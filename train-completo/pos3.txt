 I kinda wish he was like the Vertigo Lucifer, but how would they have pulled off Mazikeen. ╮(╯▽╰)╭   Just the mini series. I've been wanting to check out the Books of Faerie myself.   Looks like that one guy from the Mighty Boosh.   Is Diamond the only vendor source?   Look for small clues, like someone constantly sniffling or rubbing their nose, people taking short breaths. . .   Can anyone hook me up? Either as a third party or with a contact for a LCS that can help me out? My LCS's havent heard about this and there are a couple TPs i wouldnt mind getting.   I wish they had extended the sale by just one day T.T . . .I would get paid the day after Batman Day.   I'm tempted by the buy 2 get 1free online with the discounts....just wondering if instocktrades is still cheaper. . .gonna have to mess around with some numbers   Wait. . .so you harass her until she fucks at work?    It is about what was left on the loan yes. In the middle of paperwork currently to determine how they will setup a payback plan.   In response to your Edit 2.0:  I mean they do make test kits to find out what powder is what. . .   With $27k , I can pay off the attorney general and still have 8k to put towards my other loan that is close to default.   Is that a question or a declaration?   They bring crime, litter, SWINE FLU  So just like your average american?   It is all the red meat he eats.   I work the morning T.T   Harley Quinn's series just finished its first arc, so the next issue will be a good jumping on point.   Yea it is kind of an ego killer when you realize that you passed the halfway mark of your late father's life. Shit sucks when you realize you are no where near where he was at this point in life.   Whoops seems I was just thinking of the Baby Formula vs Breast feeding controversy of Nestle Mexico. . .   I believe it was Mexico.   Well it has a slight reference in Justice Leeague 3000, but so far is stand alone.   Heads up, get ready for some pretty big feels with this title. I actually cried a little in volume 3, and got kinda sad in some of the others. Still need to read the last  5 trades and the select single arcs trades.  The Deluxe Death Trade that collects all her stories in one is a decent related title at a good price. And After volume 4, it would be a good time to start the Lucifer trades if you are interested in how his story continues.   A couple of my favorite from the New 52 are Sword of Scorcery vol1. , Hawkman and Justice League Dark.   If you end up liking the darker side, there is the Sandman Series from Vertigo (which is like a Mature part of DC)  Last piece of advice, instocktrades.com has trades at an awesome discount price for most comics.   Yea started the East of West and recently Saga thanks to the Image humble bundle a month or two ago. I need to go back through EoW again to remind my self whats going on also.   I started late with my **Justice League 3000** pulls so I just got the first two last week (a local LCS wanted $20 a piece so did Midtown for reg. Price) and read all 8 just the other day. It is an interesting story and how it ties in to Future's End is interesting when they mentioned they have 97% of all metahuman DNA from the island 1000 years ago. Happy to be current on it.  Ordered Outcast #1 from Image with those two, since it sold out everywhere I looked. Decent take on Exorcisms and looking forward to the explanation of his blood burning the possesed.  Read through the other day the Batman Manga Death Mask. It was an interesting story with a little background of Bruce in Japan.  Currently working on the first Hellblazer arc in Original Sins TP and enjoying it so far.   This should be next banner.   Honestly the movie with Keanu Reeves was my first encounter with anything Constantine. I know almost quite literally everyone denounces the movie as being a Constantine film, but I love it none the less. My first comic ecounter was the New 52 JLD and Constantine trades, I tried catching up with the single issues, but never really put much onto it so I just wait for trades.  Just started Hellblazer vol. 1, and am still in middle of first arc, I find it intetersting, but am going through it slow since I'm reading a couple different books at the same time.  My vote for next title is Lucifer vol. 1.   Fag is common brit slang for cigarrette. The first time I ever heard it, yea same reaction, but that was long before I read Hellblazer.   All the Xx_'s are due to the name they want being taken, so that is accurate.   FYI, Goobers is a chocolate covered peanut candy.   I'm hoping he appears in Future's End at some point.   It's a horror comic, also by Image, it sold like crazy everywhere near me.   For my it was between that or Outcast for my pulls. I chose Outcast and am going to wait for a trade on Wicked/Divine   My Nightwing vol. 4 is still in the mail :x   Watched first season of Arrow this past week on Netflix. Unfortunately season 2 isnt on it yet and my local libraries dont have it yet. Anyone know when it is supposed to come to netflix?  I've been meaning to pick up the New 52 trade of Static Shock. Does he show up anywhere outside his series?  That Marvel 100th Anniversary issue of Spiderman was fun. Kingpin in a tech-venom suit, like woah.   Considering they've had leaks, I don't see why they wouldn't.   You dont think NSA intercepts their own messages?    It is just that there is not only THC in weed.    Django Unchained TP- Gotta have some Django  100th Anniversary #1: Xmen - Really enjoying these anniversary issues.  Deadpool: Dracula's Gauntlet #2 -first one was decent, but not sure how I like having 3 weeklies on my pulls  Elektra #4 - Really good series so far.  Savage Hulk #2 - was disappointed regular hulk was cancelled and the #1 Savage was ok, so I'm giving this one more try  Ultimate FF #4 -  Batman Eternal #15 - too far into it to give up now.  Harley Quinn invade Comic Con Intl. San Diego #1 - I'm a sucker for one shots.  Teen Titan #1 - Gonna see how the new one is.  The New 52: Future's End #11 - Loving the story so far.

I'm guessing until at least this Wednesday, it has been up for at least a week already so not sure how much longer it will be.   Right? Well if I am to afford at least the weekly's in my pull list this week Imma have to cook my lunch/dinner at home for work.   I'm guessing one is the older version and not the reprint. . .   It is just that doesn't Constantine and Zantanna have a sorta of history together? I think she would be better to have a show on NBC if their shows end up doing well.   I would like to see Doctor Occult or Tim Hunter.      I heard you can ask for honey butter on a chicken strip sandwhich. Never tried tho.   Being mutilated as a baby  Fucking disgusting.   What kind of shit phone you have? I read it just fine.   Sleeping until I have to go to work at night.   Purfume: Story of a Murderer or Spirited Away.   Excellent story   It is the southern equivalent of Disney workers saying "Have a magical day" or something that.   You can't prove that.   All of y'all being taller and longer than I only justifies my confidence issues, at least in my mind :(   Check out the Sandman Series by Vertigo if you are wanting a Darker feel from your comics...shoot I started reading them when I was 22 last year.   Incase you didn't know a good place to find a lot of trade collections is instocktrades.Com    I was thinking it was this, just wasn't 100%   So jealous. What collections are these exactly?   Dark House is leaving soon and was Decent enough.   Credits are part of the run time.    Well it is exactly 3 hours with the 15 minute previews.   There is this one thing. . .what is it called. . .Reddit Platinum?   Shoot I work in a cinema and dont really understand what the difference is, but if someone had brought that to my attention, I would have gone to the booth and verified that the current playlist matches the projector's settings. I mean the correct format is right there in the name of the movie file.    Maybe he was a fan of the Sandman comics series. There is the short story in one issue where the Dream of cats tells this cat it is talking to that basically if enough people (or cats) dream the same reality at the same time the true reality can be changed. It was a rather sad story actually.   I was high the first time I watched Paprika, so naturally I didn't fully remember the ending. Be me, a rather overweight guy, showing it to current crush and everything getting super awkward when the fat guy gets the hot girl at the end. . .the moment was so cringe-worthy.   It was a little hard to follow, I'm giving a couple more issues to really decide.   Batman Eternal, Future's End, Sinestro, JLD, and maybe Harley Quinn #0 Director's Cut.  Others: Trees, C.O.W.L., Doop, Amazing Spider-Man, Savage Hulk, All New Ultimates, Ghost Rider, Deadpool vs Carnage, (Damn seems all my marvel pulls are this week imma be broke T.T) and need to get MPH from last week.   Glad I'm not the only one captivated by Trees.   East of West easily.   If they extended their service area to the suburbs on the edge of Dallas, I would actually use the service.   Hellraiser. I guess I just waited too long to see it.   I thought it was funny before I did pot.   Why would you say before taking it off if she never takes it off in the .gif?!   Maybe I have a hard on for inconcievable bugs? It doesn't matter.   Unless you are on xbox. . .just saying.   Well. . .arent there tofu steaks?   So we need to break down the military budget into what % of it is actually used for military research and not just straight arms productions or troop employment/deployment then?   If it is a Driver's License it does apply, but if it is just a straight up ID, I'm not sure.   I watched Unbreakable, with Bruce Willis and Sam L Jackson, for the first time the other day. Was a very interesting look at the question: What if there are superheroes, but they dont know it yet? I highly recommend it.   Current Runs from last week: Batman Eternal, Future's End, Harley Quinn, Ultimate FF, Elektra,  Currently slowly working through the First Lucifer Trade from Vertigo.   I'm preparing myself for the Hobbit Trilogy marathon that is sure to happen in december.    I talked to a police officer the other day at my work and apparently there is a sort of underground prostitution ring on myspace in various cities.   If the response was worthwhile others would let you know by the way they respond.   It has been off and on.   If it hurt us after the leak wouldnt it have hurt us before the leak?   Shoot it wasnt too long ago that tardigrades were all over reddit. I learned what a water bear was due to it being a meme.   Ive been wanting to get into the Books of Faeirie honestly. But I am up to book 6 of Sandman, but been having trouble finding it locally.   I wouldnt mind a DC one, dunno if you have any Vertigo but that would be dope.   I didnt see that being who was placing the hits on Harley. Decent enough surprise.   And thats why i live in the burbs   I didnt know it implied sexual orientation that phrase as Big Boi said in his song Back Up Plan:  I was young, full of cum, down for the skeet skeet, not dumb . . .   I feel like the mirror isnt exactly haunted, but begs the question that it attracts mentally unstable people.   I disagree, but I tend to be liberal with my judgement of short films. The last one and "O" are the weirdest. "F" tho is indeed wtf worthy.   Its just no matter what theme I set those couple things stay green.  Edit: looks like it is only the black theme with the green everything.   Shit...I wouldnt have updated if I knew it would be like this. . .it feels so wrong.   Everything is green. Like the letters on the keyboard when I type, the loading bar in the internet browser, and who knows what else. I tried changing the theme to all black option, but that only fixed the HTC news reading list.  Is there some way to change it?   I give up. I cant find a mutant with the name: O______ R___ . . .   So do you get a family discount on the nights she works?      I'll only have enough PTO by then for one weekend (〒︿〒)   Part of the Outkast experience is also the dungeon family being apart of it, IMO.C-Bone was there so I got a little more than one third if anything.   You would think, but I'm so conflicted. I've already met and seen Big Boi in concert, so that's one half the Outkast experience. And then there is rumors this is Li's last album round. Considering I'm from Texas it's an additional 3 hours to ATL than Kansas City.   I'm looking for an album that is solid all the way through that would compliment the discography of those three.  	103
 I live close to Libbie Mill which just really started developing at the end of 2014. I wonder if that's why.   I don't understand why people need to be stay at home parents if their children go to daycare or school. I think that's just called lazy. I love my free time, but I would go absolutely batty if I didn't have a job or volunteer work or some thing to fill my day. I get depressed even if I work from home too many days in a row.   I've never realized how happy peace and quiet REALLY made me until I dated my ex and had a 2-6 year old around every weekend. For that, I am eternally grateful for that relationship. If I ever feel lonely, which I don't that often anyway - I just think back to that time period. :)   Yeah, no kidding. If they are that awful to be around for an extended period, why have them? I get being snowed in with ANYBODY for days on end, you start to get annoyed pretty easily - but just a few hours into it?   My ex had a kid, and visitation every single weekend. When his ex-wife had to have an extra day with the kid due to illness or snow or something, you'd think the world was ending. Keep in mind she only saw that kid maybe 30 minutes in the morning before work, and 1-2 hours after work and before bedtime, during the week. I have no idea what this woman would have done if she had stayed married and had to deal with her kid every single day.   Other than that it's awesome? Where do you live now? That will help a little. If you're from the sticks, there are things you might appreciate (or not appreciate) that wouldn't be a big deal if you were from NYC.   If I ever lose my mind and decide I want to have children, I'm just going to take a look at the Facebook posts I've seen from parents who are snowed in with their kids. I live in VA and the schools were shut down pretty much all last week and now they're shut down again today, and I'm sure tomorrow.   All the parents I know on FB are going crazy. Hourly posts about their kids driving them nuts. Not to mention my coworkers. You can tell which men at my workplace have children, because they will go into the office in the middle of a damn hurricane before they will be stuck at home with their kids.   Meanwhile, I'm chilling with my dog on the couch, sipping coffee, looking at the snow and enjoying the peace and quiet. Ahhhh.     Willow Lawn - at least 5-6 here.    Bought my first house last year. I live in Henrico County in the general area of Willow Lawn. I got my 2015 tax assessment in the mail this week. It shows that in 2014 it went down 3%, and in 2015 it's going up 19%. Is this normal?? It seems like a lot.   Could it have something to do with the sale price of my house? The previous owners purchased it in 2010 for only $5000 less than I paid in mid-2014, so I would think if the taxes were related to an increase in market value, it would have gone up before this year.   We had a few in the area I grew up in, in Southern Illinois. It was kind of a joke that if you wanted stale bread and borderline expired lunch meat, that's where you went. I don't know how accurate that still is, though. This was in the mid-to-late 1990s.   I think it might be one of those places where it just depends on what you buy. I found this article online:  http://www.thefrugalgirl.com/2010/03/what-to-buy-and-not-buy-at-aldi/     This is why I don't watch the local news. Go to the state police sex offender registry site and look up your house - those bastards are freaking EVERYWHERE. Either they live near you, or they work near you. Not news, except maybe to soccer moms who don't understand reality.   I dated a guy for a few years who had his kid EVERY weekend.  It sucked ass. For all the reasons already listed   Haha, true. I'm sure some people talk about it that way. #thuglife   It's probably a point of pride because the city was able to turn things around. I used to work in law enforcement and I see that as impressive, and something to be proud of as far as city leadership goes. I doubt they were bragging about it at the time.   I'm selling my much-loved Fuji X100 digital camera (retro rangefinder style). I truly love this camera and the images it produces, but ultimately I didn't use it that much after I bought a different camera.  It is in great condition with minimal cosmetic marks resulting from normal use. Nothing that affects photo quality or that you can even see without looking super closely.   Included are the original box, charger, extra battery, lens cap, strap, CD with software, USB cable, and manual.   This would be a great camera for someone looking to improve their photography. It's simple, it's classic, and the fixed focal length forces you to learn about composition. The shutter is silent and the camera is so low profile that people barely notice it - great for street photography. Great in low light.  More info/photos here:  http://richmond.craigslist.org/pho/4901502757.html   Is that supposed to actually mean "do not use gluten free" or that they ARE gluten free?   They use beagles for testing BECAUSE they are so docile. They just snip their vocal cords so they can't whine and howl.   It's gross. They use them for medical testing a lot, I have no idea how dog anatomy and physiology really translates to humans, but whatever.   I follow the Beagle Freedom Project on FB. It's horrible what labs do to these dogs. There are videos out there showing them being outside and touching grass for the first time in their entire lives. Heartbreaking.   Is he trying to be funny? Because it's hilarious. At least he's enthusiastic.       Sent you a PM.   Nope, actually sent this to a friend of mine who works in Photoshop for a living... he said it looks altered.    So your childfree girlfriend has to deal with your kids, but you don't want to deal with any more kids? Sounds like you're getting the much better deal there!      One of my favorite sayings is "We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us."  Agree with the other poster who says it sounds like you are clinging hard to the identity of being CF.   As a woman I've had doubts creep into my mind too. I get emotional or just have a weird day where I think maybe I would be okay if I had a kid. Maybe I would enjoy it. They always go away and I don't obsess about it.   If I did wake up tomorrow and I wanted to have a kid - like for real, weighed all the options and it made sense and was doable financially - I would do it. We are allowed to change our minds.   I understand not wanting to do something you will regret. But your OP sounded more like you just didn't want to give up the identity of being CF even IF you would be happy with kids. Just saying its up to you. We come up with all these beliefs about ourselves and what we want and sometimes we cling to them even if they are outdated or no longer useful to us.   Do what you FEEL is right, and turn your brain off. We over think and try and use logic and reason with certain things where logic and reason don't apply. Like love. And having kids, that's love. Logic and reason are NOT a part of it.      I don't get the sentence about not wanting to be one of those people who has kids and is happy. Huh? You only get one life. Childfree is about being childfree because you WANT to be. I don't get this whole post at all.    Exactly. Here's what I ate for dinner, here's my workout of the day, look at my kid, and my dog (guilty), here's some clickbait BS article, men suck, women suck, dating sucks, marriage sucks, I'm lonely...  Facebook is annoying.   Yep. God it must be exhausting to walk around so completely offended by anything and everything. Especially kids, seeing as how they are everywhere.  It's just how our society is now. The Internet makes it so easy to go online and find people who agree with us, and validate our rage. Everybody is offended by everything these days. And god forbid you point it out either, then they get offended by THAT :)     I have life insurance through work. I still need to look into long term disability (since I'm single and live alone and own a house) and long term care insurance (if I ever can't take care of myself).   Having worked in an office that didn't have one, and now one that does - I'll take the one that does any day. Build away, people.  The office that didn't have one - mothers had no other place to store their breast milk but the fridge we all used.   In my current office, it is actually the "phone room" in the sense that people go in there with their cell phone if they need to have a private conversation and are too lazy to walk downstairs and outside.   	29
 I hope so. Thanks for your kind words!   	1
 Now you're a doctor, too.   Schism of consciousness? Are you kidding me? You're just making this shit up as you go. Consciousness is a state of perception. The term you're looking for is cognitive dissonance, you arrogant, egotistical know-it-all. I've been working with depressed teens for as long as I've been working in federal appellate law: years. You know nothing of either field.   If "lawyer" and "economist" and "scholar" are bullshit labels, why don't you try on these? Ignorant. Cocksure. Fuckwad. You have to have character before it can be assassinated.   You must have found my history of depression in the heartfelt posts written to help sick friends and confidantes. If I have proven anything beyond any shred of doubt it's this: a jackass like you, someone who would use someone's medical history to discredit their arguments about our medical system, deserves to be taken down a peg.   worst first date ever    instad.

It's not off-ten.    Bud, I'm just inviting you to take another look at an issue. You are the one who originally suggested that support for the ACA was simply due to lack of intelligence or respect for the Constitution or some deficiency in legal or historical education. You are clearly not the Constitutional legal scholar/historian/economist you purport to be, and instead of pointing it out I should have just ignored your trolling ass.   To be fair, I'm a recovering suicidal depressive and I disagree with you guys. Suicidal does not equal homicidal, so a suicide does not mean one less mass shooting. And depression does not make one an irresponsible gun owner. But being suicidal does.   If you kill yourself, the universality of human rights dictate that it is equally tragic as any homicide. By the nature of our disease, we are prone to brief but intense bouts of hopelessness and pain, which in turn has a direct link to impulsiveness. This is good. Impulsive = easy to dissuade. Just stall for a few minutes and the crisis is over.   Killing yourself with a gun, especially if one is readily available is much easier than setting up a helium-based suicide, less risky than taking some pills and hoping you succeed, and less painful than razors or hanging. This makes this form of suicide the perfect storm to turn the morbidity of depressive hopelessness into the mortality of gun violence.  The idea that "less determined" suicidal depressives take less determined chances with suicide is not true. Suicide is not binary, and being suicidal does not predetermine you to death by suicide. Suicidal simply means prone to suicidal ideation, considering suicide. So the argument that a suicidal person will continue to seek out a potentially more painful form of death is too simplistic, lacking in the empathy required to combat depression. Do you take your life if the cost to do so is higher? For many of us, the answer is no.   Less guns available means less deaths by suicide, and I'm living proof.   Perhaps we could unite on the superordinate goal to get guns out of the hands of the criminally insane?   A government that truly reflects its populace can and should promote the common welfare in ways that uninhibited markets cannot or simply will not (i.e. laws, defense, rectifying externalities, preventing the tragedy of the commons, and investments in the community).   An adept point, but America is not trying to be South Africa. The reason we're no longer a third world country in the first place is the investments in civil liberties (e.g. child worker laws), human capital (e.g. public education), and social programs like welfare, Social Security, and Medicaid.   True, the poorest in America are not the poorest in Malaysia, China, or India. But we do have a massive healthcare problem that still costs us millions per year toward totally preventable diseases. And believe it or not, we still have a hunger issue here, which is ridiculous. Poverty is poverty, whether its in South Africa or Blackwater, Arizona, and no human being, let alone children, should be subjected to the injustices of hunger, inadequate healthcare, and the loss of the American dream.   Sure, but let's not cede the point that the Ryan has a monopoly on economic growth. The argument stems from the idea that even though both sides agree that the economy is struggling and needs government assistance to reach its potential again, one sides wants to inject money to grow demand and one side wants to inject money to grow supply.   There is a term in economics known as the money multiplier, whereby a government source injects money into an economy and a portion of that money is spent, creating demand, or saved, which does not create demand. The real benefit is that the portion that is spent gets spent or saved again indefinitely, with each iteration getting smaller and smaller as each step loses a bit of money to saving.  So if we want to boost demand in the economy (and both sides do), we have to ask where do we inject the money? Historically, Democrats have put that money into what are known as automatic growth stabilizers. That means welfare, disability, medicaid, tax breaks for the poor, the kind of stuff that immediately puts money into the economy during a recession without government action. Republicans, Ryan included, argue that a better way to make an impact on the economy is to give tax breaks to the leaders of industry, incentivizing them to expand their businesses and create new jobs.  So on its face, the question is misleading. Is economic growth the best anti-poverty program? Who cares? Both sides purport to create economic growth in basically the same way: by injecting cash. Both sides agree that we need to help the poor. The real question is: can a supply-side (i.e. tax breaks for the job creators) create such greater economic recovery than the demand side (i.e. handing poor people money to buy bread) that it obviates the need to spend the money on the poor in the first place?  Since you asked, I will provide my own argument.  No. When you give tax-breaks or subsidies to the poor, they spend them. Immediately. When you get cash to buy bread for your kid, you buy it, right now. And you spend all of it, thereby maximizing the money multiplier.  But when you hand the exact cumulative sum of cash to any wealthier group, you run the risk of greater savings and therefore lesser impact on the economy. Further, the rich have savings (off-shore accounts) that circumvent an added benefit that the poorer cannot: revenue recouped from taxes. If you spend the money on bread, the sales tax goes back to the government. If you spend the money on intellectual properties in the Middle East, the government will never see a dime. Also, the demand side spending can be used to promote positive externalities, parts of the economy that benefit society in ways that aren't reflected in the price. For example, we could use that same money to start a shovel-ready project for starving artists. The tangible gains in terms of the art produced could be considered recouped losses, in the same way that the taxes could.  But at the most basic level, I think the greatest disconnect is that of income inequality. The metaphor "a rising tide lift all boats" does not apply because the economy does not lift the boats equally or some at all. The measure of a society is not how it treats the most powerful, but how it treats its poorest, least opportune. The social mobility we know as the American dream is not free; it requires investment to create opportunity. Both sides know this. When we give money to Starbucks to expand, citizens get to work at Starbucks. True, they're not in poverty. But what if we put that same money toward producing the human capital in the first place, for example using that money to subsidize student loans? It stimulates the economy equally (perhaps greater by way of the money multiplier) and we no longer have a barista, but a scientist, doctor, teacher, lawyer, President.    I'm with you a hundred percent. And I'd like to add that post-conviction law is a clusterfuck, an absolute quagmire. For example, "innocence" is not covered under the writ of habeas corpus. And even though you have the right to an attorney (re: the FPD), many of the motions you would have to make to the state post trial are lawyer-less, which means that a totally innocent albeit completely crazy guy with a crap lawyer has no chance of successfully filing an appellate brief within the statute of limitations without even the help of the crap lawyer.  But I will argue on one minor point, that evidence tampering or corruption falls on the defending lawyer. All lawyers swear an oath to protect justice above all else, and this includes the prosecutors. That's why a lawyer is ethically bound not to tell lies even when its in his/her client's best interest.  If there is suspicion of corruption, it is the duty of EVERYONE, be it defense or prosecution or judge, to uphold the ethical obligations of the court, meaning that neither prosecution nor defense may legally make an argument under the ethics provisions regarding the "fair game" of foul play simply because the system is designed to be antagonistic.   I'm pointing out what a condescending douche you are. You claim to have special knowledge about the law or economics, but you're just a bullshitter. By definition, that is not how fiat money works. You're just a homophobic, xenophobic low-information voter. And that you could reread the most fucked up posts of your internet past and not see anything wrong tells me that you have no interest in actually putting in the hard work to learn these subjects in the first place, even when somebody conveniently points out your mistakes to you.    I have. Are you suggesting that your interpretation of the Constitution is more valid than the Supreme Court? Robert's reasoning is a non-issue.   This is just a practiced stupidity. Regardless of partisan belief, one cannot claim that the law is unconstitutional. It'd be like arguing that some squares are circles. By simple a priori logic, a law upheld by the SCOTUS must be constitutional unless the ruling is reversed or the Constitution amended.    Coulda said acute e pi   sees  	15
 was it dead skin? If so then man up and take a chunk of the living flesh! Mwahahahaha   take out a few 'spare ribs' first then you can reach. Apparently Prince did this.    err no.    What?? I'm curious! lol. Anyone else curious? Check this image out! http://theendofbeing.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sex_woman_dolphin_205.jpg   THAT is actually true.    That HAS to be true!    http://spiders.ucr.edu/daddylonglegs.html   lol that made me smile.    it does help you get sick less.    umm duuh cholestrol???   An aquaintence of mine says that all the time. Oh and she's alergic to alcohol, lizards, cats and ALL types of contraception. Oh and she's always bloody ill.    I'm googling it!   oooh moody!   Well now you know why you get cat stuff.   PANIC! Everytime that anniversary came up-you never said anything about knowing the month .. so I can assume I know that too.    Okay If my daughter, came to and said that she wanted to be male, then I've go loony! Not because of anger. But fear. They'll be worried {especially Mum} that you won't be accepted by society. There maybe alot of shouting by your dominant parent. But be strong. They care, that is all.   They will doubt themselves as parents and think 'letting you play with _____ toy when you were younger is the cause.   If you have friends that are aware, make sure they know when you're telling your parents. Make sure someone is at hand for pub or hug. Whichever you prefer.   Know that every big explosion calms and ends eventually. But you may be about to cut your link to them permantly. Be strong. You don't live for your parents. You live for you. You're about to feel very guilty or angry or maybe both depending on how it goes.   Either way I commend your honesty to them and your courage to do this.  Good Luck.   Do you like cats?   The family you make is more important than the family you come from. Something I live by.   My parents were twats . . to the point I got on a train aged 16 and never looked back. I have a beautiful little girl. She does well in school, is generally polite and we do many activities together, usually chosen by her. My parents did none of the things I do for my little girl. Other than let me live in their council house. Over the years I tried to forgive n forget . .. they 'forgave' me for running away. But they still don't give a crap. My daughter is 5. They have seen her 4 times and that was when I went to visit them {mainly to see my kid brother} I don't even drive. They have 2 cars. They have never visited me.    Yeah-I've been there tried that .. it never works.   lol . . I have taste and I'm picky. I'm an ex poll dancer, {I stopped 6 months ago} so am obviously used to turning men down  . . .zillions of times in an evening.    ha show me a pic first!    Do a google search -volunteering in __________ town.      how about one of each-I'm a bi girl :)   That would be true. But don't get big headed.    she's not still cute to you anymore?   I'm female lol   She's used a face mask that you peel off once it dries. Nice effect. I scared my boyfriend in the same way once. I died laughing. I'm currently a ghost using his computer.    Only if you're a chubby chaser and like em old.    LOL I do that all the time-sorry.   My mother says that all the time. Grrrr!   How can she walk in those things???   Yup. I'm female and I think a life without sex is .. torture.   I thought unicorns ate rainbows?   You horrible meanie. Poor little squirrel. :.(   It's Arse.   that sounds like experience!   Ewww   By the devil. Mwahahaha!   I'm sure every man will tell you that blow jobs are awesome but sex is waaay more intimate. If I guy only went down on me-but refused to have intercourse it would be cool for a few weeks then I'd be like . . .nooo I need actual sex. Being intimate is soo important. Think about your natual instints. We like it because we're meant to. Sex = babies. That's what mother nature intended. {unless you play safe}    Ouch . .you got hands right? Do what everyone else does and use em.   and how long does an open relationship last? Never very long. One person always gets jealous/hurt. Also with an open relationship, he'll probably find someone that becomes a regular .. fuckbuddy then they'll grow feelings for one another . .the rest is history.   play safe. I like it.   it means she doesn't want sex. Ever   AND if she's got something, you should get tested too. Just in case.    lol cool beans. Buzz me when ya free.   Major nerd   I'm female actually and that happened to an aquaintence of mine. It completely confused her- if she wasn't having to deal with enough. She's okay though. She did keep the baby even after everyone telling her not to. She's now a single mum and happy. Her little girl is lovely and brought up well. Atleast she made good of a bad situation. Most women I doubt could handle this. That girl is exceptionally strong willed.    Well I met him just after I was assulted. I stayed with him for almost 2 years. He done a whole heap of other things to completely screw my very innocent mind{at that time} up. I'm 23 now and thank him for the err . . .life experience but I still despise him. What he did at court that day- wasn't half as bad as the other stuff he did. I now have a great guy that fully supports me and isn't controling. Just like any other soppy story -he caught me completely offguard. He's awesome. :)   I have was sexually assulted when I was 17. I had so much fear afterwards. Stay with her as much as you can to make her feel safer. She needs to feel completely protected. Give her lots of hugs. But don't slate the attacker. She already knows he's a prick and doesn't need to hear it.   Keep her well away from booze or anything else. She also may have repetative nightmares about it and if that happens just tell her she's safe and with you.   My partner at the time tried to perswade me not to go to court about it. The guy DID get off on not enough poxy evidence. Even though girls have made claims against him before.   When I walked outta that court room. My 'now ex' partner said 'told ya so' he told me I put myself through that court hearing for nothing. Whatever you do, don't do that. Makesure she goes through the courts and even if he doesn't get found guilty support her in every way you can. Tell her how proud you are of her for standing up to him.   Oh and this will always haunt her but she will learn to deal with it in her own time. Please be VERY patient.    Or be pregnant. That makes it waaay more worse.    Murder?   I was thinking, just take an axe!   I bet you've dropped chewing gum a few times in your life.    'I remember' . . back in the day .. how old are you? That kind of behavior hasn't happened for years!   Aha I'm sooo going to stalk you now.    You just made me giggle more than the OP did.    I um kinda did. :/   Has anyone noticed how his left arm is positioned weirdly?  	59
 I barely stop myself, but whenever something annoys me I think of the most hurtful comment that I could possibly say to them, and for that split second I feel that I am completely justified to say that. But even when someone is saying nothing I feel like they are silently judging me somehow. I know it's crazy but nothing helps me from thinking that the world is against me or something (not meant to sound as melodramatic but I can't think of a better way to explain)  	1
 Aww it looks just like my Cleo, but she is napping on the sofa downstairs. I hope his/her family are found soon.      Actually OP said TSA or other authority.    Ah, ok, then definately check out Ehlers symptoms :-)   Did you mean hyper/hypo mobility rather than tension then?   Have you ever looked into Ehlers-Danlos (Hypermobility type) syndrome? Also, quit the tobacco, quit the alcohol, quit the coffee (the migraines are probably from caffeine wthdrawl).  Forget about your relatives issues if tests have come back clean, you are looking too much into a 'reason' and not into your own personal issues.  I suffer with constant pain in most of my joints, exhaustion, muscle weakness despite working out regularly (yes, despite the pain). I suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder which causes depressive episodes. I am finally in the process of being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos. The symptoms are varied and seem unconnected until you put them all together.  PS How do you have high and low blood pressure?   Stocks of silicon.   So true.   Sounds like you haven't met many nice nurses then?   and we have found a doctor......   She is three(ish) years old and we picked her up yesterday from the shelter. She was confiscated from her previous owner.         Thanks!   We are lucky to live in the newer area of Aurora, near to Southlands Mall. We can jump on the E470 and be at Denver Zoo in 30 mins, downtown in a little more. We visit the Aurora and Cherry Creek reservoirs to walk. My eldest is at a great kindergarten and is looking forward to moving to a good school for Grade 1 next year. We live in a really nice and quiet community, kids play out on the street safely. There is a little clean and safe playpark a few minutes walk away. We are located really well for shopping! Southlands is 10 mins away at most, plus we have Sprouts and King Soopers :-)   We have only been here 6 months, but it is easily the best place we have lived in, and we came from England!    I live in Aurora with my husband and two young kids, and it is lovely :)    Hi, do you know how she is with children? We should hear tomorrow whether we are allowed a cat in our house by our landlord (they agreed to a dog but we asked for a cat!). I am home a lot during the day, both my children love animals and have been taught to respect and be kind to all animals. They both adore cats and have been asking for a pet for a long time!  In short, if you can wait a day or two for our landlords response, we may be able to provide a very loving home :-) I will get back to you as soon as I can, but if you do find another home that can take her sooner, do what you need to do for your allergies!   Why not move out the way and ignore him?    I dont know why you are being downvoted, Im with you on this point.   Yup, married him too :-)   We moved to Denver six months ago from the UK. My daughter who is five and a half now has an awesome American/Cornish accent (think English country bumpkin for the Cornish!). I don't really recognise a 'Denver' accent as such, though you sure don't say your 't's. But I do notice accents from around the US when I am out an about, and can kind of tell visitors or implants to the area. The main ones I can pick out are the Southern accents as they seem so different to what I hear day to day. I still have a strong southern English accent (think Londoner) but I am usually confused for being Australian for some reason, we sound nothing alike! :-)   Pink Spring Rolls   I shall drag my oven up the mountain for you! :-)      Thank you :-)   I was pretty suprised when he came out with the comment and I do hope he gets a talking to from the higher-ups. It is a PG shiw with kids watching. Sure, be edgy and outlandish, but rape jokes just aren't funny to everyone.   Here is how to use the clove oil - note the bit about not getting it on your tongue or gum :-)  http://suite101.com/article/how-to-use-oil-of-cloves-for-toothache-a192953   For a start, which brand are you on? There are so many different types and brands. If you took two pills on the Saturday it could just be the extra hormones in your body giving you the symptoms. Check your pill information, and do a pregnancy test in two weeks if you have not had your period by then (assuming you have a 28 day cycle). The cramping could have been ovulating pain, some women get this mid-cycle. The timing of missing the pill and unprotected sex was most likely during your more fertile period, so if you are really concerned about the likelyhood of pregnancy, you need to ask your gyno, not reddit!       Feet.  Very muscular arms.      Yeah, because that was their first priority.......   It is not on their picket schedule yet...   His uncle has confirmed he was killed on his own fb page. My condolences to you all and his family and I hope his wife pulls through.   But the people who are using it do.   Wow, so much hate on an image.  Sometimes people feel helpless despite of giving blood, donations, whatever, and want to show support and solidarity. To let those affected know that they will not be forgotten. It happens almost everytime there is an incident or major event - one went round for the CO wildfires. If you don't like this stuff then don't comment or like it on Facebook. Don't disrespect other people for having particular feelings.   As for you thinking it is some sort of awesome marketing ploy - yeah, that's exactly how the filmmakers want the film remembered. With sadness and mourning.  People are connecting to the tragedy because a lot of people are being affected by it. I spent the morning trying to support a friend who's daughter was missing (found safe and well at 9am).     For families that had to be evacuated from the five apartment buildings in and around the suspect's apartment today, City officials are opening Aurora Central HS immediately as an evacuation center. City of Aurora has coordinated with the Red Cross to provide food, bedding, counseling, cable/movie access for families. Aurora Public School buses are available to shuttle folks back and forth from the evacuation area to/from the Aurora Central HS.   Thank you, I was very British and made myself a cup of tea.  I have managed to get hold of my husband and prepped him of my frame of mind for when he gets home. I could not make it out the house. I did manage to let the kids play in the back yard with their sprinklers so they had fresh air and good fun.  I have contacted a group of women I know well to let them know how I am feeling, we are good at supporting each other through hard times.  I think it has hit me very hard as I have been experiencing very bad homesickness recently and had my friends and family reminding me why this was a great opportunity and a great place to be. Now it seems spoilt and the dream life feels broken. Even as I am typing this I know deep down it is not an accurate representation, but the anxiety and issues just force the worst thoughts out.  The scariest part for me was that a local friends child was missing until 9amMT (she was found safe and well) but her mum was franticaly searching for her and trying to get any information on victims and the injured. We also have friends who work and serve at Buckley, and knowing that they may have friends missing, injured or dead was awful.  Everyone I know is just in shock and unable to understand why this happened again in Colorado.   P.s. Your chin up did raise a smile from me though :-)   Hmmm, that would not make me feel any safer. No offence, but as a Brit, I really do not get the US mentality that more guns = more safety. If someone is going to shoot into a darkened room packed with people, nobody is going to be there with the skills to shoot back accurately and without injuring anyone else.    I'm glad he is alive to face the consequences of his actions and to, perhaps, give the victims and their families some insight in time into why he did this. However, I am also pretty sure there will be back and forth as to his mental state and ability to stand trial and serve life for his crimes. This will take time, a lot of time.   I think some have gone to friends and family, the rest are just outside the exclusion zone on the streets waiting for news. I would guess that the news channels will broadcast shelter information later this evening.   They have had to leave with pretty much nothing, some are still there in their pyjamas. Taking food or drink to the residents could be nice?   Bonfils are filled for the next week, but are asking for donations in the weeks after.    Its's nothing I haven't got in my comment history talking to other people with anxiety or depression issues, but thank you for your concern :-)    I have diagnosed Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I have had it since I was a child (it is believed to be an effect of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type III, which I am currently being tested for). I have issues with death and often will have nightmares about being chased by death and having to protect loved ones from dying. I underwent CBT (cognitive behaviour training) when I was in the UK and up to this point I have been in a much better place, I am trying to find my CBT notes at the moment to go back over my strategies and though processes. My feelings are basically heightened anxiety/elevated adrenaline levels, tearfullness, fear and return of mild agoraphobia. It is hard as I have two small children who I want to take out, but I'm scared to go out 'just in case'. I'mgoing to see if I can go to my friends house not far from here, the kids can play and she knows a bit about my issues. Thank you for your words x   I feel so upset and sad for those affected and for those who have lost friends and relatives  We moved to Aurora 5 months ago and are here for another 4 years. We came from a small town in the UK where the most exciting things that happened were when the cows escaped from a local farm. I never expected such a horrible thing to happen here, never expected to have friends searching for their children, having my husbands co-workers missing or hurt (we don't know about any deaths yet). I have anxiety issues already, but now I don't feel safe going out to public places, if someone can kill people in a cinema, where is safe? How do I make myself feel safe again? .   There are many dogs available for adoption in the area - try the Dumb Friends League :-)    Go today, I'm sure they would take you x   I wouldn't like to imagine the carnage if people carrying legally tried to fight back in a dark, crowded theatre.   Noooo! English scones are round :-)    Drowning at a lifeguard course? :-)   Ouch!    Appologies in advance if I have used 'ironic' in the wrong context!   Fair enough :-)   Not being a douche, but only 19 of the US states require safety inspections (scroll up on the link). The info you have given is for states that do not check VIN, emissions **and** safety.   ohhhhhhh.... now I get it.   Search the treatment in Google? That will turn up the common or manufactures website which will include what the treatment is used for.   Well done for going down to the station. Its a shame they cant help you more but I guess they need to catch him doing it. Please, please call the police on him when you know he is out there drunk and driving.   Erm, same story.   Seriously, the roads are like rivers here in Aurora at the moment. Stay safe x   Report him. Or do you want to be partly responsible for something like this:   http://m.thedenverchannel.com/w/news-local/story/66662597/   Ok,  1. I was 19 when I first had sex, it was ok, I ended up married to the guy so it couldn't have been too bad!  2. I didn't have my first vaginal orgasm (and by this I assume you are not referring to clitoral orgasms) for a long time, I guess it was within the last two years and I am 32 now. Mainly because I never really looked into how to get it to happen, and I was satisfied with clitoral orgasms anyway!  3. A vaginal orgasm for me needs some preparation, and I need to actually work to have one.  4. For me, it is about preparation and positioning. I need to be really turned on and close to orgasm, then I can focus on stimulating my g-spot. On top is a great position as I can control depth and angle. Also, I need the stimulation close to the vaginal entrance so deep thrusting just doesn't do it for me! I'm not sure it was anything other than wanting to try it out and reading up on technique that did it for me. Occasionally it is easier to achieve if I am more relaxed, or really turned on!  Hope that helped answer some of your questions?   Why do you think they died out? :-)   Sadly the dinosaurs are not edible, but the kids can take them home after the party!      I d0 :-)   Because this is the site being promoted by all the local agencies and news sites in an effort to coordinate funds. Of course it is rough, do you think they have the time whilst fighting fires to make it pretty? And it directs people to the Red Cross and Salvation Army as well as other groups needing funds such as vets and sanctuaries for the animals affected.   Yes, Im in Aurora, with friends in CoSprings, we have offered space in our house to evacuees.   Actually, I did, there are two postings of my link to the resources on this thread. If you can't be bothered to scroll, here it is again... http://www.helpcoloradonow.org/   Actually, we were sent here by my husbands work. Oh, and the last controlled burn didn't turn out so good.   That needs a Patrick Starfish meme :-)   http://www.helpcoloradonow.org/  My original comment got buried :-)   Sorry, no idea, maybe because it is not always in use and is changed according to the information that they need to get out? I am not overly familiar with WOT though I know what it does, does it rely on uptime and issues with security, or just user responses?   Crazily enough, there is a firework sales tent pitched not 5 mind from my house. Idiots will be oblivious to everything saying they are banned :-(  	74
 I wear a 44L because I have long NBA player arms.  I went into HM and saw a blazer I loved but they only had it in 44R.    What are my options?  The girl I was with took a look at the sleeves and said there wasn't enough material to get more than an inch and a half with a tailor.  That wouldn't be enough length.  Any alternatives to HM?  I really liked the low cost but slim fit.  Thanks.   Thanks.  One more question... with an exercise like squats is there an alternative to high reps?  I can do plenty of bw squats but I can barely do one legged squats.  Is there an in-between progression?   I dunno.  I'm new here but I've seen a lot of programs focused around a lot of situps, pushups, and pullups.  (i.e.  hundredpushups.com )   The main reason I can never stick with body weight exercises is because after about 20 reps I lose interest and can't get the motivation to finish.  How do you guys push thru and do 100+ situps, 50 burpees, etc ?  Especially when breaking them into smaller sets isn't an option because you need more reps to challenge yourself but can't quite progress to an advanced version of the same exercise.  Also, how does hypertrophy apply to this as well?  EDIT:  I will check out the FAQ's for better progressions.  Thanks for the replies though!    You are correct.  I have a mirrorless Sony NEX and if you don't mind shooting manual,there's no limit to lenses you can use.   I read it but I'm confused... It didn't really seem like any useful advice.   Is this in store as well? Also, when does it end.   Yes.  I do.  We're all human beings and make mistakes.  I regret making someone I truly loved feel horrible and worthless.  I was young and didn't understand it then, but I understand it now.   What you're going through right now is very tough and I don't think anything I can say will help. But take it from someone nearly 10 years older than you... YOU HAVE SO MUCH LIFE LEFT TO LIVE!!!  You're very young.  I know how you feel however.  And I know that it will be hard to realize that now and in this moment.  Focus on a goal.  Focus on something you really want (besides her) and put all your energy towards that.    Dude, she did you a favor.  If you don't respect yourself nobody else will.  At least you didn't have to deal with that during marriage.  Don't get me wrong, its TOUGH.  But sometimes you have to put these things in perspective and realize that over time you'll look back and be glad it ended.   This is just what I needed to read.  Also, for those of you who have been dumped, it's also not easy when you're the person who breaks it off.  I beat myself up constantly knowing that I hurt someone when I thought I was doing the right thing by not wasting their time and taking them through my ups and downs.   *In Nelson voice*   HA HAAA!   Make sure you're doing this for the right reasons and not because you feel "dreadful."  Also, be prepared for an outcome that may not be what you desired.  I'm interested to see how it goes because I've been on both sides of this situation.   Don't do it!  I had a similar situation and almost wound up with a restraining order.  That surprise stuff seems cool in the movies but in real life it might not work out like that.  Just call her and see how it goes.   I sat here thinking of what to say in response to this and all I could come up with was, "Wow."   brb. looking up "ignominy"   Talk to older people.  Any older friends or family you have will give you perspective on why you probably have not met the person you're going to be with for life yet.  You're only 20 with your whole life ahead of you.  The feelings you're having are natural. Give it time.  But I'll let you know now, you guys still being friends and still talking will only delay your healing.   I don't know if you'll see this but I am one of the most uncaring non-empathetic people you'd ever see usually. But your post spoke out to me. Please don't kill yourself. If you must get away, run away, but don't kill yourself. Trust me it gets better.    Obviously you already have your mind made up so just follow your heart.  Best case:  It works out. Worst case:  It doesn't and you'll have learned a valuable life lesson in the most effective manner possible... by experiencing it firsthand.   It's going to take time.  There's nothing you can do.  What is it that keeps reminding you of her?  If you can you need to do everything to remove those reminders.  I had a girl break up with me but we had mutual friends on twitter.  Someone would RT her and it would ruin my day.  I created a filter in Tweetdeck to remove any tweets with her name in it.  It sounds simple but little stuff like this helped me heal and not think about her all the time.  If there's nothing triggering the memory but your scumbag brain then the only thing I can recommend is keeping yourself occupied so you don't have time to think about what could've been.   They're only hurting themselves with the mandatory group tip IMO.  I tip higher than the 18% normally.  But I'm so put off when I see i'm forced to tip that I just leave it at the 18% and don't tip extra.   Eh... If they (or their insurance) wants to pay for it then it's their prerogative.  I actually stay away from ER because the bill is usually ridiculous.    It's your call.  Just know if you do it you well feel horrible for awhile.  But in the long term it will be the best thing to do.   This is so relevant to me right now.  I wish I could upvote you more.  I'm going to save this.   Wow.  I know you in real life.  Small world.  I'll give this recipe a try.   I think it's very normal for us guys.  We get conflicted because we know we can't give the girl the relationship she deserves but don't want to hurt her feelings.  Then we end it because it feels like the right thing to do.  But afterwards we feel like shit because the girl is still sad anyway and now we're lonely.  I'm going through this process as well.  If I would have known about this subreddit I would've posted it here.  http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/    I just want to say that I don't think it's that uncommon at all for girl's to want sex more than guys once they get in a comfortable relationship.  I've been in that position before and it's awkward to tell a girl "No."  The rest of your post is typical relationship stuff.  You did the right thing.  You'll be alright.   It's probably the right thing to do.  Why did you break his heart and then ask for him back?    What difference does it make if it's quick?  If the other person has doubts or has made up their mind it's best to end it.    As the dumpee you're still holding onto feelings that why you wanted it to last longer.  The other person would be doing both of you a disservice by prolonging something they didn't want to be in.  I mean, when is the *right* time in your eyes?   Quickly.  Either way he's going to be hurt.  You might as well let him start the healing process sooner than later.   This may be hard but you're going to have to separate from your feelings for a minute and think logically.  This girl...  1. Has been chumming it up with an old friend. 2. Has been avoiding you 3. Decides to break up with you on fucking Valentines Day!?!?  Sounds like she did you a favor bro.    At best she's highly confused about her feelings and its best that she let you go while she sorts it out.  At worst she's a selfish cruel bitch.   Dude you are so young that none of this will even matter in the grand scheme that is your life.  Be glad you're going through it now because the experience will help in the future.  I went through my first major breakup at 28 and it was TOUGH.  Imagine being with someone for years and not being equipped to deal with the pain while all your friends are getting married.  You're 18.  You're still learning what you'll be in life.  Have fun and try to move on.  You'll meet so many women over the next few years it will blow your mind.   I like what this subreddit represents and all, but I feel like not giving a fuck is either in you or it isn't.  The guy that got dumped by his ex on Valentine's Day isn't going to all of a sudden stop being depressed because of a few words on here.  It takes multiple failures and an internal resolution to get to that point.  And the time it takes for that to happen is different for everyone.  Most people have to get to a point where they decide *"enough is enough!"* and change their life.  I'll leave you with a quote from Anthony De Mello.  It's in the context of relationships but I think it applies here:   "It didn’t make sense to me for many years until I suddenly discovered  that people have to suffer enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with all relationships. Isn’t that a terrible thing to think? They’ve got to suffer enough in a  relationship before they wake up and say, “I’m sick of it! There must be a better way of  living than depending on another human being.” And what was I doing as a  psychotherapist? People were coming to me with their relationship problems, with their  communication problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help. But sometimes, I’m  sorry to say, it wasn’t, because it kept people asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a  little more. Maybe they ought to touch rock bottom and say, “I’m sick of it all.”  **It’s only  when you’re sick of your sickness that you’ll get out of it.**  Most people go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief. I repeat: to get relief. Not to get out of it"   I'm a GT alum.  How do you feel about Paul Johnson's offense?  oh and Hillary?!??  wow.    Because it can make a subpar photo look good.  Also, its easy to apply at the press of a button.   I dunno.  Heartbreak is probably the worst pain I've ever felt and I've been through A LOT in life.   My head exploded and ascended into the atmosphere when I saw what [this guy looked like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laStiu_sUd4)    True.  But it's gotta sting knowing that the Cardinals, Seahawks, and Buccaneers have been.   The only NFC team that has NEVER been to the Superbowl.  That's gotta sting if you're a Lions fan.   Be glad you've been spared the pain of heartbreak then.   I'm struggling right now with all my relationships.  I just broke up with my girl because my heart wasn't in it and it was the right thing to do.  See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/)   The problem is I underestimated the friendship I had with my gf.  It wasn't perfect but at least I had someone who was obligated to put me before everyone else.  At least I had someone to vent to.  Now that I'm single and depressed nobody is around.  I have friends, but I always feel like I'm bothering them and they all have other priorities whether it's kids or a significant other.    So this leaves me by myself.  Who am I supposed to talk to?  I feel like nobody understands me.  Even when I was in a relationship I was the type of friend to drop everything and be there for a friend in need.     I don't have the best relationship with my family either so I truly feel Forever Alone.   I agree as well.  I've been depressed lately and have been rolling with the mantra, "When in doubt. Write." I have a ton of journal entries over the past two years.  It's therapeutic.   I don't wish mental problems or depression or anxiety on anybody.  On the outside everything is great in my life.  Good job with great salary, tall, handsome and athletic but inside my mind I've been to hell and back.  For a while I was taking Prozac but I quit it cold turkey against my doctor's orders.  That was about 2 years ago and I think I'm much better but when I have my down moments they're BAD.  It used to be better because I had my girlfriend to talk to but now I don't have anyone I feel like talking to about my problems because they all *seem* so unimportant in the grand scheme of things.   Doing pushups in the office would be taboo where I work.  I once did it during a brainstorming session amongst four other people in a non-formal setting and was told it was the most unprofessional thing someone had ever seen.   Michael or Christopher.  You're basically giving your kid no originality and asking for mistaken identity problems later.   This is good stuff.  I've got a Spanish learning blog where I'm applying this.  I'm also going to start a GMAT prep blog as well.  I figure if I type out daily lessons of how to study effectively then it's just as good as me teaching a live person.   Told my ex I cheated on her.  Even though it was the right thing and I never did it again, the next few years of our relationship were hell.  Had I not said nothing and just acted right things would have been much better.   Knowing when and how to end a relationship.   At least you're being honest.  It's hard as fuck being a black guy when you have to deal with those stereotypes tho.  And be honest, you know there are just as many white people who fit those stereotypes as well.   What's your racial makeup?  I'm pretty sure to get into this you have to fit a standard profile right?  	50
 Agreed. He's giving some good advice there. I was once an assistant manager at one of my jobs, and it was always the people who went that extra step that always got the benefit of the doubt. Show them that you're dedicated, then do your job in such a way that it leaves -them- needing -you-. It happens. When I was assistant manager, regardless of some of my health problems, regardless of the fact that I was having panic-attacks every day, they kept me because, even if I wasn't doing perfect, I was at least doing consistent. And that's, at least as I saw it, what made a good employee. They were consistent, if not perfect.   That's rough. When I was young, because of my depression, I used to fake being sick a lot so I wouldn't have to go. I got picked on and bullied quite a bit, mainly because compared to all the other guys, I'm tiny. But one thing that time has taught me is that what you're experiencing is temporary - keep moving forward, get through school, if you have no one else trying to help you maintain your happiness, then take it into your own hands and do whatever it takes to make yourself happy. Friends are an extension of your happiness, not the definition. You may hear a lot of people (older people) say that 'high school was the best years of their life!'. But that doesn't hold true for all of us. High school were some of my worst years of my life. But I made it through, and you can too. When you get past this moment and into the next (whether it be college or a job or what have you), you have a chance at a new beginning. That's another lesson life has taught me - life is full of new beginnings. Even if you take it day by day, every day is a new beginning. I hope this helps, and again - you're going through a rough situation by anyone's standards, regardless of their age. But there are some of us who have been through similar situations, and if we can make it through, you can too. A quote from the ancient Samurai helps me with this - "six times down, seven times up"; what this means is when you fall, pick yourself up. If you fall again, then pick yourself up again. I'll be honest with you, it's not easy, but it's worth it. You're worth it. Take care, and remember - there's always this sub for you to bring your thoughts and feelings to, and obviously people who are at least willing to listen. Sometimes, that's all you need, is someone to listen.   You're welcome. Take care, and - once more with feeling - don't give up.   Self-loathing is a beast of a monster. But if I may try just one more time - you believe there's nothing that can help, and if you continue to believe that, there never will be anything that helps. But because of the nature of depression, it's hard to change from mindset to mindset, especially from a negative mindset to a positive mindset. But - I'm sorry if this is corny or too much of a stretch - but I honestly believe there is a way. It's part of my recovery from transitioning from drug addict to recovering. I always thought that drugs would be part of my life, I never thought I'd ever be more than the drugs in my system, and I honestly believed that it was all my life would ever be. One high to another. It was a struggle to get my mindset to the point where I felt I could finally believe any other way, and to this day, it continues to be a struggle. "Once an addict, always an addict", and for some of us, it's unfortunately true. If I ever went back to cocaine, I truly believe I'd be gone in days, if not hours. Which is why I do everything I can to stay away from it, and the people who do it. But I found a way to change my mindset and embrace sobriety. I may not know you beyond this conversation we've had, but I want you to know that I have hope for you - as dumb or as corny as that sounds, I truly do have hope for you. You may not believe you can do it, but having experienced weakness and that drowning feeling that comes along with depression, I do believe you can do it. I hope you can do it. If that doesn't help, then I'm sorry. I wish I knew what to say. If there was some magic phrase I could use to lift that self-loathing from you, I would say it.   I'll be straight up honest with you - I've never heard it myself, but I have friends who have, and it's heartbreaking. People who suffer from depression tend to be some of the most beautiful, compassionate people in the world, even when they're not feeling it themselves. But I do understand the fear -  My wife and I have been married for 2 years, and together for 12. I suffer from clinical depression, which means that I will be dealing with it all my life, like I have for as long as I can remember. All I've ever really known in my life is sadness and darkness, with some breaks of sunlight along the way. Some breaks lasted longer than others, and some seemed to only last a few moments. It's hard on me. But it's also very hard on her. I got lucky - I got damn lucky. I found a woman who's stronger than I could ever be, and she uses her strength to help me keep my head above water. But even the strongest among us have our limits. Every time I fall apart, there's always the question floating around in the back of my mind - "is this the last time she'll be here for me? If she left, could I blame her?" Like I said, I've gotten lucky. As for your situation, don't give up on love. Love saves, as corny as it sounds. This guy wasn't the one for you. I'm not going to say he broke under the pressure, but like I said - even the strongest among us have our limits. Him stepping out on you is on him, not you, and not your depression. And if someone sees something in someone worth cherishing, then someone else can potentially see that as well. So like I said, don't give up.   One thing I've learned through life is that you can't make other people happy if you're not happy yourself. When you suffer from depression, it ranges from hard to downright impossible. My advice, start working on your own happiness, because it's like turning a light on. That light will attract other lights, and soon you have a support group who can help you through whatever you may be going through at the time. For me, I'll admit that it's been a long, painful process, but that's how I've been viewing it - as a process. It takes time, it takes work, and it takes energy. When you suffer depression, that does seem like an impossible task. But don't give up. Please. Just try - you may surprise yourself.   No problem. Take care of yourself. :)   This honestly sounds like the beginning to the relationship between me and the woman that would eventually become my wife. She saved me. When we met, I was 21 and a complete mess. I was doing cocaine daily, popping pills whenever I could, and basically doing whatever drug that was placed within my reach. The reason? The same as yours - I absolutely hated myself. For the first few years, I did like you - I never once told her about my depression or my past drug use (I cleaned up for her, which was one of the hardest things I've done in my life, especially trying to do it in a way that she'd think I was just weird/crazy and not a recovering drug addict). She was supportive of me to begin with, but when I finally came out and told her about everything, the love and support only grew. If your man is even as half as kind and supportive as you suspect, I honestly feel you have nothing to lose, but everything to gain by telling him. Once he realizes he's your front line of defense against your depression, he'll be capable of being there for you in ways you can't imagine. For me, my wife certainly was.  From there, with his support, your battle with depression can only get easier. Educate yourself about your condition, and include him in what you learn, or when you tell him, explain to him what you do know about it. I hope this helps, even if just a bit.   Feeling rejected is a horrible feeling, but don't let it stop you. You may not have gotten this job, but that doesn't mean you won't get the next. And if you don't get that one, you get up and try again. The highest I've climbed at any job I've done was assistant manager - meaning I sat in on a lot of interviews and gave my opinion on whether someone should be hired on or not. I can tell you right now, that I watched a lot of amazing people step into that office who would be perfect - but that's the thing about the job-hunt, you're not the only one doing it. I don't know why they didn't pick you, but I do have an idea of what you can do now. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again. And again if you have to. But whatever you do, don't give up - and learn from any job interview that doesn't lead you to getting the job. One question I ask (if an employer actually calls to let me know I didn't get the job) is - "was there anything I could've done in my interview that would have improved it?". If they have the time, they just might answer. And one more time, with feeling - Don't give up.  	9
 trying to sneak a selfie. just be honest about it   yeaah... definitely ill   pizza hamburgers hot dogs ice cream cake cookies   that is so awesome. and respect. i was actually going to join the LAPD hahaha, but stuff happened...   http://blog.betdsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pic_alistair_overeem_skinny1.gif  http://isportsweb.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/04/alistair-overeem-denied-1.jpg  http://photos.imageevent.com/sharpshootercollectibles/newwwepromos/Brock%20Lesnar%202012.jpg   this is actually super interesting. if you added some fat this was kinda like brock lesnar vs. alistair overeem. lesnar naturally has a way bigger frame. overeem put on the muscle so they weighed the same.    run with a backpack on    hahahaha word   something else i wanted to add... im actually the drummer for my church and to be honest, i havent told the worship band where i stand in my (lack of) faith. but i still enjoy the experience of practicing and working together to create the best possible sound and experience for the church... i do plan to step down eventually   i see them as good works of art. music is a great experience and it can be explained by science honestly. there are 8 notes in a scale, which all vibrate at a certain frequency, and when they do it in certain combinations, they make major, minor, diminished, augmented,etc chords. i think music is just a good experience. and christian artists, despite what they are singing about, are conveying a meaningful emotional experience, with usually poetic and well written lyrics. so that combined with good musicianship and instrumentals would also make for a pleasant listening experience. no reason to feel guilty i dont think   first thing reading through that: you're a good writer and it was really cool reading your articulate thoughts. hell is scary, and the whole science vs. religion and how some christians think science is evidence of how detailed god is... idk it just seems like an easy way out. but yeah there are times when i think back to the christian teachings i was raised with. how there are passages like, the enemy will try to deceive you or there will be false gods and stuff like that. but when i try to really look at the world, god just doesnt make sense. every culture had a religion to explain how they came to being.    Anyone else have any experience with this? I grew up in the church so almost all of my friends were part of this church circle. It feels almost impossible to break out and meet new people that think like me.   How did you guys find a new circle? The friends I grew closest with I still consider my friends, but there definitely is a divide now.    i'll never feel tall enough ripped enough smart enough rich enough. and to be honest im insecure and ive never really felt like an alpha male, but if i admit that and show it, i think i become even less "masculine"   if you want to compete in mma or get really good, it's going to be pretty hard. bodybuilding is definitely intense training but the conditioning, flexibility, and movement training would for a significantly different goal than being a good striker/grappler   CPA   i used to always make fun of my parents for napping during the day. i'd say things like, "what's so tiring about driving? all you do is sit in the car." now i understand the joy of a nap  	16
 considering that I've been called a satanist many times before because of these particular things, I would have to say hair/makeup/clothing and many of my drawings.    I have had a Galaxy S3 for a while now and I really love it. It has a great battery life, its pretty durable even with a cheap case, its a little more complex than Apple, and it has a lot of customizable features. Meanwhile, all of my friends have iPhones and all of them are the same. Battery doesnt last any longer than about noon, expensive case yet still manage to shatter the screen, constantly complaining about their phones, but still every day I hear "why dont you just get and iPhone? they are way better than Android". I am not saying that all iPhone users are like this (my friends are just stereotypical teenage white girls) and I am not saying that iPhones are horrible. I'm just saying that I prefer Android.    oh, okay. and yeah its really interesting to see other people's thoughts on stuff like this because when I've asked people about this, I have gotten responses anywhere from "ghosts are 100% real and you cant tell me otherwise" to "you need to get mental help"    I personally believe in ghosts but thats because i have been around spirits my entire life and have done a little bit of paranormal investigation in my free time. I will admit though that there really is no scientific evidence to prove that they exist even with all the EVPs and unexplained photos and videos. So you can take it either way. There may be a logical explanation to this but whether or not you find one is up to you. I hope this makes sense even though it probably doesnt help your situation much.   	4
 Resources are worked by the city aren't they?   Maybe they changed it for different versions.   Are you too afflicted with tall/wide/resting-bitch-face?   Stubbing your toe hurts.   Shouldn't you be working though?   But it's super trivial.    Why?   When everything is ridiculously overpowered, nothing is.   Pretty sure reddit has been marking all of these threads as nsfw.   Asshole =/= blunt/honest.  I'm an asshole, I'll tell you if your opinion is hit, or you need new makeup.   After seeing what my father and mother did to three kids, I don't want to o that to someone.   For real, if you have depression or borderline personality issues, don't have a kid.   Yeah? Ever rear end someone?   I used to work in construction. (used to is a different issue, construction of new homes dried up.)   I broke the back window of a cargo van once. Was loading up a t pole to take back to the shop after a hotwire passed, pulled a ladder from underneath, jimmied the pole a little bit back(without knowing) and broke a back window on a company truck.   Now I make sure I have clearance before Clarence clears me.   Fuck, I'm lonely.   Yeah. Sucks man.   Question, do you like to connect with someone on a deep level or are you more of a light conversation kinda person?  Because I started hanging out a fairly busy local bar and the short, drunken talking about whatever conversations suit me really well.    Mn, I was really hoping this was a [Frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_%28film%29) related post, but it wasn't.    They're brainwashed by their government who bring up the Falklands any time their government is in trouble in any way.  If it works, it works.    It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.  If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.)   Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference.   Just grab your junk and hold on for the ride.   Lack of enforcement =/= legality    No, legally they cannot. A business can't refuse service based on race or sex.

It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half.   So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished.   And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.    I saw a study that said ~43% of statistics are made up on the spot.    Saw a study that suggested upwards of 50% of a pain reliever's effect was placebo, people expecting it to work.   So even if it does nothing, it could still do something.   Why would you... the fuck is wrong with you dude?   So it was a three on Juan kinda fight?

I've worked as a bouncer and had to remove some straight assholes from the club, if while I'm removing them, they get away and grab a bottle, I push them and they break their neck on a wall or something, is that murder?

Fucking dicks, the lot of them.   http://i.imgur.com/7nsZCmP.jpg  What did you say about mathematically impossible?   Its actually a brilliant move. They drown out competition, increase consumer confidence so they buy those big trucks again, and when the prices go back up there will still be competition, but the price will be even higher, allowing them to step in and buy the companies supplying the tar sands type oil.   I mean yeah there's some niche shit to it, but damn, I hope they use lube on us later. Of course it might be too expensive.   No. But the level at which they decide to produce does have a direct effect on prices, in a less supply = higher prices way.   You just made a statement where you contradict yourself and that example is crap.   Just so you know.     Holy shit.   I like pizza and cheap tvs. Deal with it ya damn hippie.   How do you figure? Instability equals a much less stable market. One government falling in the region has a huge impact on the market price for oil.   And no serious coalition will form, its like herding cats, who have guns.   Back in my day we only had 3 channels and we liked it that way.  Seriously though, at least House was on, daytime TV is shit.   My point was more of once the oil prices start going back up hard to reach oil like the tar sands is going to become a viable source again.   "Which could count as a geopolitical win in the Mid East region."   We want that region as stable as possible, the fracturing of Iraq is the perfect example. Removing the leaders of a country with that many different tribes and sects all wanting the money is insane.   Eh, its a body part. Can get mixed up in the process.   Ugh. Conspiracy theories are so stupid.   Apparently some people have a misunderstanding of what Foul Bachelor Frog is all about.   A safeword should be a calm sounding word. Not too many hard consonants.   And should always be something that doesn't fit the situation. Like 'Chicago' or something.      It's a delaying of the inevitable. I do think the Saudis are trying to drive the competition away, but as long as there is money to be made...   Another aspect people don't get is that unless the US subsidizes oil in a serious manner, we will still be effected. Oil goes to market first, then it ends up at the consumer.    Points for front end down force on FWD?  I mean, it looks like shit, but in theory it should work better than a freaking spoiler.   Wow.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXSLcYQHqFQ   Holy shit. I'm sorry, but self deprecation is the best humor IMO.   Benny Hill wasn't funny, but I got a good kick out of this.   Vampires Suck was bad, but it had some decently funny bits.   The whole hating on Twilight thing was a plus.   Savings accounts don't even keep up with inflation anymore.   You re literally better off keeping your money under the mattress than in a savings account and paying the capitol gains tax.   Few 5 star restaurants are publicly traded.  	107
 That's absolutely lovely. Warmed my heart. Have been told that it would also depend on the reason as to why the animal was surrendered, if it was just because the animal is too old then they probably wouldn't let you adopt. There are some nasty owners out there, in saying that there are some awesome ones 😊  	1
 Thanks, that's what I think would be best. As much as I eventually want to get back to working full time and feeling like I'm a proper member of society again, I think wading into it is my best bet. The last thing I want is to overwhelm myself and break down again. I guess part of my anxiety is based on the pressure I've felt from everyone to "just get a job already" and the guilt I feel for being so dependent at my age, but I really do need to ee acclimate myself and do what's best for me. Thanks so much for the advice. It's nice to hear from other people who have managed to get back up on their feet.   Thanks I was planning on asking in jobs and getemployed but I figured I'd reach out here first since I kind of just needed to get all this off my chest and knew that I'd need to extremely abbreviate this there. Thanks for the advice though, that's going to be my next step :)  	2

 I felt so much better reading this towards the end when you were able to take a shower.     I can't figure out what you're trying to say.   Fuck, I have no idea what I would've done in that situation!   Yeassss   This happened pretty close to the crowd. Why am I explaining myself?    I mean, it was kind of funny.. But in that moment I just wanted to light a cigarette and throw it in their direction.   Yeah, well. Point proven.   Cara, e hora de saber do World Cup. Não tem jeito.   I think I love you.   (I don't post..ever, but this is my second time posting on /r/TIFU..so it's safe to say I'm an idiot.)  After work, about two days ago, I was pretty tired after a lengthy and busy lunch serving shift. I needed to get cigarettes at the gas station, so my boyfriend took me straight there after he picked me up. I run in, grab 'em,talk about how I need to quit with the cashier for the millionth time, and head back out.  not paying any attention to the make or model of a gunmetal colored car, I don't bother looking inside, and proceed to try to open the locked door on the passenger's side. I'm not looking inside, but kind if just staring ahead of me waiting for it to be unlocked. To my FUCKING HORROR,I see my boyfriend's car parked in front, and the driver looks at me and starts laughing, unlocking the car and rolling down the window saying, "am I missing something?"  It took me a minute too long to register, and after mumbling something stupid, I run to my boyfriend's car, turn last minute and see half of the people filling up and waiting to fill up laughing.   I jump in the fucking car and tell him to get the fuck out of there, Meanwhile covering my face with both hands and repeatedly saying " ohmygodohmygod."  Haven't forgiven myself yet.    Yeah, that kid is going to have some major issues.   Howwwwwwwwwww there's no fucking popping   Haha, yeah. The vet said that he saw it happen all the time, which, well...made me feel better   Haha no, ear. But technically a chuck of meat came off :(   Turned out, the little mat was a tumor or some kind of mass! It had little blood vessels and was squishy :(   Goddamnit I meant *EAR   Today, I FUCKED up.  Let me start by saying I adore my animals,  all animals.   My friend has this weird long-haired chihuahua papillon. Wicket. Sweetheart, tiny, and well taken care of (by me, usually she smells like cigarettes and has little mats. Roommate loves her, is just completely fucking clueless.) Anyway, after giving Wicket a bath and drying her off a bit, I started to trim her hair, and some of the mats. I used to groom dogs, bathe them, etc., so I was comfortable doing it.  I found a huge fucking rats nest of a mat behind her ear, cleared around it and slowly started to trim. Wicket didn't move,cry, or give ANY sign she was in distress, and just sat there blinking slowly. I kept trimming, tried to pull some of the excess hair out of the way and noticed something bright pink. When I moved closer and moved the remaining mat I found I had practically cut off the back of her fucking ear. Bright pink skin, veins and blood vessels galore. Nothing to protect it, just skin. The second layer of her fucking skin.   I fucking lost it. Not the gore, that does bother me. It was the fact that,because this dog is so small in size, including her ears, she practically had no first layer of skin/fur on the back of her ear.  Ran to my car, ran a red light to the emergency vet just to be sent home, and was told to out hydrogen peroxide on it.  Roommate? Killed me. Freaked out on me, rightly so, and slapped the back of my head.   Wicket is fine, it healed perfectly. I took her to the vet, no stitches required, but apparently I was extremely close to doing major damage.   I will never groom another animal.  	17
 The prettiest people do the ugliest things.   Wut?    it's kinda pointless to discuss strategy in pubs  Uh, actually that's most of what this subreddit is for considering 99% of the people on here only play pubs. It's actually more pointless to talk about pro dota considering, again, that 99% of the people on here are not pros. And neither you nor OP specified which you were referring to.  Bye Felicia.   Yeah but that applies to any hero, not specifically these 4.   Well, there's this super cool thing called Google that I guess not many people have heard about that has dozens of guides on how to play this hero.   But since you're lazy and I'm bored, you start off by maxing your Morph ability and Waveform, stopping off to take your Ultimate at 6. Morphing to agility gives you more damage, but less health, and morphing to strength does the opposite. Finding the correct balance in the early game takes practice and depends on the lanes. If you're in a safe tri lane, you can afford to morph more agility for damage to ensure last hitting because you won't be taking near as much harass as say if you were running mid or offlane.  The way Morphling wins late game is having a shit ton of damage and a shit ton of armor from maxing out your Morph ability on Agility. You build items that give you survivability, such as Linken's Sphere, Butterfly, I've seen Skadi Morphlings before, etc. The Eblade build, or Shotgun build, is used to blow the everloving fuck out of one of the enemy heroes, usually a key support or utility hero, at the very beginning of the fight making it a 4v5. The Eblade nerf hurt this build however, so I'm not sure if it's still too viable. Morphling is rarely run in this current meta. Eblade increases magic damage taken, and a maxed out Agility Adaptive Strike plus a Waveform does a metric fuck ton of damage and will usually 1 shot somebody below 2k health, maybe even more. I'm not bored enough to do the math. This however falls off in later portions of the game when enemies build BKBs and get more health in general.  Your ultimate is used in multiple ways. You can make a replicate of the enemy hard carry and use it to attack for your team, or make a replicate of a teammate to send to another lane to jump to to continue farming when you've pushed your lane too far out. Additionally, you can instantly replicate out of a sticky situation in a fight where you might die by sending the replicate out of the fight or keeping it back beforehand.  If you're ever in a pickle, you have two options. Replicate out, or start morphing to strength to gain a ton of health and hopefully survive where you might have died.  The general build I used to run was Acquila  Treads  Linkens  Eblade  Butterfly Skadi, and by that point the game was usually over. I haven't played Morphling in months however. Once you have Eblade, you want to be running around with maxed or almost maxed agility to pull off your Shotgun combo effectively.   Morphling isn't a hero that can 1v5 and destroy the enemy team, usually. Because he requires the maxing of agility and reduction of strength to do the most damage, he is vulnerable and requires heroes around him that can protect him and pull aggro off of him if needed.  One cool thing to note is that you can Morph to strength or agility while stunned (definitely) or rooted (I believe). However, not while silenced. So if the enemy team has silences that could fuck you over, consider building a Manta.     Tinker gets destroyed by Sniper in lane  Wut? My 3k Tinker shits on Snipers in lane. Fuck going March build, just rocket spam him. Maybe it won't work in Very High Skill brackets where Snipers run bottles, but if you're in "the trench" Tinker should easily win.   Blink, Laser, oh no troll bkb'd!, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Rearm, Ghost Scepter, Laser, Profit.   Anyone who's good knows he's not a support. Wait until your trash tier carry stops farming at 10 minutes to go teamfight before he's ready, secure lane farm for yourself and let him die, dominate the mid game kill stealing with your ult and laugh in their faces when you carried harder than they did.      where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah?     Mine, keeping in mind I don't use quickcast. That's probably because I don't use mouse movement and have never really seen the point of quickcast:  123456 - spells (Played WoW for 4 years where your spells took up 1 through =, so hitting the 5 or 6 is already muscle memory and not an issue at all)  TAB - select all units  CAPSLOCK - cycle through units  Space - Select Hero  Q - attack move  E - Stop/Cancel  ZXCVFR - items  WASD - Camera Move  Basically the difference I'm seeing is that if I use mouse movement, that frees up 4 buttons to use for control groups. But what I'm also seeing is that only helps me play micro-intensive heroes, which I have no real interest in playing anyway because they just aren't my style, and that's less than 5% of the hero pool. Control Groups are useless on something like a Lion or Magnus, where the only time I'll need it are if I get an Illusion rune or for some reason build a Necro book. And in that case I can just CL cycle them if I need them to do something different than what my hero is doing, yeah?   My hand position rests with pinky finger on Shift, ring finger on A, middle finger on W, index finger on D, and thumb on C, so all of the above buttons are able to be pressed instantly. I do use Edge Pan as well though, so I suppose I use a mixture of Edge Pan and WASD.   Why are they inferior? If I'm using keyboard controls, my mouse is free to go wherever I want it to, rather than it being on the edges of the screen using Edge Pan or MMB.  It's not any slower, because Edge Pan and WASD movement are both dependent on what your camera speed is set to. Mine is set pretty high, and my WASD actually moves my camera faster than what MMB does.    I can see how the control groups would be more efficient for illusions and summons.   But if I'm playing a Weaver, Tinker, Centaur, Magnus, QoP, Lion, Crystal Maiden, Earthshaker, or any of the other heroes that don't require the use of illusions or summons 99% of the time, what are control groups used for?  And I know I'm going to end up typing something in caps in chat more often than not, but eh. It'll work.    select illusions/summons   I've got that on TAB for all and CAPSLOCK for cycle currently.   select hero button  Space bar.   chat commands  Actually that would be useful considering I'm still using the default Y+mouse direction for those.    awfully slow compared to all other methods.  Really? I've got my camera speed up pretty high, it doesn't seem like it's any slower than Edge Pan or MMB.  I dunno it just feels like I'm not grasping the concept of why WASD is so bad.    The way it looks, if I want to move the camera up with MMB, I have to click and drag down. What if a hero is running up and I want to follow it with the camera, using MMB, and cast an ability on them? I'm dragging the mouse AWAY from where I want to be casting my ability, meaning I'll then have to move my mouse back from the bottom, to the top to cast an ability on the hero. Whereas with WASD I can just hold the keys and keep my mouse free to click wherever I want. Edge Pan would work the same as WASD in that sense, but MMB seems like it would be way more garbage. Unless I'm missing something.  edit: I was missing the option to Reverse Camera Grip.   Attack-move is Q, I have Stop bound to E.   I never use the Move command, if I want to send a unit somewhere without issuing an attack command I just select it and right click it to where I want it to go.   I figured out above how to cycle through controlled units, something I had always thought I could do but accidentally unbound some time in the past.   I played WoW for 4 years, where your spells took up 1 through =. I have no problem at all doing the quick reach to hit a 5 or 6 if necessary if I even choose to play those heroes.  Currently my setup is 123456 for skills, WASD for camera move, ZXCVFR for items, TAB is select all units, CAPSLOCK is cycle through units now that I figured that out.   I don't know, I've never felt like I had any issues being able to play any heroes this way. I consider Tinker one of my best heroes and playing him requires hitting up to 7 or 8 different keys in rapid succession, of which I have no issue. The only issue I can see might arise is with micro-intensive heroes like Meepo or Chen, but micro-intensive heroes don't interest me so I don't really care to change my entire setup to accommodate heroes I don't want to play anyway, you know?   Okay, I had bound TAB to select all units some time in the past. Went ahead and switched that, thank you.   What other things would I need to utilize those keys for though? I don't have quickcast hotkeyed to anything, is that something I should be using? It sounds like a neat idea, but I also don't think that the time it takes to press the hotkey and actually click the mouse for me (near instantaneously) is worth keybinding 4-6 keys for.  I suppose I could keybind control groups to the keys for micro-intensive heroes, but I try to avoid playing those anyway because I just don't like them.   Also, random question, but is there any way to hotkey a button that scrolls between different units? For example if I pop my Manta Style and want to quickly send my 2 illusions and hero in different directions, would there be a button I could hit that selected specifically 1 illusion, and then if I hit it again, specifically the other illusion, hit it again, back to hero, again, back to 1st illusion, again, back to other illusion, etc.?   Why is it better though? And if you use Edge Pan or MMB, what's the difference between keeping it on 1234 vs. QWER?   Currently I use do WASD as camera, and have my 6 item slots bound to ZXCVFR. XCV are the items I use most in a game (Blink, Phase Boots, Force Staff, etc.) with R usually being hero specific items (Hex, Ghost Scepter/Eblade, Dust). I don't have any problem hitting these keys because over the years my finger dexterity has only gotten better (just ask my girlfriend ;)).     So I've been playing Dota 2 for about a year and a half now. It was the first game of its kind I'd ever played. Before that, I'd played Call of Duty and World of Warcraft among other games extensively on the PC, so I was no stranger to PC online gaming.  I've never bound my Dota 2 spells to QWER, I've had them as 1234 the whole time because after a good 7 years of online gaming, 1-9 were always spells, switching weapons, killstreaks, etc. and WASD was always camera or player movement of some sort. It's so ingrained in my muscle memory that I figured it would be more detrimental for me to switch that around and try to learn something new than stick with what I've always done, and could also hinder my performance in other games.   What is the advantage that binding your spells to QWER gives in Dota 2? A second part, and most of the reason for asking this, is that I've recently picked up one of [these](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BcyeIQuSL.jpg) mice. It has two buttons I could use to bind things to in Dota 2 that I haven't experimented with yet, and was wondering what might be the most beneficial things in the game to bind to it.   Mute them all and just play your game. Focus on learning. Watch your replays too. If you're dying a lot, look at WHY you're dying. Were you in the enemy jungle without vision? Did you commit to a fight you were outnumbered in? Should you have backed out instead of going for that last kill?   There's no one quick trick to getting better at Dota, it all just takes time and practice.   Eh Lion actually isn't as great as you'd think. Lion's burst is great in the early game, but Sniper and Troll should always build a BKB, Axe usually does, and Jug has built in Magic Immunity which completely counters Lion.  Lina, however, would be decent if you're able to farm an Aghs Scepter because the Scepter changes your ult's damage type to Pure and allows it to pierce spell immunity.   Then you just need to play more. Stick to one hero for a while just to get basic mechanics to become muscle memory. One mistake I made at first was trying to become a jack of all trades/master of none.   Also I'd recommend playing the Limited Hero game mode. Those heroes tend to be simpler to understand, have less complicated synergies/mechanics, and greatly reduce the amount of "what the fuck was that" potential in a game.     tinker   Before the March/Eblade nerf yes. I rose 500 MMR by spamming Tinker. Shit was insanely easy.  Now though it's way harder to win solo as a Tinker. If your team won't push with you, you're not going to win.     Winning mid is more about your skill vs. the enemies mids skill then anything else  Debatable depending on your MMR.   2k, yes because you RARELY get support rotations into the mid to gank. 2k is the mindset where if the mid isn't ganking a sidelane the minute they hit 6, it's a reportable offense.   4k however, if one team's support rotates a couple times even just to apply pressure and the other team's does not, the former team's mid may win out over the latter even if the latter is more skilled.   I wouldn't. Naga is a hero that relies pretty heavily on coordination within the entire team to be utilized correctly.  You rarely get that in solo queue.    I've gotten multiple on Bloodseeker, Weaver, Sven and Crystal Maiden but I think that's it.   Watch pro gameplays. Usually the commentators do a great job (depending on who it is) explaining what's going on, item choices for heroes, why teams are doing specific movements around the map, etc.  I've learned way more watching pro gameplays than I ever would have just playing the game.   Omniknight's ult counters them because they all rely on physical damage.  Vengeful Spirit is pretty good because you can use her ult to swap an important carry out of a death situation, and if you die your 3rd skill reduces the enemies' physical damage output.  Dazzle is good because your ult gives your team +armor and the enemy team -armor if you land it on everyone, and Shallow Grave will keep an ally alive for a potential escape against all but Axe.  Disruptor can be good if played correctly, by Glimpsing initiators back out of the fight or dropping a huge ultimate on 3-4 during a fight.  Ghost Scepter is an item that makes you invulnerable to physical damage, is great against these heroes.  Heaven's Halberd disarms the enemy, so they can't physically attack anyone for the duration and also provides evasion.  Just to name a few.   Slark destroys Sniper as well.   Did you even read the hero names? Sniper is THE hero for low MMR games, and has been since Dota 2 came out. Axe has always been picked in low MMR games too. Troll is the only one of the four that hasn't been a consistent pick for 3k MMR.   And like the other reply said,    you have to remember that the people who play against them are even worse at countering them then the axe troll and jugg pickers are at playing them.  Bye Felicia.   Lol what? These heroes are picked every game from 1k MMR to Pro Tournaments. You're an idiot.   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+better+at+dota+2   A:256  B:30  2.7k MMR   Troll and Axe both need nerfs in my opinion.  Troll needs his base movement speed slightly reduced, and maybe a slight reduction in health in melee axe form to be balanced.  Not really sure how to make Axe balanced but he's way too strong in the laning stage.   Yeah my comment was tongue in cheek regarding the horrible nature of South Americans specifically on this video game.  Calm it down.   Average    Very High Skill    0 BKBs against a Tinker/Ogre/Zeus with 3 Dagon 5's.  lolwut    What the hell is the problem if I want to play something other than AP or CM for MMR?  You do. It's just hidden MMR. Kappa.   There's a difference between picking something inappropriate for your team and randoming a hero you have no idea how to play but keeping it just for the extra gold.     I played a game like this earlier tonight. 2 people on my team said nothing throughout the entire draft, didn't lock heroes or anything.   3 of us had already picked PL, Clinkz, Jakiro. The final two randomed Naga Siren and Tinker. Neither had any clue how to play the hero they randomed, and barely spoke English (surprise surprise).  Needless to say we got completely stomped because Tinker fed the shit out of the enemies' Sniper mid and the Naga was only good for using her Ult to escape and throwing down maybe 1 or 2 good nets the entire game. I reported them for Intentional Ability Abuse, was happy to see two notifications pop up later in the night that they got put into low priority.  Tinkers one of my best heroes. If the stupid Peruvian had spoke English I could have swapped him, but alas, another game ruined because of South Americans. Typical Dota 2.   I believe if you die with rapier the item is no longer bound to you, meaning you no longer own it.  Contrasted to if you drop your Yasha, even if someone picks it up, that item is still bound to you and only you benefit from the stats.   Lol.    Juggernaut can perform normal attacks during Blade Fury, but these attacks will deal no damage to enemies being affected by Blade Fury.  From the Dota 2 wiki. How is this supposed to work? Does this mean you can't auto attack an enemy while BF'ing unless they're already magic immune?   Christ. With that team composition you deserved to lose.  Also, the guy's friend is retarded. If he raises it any more than 500 he's just going to get stomped back down to where he was in the first place.    Take a break and do something else.     I don't understand why everyone is crying about it.  If you have a huge lead and the enemy outplays you and wins a teamfight, it's your fault for getting outplayed and losing a teamfight that you should have won.   How is this any different than previous patches where teams would draft insanely good T3 tower defense with a 4 protect 1 carry strat, lose all outer towers at 20 minutes and defend for the next 30 until their carry became unkillable?      Dear South America:   Please cut off all internet access to your favelas.   Sincerely, World.   That's a good mentality to have and makes you a better player. I've learned to never trust or rely on random teammates in video games, because 90% of the time they'll fail you.  However in this case, split pushing would have just stalled the inevitable further. If the Sven and LS didn't build MKB for 60 minutes, they were trash and you weren't going to win.  If they had built MKB, you probably would have won considering a couple teamfights could have gone your way and you could have transitioned those into Roshans or tower pushes. But that's Dota.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32tELgOnwOI   Alt clicking is great because South Americans that queue on US E without speaking a word of English can still communicate the cooldowns/availabilities of items and spells. In a game such as this where communication is arguably the biggest key to victory, and Valve refuses to region lock, it was kind of needed.   I for one am against making the game too much easier. Making things easier is what kills online multiplayer video games. I used World of Warcraft as an example in a thread earlier. In my opinion that game is absolute shit now after they lowered the skill cap for literally everything in WotLK. Call of Duty is another good example. 4 was one of the greatest games ever made because it was barebones, simple, and required heavily on reaction time and pure gun skill. Look at the shit they did with MW3 and BO2, as examples. They made weapon attachments that were literally hacks in previous games (Target Finder, Dual Band) and those games are shit now.  There was a suggestion earlier that was put forward by an alleged 4.2k player saying warding was too difficult and "it's a needed change" that Valve should implement a special courier THAT GOES OUT AND WARDS FOR YOU. Shit like that would ruin the game, and is an absolutely stupid suggestion.  I don't exactly know where I was going with this reply, but changes that make communication easier I'm all for. However, mechanical changes are when you cross the line. Skill shots are a great example. If they made landing Slark's Pounce any easier, it would be too much. Or WR's Shackleshot. In-game timers that were visible to players for Roshan or enemy buybacks would be too much. Just a couple examples I thought of.    You probably wouldn't have won even if you did split push. Your bat and sven were trash.   Maybe not at minute 4, but a riki with some farm hiding off in the trees blink striking in on an underleveled support running out of fountain? Or ganking couriers?  It obviously isn't a great idea, and I wouldn't advocate it, but it definitely could be annoying.   With heroes like Troll, Jug, Axe, Sniper, Lion extremely strong in this meta it's almost impossible to pub stomp with her.   She loses hard to heroes that can burst her down quickly, and that's what the meta is about right now.   And then get initiated on immediately by a blade mailed Clock/Axe/LC. Fun times.   Some of them are good ideas. Alt clicking allied spells to indicate "Use ____ Now" in chat could be very useful.  Then some of them, like the alleged 4k player suggesting a specific courier be put into the game that wards for you, are fucking retarded.  But that's how this entire subreddit is so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Why the fuck won't my shrug ever work? It's always missing its fucking left arm.  I kind of like this one better though so ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯   I actually haven't seen one of those in a couple months.    It could work.    for you lefties  What does being left handed have to do with any of this?    Because you're in the lead and you lost a fight. That shouldn't happen.  Don't think of it as being penalized for losing a fight, think of it as the other team being rewarded for winning a fight that realistically they shouldn't have won due to your advantage. They outplayed a stronger opponent, and deservedly get more reward.    At this point, the Glyph being refreshed after a Tier 1 tower falls is just dumb and appears to be a gross overreaction when combined with the comeback formula.  Maybe when combined with the formula, but do you remember TI4? 20 minute gg's because you win a team fight at 15 minutes and take 3 towers afterwards was stupid.    He can be used as a niche last pick sometimes, but Huskar relies on lack of coordination on the opposing team to be useful. He's a great pubstomper because he ults in and people go full panic mode, but that's not how pro teams operate.  And no pro team wants an initiator whose initiation ability drops themselves to half health right off the bat.    Just do what I do. If someone on the opposing team is flaming me, get 1-2 of your teammates and make it your sole objective for the next 20 minutes to gank them whenever possible and make their game extremely unfun.  Or just mute them, outplay them, win the game and type JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA [Their Hero Name] over and over as you kill their Ancient.    i believe that if people didnt feed nobody would complain  You have too much faith in the internet. People will flame you for anything and everything.   99% of the time the pros get aegis immediately barring some sort of engagement going on in the pit at the same time. I've rarely seen a pro team do rosh and sit for more than 2 seconds without picking up aegis/cheese.  in b4 "BUT X PLAYER IN X GAME RAN AWAY AND DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL HE WENT BACK 5 SECONDS LATER"   If you were going in first, you were doing it wrong. The correct way to win that lane would be for CM to go around behind her when the wave was closer to your tower, freeze her, then you run in with your whirling axes. At that point she should be easy food.    Meepo, Earth Spirit and Invoker every time because I've never tried to learn them. Most of the time I'll repick Chen/Enchantress but I've had decent games with them.  Otherwise I can pretty much play every hero in the pool. Aside from those, I'll only repick if I randomed a hero and the enemy team had already picked a hard counter.   As the title says, when is the best time to buy BoTs in a game? I expect this depends on the hero, like with a tinker you want them ASAP, and with an AM it's good to pick them up early to split push and farm lanes more effectively. And sometimes you don't need to buy them at all.  But is there a general rule of thumb for when to pick up BoTs on other heroes? What I've been doing is if I can tell that if I complete my next item and doing so won't leave me a spot for a tp scroll, I'll go ahead and buy BoTs and prolong that item a bit longer to ensure I'm not caught in a position where I need to TP somewhere for a teamfight or defense. This usually comes around the 30-40 minute mark (3k MMR here, so it's not like at that point I'm fully 6 slotted or anything), both on supports and cores.  Thoughts?   4.2k and you don't know how to ward? That's pretty sad. I just played a Lion solo support. They had weaver and invoker, so I had dust on me from minute 1 until the end.  Good gold management and the fact that both ours and the enemy team's outer towers were all taken out around the 35 minute mark allowed me to sell my Tranquils and purchase BoTs, meaning I could keep BoTs, Magic Wand, Blink, Force, Observers and Dust on me. Our viper bought a gem relatively early as well, so whenever we felt like dewarding I went around with him and dewarded. Since a couple of us had dust, we didn't need the gem in team fights and we kept it in base.  Didn't have a problem with space management once in the entire game, and managed to ward throughout a 55 minute game as a solo support without any issues.  You're 4.2k and you can't figure that out? Once again: SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL PROBLEM. Get better.   Peace out.   3k. But I don't see anyone else supporting your suggestion, and I haven't seen anyone else complain about warding being difficult. If people thought this was a problem, you'd have support. (See what I did there?)  Do I WANT to leave my dust or bracer in stash to go ward? Not particularly. But I'm also not going to propose a stupid suggestion to "fix" something that isn't even a problem. It only takes a couple minutes to ward, then you get your item back, then 6-10 minutes later you do it again. It's part of being a support.  Good players don't have a problem warding.  So once again, it sounds like a personal problem.    There were a lot of factors in addition to it for me in real life too. It was also just my personal opinion that the game in general just felt too easy.   Consumables aren't needed after minute 10. If you're running around with tangos or a mana potion taking up a slot at minute 20+, you're doing it wrong. Wards take precedence.  Magic Stick/Wand falls off after 20-25 minutes. As a support, you'll have enough mana to cast enough abilities to where you won't need the boost, and if you're gone on first in a gank attempt, the stick charges probably aren't going to save your life enough of the time to warrant holding onto it. If you feel like holding onto it, put it in your stash, go ward, TP back, grab it from stash. Wards take precedence.  If you're holding a bracer at minute 40 and claim you don't have a spot for wards, you're doing it wrong. Bracer only gives somewhere between 100-150 health. That's enough to survive 1 extra attack from their carry, if that. Applies to components such as Null Talisman, Void Stone, Ring of Regen, etc. Put it in your stash, go ward, have it delivered back. Wards take precedence.  Dust or Smoke as well, either put it in your stash or give to an ally, grab it back after you ward. Wards take precedence.  Warding is YOUR job as a support. Wards take precedence over all but 3 of the things you listed above, especially considering it should only take 2 minutes tops to place them before you can get the other items back. If you're playing correctly and warding at the correct times (hint, NOT running blindly into their jungle when all enemy heroes are alive and missing from the map) then none of this is an issue. You also have 4 other heroes on your team that can assist you in this entire process. Your position 4 has an extra slot? Give them the Observers. Your Batrider and Storm Spirit want to gank the Riki farming too aggressively in bot lane? Pass them the Dust. A change isn't needed at all. Get better.   Definitely practice your last hitting. At up until 3k, that's the biggest thing that can give you the edge over your opponents.   Also learn item builds on heroes. For example you're buying a Null Talisman on the Spectre games I looked at. Completely useless and a waste of gold on that hero, meaning you are less effective in the laning stage than you should be, giving you a hard start on a hero that usually needs a good start to be effective. Shadow Blade is also useless on that hero, and to some extent Spirit Breaker as well.  You're also not really picking strong heroes to play. Visage and Elder Titan are probably way over your skill level, and Spectre isn't really that strong right now and definitely not in your MMR where most of your games are 30 minute 1 sided victories.  My advice would be to learn some bigger tempo controllers, outfarm your opponents and control the game. But that doesn't mean run into 3 heroes solo and expect to triple kill them. Solo pick off heroes are usually the best because 1. Players in that MMR rarely buy wards or TP scrolls, and generally don't have the map awareness to utilize them properly and 2. Players tend to farm and play way over aggressively. Punish that with a Shadow Bladed Slark killing a solo hero at your top T2 when their team is in their jungle or other lanes, for example.   You can't re-calibrate. What he's referencing is creating a new account, power leveling to 13 and doing ranked matches again to see if you place higher. Which is completely pointless if you aren't any better than when you calibrated the first time. If you are, then you'll be higher. But the thought process also is that if you're truly better than the 9 other people in the lobby, you should be able to single handedly carry your team to victory and increase your MMR that way on the account you play at normally.   Maybe you should have only punch it 2 times.   rekt   And you sound like the kind of person that if you're not good enough to do something, would rather have it changed to be easier than getting better and improving your personal skill.  Like I said too: If you're a good player, the current mechanics aren't a problem in any way.   If you're a support, you should always have a slot designated for Wards. Just like a good player always designates a slot for a TP scroll. It's part of the role you're playing. Wards are more important than the component of an uncompleted item that could stay in your stash until you've completed it fully. In 99.9% of games, the position 5 support will never be six slotted to the point where you have to drop something more important for your team than wards.    You pay a monthly or yearly subscription to be able to play WoW. It's been four years or so since I last paid for it, so I don't remember the actual cost of it.   What I mean by making the game easier is that they implemented purchasable (with real life money) items into the game that made basically every aspect of the game easier. Power leveling (leveling from 1 to the level cap) used to take a lot of time and effort. After these items, you could do it in a fraction of the time. These items were extremely powerful and took out a core aspect of the game where you had to sit and think about the benefits of choosing one item over another. Basically you bought these items, they scaled with your level (IIRC) and you never really had to worry about your itemization until you hit the level cap.  They also (from my experience) nerfed raiding (going into a dungeon with 5, 10, 25, etc. different people) so that instead of having to figure out strategies and use tons of teamwork to be able to down a boss, you could blow through it easily because none of the fights were anywhere near as difficult, coupled with the fact that you had these really strong items.  They earned more money because the game was more accessible to millions of other people who could buy it, load it up, and be able to get that feeling of accomplishment very quickly instead of having to work for it, as opposed to the game being a challenge and potentially turning people away because they couldn't figure it out or weren't good enough to get through certain parts.   I started to despise it because everything I'd spent tons of time working for for the past 4 years was now extremely easy. The sense of accomplishment went away. For me, if a game isn't challenging, it isn't fun.       Agreed, but taking time to micromanage such a petty task (unloading items in order to ward) takes away from the much more important micromanagement that takes place during battles and map control.  If you're a good player this isn't a problem at all. If you're not a good player, then it sounds like a personal problem.    I used to adore Blizzard. Played WoW for about 4 years, from around the time AQ was released pre-BC to right before the Cataclysm expansion.  Could just be my personal opinion, but halfway through WotLK they completely destroyed that game. I understand their model, making the game so easy an 8 year old can be successful makes it more appealing to the masses, which makes them more money; but it got to the point where everything was so easy that the game was no longer challenging in any way.   If that happened to Dota 2 it would be a very sad day indeed.   Link to dotabuff? If you're 700 I guarantee the reason you're so low is because you don't know how to farm.  Tip: Stop playing ranked for a bit, learn a hero that can come online early with heavy snowball potential (Drow, Bloodseeker, Slark, Troll Warlord, Axe are some of the easier examples to play and can also utilize the jungle well) and practice your last hitting in bot games. At 700 MMR, spend your first 20 minutes farming and not dying or participating in stupid fights. ONLY enter a fight if you know you will survive and will be able to get a kill or two out of it (for example if three enemy heroes are tower diving at less than half health. TP in, clean them up. Profit.) My experiences with lower MMR players is that they'll horribly farm for the first 8 minutes and then spend the rest of the time running at you Call of Duty style instead of continuing to farm.   If you can come out at 20 minutes with 2-3 items and maybe even 4-6 levels ahead of them, go around and continuously pick them off if they're solo and transition that into tower pushes. Nobody at 700 MMR is going to be coordinated enough to kill you at that point.   I've tried to do this way too many times. I like this idea.    wasting time in such micromanagement can be potentially game-costing.  The ability to micromanage throughout a potentially 60+ minute game is a big part of what separates great players and teams from mediocre ones.      Not really. There's a big difference between not being able to play at all and a minor distraction.   If I'm sitting in front of my TV, at a bar, or even in the seats of the stadium itself as a spectator, it's impossible for me to injure a player.  As opposed to DDOS'ing a Dota player which can be done from anywhere across the world.   This only matters above 4k where you'll get differences of 100-1000 MMR between teammates.  The difference in player skill relative to MMR between a 1000 player and 1500 player is almost zero, same for a 2000 and 2500, and probably even 3000 and 3500.

[This could be my alarm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDz9B9VGcpQ)  I think I remember hearing that he used to be a radio announcer or DJ before he got into Dota, which would explain why he seems like the most experienced behind a microphone. Is this true?   I just can't stand his voice. That's not something he can really control, so I can't fault him as a person for it, but I just can't listen to it.   Honestly he casts like a 16 year old on a sugar rush.    My problem with Zyori is that his jokes suck. All of his attempts to be funny, in my opinion, just completely fall flat. He's also completely wrong about... well, everything a lot of the time. He'll sit pondering something for two minutes when it's plainly obvious even to a 3k "scrub" like me that watches maybe 2-3 pro dota gameplays a day what the answer is.   He's gotten a little better than he used to be, so I guess the progress is good. But if I see him casting a gameplay replay of teams that I either don't know or don't necessarily care about on dotacinema I won't watch it. Compare that to Tobi, Sunsfan/Synderen, Godz, Kotlguy, where I would watch the game even if it was a pub.   I like all of BTS except Lysander. I cannot fucking stand Lysander.   I want to start off by saying ~6 months ago, I despised Capitalist as a caster. His tone and demeanor in general was just so... smarmy. He even replied to a comment I made in a thread where I bashed him. Since then however, he's actually really grown on me and I don't mind watching his casts. So if you're reading this Cap, I apologize for my previous comment and keep up the good work :)  Kotlguy is also quickly becoming one of my favorite casters. I don't know how long he's been in the scene, but I've really only discovered him in the past month or so. It's funny though, and this could just be me personally, but when he casts with Zyori (who is still really terrible) he tends to cast down to Zyori's level as opposed to if he's solo or with somebody different.   What happened to Ayesee? He was everywhere around TI4 and I don't think I've seen him since.   Somebody like Tobiwan, I'll watch games he's casting even if I don't know the teams because he's just the best in my opinion. Very knowledgeable and entertaining as well. Godz sails in the same boat, although he doesn't cast nearly as much.   Who are your guys' favorites, least favorites, honorable mentions, dream caster combo's, etc. and why?  edit: Completely forgot about Sunsfan and Synderen because I haven't seen them in forever. Another two favorites!   /r/nocontext is having a field day with this thread.   Bane/SD Mirana +1 was used heavily around TI4.    It's pretty core on Puck. His whole thing is being as evasive as possible.   It's pretty core on Jakiro too unless you have a reliable setup stun already on your team to set up ice paths.   It's not core per se on Invoker, but it makes landing his spells a hell of a lot easier.  And Eul's is great on DP for the movement speed, but again not necessarily core.   It might work for solo pick offs, but in a team fight if they notice your MoM on while dueling you're going to get bursted so hard you'll end up losing most of your duels.   Exactly.   Sounds exactly like when I try to play at 4 AM US East and get teams full of South Americans.  Seriously. They "farm" for 10 minutes and spend the rest of the game just running at you. It's fucking annoying.   Weird, it shows up in the text box if I go to edit it.   This is the account I've been playing on for the past few months, not my main though. Ignore the Ogre, Slark and QoP games, those were fresh after a blunt to the face and I always play terribly when I'm high. I also meant to queue for Normal, not Ranked, but marijuana ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  http://www.dotabuff.com/players/206703220  I'm not sitting here saying I'm pro, but the only one of the Latest Matches losses that was anywhere close to my fault (aside from the above) was the 4/8/12 where I lost mid to a smurf SF.   The hardest part about getting out of 2k/3k is that 90% of the time your team doesn't know the correct course of action. People in 5k know that at around 20 minutes if you smoke gank and get 2 or 3 pick offs you're in a great position to take Roshan uncontested and then transition that into a 1 or 2 tower push.  At 2/3k you rarely ever see a smoke bought for starters, and generally people just don't listen to anyone else on the team unless you get extremely lucky. Even though I'm spamming ROSH ROSH ROSH, nobody fucking does it. That's the biggest obstacle.   No synergy? Did you miss the part where his Astral gives you invulnerability for 4 seconds and it only takes 3 to reduce your Blink cooldown after taking damage? That seems pretty damn good to me.   The first few times I got ganked by 3+, Astral'd myself and Blinked away were very nice feelings.   It makes you almost as elusive as a Puck. I don't know the interaction if, for example, Alchemist puts a Acid Spray under you. I'm assuming you wouldn't be able to blink fast enough so in that situation a Force would be better. Maybe it depends on the game, but I'm just surprised I've never seen anyone do it.   See when I play mid or carry, I hold a 500+ gpm over 80% of the time, even when I lose. Looking at your last hits and gpm/xpm my stats are essentially the same.  I guess the difference is consistency? If I don't have a 500+ gpm every game I'll never get high skill?   Assuming you have full mana on every Orb attack as well, though.  I just personally think for the same price, the Blink gives far superior utility than the little bit of damage and lesser mobility you get with a Force.   Copied from above:  Force gives 130 mana. At level 1 Orb, this increases your Orb attack by 7.8, at level 4 Orb it increases your Orb attack by 11.7.  That's not really much to write home about in later portions of the game, considering you usually max Orb last (I usually put a value point in just to have, but I always max Astral and Aura first). It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.   Force gives 130 mana.

It might be a nice little boost right when you get it, but I still think the effectiveness of Blink outweighs that heavily.  As far as the item slots, if you start with a Null and pooled tangos, you'll use the tangos and get Bottle, then Treads. So you're at Null, Bottle, Treads, TP Scroll. You have two slots left. Blink and another Null fills that until you can sell a Null for whatever you build next (Scythe, Aghs, Shivas), and that extra Null gives you 6 Int, plus other stats as well for a fraction of the cost of a Force.     It could still be as useful for initiation as a Blink, but nowhere near as useful for escaping. If the enemy team has Dust, if you try to Astral and Shadow Blade out, you're just going to get dusted and killed.  As opposed to Blink, where if you Astral and immediately blink into trees or over a cliff, you can get away much easier.    too much damage  10 damage is nothing. You can get 12 damage from 2 Null Talismans, which together only cost 940g.   Because against good players the invisibility from Shadow Blade is almost useless. And it costs more.   PL isn't the ricing, split pushing rat like the days of old though. You don't really want to spend the whole time farming any more.  PL is a fighter now. You should be fighting as soon as you get your diffusal. Doppelganger doesn't necessarily help you fight like Lance and Rush do. You can have Treads, Vanguard or Vlads, Diffusal by 20 minutes. If you max Lance and Rush, you're going to destroy the enemy team.    I know OD is in a pretty shitty spot right now with having a ~5% pick/ban rate for pros in the past 7 months, but it's one of my favorite heroes to play. Recently I had the idea of building Blink Dagger instead of Force Staff. I'm not going to say I invented it, but it isn't something I can remember seeing anyone else do.  Force Staff has been considered core on him for as long as I can remember. It gives you 10 Int and a bit of mobility on a 20 sec CD for 2250 gold. Dotabuff matches played this month with Force Staff: 828,013. Win rate: 45.77%  Compare this to blink dagger, widely considered one of the best items in the game for almost every hero. Same exact price as Force Staff, but much better mobility on only a 12 second CD. Plus it is a far more reliable initiation tool, as well as escape mechanism. If you Astral yourself, at max level, it is 4 seconds. Blink damage CD is only 3 seconds. You will be able to reset your blink cooldown while inside Astral and give yourself a far better chance of evading death than with the Force Staff. Dotabuff matches played this month with Blink Dagger: 26,988. Win rate: 56.90%  Obviously you can't go by dotabuff winrates for everything, but I'm wondering why nobody else does this? Especially considering this month more people picked up Shadow Blades on OD than a Blink Dagger. BlinkAstral is almost equivalent to Nightmare and Disruption as far as an initiation tool, and is great for saving teammates that also have Blink Daggers because of the cooldown reset.  Does anyone agree? Is there some piece of the puzzle I'm missing?   Also, what would make this hero viable in competitive play again? The consensus seems to be changing his Aghs upgrade. If you changed the Aghs upgrade to Pure damage, and maybe re-scaled it a little bit, would that be enough?   He's still a mid dominator against popular mid heroes in this meta. Take Shadow Fiend for example. Astral reduces an enemies total mana pool by 52/91/130/169. If you're able to continuously get Astrals off on the SF in lane, he's not going to have enough mana for Razes, and you'll be able to cs far easier, effectively shutting him down without the use of support rotations.  Thoughts?   I said I was agreeing with you. I think he's viable.  I'm saying as a general rule, there is a difference between pubstomping and pro competitive.    but that dopple is critical for farming.  It should be worth noting that the only reason Doppelganger is good for farming is that it can essentially work as a pseudo-blink. Purge was talking about this in a recent cast, I believe it was Starladder Secret v LC Game 2.  One of your illusions does 0 damage, the other only does 20%. If you're doing 100 damage, that means the Doppelganger illusions are only increasing your total damage by 20.   IMO you should max Rush and Lance first, keeping Doppelganger at level 1 to be used solely as an escape, unless you are under tons of pressure in which case you may need the reduced cooldown.   I agree with you, and see your edit, however keep in mind there is a big difference between pubstomping (even at high skill) and pro competitive.   I don't know how many people know this, but when the hero selection screen shows up (where you can scroll through all the heroes horizontally), if you type the letters of the hero name, it will auto scroll to that hero. So when it loads, if you type S-N it will go to Sniper and you can lock it in.  	117

    As the titles implies,  I made an agreement with a friend. Basically, he is not going to drink for a month if I don't smoke for a month.

That would be a fun what if, like what if Goku suddenly has an IQ of 1000 and can come up with better plans than "we need to hit this thing really hard"  Edit: he could beat Superman in that chili cook off posted earlier   This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers).   Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.  Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)  Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.  Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)  Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted)   Inb4 Comcast IS Hitler    Marvel   Greedo  shot first   I'm not your bud, pal   "Uno Dos tres cuatro Cinco Cinco seis" The Offspring.

One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands.

First of all forgive me for any grammatical mistakes as english is not my mother tongue.   So since years I've played with idea of becoming a pro gamer, to make a living from what i love and do since i'm a child.  Playing games. Now im 20 years old and life is a bitch these days.  I never really knew what i wanted to do later on. Parents and friends tell me that i should start a normal career like everybody else. But that always seemed kinda dull to me. I've been playing League for a not too long time now but recently i started to think that i could actually do this. Becoming a pro. Dedicating my whole life on one single thing to become one of the very best. The question that crosses my mind however is if that is actually a realistic and a worthwile goal.    I know that first of all i would need to get to Challenger to even get noticed by any of the bigger teams. Now I ask myself if anybody who puts enough work into it could achieve that. I know that there are people who are just naturally gifted and have a talent for it but do you really need that to become one of the very best? I wouldn't say i'm untalented but there are certainly a lot of people who are much more talented than me but they might have a worse work ethic. Also is it ridiculous to start a pro gaming career with 20 years of age? Am i already to late to start something that I've always dreamed of?   I know that these are a lot of rhetorical questions but i feel like i just need opinions from other people to confirm that i'm not out of my mind. The thing is i also have nothing to loose really. My social life is subpar as is my graduation.    So what do you guys think?   Amazing times for all People Who are in australia right now. I'm normally from Germany but now i get to see every game in the evening before going to bed. Thanks Based god.  	4
 love this!!   I would have gone with a warmer shade of pink, but otherwise, GORGEOUS! I love this look so much, and you are beautiful(:   You look great! Happy birthday(:   I was expecting a "You've sure got her back" type joke somewhere on here...   Well, happy cake day then!   The eyes look very nice(: I would add some color to your face (blush) and lips, and bring out those eyebrows a little more. You look great!   No.   You might want to post this to /r/motorcycles   I'm confused... Today is your cake day.   That's exactly what college is for. People that complain about a college degree not getting them a job went to college for the wrong reason. It is meant to enrich your mind, and in turn make you more skilled at your craft and hopefully more valuable to a workforce. Good for you(:   Damn, girl, you're talented!!   This is gold!   I had been on this subreddit for just under a month, and then one day I just wasn't motivated anymore. I realize that masturbating wasn't affecting my confidence or anything, I just decided that I wanted to stop. Now I can't get motivated again, and I thought if I heard some of your reasons why, I would find motivation in that.  Thanks for sharing!   You're not alone...   Hey, my area code is 972 as well! I don't know why I found that so interesting...   WOOW!! You look gorgeous! I'm officially obsessed with this look!   Do you mean is?   [Just gonna put this here...](http://i.imgflip.com/1bh6.jpg)   May I just say, you are gorgeous!!   No joke.   My first musical in high school was Grease. Couldn't agree more.   Love Never Dies.  No way in Hell.   Haha, your welcome, I suppose. Honestly, the story is so amazing, I wouldn't normally care. The only reason I point it out is it was actually a vocabulary word of mine (being in high school and whatnot) and couldn't resist.  Thank you so much for your contribution to reddit. Your posts will never be forgotten.   Oh. My. Lord.  My heart just wept...   This is amazing, and I appreciate what you've done here. I am so sorry for this, but I couldn't help myself...  ... you're trapped between the split in the ice *floes*.   Anyone else start suddenly playing the soundtrack of *West Side Story* in their head?   Did you have another job while performing this job? If so, what was it? and if you didn't, what would you do while on your period?   Anyone else find this incredibly sad?   Oh... Haha, I hummed this to myself and though, "well, I don't recognize this tune from anywhere..."   Wow, that is a very good look on you!! I'm usually not a fan of bangs, but your face was made for them(:   Maybe, but that's just not how I look at it. I don't think He *did* it for me, He just helped me feel confident and strong enough to push myself to my fullest ability. But I completely understand why one might look at it that way. I just believe that there have been so many people that have helped me get to where I am today, and He had a portion too. Thank you for your support. It gave me a smile.   Well, thank you, and I understand how you would think that. I think I wouldn't have had the strength to push myself so much if it had not been for His mental support.  But still, thank you very much(:   Thank you so much(:   fixed post... http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1cre0b/what_the_power_of_prayer_did_for_me_this_week/   Hi /r/Christianity,  I am a fifteen year old girl who is on her high school's drill/dance team. This week, we had tryouts for next years team to see who would make varsity and who would make Starlettes (JV). I am just about to graduate from my freshman year (so in tryouts, I am considered a sophomore), and since the beginning of this year, I have been a Starlette. I knew I was a better dancer and deserved to be on varsity, but I waited patiently for my turn to move up. Once tryouts came along I knew it was my time to shine.  But still, I couldn't do it alone. I knew that even when I had put forward my best effort, I still hadn't moved up during the year like some other girls had. I was confused and scared and had no idea what I was doing wrong. So I prayed. I have been praying for about a month that I would make the varsity team, with the help of St. Vitus (the patron saint of dancers) and St. Genesius (the patron saint of performers). God gave me the strength to work my hardest in the upcoming weeks to tryouts. Well, yesterday was tryouts, and I made varsity! Yay!! And not only that, but as a sophomore, I made the highest score out of the whole team, plus a $100 scholarship. WOAH! My director told me that the judges were wondering why I hadn't tried out for officer (the highest authority position), yet I hadn't even been on varsity yet.  **Yes, I do acknowledge that it was my hard work that paid off, but I got the moral support from God. It wasn't like He told me *Okay, now do 100 jackknives and then sit in you splits for a minute, each side.* That was me. But I think He helped guide my patience and my focus. He inspired me to work toward this goal that I ultimately received.**  This is surreal. I honestly cannot believe I am so extremely lucky that such a thing could happen to me. This is almost unheard of, and I am so unbelievably happy. To add on, just two years ago I was fighting an extreme depression and battling thoughts of suicide, but God saved me. If I had given up then, I wouldn't be here now. Thanks to His guidance, I have never been happier. My life is going amazing, and I am so thankful to Him. Just ask, and He will do anything for you. You are His son/daughter and He could not love you more.  **TL;DR:** Trust in God. He will give you the strength to carry on, even when it gets tough.   I'm sorry. I guess I did misunderstand. I just got very defensive when I thought you were undermining my mistake. My apologies for lashing out.   Excuse me?  Being a part of a drill team is an extreme dedication that is hard to explain. You spend every hour of every day trying to be perfect, a goal that can never be truly reached. It takes so much concentration and strength. I put everything I have into this, but I couldn't do it alone. I have no idea what this has to do with me being a young person. Sure, there are many other things that are much more severe that the Lord has helped people with, but this is what is important to me. I am extremely embarrassed that you would suggest that people would "rip it apart." I'm sorry, but you made me feel like my accomplishment amounts to nothing.  Think before you speak.   Dem lashes... aw my gawd.   Congratulations! You look beautiful!!   Wow, that's amazing!   Hello lovelies,  I normally don't do my waterline, but when I do (for my drill team), it is a hot mess. (FYI: I use the twistable pencils aka crayon eyeliners.) Every single time it smudges everywhere. No matter what I do, it ends up all over my lower lids and looks horrible. Can anyone advise me on what to do? I'm sick of wiping my eyes to get all the ugly blackness off of them):  Thank you!   Thank you!   Can someone tell me what he said? It was deleted.   Yup.   That poor girl...   Ah. Sorry about that.   Why is this on this subreddit?   Same here. I was writing the word "label" trying to spell it as "lable." I could *not* figure out what I had done wrong. I also have gotten stuck over "santa" vs. "satan" quite a few times. That one is a bit more concerning.   Thank you for this!! I am currently enrolled in a Catholic high school, and I have much respect for the Islam faith. I understand that we have our differences and my beliefs differ from that of yours, but we are very similar and just want to love God. I'm so sorry that you're beautiful faith has been associated with such horrible acts that you and the vast majority your fellow Muslims are not responsible for.  Go in peace and love.   That's definitely enough proof for me. Dammit reddit...  Thank you!   Maybe Kids Bop is the Canadian KidzBop?   Nope. Sexy zebras. When I was in eighth grade, I had a friend so used this phrase instead of "cool" or "interesting." Now it's my username.   What was it like when you saw yourself for the first time all doctored up? Was it a relief, or strange to see a new face? On that note, how similar do you look in comparison to before that son of a bitch decided to fuck with the wrong woman?  Thanks so much for answer *so. many. questions.* you truly are amazing and I wish you an amazing life here on out.   Yeah, I've heard that they can be perceived as gay, but honestly, I think they are amazingly attractive. They hug and show *just* enough.   Relevant username?   Boxer briefs are so goddamn sexy.   I also cleanse my face in the shower. It's so convenient and refreshing!   That's the hardest habit to break, and you're not alone. I believe that it's okay to break once in a very few time. Just remind let this be a release, not a relapse.   I'm currently selling that on eBay. Price went from under a dollar to over ten dollars.   If it makes you feel better, most women think men should have to ball sacks. We only pretend to know what's going on, and it's easier to pretend because the male anatomy is somewhat less complex than a woman's.   Yeah, I use the ultra thin liners for when I have a super in and have to wear a thong. (Note:  I'm on a dance team.)   Yeah, when it first kicks in, you know. It's easier to tell when you get it when you wake up, but when it's during the day, personally, my thighs get sweaty and my uterus feels like it's being used for a scratching post.   I definitely get turned on more easily. The right song can send me into a dizzy fit on sexual tension.   You could say cool, I would say annoying... Haha, Glad I could help!    That's fairly accurate.   For me personally, I've only had mine for about four years, but I have adjusted to knowing how my period works and understand it better. I am more of an instinctual person and have paid very close attention to how my body works.   I'm not going to lie, I don't know / haven't study much about what exactly is going on down there. I do know that the first few days is a lot of what seems like tissue and blood. The rest of the time is still the tissue, but not so much blood. To get a more accurate description, you would have to ask a professional, but I know for me, I never have only blood, but I do sometimes have only uterine wall.  EDIT: (Currently on my period) You can have just blood.   Yeah, I hate waking up to a dirty pad. I usually wear a pad in addition, but alone, it grosses me out too much. I never use a tampon for more than twelve hours. I usually switch them three times a day (partially because I'm too lazy to do it more): when I wake up, in the afternoon, and before I go to sleep.   Fenêtre. It means "window" in French, but I think it sounds beautiful.   Not at all. I actually find you quite beautiful.   I already posted this comment, but I'll just copy and paste it down here for you.  Too be honest, it can be hard to tell sometimes. For most women, you wake up in the morning and their tampon is still white, so they can move on. For other women like me, the bleeding stops, but the uterine wall still sheds for a few more days. In the end, a woman's uterus feels fresh and renewed, and your body kind of tells you when it's over.  To sum up, womanly instinct.   Damn you...   Too be honest, it can be hard to tell sometimes. For most women, you wake up in the morning and their tampon is still white, so they can move on. For other women like me, the bleeding stops, but the uterine wall still sheds for a few more days. In the end, a woman's uterus feels fresh and renewed, and your body kind of tells you when it's over.  To sum up, womanly instinct.   The bloating going away. Every period I get, my belly puffs up like a bubble. When it's done, I realize I have a great figure. It is a *huge* confidence boost.  I also have to add that you feel a lot less gross and, well, *are* a lot less gross when your uterine wall isn't coming out in bloody patches. I would add the cramps finally going away, but mine usually only stick around for the first half.  **TL;DR** You don't feel disgusted by your own body once it's over.   Daaayum.   I would've posted something in French just to see if anyone noticed...   You know, there's a reason we have subreddits like /r/confession ... If this were real, it wouldn't be posted here.   I took it in today and decided to let then go ahead and replace the hard drive. It was in really bad condition, and none of the files could be read. Thanks again for all your help(:   Thank you so much!! It really helps to understand the situation. I tried to repair it, but the b-tree problem arose and claimed that the disk could not be repaired. When I pressed my ear to the bottom of my laptop, I heard ten clicks, followed by two, four second vibrating noises. I assume that's he clicking sounds you were referring to, so I shut it off for the night.  Thanks again!!!!   I was using my laptop last night to listen to music, and I realized the music had become slow and choppy, so I decided to turn it off. When I turned it back on, it took a very long time and it popped up with a screen I had never seen before. (I'm don't really have an adept knowledge in computers, so please bear with my somewhat vague explanations.) It allowed me to navigate to something that told me I have an "invalid B-tree node size." I cannot access my files or desktop now. What does this mean? Can I fix it, and if so, how?   I was going to question the date, but then I realized that I'm just an American... *facepalm*   Yes, but I have come across people that have thought less of me when I have told them I am Catholic. In Catholic high schools, there is a large group of people who are atheist and I tend to socialize with the people a lot, just by chance. When they found out that I was not an atheist, some avoided me or just appreciated my company less. I guess it's just a level I can't relate to, but I still worry that they think I'm a nut or something.  I'm not crazy, I just think I have a loving Father waiting for me on the other side.   When I saw the title, I was not expecting gore makeup... Nonetheless, she did an amazing job!   **DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW THAT WE GAVE YOU THE EIFFEL TOWER!!**   Can I have this? This pack looks AMAZING!   Not at a time like then, when they take over our subreddit...   **TO /R/FRANCE!!**      **NON!! C'EST PENIBLE!!**  **THAT'S THE ONLY FUCKING FRENCH I KNOW TO INSULT YOU WITH YA DAMN COMMIE!! DON'T MAKE US TAKE BACK THE EIFFEL TOWER!!**   **NOT TO MENTION THE EIFFEL FUCKING TOWER**   Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!  I know that it can sound contradictory, but moisture is an oily face's best friend! When your skin becomes dehydrated, it overcompensates for the lack of water with *oil*. Benzoyl peroxide can also have a drying effect on the skin, so you can use it, but with moderation. Drinking more water can also help.  As an oily girl too, I hope this helps!!  P.S. **MOISTURIZE!!** 3  	90
 There was a specific judge who envisioned the power of electronic communication in the future (today) and ruled to break up ma bell (AT T). Also huge was the TeleCommunication Act of 1996 (where Bill Clinton and Congress gave media corporations the digital spectrum free of charge).  You should look for docs on Comm history or Comm law.

Phantom Hourglass 8. Minish Cap 9. 4 Swords 10. Oracle of Seasons 11. Oracle of Ages 12. Links Awakening  13. Legend of Zelda  14. Skyward Swords     Personally i liked twilight princess a lot better. Skyward sword was just bleh. I was super disappointed by the game overall. I think it was annoying having to buy everything and constantly fly around back to the main city. I just came out of the game not liking it at all. All the other ones ive played a million times, that one i probably wont even finish. What I really just don't like is the motion controls. I feel like i'm flailing around. I don't have a wii u yet, but I was hoping that they would mostly do away with that, or at least make an optional control to no have to swing remotes around.   I didn't like the clutch on the new bike. I didn't like the riding position.  Just my opinion. It didn't feel faster,  it felt sloppy.    Tbh i have ridden both ninja 250 and ninja 300 and i far prefer the 250. It was an excellent starter before i moved on to the 600    Yeah i agree. Unfamiliar bikes make it worse. And it would be nice to have more then jeans. Which spurred me to buy some riding pants today.    Yeah i wouldn't bother again.  Not without a few one an one with good instruction. The group was mostly people who have been on track before. It was intimidating. All i went for was to demo some new bikes    Yeah. Hence i didnt call it a track day. Just first experience with a bike on the track. Not sure if go again. Not without proper instruction and my own bike.    It was a Kawasaki demo ride you could ride any bike there on the track with a large group.  I'm in canada not the US    Ugh i dont know if i feel like i wouldn't want to again. I was so afraid. I feel embarrassed.    Wonder who won    They had 2 to heavy for me... I'm like a 5'3 female and that bike was just too much bike    Just the track to be honest. The bikes were fine. It was super twisty... Not used to that and i felt nervous of the eyes on me and other riders    Went out on a ZX10R and then a 300r and both times i was just way too uncomfortable. I felt so nervous. Both times. Just destroyed my confidence. I got back on mine to ride home and felt awful on it. Like my confidence is just shattered.   	16

 The last doctor I talked to (pain specialist) was like "why do you want a diagnosis, would that make you feel better?" and "Sorry I don't have some kind of magical power that can fix you." I'm not even kidding. She really said that. And she is a university doctor!           1. It would make me feel better if I were able to get proper treatment for the ailments that I have.        2. I DIDN'T COME HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FAIRY GODMOTHER! I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU WERE A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE!         And that is just the most recent doctors visit I have had the displeasure of experiencing. But it is a pretty good representation of the past dozen or so. All I want is for them to treat me like my illness is not somehow something I am managing to do to myself because I am a shitty person and actually treat me. It would also be wonderful if they even mildly respected my knowledge of my own body.        I don't even know what to do now. I just can't get through to any of them. I told my pcp recently that I think I have POTS and she completely ignored me and continued asking me the same shit she does every time I see her and then telling me my diet is shitty and I need to exercise. Even though I am not even overweight. She also seems to be convinced that I have some kind of std despite the fact that I have had the same monogamous partner for a year and a half and haven't even had sex with him since I left home for treatment months ago. I'm also clearly not running around shooting up meth.         Okay now I am just bitching. My point was that since doctors don't actually like to listen to people maybe I can get their attention with medical words and bright colors. So I made a very child like flow chart (it was going to look nicer but I was in a hurry). All my symptoms and traits are in green and connected to the corresponding condition. All of the conditions are related to the main one which is ehlers-danlos syndrome. One of my doctors knows I have it but doesn't give a shit to get me diagnosed.        I figured if anything it puts things into perspective a bit.         It's kinda dumb but I do plan to make a rheumatologist look at it.        [Here is said masterpiece.](http://imgur.com/q6RpbJx)        Don't laugh at me. Or do. Haha. I don't really care about anything anymore.       EDIT: For the record I did see a psychiatrist at the University pain clinic and he seemed impress by how reasonable I am about everything and that I am actually knowledgeable about medacine and my own body. He thought all the ideas I had about treatment were good ones. So it's not like I'm not communicating with my doctors poorly.          I am also at the point with my health that I would be relieved if it were some kind of horribly aggressive cancer. At least I would know the rest of my life would involve treatment rather than being told to fuck off.   That's who I have been seeing. The first one told me that my conditions are too bad for him to even know where to begin treating me so he just wasn't going to try. The ones I have been seeing are the university specialists and now they aren't bothering to try anything either.    They won't even fucking give me tramadol.    No problem.   Back and forth between Seattle and Boise. Or near them anyway.    Yeah I'm trying to take control of my health but I still need to have doctors that will take me seriously. I am thinking about drawing up a color coded flow chart for them to look at. Haha.   It's fine.      And yeah I'm basically ready to take something even if it does have its downsides. The pain I have every day would be fine if it just lasted a week. I have a really high pain tolerance and if I had to withdraw from a drug I could deal with two weeks of horror. My pain is a consistent 6-7 pretty all the time which really isn't that bad. Except for the all the time part. I just want to be a normal person and do people things. I'm 23 and feel like I'm 63+ health problems. It's not okay anymore.    Ehlers-danlos. So I also have osteoarthritis and a bunch of shit that is already listed in the post.      I'm in the US.   My pain is caused by a connective tissue disorder. Which is listed. I am not entirely sure what kind of depression or mental illness I have but I know that *before* I was on the cymbalta I was mentally unstable. Now I am fairly stable. Had I not started taking it there is a good chance I would be dead by now. I was already screaming and crying and punching myself in the head every night before I was on it. Which is why I fucking take it.   So are fingernails but thats not exactly what Im getting at. But thanks for downplaying my most severe life obstacles.    Oh no, I wont be getting off the cymbalta. Its the only good thing in my life.   My CRPS isn't my main problem. I got that diagnosis from a pediatric rheumatologist 7 years ago. My main issue is my widespread soreness in my muscles and joints. Which there is basically no treatment for. So I am pretty much fucked.         My emotional distress would not be an issue if I could physically function in a way that resembles normalty beyond getting off the couch to pee. Because that's almost all I am capable of.    Maybe. But I don't want curls.   Thanks.   Um. I know that I got on the drugs in the first place because my depression was unmanageable and I was crying and screaming every night about nothing. It's not like I have the blues. I have a fairly severe mental disorder.   I just checked and the information about my thyroid is in my response.        I definitely wont be getting off the drugs that keep my chemically balanced enough to stop me from tearing all my hair out and running into traffic. Thats pretty non negotiable. Mental health is important.   Didn't I? My thyroid levels are sub-clinical. I see an endocrinologist for it and its stable enough. It just worsens my anxiety and makes it difficult to stay hydrated. Its not the source of my pain.   My mom used to tell me I was the smartest and prettiest and blah blah when I was a kid all the time. Apparently I would respond with "No I'm not." I think she thought I had horrible self esteem issues. Which could have been the case. But I'm pretty sure I was just being realistic.      Not sure why it went like that with me. From what I am reading your reaction is the norm.   Seriously. My sister used to call me fat all the time when I was a kid. Then puberty happened and I developed a delightful case of anorexia that lasted a couple years. But justice was served because she got pregnant around the same time and never lost the baby weight entirely.    I'm not really sure what you're getting at. Are you saying my pain isn't that bad?      I'm 23, about 130 lbs, and my diet isn't perfect but I don't eat much sugar, I eat a lot of veggies, I try to eat a variety of grains, and I eat meat but not a ton. But I don't actually eat very much because I cant often stand long enough to cook for myself. Some days I just have a bowl of oatmeal because its easy. Today I had a sandwich someone gave me. I also try to eat plenty salt lately because its hard for me to stay hydrated if I don't.   Yeah I need some braces for my wrists and so on. Which I will discuss with my doctors tomorrow. I also am interested in possibly some elbow crutches or something of the like. And I don't know who I would have to see but I definitely want to be monitored to avoid addiction. My sister is a junkie and it doesn't look fun. So I'm not looking to ruin my life. I just want to have one.   Actually my CRPS is not that bad. Which I am thankful for. I get really brief flairs that don't hurt that bad usually in my feet but also in my hands and face.     Oh, I also fit the criteria for fibromyalgia. But I contribute that mostly to the EDS.      Most of my pain is actually from the Osteoarthritis and EDS. My joints are pretty worn down but one of the biggest issues is that because my tendons and ligaments wont do their jobs my muscles are constantly working overtime. So I basically feel like I worked out super hard for several hours yesterday. Every day. I also just tend to get random sharp aches like you get when you're sick. If you know what I mean. But mostly I hurt around my tendons and stuff, the larger ones especially like inside my hips (where it connects to my groin), my neck, the insides of my elbows, behind my knees, and so on.       I am not being treated for my thyroid as it is currently sub-clinical. It mostly just makes it hard to stay hydrated and makes my anxiety worse. I'm not underweight or anything.       I was on fluoexetine for a couple years as a teen. It makes my anxiety worse (so does trazadone). For some reason things tend to work the opposite on me sometimes. Like the allergy meds that are supposed to give you energy make me sleep.      The cymbalta only makes it a tiny bit worse and I really like that it helps me hold on to my sanity a little so I will be staying on that. Other than that I am only taking vitamin D4 and C as well as melatonin to sleep and the occasional Tylenol or ibuprofin which generally do nothing except sometimes help my fevers.          At the moment I am not sure how willing I am to try any other kind of medication for depression or anxiety. I have a lose grip on my mental state and I cant afford to lose that when my physical self is in such poor condition. I wont get into my depression right now but when I'm not on my cymbalta or if I take the wrong thing its not pretty.      Like you said the narcotics wont help with the POTS or AD. Whats weird though is that they do help with some of the symptoms. The couple times I have had narcotics in the last six months I didnt get any fevers and when I would stand up I almost never got dizzy and lost my vision like I usually do. But other symptoms stayed like when my blood pools while I shower and it made it harder to pee than usual. Its like when I am not in crippling pain my brain can actually focus and maintain my body temperature and blood pressure better. Or something. Thats my uneducated guess. Ha.       When I was given tramadol I think It was 100 mg every 6 hours. It always wore off in 4 though so I was back in pain for a couple hours until my next dose.        I guess I kind of understand why doctors don't get how much pain I am in. I don't even know how it could be this bad. The times I have had pain pills I would stop taking them for a day or so because I would think "oh its not that bad, I don't need these I can just buck up and function fine without them". And then I get knocked on my ass again by how much everything hurts. This whole thing is so stupid. I am constantly exhausted of myself. I don't expect everything to feel better, I just want to be okay enough that I can live some of my life. I haven't lived long enough for this to be how the rest of it goes. I cant even put on a shirt sometimes. And then I have people telling me I should do yoga or some stupid shit. As if I'm just not motivated enough. Its not like I am too lazy to take a shower today. I just fucking cant.   I am just wondering if it can be done as waved as opposed to curls? Like instead of it getting wrapped around a curler is there like a double curler where the hair does a figure 8 around two of them? Is this a thing?   Hi. So I have been wondering if hair can be permed in a way that instead of being curly it can be wavy. Like when you wear two french braids all night and the next day it has nice tight waves. I don't really know how perms work so this is probably a long shot.      The other issue is that I don't even know if it would work for me. My hair is about three feet long and I have been dying it forever. Its actually surprisingly healthy though because genetics and the fact that I don't keep up with dying it that well because its close enough to my natural color. I also bleached it for the first time ever after years of dying it black but there was no noticeable breakage. It bleached great at the roots. The rest not so much so its sort of doing a stripey ombre thing. Which is fine.        My hair is just sooooo straight. All I want is for it to look big but I look dumb in curls.                 [This would be nice.](http://cdn.hairstylestars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Long-Wavy-Hairstyles.jpg) Or maybe even a little tighter.   Ah. Yeah its just a basic hardware store.   I am a 23 year old female and it made sense to me too. I'm really not even sure why its supposed to be funny. Looks like I should go to the doctor and make sure I'm not actually a dad.   Well I am wondering what the second line therapy is then? I have taken all of the OTC options. I am on Cymbalta, which makes my pain worse but keeps me sane. Amitriptyline made me depressed. With Gabapentin it made me so loopy that I couldn't even taper up to the regular beginning dose and it also gave me really bad myoclonus so I stopped trying. So what is the next option?      Also my chronic pain is not ill defined. I failed to include my conditions because its hard to remember them all. I will edit that in.   I like my men and my women to have their natural armpit hair.   I really is sexy and feminine.   I'm not sure what you mean by rewards. A couple years ago I quit shaving everything except for my bikini line and directly around my vulva. Nothing has really changed, I don't feel less rewarded. The only real difference is that I am more comfortable and feel sexier.      I am not arguing or anything. I am just curious as to what the benefits are to shaving.   Same. It seems all the ladies on here that don't shave are saying its because of the discomfort. Which for me is a factor. But the main reason I don't shave my pits is because I think it is sexy and womanly. My armpit hair looks pretty good to me, I also like to bleach it because I hear blondes have more fun but I'm not that committed. I also just don't understand why I am supposed to shave them. Its such an odd social standard that that women aren't supposed to have body hair. How is it more feminine? Can someone explain this to me with a real answer? I may have to make an askreddit post. Which I'm sure will go over badly.   Hello, chronic pain sufferer here. I am 23 and have a crappy number of health problems. They have always been an issue but for a long time I kind of just thought I was lazy or bad at taking care of myself, but it turns out that is not the case. About ten months ago my pain, fatigue, and other symptoms got significantly worse.     That is when my life stopped. I left my job, dogs, home that I share with my boyfriend, and basically my entire life and came 2000 miles back to where I am from so I could seek medical treatment and be supported by family. All I want is to get better and go back to work and my relationship. Now it looks like I will have to go on disability.     The issue I am trying to get at is that I am having a hard time getting my doctors to take me seriously. I have two pain specialists, one I will be seeing tomorrow as well as a psychiatrist at the same pain clinic, and I also have a GP. The specialists are great and seem to care but they also don't seem to think my pain is as severe as it is. My GP seems to think I am on heroin or something. She treats me like everyone else that thinks I just don't know how to take care of myself does.      What I am getting at (sorry, ranting a bit, brain fog) is that I have tried every non narcotic medication I know of besides Lyrica and none of it helps. I would rather not take narcotics but if it means being able to go to the store AND shower in the same day then I will gladly go for it. I was given tramadol briefly and it was great. I know it is still addictive and all that but it helped enough of my pain that I could actually take care of myself enough to feel like my life was worth living. Another great thing about it is that it didn't get me high like opiates do (or at all). Which is awesome because I don't want to be high.      I just don't know what to do because I'm doing about everything I can to get better but doctors don't seem to trust me or take me seriously enough to help. I don't think that medication will solve everything, but if I had them I could go to physical therapy, be more active in trying to fix my health, and so on.       I'm hoping someone might have some insight on my situation. I know there are a lot of liability issues doctors have to worry about, but maybe there are other factors and reasons I don't know about? How do you normally go about pain management? Why cant my doctors take me seriously?         Sorry for all the text, I meant for it to be much shorter but my thoughts aren't very linear at the moment.               And one more quick question. Why cant I find fevers listed as a symptom for autonomic dysfunction? I know the autonomic nervous system regulates body temperature. I know I have autonomic dysfunction. And I know I have low grade fevers off and on every day. Am I missing something? Is that not what my fevers are from?            EDIT: I guess I should add my conditions. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, TMJ, Hyperthyroid, Early Onset Osteoarthritis, Depression, Anxiety, Autonomic Dysfunction, POTS, and last but not least (the source of most of my problems as well as the one that took the longest to figure out) Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type.        That's everything I have been diagnosed with so far as long as I'm not forgetting anything.   I just looked it up. That's like the prettiest one. So many more neat pictures.    I was already only on 100 mg a couple times a day which is less than the starting dose anyway. So I'm sure it's fine that I stopped taking it. Especially considering it is a seizure medication that is giving me bad side effects, I imagine it's better I be off it sooner than later. I haven't been taking enough to need to taper off so it's all good.    Well your pain is very real and a lot of us had to realize that we weren't just being sissys. I am 23 also and have found a ton of comfort in online communities, primarily this one. So you have us now and we know exactly what you are going through.        On the subject of the whole yeast infection thing, which may not apply to you seeing as it is chronic. Which could mean that's not even what it is. But whenever I get one (which happens whenever I use the wrong soap/laundry detergent, take antibiotics, or swim in a lake, so often enough) I peel a clove of garlic and use it as a suppository. It is the best remedy I have found for it. I know it sounds gross and hippie but it is the best for me.       But anyway,  if you need someone to talk to feel free to PM me.    :)    I'm actually kind of pissed off at them. No, I am pissed off at them. People are idiots. Do they not understand what CHRONIC means? It means constant pain. All the time. Every day. Fuck them. I wish I could talk to them. I really do. If I could just magically call them and have a conversation I would absolutely do that. They have no idea about how much pain effects so many people. I mean I'm sure they know. But as soon as they know someone with it they assume it must not be that bad just because they sprained their ankle once.      Sorry, I'm kinda ranting. It just pisses me off. Don't let them get to you. You know how real your pain is. I know how real your pain is. We don't need that shit. Don't let their ignorance make your day worse. And don't forget how strong you are for living your life despite what your body puts you through.    I do it really bad in my sleep also as it generally only happens when I am relaxed. I think that the normal falling asleep jerk is actually a different thing though. That happens when your body starts relaxing quickly and your brain interprets it as falling so your whole body jumps. Or something like that. But a lot of people have little jerks and twitches while they sleep. My best friend got mad at me because I slept in her bed and kept her awake all night. Haha.   Feel free to x-post it if you like.    Wow, that's crazy.    I like it. It's fun and exciting. The mystery about it is fun. My boyfriend and I were so bad at having sex with each other at first. Learning how to get in sync was fun. Now we have it down to a science.    I live there too and it drives me crazy.   That's awesome.    I'm not supposed to talk about it.    It's pretty amazing. That was the first one I found that prompted me to find more.       Awesome. I will find your Facebook page then.   Yeah I figure I will find the right doctor eventually. Sooner than later would be ideal. It will be much easier once I am staying with my mom because she will keep me motivated and take me everywhere. Once I do find a good doctor and get disability I will just have to cross my fingers and hope that once I go back home my doctor there will be willing to continue whatever treatment I am getting. Having a disability is so convoluted.          And thanks. Maybe I will look into the modeling stuff when I get home. I still don't really know if my appearance is still up to par. I am mostly concerned with my skin but I guess that is what photoshop is for. Haha. I really like being naked and posing nude, my boyfriend on the other hand feels a little differently about the subject. So that's a little bit of an issue but I don't think it will be too problematic. As long as the photographers are legit which I'm sure is generally a non issue if they are contracted by SG.        I really appreciate your advice. Especially with the idea of modeling again. I wonder if maybe we could stay in contact a bit. It would be great to have someone with EDS to talk to sometimes. Especially seeing as you're sort of my kind of people.    How quick people are to be confrontational and take sides. People behave so differently in the big subs than they do in smaller ones. It makes behavior that would never be acceptable in a regular online setting become suddenly okay.        I like askreddit because there is a lot of neat and funny content and I love reading interesting stories people have from their lives that I would otherwise get to know about.  But it can get ugly fast and it happens all too often. The littlest things are unacceptable it's silly. Like if you include a 'haha' in your comment there is a good chance you will get downvoted. There is just a strange superiority complex among the familiar ask redditors. I once had a bunch of downvotes because my comment had a typo/grammar mistake. It makes you worried that you have to be careful if you want to be part of the discussion.      On that note I'm not going to proof read this before I hit submit.    It hurts when I wipe.   Yes. Not often, but it's normal.    Their use of the English language. I have heard a disturbing number of people say "conversate" in place of converse. It makes my IQ hurt.      On a side note I also hate when people even say converse. Some say it naturally but I feel like a lot of them are just trying to sound smart. Though I may just be slightly delusional.    Exactly. They would end up creating all the technology we would need to do all of our regular functioning for us. I suppose I am picturing the people in Wall-e more so than Idiocracy.   Me too. I highly recommend using Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa powder to make hot chocolate and add a little bit of orange extract. It is seriously the best hot cocoa I have ever had. I am kinda obsessed with it.   My wrinkles smell weird.    Not to mention the people that "are just being honest" and "telling the truth" think that somehow being truthful justifies being a hurtful piece of shit.    It's weird because they have seen me cry when I start talking about how all I want to do is just going back to work. I have pain specialists but they don't drug test because they don't prescribe anything, they just tell my pcp if they think I should be prescribed anything. I wish they would drug test me. I am going to find another doctor a state over where I will be for a while so I will offer to take drug tests. I did learn that if I bring my mom with me to the doctor they will take me seriously and trust me with narcotics. (My mom took me to an urgent care because she couldn't deal with me being in so much pain constantly and they gave me tramadol). Hopefully when I establish a new doctor and bring my mom with it will work out. I also have an appointment with my pain specialist on Monday as well as a psychiatrist with the pain clinic. I'm worried they will still think I shouldn't be on the stuff that works and allows me to function at least a little. At this point I don't expect to be able to go back to work but I at least expect to be treated well enough as a patient that I can get decent enough management that I can go to the store and take a shower in the same day.       I really don't get how everyone else is able to get treatment but me. Maybe that's not very accurate but it's how I feel. I am always completely honest with them. I tell them that I want less pain but I also want to be careful with meds because my dad is an alcoholic and my sister is on heroin. While my dad is very functional the last thing I want is to end up like my sister. I am seeking drugs so I can have a life, not ruin it. I get that the regulations on narcotics are pretty serious and I know they don't want to give those meds to someone my age but shit. It sucks being 23 and feeling like my life is over. I am already going to have to go on disability and I already left my job and home where my partner is to come 2000 miles to get better.        My pain makes my depression so much worse. And the fucking brain fog. I can't even think straight. I'm so irritable all the time. My jaw hurts so bad sometimes that I end up on a slimfast diet for weeks at a time. Half the time I don't even want to eat because it all puts me in a weird mood. I can't wait to see the psychiatrist. I think they will understand better. I hope.        And about the modeling thing. Part of me really wants to but I am not nearly as photogenic as I used to be. I am also not as fit and my skin is bad now. So even if I could become a suicide girl I probably wouldn't be a very successful one. My boobs are totally saggy. Hahaha.   They assume I am a drug seeker before I even open my mouth.    Thanks.   Also, I was just thinking, if the straightforward thing doesn't work there is a 'final straw' option. When they keep trying to hassle drugs from you  just say "The medication I have I need for myself and I am not allowed to share them, but if you would like to go get some of your own I would gladly break your nose for you. At least I would be kind enough to know that you will need them and not ask for any."        That should effectively get someone to fuck off.   Exactly. And in most cases they are just curious. For me the worst is when they just want to give me advice like they know what I am going through because they pulled a muscle once. I hate being treated like I'm just not taking care of myself. As if I would be in this much pain and not be doing everything in my power to fix it. Like if I were to just exercise it would fix everything (except how that is what caused the problem). But apparently I am just lazy.   I creeped your history, SG, very cool. I thought about modeling with them when I was 18 and cuter. That sucks that you are open about it publicly and people give you shit. And seriously, a grill... it's 2015. Marilyn Manson and Flavor Flave rocked it back in the day but that shit really isn't cute anymore. Obviously people like that aren't to be taken seriously.        Keep doing your thing and the people that just want to be confrontational can go fuck themselves. It doesn't even mean anything, no matter what you do someone will find something they think you are doing wrong. It's unfortunate that in this case they are poking at an issue that is already a struggle in your life that causes you hardship. I really find that the best way to deal with it is to be blunt, straightforward, and honest. If they are persistent even after that cut them off and don't even tolerate it. It's not worth it for you. And I know it's hard to burn bridges rather than pleasing everyone but it's a quality of life thing just like the medication you have to take every day.          Now that I saw a couple of your pictures I actually have a question for you. How did you get your doctors to take you seriously and trust you enough to give you narcotics? I am a young, small, and "alternative" (or fucking whatever people call it but I hate that term) female also. I have several conditions that cause chronic pain (I'm about to be diagnosed with EDS as well) and my doctors are all pretty familiar with what is going on with me. Yet despite being aware of the fact that I can't even dress myself some days they don't think I need narcotics. The only non narcotic I haven't tried for my pain is Lyrica, aside from acupuncture and other alternative medicines. What sucks is that I don't even need anything too strong. Even Tylenol 3 will make me well enough to go to the grocery store. All I really want though is tramadol because it doesn't get me high. I know I'm young but jesus. I just want my life back at least a little. Why can't doctors take me seriously?  My pain specialists are alright but my pcp  totally thinks I am on heroin for some reason. Most regular family practice doctors seem to and most specialists don't take me seriously.       I guess I am just wondering if you have any tips or insight. I have been wanting to talk to someone else that has tattoos and weird hair colors and so on that also has chronic pain for a while now.       On a side note, why are there so many cute girls with EDS? Haha.   Yeah I have an appointment with her on Tuesday. But I'm just going to stop taking them.      For some reason things effect me the opposite of how they should. Prozac and Trazadone make me anxious. Day time allergy meds make me sleep. Now gabapentin. I take cymbalta too and it makes my pain worse but it keeps me sane so I stay on it. I am a bit of a medical conundrum, you would think doctors would take interest and want to try and treat me but instead they just think I am dumb and full of shit.      ^_^   Are you near a university with a pain clinic? That's what I go to. They are kinda weird as they don't order any test or write any prescriptions themselves, instead they basically just tell my primary to do it. It's strange and usually it would piss me off, but my appointments with them last an hour long and they ACTUALLY listen and care and try and solve the problem. Which is awesome.        I don't know if they are necessarily like that at other universities but if they are it's probably worth it.   I have been getting them for a while now and they keep getting worse. At first it was just in my legs and stomach, now it's everywhere and ever since it started happening in my shoulders and stuff (near my head) I am more stressed out about it. It happens the worst when I am relaxing. I seriously look like I have tourettes or something.       I had done some research before and saw a couple things that might make sense but I started to look it up again today and I realized it might be from my gabapentin. I have been on it for a month or two but I am only on 100 mg three times a day. I am trying to work up to the 350mg dose but they make me way too loopy. Even if I take it at bedtime when I wake up to pee I end up stumbling down the hallway.       Anyway, I was looking for articles about gabapentin causing twitching and such and I read something one person said. It was something like "My doctor said it was a good thing I came in when it first started happening because they could have become permanent." So that sounds great. I know I shouldn't be worried just because of something one person said and I couldn't find anything else about it. But still.         I called my doctor but she's not in today. I think I will just stop taking it since I am already on a really low dose.     So I am just wondering if anyone else has gotten the weird twitching thing from gabapentin or know anything about all that.    People should be more understanding. And from my experience honesty works really well when it comes to getting someone to take you seriously. Even children work that way.       I'm not opposed to lying in certain situations which would need to be gaged from person to person and whatever other factors. But that would be my second choice as to how to deal with that.       Yes people are dicks and it's easy to just get them to lay off the easy way but as far as I am concerned honesty works just as well. I try not to be spiteful. There is also the bonus factor that if they do come to an understanding that people on narcotics don't all think it's fun and want to share or even talking about it, maybe they will think twice about bothering the next person with a prescription.    Yeah I would have to cover my entire body with them. Hahaha.   Seriously! I hate when I am crying while telling my doctors about my pain and they just want to talk about my mental health. My depression is not the cause of my pain. As a matter of fact it is the other way around. Actually, I have never been as insane as I have been since my pain started getting bad.      I am so tired of being tossed around from specialist to specialist like a damn potato. It's like every one of them is going "Not it! You touched it last!". I am beyond ready for one of those fucks to just give me a damn prescription for tramadol already. But like you were saying, it just doesn't work that way. I feel like they won't even take me seriously despite the fact that I had to derail my whole life because of my pain. At this point I'm not even expecting to get fixed enough to go back to work. It would be nice to be able to go to the store or even take a shower though. I know tramadol is still addictive and blah blah withdrawal and so on. But I would much rather have a physical drug dependency and a life than constant intolerable pain and no life. Also, it doesn't even get me high! Which is totally cool.     Did I mention that I'm 23? So there goes my life and apparently I will have to wait 20 years for a doctor to be willing to give me narcotics to actually manage my pain. If the non narcotics worked I wouldn't still be asking for pain relief. I would rather have my job back and not deal with drugs or pain but that's not an option. All I get is pain and no management.        Sheesh. I am kinda angry all the time.      Sorry for hijacking your rant.   Yeah I wouldn't even tolerate that. Just be blatant about the fact that it is entirely medical and something you require to function. Not something fun for you to share with the world. Also point out that it is highly personal and not something you want to talk about.        Why did someone call you a junkie for wearing a pain patch? People are awful.    I don't think that makes a difference.    Is this supposed to be shitty things?       I talk to a lot of other people with many health problems so it doesn't seem that weird because there are tons of people dealing with chronic pain and other health issues. But I suppose the combination of health problems I have is unlikely. Some of them are rare, some commonly come with the others.       Here's my list: CRPS, POTS, TMJ, fibromyalga, ehlers-danlos hypermobility type, autonomic dysfunction, osteoarthritis, migraines, and hyperthyroidism. Not sure if I'm forgetting anything but basically I am a hot mess. I have a pretty full schedule of being in constant pain so I don't do much.      Genetically I am pretty interesting so there's that. The CRPS (effecting 1 in 4000) and the ehlers-danlos (1 in 10000-15000) are the most uncommon things I have so far.       There are all kinds of symptoms I deal with every day between my conditions and my meds including the ones that aren't painful, just annoying. Not to mention the mental conditions on top of all that that I didn't list. There is almost no part of my life that is not effected by it all. I won't get into the details unless anyone is interested.    Same. That is way too much life. It's not like I'm suicidal or anything. But after a couple hundred years I'm sure I would be.    On anyone. It's not even necessarily the accent that bothers me, it's the improper sentence structure and mixed up words. Also the use of words that aren't real like 'conversate'. A lot of times if you pay attention they will use double negatives and subtly say the opposite of what they actually mean. It irks me.   I'm not even sure I understand what you mean.    Haha. Dressing like a  whore is fun sometimes.    Not really messy. I am female and my sister is seven years older than me. I was 18 or 19 at the time. My sister had already had a kid by then so breastfeeding hadn't effected her nipples. We used some ice to coax them out and then I pierced them like you would with any other nipples. Now the piercings kinda hold her nipples out. I used regular bar bells and hollow needles. 16 gauge which is the normal size.    When I go to hand someone something and they make me wait for a bit before they put their hand out to take it. Or when someone has something to hand me and I put my hand out and they just set it down in front of me. I'm kinda irritable sometimes.        On that note I hate when people give me advice when I don't ask for it. Particularly when it comes to all of my significant health problems including chronic pain. I really want people to stop recommending yoga and acupuncture. It is way to frequent of an issue for me. I am very active in trying to find the right treatment to get better but somehow people treat me like I am failing to do so.   Haha. Fun. My sister used to have innies until I pierced them. Now they're normal.    Never.   That's amazing. I have light nipples too but not that light. Someone told me my nipples look like bologna once. That was nice.    Same. I love how my boyfriend smells. I also like how I smell and the combination of both of us. Armpits smell nice a lot of the time. My best friend has nice smell.   Nope.   I had a boyfriend who had a dad we would house sit for occasionally. For some reason the back room and the bathroom were just really creepy and uncomfortable. Nothing too crazy, the house wasn't too old and it was a small place. In the back room there was a closet with a shelf up top that could be taken down. If you did that and flipped it over there was two child sized footprints burnt into the wood. No one knew how it got there and it clearly wasn't done with a wood burner or anything. So there was that.     My personal experience was in the bathroom though. Whenever I showered in there I was always incredibly creeped out. Every time I had to slide open the shower curtain I would get the most unsettling feeling, and I'm not one to get creeped out easily. In my opinion even if there are ghosts or what have you I would have no reason to believe they are anything to be scared of. The thing that finally scared the shit out of me involved this weird shower timer. It was this little, plastic, round wheele that suctioned to the wall in the shower and it had a five minute sand timer mounted inside of it so you could start it when you got in and be finished by the time it ran all the way through. I didn't actually use because it was unnecessary. So it's just sitting on the wall with all the sand in the bottom and I am trying to get done with my shower because I am feeling creeped out. I had just been looking at the timer and I turn around to rinse my hair which couldn't have taken more than 30 seconds. When I turn back the timer had been flipped and somehow had ran half of the way through. For a few seconds I froze and just stared at it in disbelief. Once I finally believed what I was seeing I got the fuck out of that bathroom as soon as possible.       I still have no idea what that was about.    Trying to relax so I can get off.   Someone once told me "A cannibal would have a field day with your thighs."      As you may imagine, I have fairly large thighs. I am fully comfortable with that fact. Though that comment was slightly off putting.       That was also the same person that introduced me to Reddit. So hi Tom.    I work at a dog rescue. So most of it, but primarily compassion.        Also hosing down the pooper scoopers without misting myself with poo water. I learned that one the hard way.    No I agree. I'm just saying from my personal standpoint it would be fine once or twice in an emergency. But obviously it's past that and they are just taking advantage.    Jabba the duck. Jeez. (You know you can't swear on the Internet.)   I like your commitment.       Yeah I have heard of people that can smell it. Personally my menstrual blood doesn't smell much. Occasionally it will smell a little and I can tell. But even if it did all the time I wouldn't really care.    The bears can smell their menstruation.    Fellow gwc girl here and wow. Great body.   Yeah if it's happening constantly they are obviously just taking advantage and they have crossed the line. But if it happened a couple times I wouldn't care.    Seriously. It could look absolutely identical and she will still know it's not her cat. Turns out they actually have personalities. But I'm pretty sure this post is fake anyway.    I mean when someone needs a tampon it's fair game. Girl code and all. I wouldn't care if someone I didn't really know got into my drawers to find a tampon. But when it's happening all the time and they are using a bunch of other toiletries too that's not kosher. Bitches know how expensive that sort of thing is. I would totally put a lock on my door.   People already think they are in some high position to give people advice when they are in a shitty situation. Like somehow being a healthy person qualifies them to coach a sick person. It is stupid and backwards. I am 23 and have to deal with this plenty.       People also tend to do this with teens. As if anything they say is going to make a difference. Having been teens before we should remember that we didn't give a fuck about any of the advice given by adults. It's not the point. We have to figure our shit out on our own.      That sucks that you are in a situation where both of those things apply to you. People are shitty. It's not even just when you're a teen. Everyone like that stays shitty. You could be 35 and you would probably still be getting the same generic bullshit 'advice' from people like that.       Just try and brush it off. You have your own thoughts on your situation and that's all that matters. Keep coping and handling it in your own way. Luckily there are places like this where there are people to talk to that know what it is like and many of us can disregard your age because that's not what's relevant.    That was very helpful. Thank you. Luckily I have good insurance for the time being so if there is medical equipment I need then I'm not too worried about it.      Also I just had to leave my job working with dogs. I love those stupid squishy faces.   Damn.    After I had my own miscarriage I looked up a lot of pictures and saw many like this. So this picture wasn't very 'WTF' to me. Just gross to think about.    Personally I would just ask one of the bag boys for help out. But I generally have my boyfriend shopping with me so he takes care of those things.    If/when I get to the point where I am more confined to a chair or scooter I would probably just ask an employee for one of those tall poles with the hook on it to borrow it while I shop. I'm sure some places have a policy against that but there are often little solutions like that.       On the whole having more benches thing I absolutely agree. I have a connective tissue disorder and get tired really easy so I am often looking for somewhere to sit. A lot of the time I find a wall or something to sit by if I need to and just deal with the weird looks I get.    I'm almost 5'1'' and I don't have a problem asking. I just put on the cute girl act and people are always nice.    People like that make me want to freak out. I can't understand how anyone could have the kind of mindset to think it is okay to behave that. Even most children know better. You would think they would at least have really solid evidence to back themselves up before resorting that behavior. It's like they are asking to be made to look like a piece of shit.    Exactly. I generally walk myself but at times I could use a wheelchair. I'm currently looking into a cane or platform crutches. I have gotten dirty looks getting up from the grocery store scooter to get something off the shelf. It's ridiculous that people automatically think that just because you are using a chair or scooter means you shouldn't be able to walk or stand. In my case it doesn't help that I am 23, look healthy, and have tattoos and piercings. Despite how someone looks they could easily have serious health problems as much as the next person.    No. It's not flat.   Even obese people who are handicapped because of their weight deserve some level of respect. Chances are they have an eating disorder. It's the same as people like me who have a problem with picking at their skin religiously or someone who starves themselves. It's an impulse control thing. Yeah they eat too much. Some of them are dicks about it like anyone else. But it's still their personal problem and clearly it is severe. They could also have a thyroid deficiency or a head injury that causes them to gain weight. If they need a scooter or a closer parking space because their joints are bad due to their size then that is their business.    My mom used to watch E.R. when I was a kid. There was a scene where a surgeon got his arm chopped off by the tail propeller of a helicopter and then he immediately threw up. It freaked me out. Somehow House of 1000 Corpses didn't bother me.   Ratios.    Drugs.   Constantly. Especially when I am having an imaginary argument with someone. For the record, I always win.  	112

 Hi :)  It is awful to feel 'not normal'. I don't ever remember feeling anything other than a freak for a long time. Self-harming was just one of many ways that I 'coped' with the storm inside my head.  But I have spent 5 years learning ways of dealing in a healthy way. I never engage in harmful behaviour to cope with stress anymore...wow just saying that makes me feel somehow amazed at how different I was to back then; back when I drank, occasionally took drugs, binged and purged on food and self-harmed. I never once now have the urge to engage in any harmful behaviour (the worst I do now is eat a whole pizza to myself followed by a mountain of ice-cream - bit again that isn't to punish myself so it isn't the same thing).   So why is I have not got any desire to 'give in' to addictions? Because I learned to love myself. I love myself too much to disrespect myself in such a way. I know I deserve to be happy. And that lesson is probably the most important of anyone's life.  The tools that helped me vary from self-affirmations to meditation (no I'm not a crazy hippy, I promise ;)).  People do care, but they don't know how to deal with uncomfortable things. There is too much stigma surrounding it. I am trying to raise awareness and now try to help people that go through similar things that I survived. That's how I see it. I survived. If you'd like to speak in more detail please feel free to ask :) xx   Hi :)  Firstly, you're already doing so much by not judging her! Take it from a survivor of self-harm; being made to feel ashamed is incredibly debilitating and worsens the problem.  Self-harm is a way of coping. I don't know if she'll be able to relate, but for me it was a way of stopping the chaos that was in my head. The physical pain was the only thing that beat the emotional pain...at least for a while.  As I said, I'm a survivor. I have gone from doing it almost weekly, to now being free of it for over 8 years. I help and support people going through these things, so please let me know if you would like to talk to me more about it.   Sending you both strength and love   	2
    Honestly, you are SO gorgeous! I adore your red hair. Please don't let one bad break up ruin your self-esteem! Xo    What a cute name! How'd you come up with it?    I've had this problem for at least the past 5 years but haven't linked it to trich before. I pull on the front strand of my hair (the "bangs" as you may call it but it's not short) until it's broken and split. I don't pull the hair out unless I see one that is too broken. Is this considered Trich? I typically do it more when I'm stressed.    I'm currently in my last year of university, studying biochemistry, and looking to make some new friends! I enjoy TV shows (Game of Thrones, Parks  Rec, AHS, etc), travelling  I love animals :)    You're so stunning  loved the makeup!    I've been in two long-term relationships, the first one for 3.5 years and the second one for 1.5 years so far (still on-going) and the patterns for each relationship are the same.   1. I become infatuated with them and am willing to do anything for them. 2. The fighting starts and I start to hate everything they do. 3. I meet someone else and have urges to leave my current SO for them.   Step 3 is actually how I ended my last relationship and started my current one.  I'm starting to feel #3 again and I seriously feel so gross about myself. I love my SO so much and I don't know what to do to suppress the feelings. Please tell me I'm not alone :(       Last week, I dyed my hair using L'oreal hicolor hilights in magenta and it doesn't really suit me so I want to dye it a medium ash brown. Is it okay if I just use a medium ash brown hair dye with 30 volume developer and a colour remover packet (from Sally's)? Or would my hair still have red undertones?   I purchased Dr. Collins 2010 study guide (second hand) and will be purchasing all the updates from Dr. Collins to take the January 2015 PCAT. Do you think this will be sufficient or is the 2010 study guide too outdated?   Sadly, it's been worse but I'm used to it by now. Maybe one day I'll try again.   Heroin   Angelina Jolie.

 I'm pretty sure that can make you really sick.   “Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone. Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation. Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home. We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano. It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire. When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning.”  -Tom Robbins, *Still Life with Woodpecker*   Ooh thanks for the explanation. English is my only language and I still didn't get it. Maybe I'm just being slow today.   I was a 17 year old girl at one point in my life. What the top commenters are saying about trying to talk to her about it without being too harsh or threatening to punish sounds like it would be the most effective. I'm sure most of us can remember a time when we were in our late teens and our parents trying to punish us was more of a joke than anything else. At 17, she's nearly an adult, and while she will obviously still be under your rules at home, she will see herself as and want to be treated as an adult. You also sound like you understand that concept of letting her form into her own person as well and I commend you for that. Remind her that she could end up in serious trouble if she's doing illegal things. It sounds like she's a smart kid with good schooling and possibly college aspirations so a firm reminder about not messing that up could potentially go a long way.

Very upset that there are so many Imperials. Praise Talos!   Um... Portal Long Fall Boots anyone?   The length of this is almost perfect for my lung capacity.

You mean to tell me that I'm not looking at a picture of a panda? I don't believe you OP.   This. This is fucking great.   You're not the only one. My mom didn't talk about it at all, so when certain puberty things happened that I should have made her aware of, I hid it because I thought it was weird and reason for judgement.   I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but what is bv? ^I ^feel ^like ^I ^should ^know ^this...   I'm still blown away by the fact that people gave her money after she left her kids in the car. Seriously, what the fuck?   How are you people seeing these things?? Legit staring at the thumbnail now trying to figure this out.   I'm not sure how I feel about this.   Well, time to go order a few things from Amazon.   Happened to me. Am woman. Can confirm.  Dated a guy once for about two months who told me he had a propensity for sticking his dick in crazy, and I was thinking, "ok, well I'm relatively normal, so it should be good." Nope. He turned out to be the most arrogant, self-centered person I'd ever met and it was simply impossible to please him. Any opinion or idea that differed from his was considered "crazy". Dropped that like a hot potato. Ended with me telling him "maybe you're the problem."   Guys! We've come so far for equality! Why you gotta start fighting about it now?   Can you please elaborate on this so I can decide if it's worth it to put you back in your place?   Hold on. 3 sexual partners? I know this has been beaten into the ground ITT already, but damn. Seeing this must have transformed me into a basic bitch because I can no longer even.    he isn't adopted  That you know of... Unless you're the mother, and then there's a higher probability of you being sure it's yours.   How does that have any relevance?   My first question for you, after looking at your website, is: how are you different than sites like Trello or Basecamp? There are tons of collaboration tools out there. I would highlight what makes yours different/better than the rest, or what makes it better for your target audience. I think the customer inclusion is probably a big thing. Also, the x leads to y, y leads to z thing you have going on in the pitch lost me a little.   What was your previous programming experience like, before developing this (languages, etc)?

I can't fall asleep any other way though.   I don't think that's a note. That looks like a message for the bathtub. One of those info plaques that hotels like to put everywhere because normal people don't know how water works.   They... threw them away? That hurts.   It's a bell curve, and the peak is at that mohawk.   I was taught to let hydrogen peroxide sit in your ears until the fizzing stops and then let it drain out. Not sure if it does anything, but my parents used to make me do it when I was a kid.   I once lost points on a writing assignment because I wrote "per cent" instead of "percent".

I recently met one who loves to "fight the good fight" but actually has no idea what she's fighting for/about - she just makes a whole lot of noise for attention and is a hater when other chicks aren't "feminist" enough.

Regrets.   To be honest, if a guy I was into had pics of naked women as their wallpaper - I'd be nervous and intimidated because I wouldn't be able to live up to those ideals.

I decided not to go for about a week and a half and just stayed in my room and locked the door. My parents were at work but my bro was still home and he would bang on the door and i'd hide in the closet just in case he came in.   I had to think of elaborate ways to appear like I had gone to school so one day I decided to throw my backpack out of the window and I climbed out of my second storey bedroom window and was holding onto the window sill trying to decide whether I'd jump onto the bush below or just try to slide my way down somehow.  Ended up realising how stupid I was being and climbed back in.   I've had lots of experiences that have made me question whether I'm experiencing terrible nightmares or if there really is something happening.

 This is interesting because we somehow got around to talking about pills and dosage in a recent lecture actually.   Part of it is to do with how you use the pill as a product. Certain pills might be marketed in small doses per individual pill for safety reasons, e.g. so you don't accidentally harm yourself taking too much; one less concentrated pill on its own isn't going to be so harmful. Also so that you can take smaller doses than one might normally need, should you wish (I'm talking things like paracetamol, asprin, everyday over the counter type pills).  But a lot of the time it's for general ease of dosage, particularly if they are prescribed pills that you yourself are meant to take regularly to a prescribed schedule. For instance, it's easier to remember to take one slightly weaker pill per day than a slightly stronger pill every two days, as the routine you maintain in doing so is easier to remember, and also with a weaker pill, the damage of missing one would be less (I'd imagine). This way you're more likely to receive the right dosage because you are more likely to take it correctly.    It's also why a lot of birth control comes with placebo pills for seven days, rather than simply a break of no pills. I'm not sure how familiar you are with birth control pills but with the most common type you basically take it once a day for 28 days, then have a break for seven days (have yourself a period), then resume with it. With the brands that come with additional placebo pills that don't do anything for the seven days, rather than those that simply give you 28 days worth of pills on their own you just keep going without breaking your routine, no potential difficulties in trying to remember where you last broke off etc.   Sorry for my dreadful examples, but hopefully you get the idea was trying so so poorly to convey :p  EDIT: 21 days, not 28, rather   Falconry!  I'd love to try it, and who doesn't think the idea of owning and caring for a bird of prey would be cool? But I've no idea how people go about starting with it. You obviously can't (or rather shouldn't) buy a bird of prey without first giving it a go and finding out if it's really for you and learning a whole lot of background stuff. But from where?  Like, where do you even go to learn about stuff like that outside of the internet?  :(   I find this both stressful and satisfying to watch...   Thanks for the replies folks! I've currently taken on a swap to keep me busy for now. Hopefully we can sort out swaps for the next time I'm swap-free :3  Have a lovely day   Nice, I wish I'd known this was on, would have loved to have gone   This was nice... I really enjoy seeing comedians or whoever handling hecklers well without being too heavy handed :3   Aww shame, she was awesome, and she signed my book :D But if that sort of thing's not your cup of tea then fair enough :3   Seriously you should go anyway, you'll regret missing the chance to see her!   Agreed, this video just made me uncomfortable :(   I don't think the clothes are even that bad, it's just...why so angry? :(   Aren't they?   Seconded the mlp stuff, (am also griller). I truly believe there was a time when it would have been (somewhat moreso) socially acceptable to be into ponies and now the golden age has passed.  I just lost interest once it became known as the fandom with all those grown men in it who masturbate to children's toys and stuff...   No I totally agree here with Cryptic. It was pretty mean to make fun of him that much...though...maybe in a way it could be what he needed, poor guy...

Edit: This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ggK9-TBVY   Literally Hitler.   I was obsessed with the Hogfather adaptation when it came out. I think it was maybe mostly to do with a teenage crush I had on the actors playing Mr Teatime and Susan. Good times. I should dig the DVD out sometime...   American Gods would be cool. I think HBO was going to make it into a tv miniseries(?) but then it just hung around in development purgatory before getting abandoned.   Failing that, A Handmaid's Tale or the Wasp Factory would be cool options.  Also, two of my favourite books ever, Titus Groan/Gormenghast would make a great film/films. They were made into a miniseries back in 2000,  it was so-so, has Stephen Fry in it and a bunch of others, a feature length film would be wonderful though.  Yeah, Brave New World would be interesting to see on the big screen.  EDIT: Turns out there was a Handmaid's Tale film...huh   Rite?

I had a bit of time in hospital a few weeks ago and played SO MUCH of this game, beating it was such sweetness. I'd been playing it at home a lot too and my boyfriend was starting to make fun of me for all the times I ended up yelling "I don't even think I'm having fun, I just have to keep playing though!" :P Grats.  Might I also suggest you now try the Fibonacci and Threes editions? Just as infuriatingly fun as the original ;)   10/10 would display proudly on my bookshelf   Yeah, Kyle Maclachlan was a pretty decent Paul in my eyes.

Duke Leto was spot-on for me, shame we couldn't have seen just a bit more of him   Gotta love Toto   Oh hai there, fellow VisualBoy Emulator user   This just came to me last night. When I was little I had a VHS tape and it had some short animated kids stories on it. I can't remember if there was any rhyme or reason as to the things on it, maybe it was things we'd recorded off tv, but one of the stories was about a couple of panda cubs.  It may have been in anime or Western style, I'm unsure, but basically the two panda cubs (possibly some other type of bear cub) are travelling some where together. Starts off with one of them saying they were bored, which I remember because I had to ask my Mum what 'bored' meant.  Eventually they start squabbling and, I don't know, smash the world or cause some sort of rift (possibly something to do with that part of the world being made of crystals)? At any rate, it ends with them being separated, either from each other or with no hope of ever getting home again.   Something depressing like that. The moral of course was "don't fight or quarrel".  Anybody? I feel like I would definitely recognise the voice acting if I heard it (American accents). Please help me recover this bit of my childhood :p   Wild stab in the dark with the 'Wind Singer' books?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_Singer  All I really remember of them is that there's an oppressive society, an underground fringe society, and a circular 'S' symbol on the front, they are YA books and came out around about that time. A lot of the other details don't add up though, so I won't hold my breath on this :p   YES! Thank you, I knew it was by someone familiar  Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LNHYz89sNc found it.  Second Edit: I will totally read the short story at the earliest convenience   That is, the machinery in it goes through the motions of setting out food (possibly) and other actions like waking them up, but the actual inhabitants are clearly dead (though I don't think we see their bodies or anything).  Sorry that that's so incredibly vague, I'm sure this is a real thing and not some grim dream I had or whatever. Almost 95% confident it was a short animated film with no dialogue. *Unhelpful shrug*   Also, brb, installing Chip's Challenge...   Sounds like it, does this look familiar, OP? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge   Check that SMV...   FINGERNAILS. OH GOD. FINGERNAILS.  I mean, you surely don't have to have a vagina of your own to realise that scraping/stabbing with your uncut nails is going to happen if you just ram them in there...*shudder*   Yeah, we had a one-way system at our school too, like, all the way around the entire school (which was sort of ring, shaped, with bits coming off it, if that makes sense). It was a bitch to get around if you had to get to your locker, go to the bathroom etc. and get to class on time, but I guess it made sense from  a safety point of view    My, what an attractive individual.   Interbreeding with wolves and dogs does sometimes happen, however, some dog evolutionists argue that the grey wolf may not be the sole ancestor of the modern dog anyway, rather it could be some other canid like the jackal or something similar. At any rate, we need to remember that dogs aren't wolves, they *are* their own species, one artificially created through their ancestors' ongoing symbiotic relationship with humans.   I reckon, although as someone else said, there is no way of predicting what evolution will do, that we could reasonably expect to get a mongrely sort of 'street dog', as we see in dogs living on the fringes of human settlements today, the type of dogs we think early proto-dogs living alongside humans would have looked like throughout most of the species' history. There'd be variation depending on geography and so on, but probably a medium build type of dog, not too chunky, not too anything, fairly generic. But that's just my speculation.  Selectively breeding dogs for certain breed types is only a relatively modern phenomenon, and it is the Victorians we have to 'thank' for a lot of selective pet breeding, and for the rigid breeding of dogs to a particular standard or appearance. There have been breeds and types before this time of course, but breeders were more concerned with performance; a shepherd might breed his best herder or whatever, hunters might select for dogs with good retrieval skills, you get the idea. Companion or pet breeding was similarly casual, and of course, with less strict rules about roaming, and less spay/neutering, dogs tended to just do the biz with whoever else they damn well pleased. What I'm saying is that there's so much variation in how dogs look, and it's not always been necessarily down to us intentionally breeding for it.  If you'd like to learn more about the history of dogs and their place alongside humans, I highly recommend the book 'In Defence of Dogs' by John Bradshaw. Hope that was even remotely helpful. Like I say, I could be totally wrong, and I'm just speculating (please be gentle, Reddit people) :3  Edit: Ofc I'm not saying there is no influence of their ancestors in the dogs genetic makeup, just that dogs are now pretty much their own species, and so long as they inhabit an evolutionary niche alongside humans, I don't personally think they would 'revert' to wolves.   ^ What this guy said, these 'after image' effects caused by rhodopsin (the chemical in question) depletion, are what gives us these cool optical illusions: http://izismile.com/2011/11/11/mind_blowing_afterimages_optical_illusions_3_pics_11_gifs.html   My body is so ready, but where can I find showings in Europe/The UK?    Yeah, I think threads like these are pretty good for asking the question "can/should we actually compare books to their film adaptations?". I know I've definitely come across those who think it's meaningless to even compare two different types of media like that. I can appreciate why, I guess   No you're right, I misspelled it and didn't even notice until you pointed it out. Rest assured I feel suitably dirty and ashamed :p   Thanks, I think they're adorable too :p She's a long haired, which in female Syrian hamsters basically just means a couple of ear tufts and maybe a bit of a butt 'skirt' (though my hammie just has little butt tufts). As far as I'm aware the females don't really express long-hairedness to the extent that males do.   Oh no, would you not recommend Memoirs of a Geisha? I've always had a notion that I'd get around to reading it some day but, meh, worth it?   For me reading the books along with the show has just heightened my enjoyment of both, I couldn't imagine being as into the books as I am if I hadn't seen the show and vice versa   That's cool, I didn't know that.  I've read a couple of other short pieces by Palahniuk that I thought were just great, Fight Club just left me underwhelmed :p   Children of Men was great both in book and film form, but I honestly felt like the two were completely different stories, but for the fact that there are no children happening. It's one of the film adaptations I've seen that's the least similar to the book on which it was based, just a completely different tone, focus, everything, even down to the fact that men are impotent in the book and women are barren in the film (or whichever way around it was :p).   I'd still have a hard time deciding between the two, though in terms of preference.   Close one for me to call but I'd maybe just have to go with the book this time. But man I love both so much...  	66
 Thanks, I was thinking that or 29th! but a second opinion helps alot!   Hi everyone I really need this picture to be sharpened or better quality. A small date is what I really need to know on the picture. Its very important to me. If anyone can help I will really appreciate it.  http://i60.tinypic.com/qqtuzr.png   Thank you very much!   My brother is the one gifting or transferring it to me. I purchased the car already from him. I just need to take the title to register it. I don't know whether to say it was gifted or just transfer it. Or if there is a difference.  	4
 Something I do which has really helped me was to write down three things I was happy with every day - at first it was only small things, that I took a shower or that I made a proper meal ... Then, when I felt really horible, couldn't sleep I looked at the list and tried to think about the stuff I had written down and not the misstakes I made.  	1
 Probably not as devastating or terrible as some... but I found out my mom regrets marrying my dad whereas my dad does not. He's not a terrible person per se; just very stubborn.  I knew their marriage wasn't perfect but to hear her actually say that was a bit disheartening.   Very lucky. As much as there's a lot of shit going on in my life, I've been incredibly lucky that my hard work paid off when it needed to.   Yeah I don't understand either. I thought this was a cute post. And a lot of people clearly agreed since it got to the front page.  Edit: You don't like this because of FB qualities. Point taken.   What a pretty pattern. Man that fish is a better artist than I!   From the thumbnail alone I saw the inside of the ears as red eyes and the face as an open mouth. I was so confused why this was on awwducational   "I'm not a racist but it's time for dinner"  "YOU HYPOCRITE"   Put that cookie down!   "Very poor choice of words."   I admire you for being the bigger person. I think I'd be consumed with rage and bitterness if someone did that to me. Hope you find a great guy that deserves you!   "lol sry bro, got so many prompts and must have clicked yes by mistake."   I'm sorry you had to go through that kind of shit. Just reading your comment broke my heart; I can't even imagine how difficult it must have been for you. But looks like you have great kids. Best of luck to you.   Being dismissive of people who hold jobs that pay less.  I went on a blind date with a guy who was really full of himself. He was also a hard worker so I could kind of see why he was so proud of his achievements, and I tried to be understanding. But then he said something like "you know how bus drivers are, they're uneducated and grumpy." That drew the line for me. Didn't even want to be just friends with the guy afterwards.   I really wanted to finish Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth but I was too much of a wuss. Survived the Attack of Fishmen chapter, didn't have the energy to continue. I think I would've had more fun if I had my friends over to play it with me.   Same here. That Let it Go song made me sick of the movie even before I watched it.   What defines "nice"? This is probably an extreme example but I'm sure Hitler was a pretty nice person to people who blindly followed him.   IIRC Louis mentioned that implying that they weren't nut jobs when they were going on about their daily routine. They did have a "normal" side to them, loving their family and enjoying little things in life, but it pales next to what they believe and how they act on such beliefs.   My heart goes out to former WBC members, but I find it hard to believe those who stay there and choose to spread hate can be deemed "nice".   It's pretty amazing how most people in the ROK are skinny to slim when they offer fattening food like this. I have the Korean genes but I wasn't born with that kind of "eat whatever the hell I want but stay skinny".   I think the sight of something can make someone feel "neugul" / nauseous. I agree food itself should be described as "neuki" / greasy.   Paper fresh out of a photocopier, all warm.  It's kind of disconcerting when it's in tens or hundreds of pages and I have to work on it, but it still has a peculiar smell I find pleasing.   How *you* doing? (a la Joey)   I like the faction idea, but yeah I wouldn't buy monthly subscriptions either. It'll probably make me feel like I *have* to play the game as much as possible as opposed to just making me want to play whenever. That's too bad.   "love don't make things nice - it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and die. The storybooks are bullshit." - from Moonstruck.  Not particularly cute but something about this resonated with me. Love makes us unreasonable, at times insane, and the lines seem to capture that perfectly.   One time back in university years I thought this server at my fave restaurant was pretty cute. I left him my number in a post-it with my check. Never heard back from him so I stopped going there for several months out of embarrassment.   Oh yeah, watching it would be fun. I'm not particularly good at PvP so :p  I guess Skyrim Online doesn't have this? I haven't tried it out.   I would love this as well except I'm not sure how it could be a competition. PvP? Things would come down to the issue of who has better items and not skills.   Actually it doesn't exactly apply to other people who hold the same position as I do. I was extremely lucky.  I'm isolated from the rest of my colleagues (who work together in one room with cubicles, where I once worked as well) and even though technically I could, I would feel too self-conscious to do whatever I want. Right now I share my office with one colleague who is not my supervisor so anything goes. I receive assignments via email or phone calls so people giving me work rarely see me in person.   Yup, shit vs. the shit doesn't make much sense to me either.   I don't know how that phrase was coined but I always imagined a giant cookie merrily rolling on the road...   I can pretty much do anything I want at the office as long as I get my job done in time. I've watched movies, played the League, blogged, taken a nap, etc.   I absolutely love that series. I really have to commend him for tolerating them and trying out their way of life even though he (like the rest of us) cannot comprehend what drives them to be so hateful. I would've been really tempted to just quit midway. I don't have that kind of patience.   I really love the retro style!   I fucking love naan. I don't usually use expletives in expressing my love for food but goddamn I love it so much. Yours looks superb!   I'm not British but this looks like a "u wot m8" situation...   "Look at me. You will pick me. You will serve me for eternity."   That's what I thought too, like using the flag as a cape.   Was afraid this might have a bad ending. Congratulations!   Goddamn I hate it when people do that. For some, common decency just doesn't seem to exist. :( But it's good to see that this hasn't discouraged you from helping others. I think I would have called it quits easily myself. Though I don't smoke, I know a lot of people who would benefit from this and I thank you for continuing to help.   I think they're okay too. I don't like every song they make, but a lot of the songs in All the Right Reasons were pretty decent.   Actually this makes me happy for you.   Same here 2, also Canadian   Oh I didn't know that. Thanks, I'll check it out.   He's a giant dick now thanks to radiation poisoning.   Sorry you had to deal with those assholes.   Watching my grandpa's coffin being rolled into the crematorium.  Obviously I didn't see the oven. We said our goodbyes before the gate that led to the oven chamber. But I didn't expect them to bring out the remains before our eyes and then show us the grounding procedure.   That felt surreal.   I imagine a slightly smaller one with a little surprise from John Doe.   Descent. The last woman probably didn't make it out of the cave. ... Probably.   It's kind of like sharks that would bite you to death and then say "oh, dude, sorry, I thought you were a seal. I'm... I'm so sorry."   Teleportation spell from Diablo II. I'll have to wave my arms like crazy though if I want to get to work from home, given the fact that I can only teleport to a location within my sight.   I would love this, except I wonder if I'll remember that I loaded the old save file? I don't think I can take most out of learning from my mistakes all that much if I forget...   Also I'd rather not feeling anything, so this sounds like a winner for me.   And I hear networking is really important in BDSM.   The way things turned out after Scar was put in charge was tad disappointing. The typical good people (Simba's.mom,.etc) suffering is predictable but even Scar and the hyenas had little to eat. Thought he was smarter than that. HE IS JEREMY IRONS. COME ON DISNEY   Do you enjoy it?   Hey Paul!   I think that's an excellent point worth digging into. But in the end he set his weapon loose to wreak havoc and tried to profit from it. I wouldve been more sympathetic about Syndrome's good boy gone bad personality otherwise.   Me me me me me   Glad I'm not alone in having hots for Bear Grylls. ♥   I love the varying degrees of Cheese shades. Must they all squeeze themselves in there together? 3 They just know how to be cute, don't they.   Just like everyone here I think you found your look! It looks awesome. Also thanks for donating that luscious lock of yours. :D   They operate on a reservation basis? Must be really popular. Thanks for the info. Will check it out.    I wasn't surprised by this. I knew something was up :'( Hope things turn out for the better for both of you. I'm sure he's a fighter inside.   That's beautiful! Such detail. Consider submitting it to the Fight Club FB fan page. More people need to see this!   "Dude are you sure this is how it's done?"   I was going to say "can't wait for her to settle in and dominate the house" but it seems like the job is already done. Thanks for bringing her to safety! :)   Back when the Internet was still a new thing (Windows 95-98 era, I think) I saw that my computer was in danger, infested with malware and this nice company offered a program for just 49.95 to get rid of them.  I was like ten. I was afraid.   Totally. Same goes for carrots, onions, pretty much all vegetables.  I still hate beans though...   Yeah, makes sense. I myself am pretty much addicted to coke zero so I'll take the offer nine times out of ten. Non perishables or things you use on a daily basis at a large quantity, also understandable.  I guess I should've clarified in my original comment that I was thinking more along the line of clothes.   I'm sure Canada is still in Top 3 of the most polite countries... If not, then I do apologize in advance.   "Yeah. When we're done with it!"   I got my mom (in her 50s) into the trilogy and it's become an annual thing for us. Back in university we'd pick a week in the winter break and do the LOTR marathon.  Of course by watching I mean talking over all the scenes because we know what happens and just want to nitpick the detail.   Not very NSFW but I used to take screenshots of the Sims 2 and make comics. Also created clothing items. I'm pretty sure this was the major factor in bringing down my undergrad GPA. I should be ashamed of putting so much effort and time into doing something like that but I was happy doing it. Good memories... just had lasting repercussions.   Buying things whenever you see "up to __% off" or "2 for 1" sale.  If they had been meaning to buy those particular products, sure, but buying stuff just because it's on sale is pretty silly.  I give this as an example because I used to be like this when I was younger... What a fool I was.  Edit: typo   Wha...? This is some Disney teen movie stuff right here. Who does that? Jesus christ. Sorry you had to endure that :(   Well it's not like Frey needed another reason to be called a scumbag...   Brownie points for being a cat person. Not that he'd need any...   I remember installing Prince of Persia 2 from larger floppy disks (5-something inch ones). There were like ten of them! Now I can carry around 64gbs in my cell phone charm... All that progress in less than 30 years.   You captured each movement so perfectly! *resist making a pun*  This would make a really great sticker series 3  Edit: Just found out you only ship within the US :( Too bad.   You must make a calendar of her... She's beautiful!      I do want to see more of Futurama. People say the Simpsons has gone way past its prime and should have ended a long time ago but I still find the series endearing and funny. I'll probably feel the same way about Futurama if it is rebooted yet again.   "What are you, gay?" The phrase it self is totally dull but the context was flawless. A close second would be the one about how the spirit is willing but the body is spongy and bruised. :p   Awww they're made for each other. I can't wait for them to conceive a twisted hell spawn!  Man each time I post a comment here I'm typing things I thought I never would...   Wow I'm late to the thread and probably (and hopefully) you feel better by the time you read my comment but fuck that woman. Even if she was a super model she wouldn't have any right to say that kind of thing to anyone. I'm sorry you had the misfortune of crossing paths with that kind of nut job. :(   My usual course of action in this case is to murder the wife... welp this is a sentence I thought I'd never type. Thanks CK2!   Lol it seems like that's when Tom swung by Korea. He also starred in the Korean SNL and did some weird shit. Gotta love a hot guy with a sense of humour and Oxford accent 3   Seriously though. I want to know as well   MY GOD first of all the cherries look great! The kisses decoration is so well-done. It's something I'd never pull off. Well done!   Man once I get a taste of that I'll probably want exclusively that burger.   I'm relieved it's about excitement. He'll be thrilled!  I just hope he doesn't sell the tv to get you a present a la the gift of maji haha   I don't know... I would think the person was trying to befriend me if someone stuck an arrow in me and set me on fire...   "How come you have to shower so often? WHY ARE THEY PUNISHING YOU"  unless she likes water.   Hello from a fellow Canadian! I only got to stay five days or so in Montreal but I loved food there in general! Wish I could visit your shop...   Did you make the costume yourself? It's spot on!   "Is it me?" *raises one eyebrow*   I'm glad she met you! Hope she gets to run around soon and play with your kids. That'd be an adorable sight.   Sure you say that NOW   Didn't realize I'm part of that 1%!   Chocolate beans!   I'm so sorry you lost him... And he was so young :( But I suppose he'll stay young in the kitty heaven forever, teasing other older companions. RIP beautiful Mr. Boots.   Is she Siberian?? She does look like a princess!   Must. Resist. Petting. the Monitor...   Sweet mother of God a Tuxedo 3 She's gorgeous. And I love it when a cat and a dog become friends. Consider posting pics of her in /r/cats!   I love the detail on Slurm! Each figure looks like it would make a great keychain or necklace. wish i had this kind of talent!   I read the last part In Moe's voice automatically  	103
 Sounds to me like your dad has fat logic too. You don't need to workout to lose weight, you can eat healthier. Just because you had surgery doesn't mean you can't eat less.    Holy crap. You have an amazing body! Do you work out too? I am around your weight but don't look like that haha.    I'm totally the same way! I started looking at cute clothes and makeup and even painted my nails too. I went to /r/skincareaddiction and spent money on some nice products for my face.   I think I avoided those things before not because I was so "above" them but because focusing on my appearance depressed me. Now that I'm trying to be healthier I find a ton of girly enjoyment out of shopping and yesterday I even got a haircut and waxed my brows haha!   So good for you, it's all a lot of positive things going on!    Do you think a lot of it has to do with pressure from other people? Especially since you have issues as the day goes on. I know I wanted to cheat and told my boyfriend we should get pizza. He isn't in charge of my diet so he said okay, and for a minute I felt like he had validated my decision to cheat, do you know what I mean? I ended up feeling bad and we didn't get pizza, because I need to hold myself accountable. But there were definitely times in the past when I allowed myself unhealthy food because I was out with friends or family. It's hard to feel in control I think when everyone else is eating crappy!    I'm a bit stressed out. I'm trying to get the Internet at my new place and I was on the phone with twc for TWO HOURS I must have talked to five different people and in the end they're making me pay to have a technician come out! Aaaaaah!  I'm trying to be more positive. I'm going back to school go finish my degree this fall and I can't tell if I'm super excited or insanely stressed. Maybe both.   I also just started dating someone seriously (the first relationship I've had after my divorce) and I have no idea what I'm doing. Ahh!   But thankfully I have keto in my life haha. One thing I can actually control and feel good about! Oh, and today I'm getting a hair cut so I'm excited! I'm seeing a really talented hair stylist who is usually totally booked but someone cancelled. So I'm pumped!    Hahaha I was thinking that too!    I would use the keto calculator in the side bar and only put in a small calorie deficit. When I started, I had a calorie limit of 1600, which was good for me because I was full enough despite still having cravings. Now I eat around 1200-1400, sometimes more if I want to indulge.   What kind of foods do you eat? If I find myself hungry I usually eat a handful of almonds or I make fat bombs. The large amount of fat makes my stomach happy and I am way less likely to binge. I still track everything to be sure I'm under my carb limit.   Good luck. I tried keto a few times before but only recently did I start it and stick to it without cheats. It might take a few runs to figure it all out.    I totally agree with the pizza idea! I just made an awesome pizza with Almond flour. In fact, I'm eating leftovers right now.    Yeah! Just discovered I can eat a ton of cream cheese haha. I love cream cheese!    I had a girl from the office tell me I didn't need to lose weight, but she was trying to lose weight. We then discovered we weighed the exact same amount! 174. She just carried a lot of weight around her midsection making her look bigger than me, I think. I have fat everywhere and was good at hiding my arm fat and leg fat under my clothes haha.    Sweet! I'm on my third week so I'm pretty new too!   Duck bacon sounds really neat!    Wow that is awesome news! Keeps me motivated as I'm only on week three! Can't wait to see what kind of results I get after three months.    Haha, my breath is still god awful in the morning. But my teeth do feel cleaner and less mucky!    It's my 17th day of keto today! Can't believe it's already been this long, and I can't believe I have faithfully stuck to it.  I finally got the internet at my new place, so I'm going to spend tonight gaming and making low-carb pizza! Super excited.   I feel you. For whatever reason moderation is just impossible for me when eating carbs. Especially beer. If I have one beer, I'll have one more, and another, and another. Bleh. Best to just keep calm on keto haha.   That sounds awesome! I need to get a bikini for a vacation I'm taking at the end of August. Ugh. I don't know what to wear. I'll probably get one of those high waisted ones but I haven't worn a swimsuit in forever!    Lame! Hope you get a new cool doctor soon. I'm avoiding going in to see my gynecologist because she's really terrible. I have scars on my body from a period of self-harm (I'm fine now) and she made a HUGE deal about it and embarrassed the shit out of me. Not to mention she's a really overweight doctor, so what's up with that? I don't want to take health advice from someone who can't even take care of themselves.   That sounds really interesting. I should start tracking my periods.    I totally need to do this. I don't even own a scale but somehow find myself using a friend's scale or the one at work. Bah! It's frustrating me.   Ooo a romance toy party sounds freakin' awesome haha! Have fun!   What were her reasons for why it was dangerous and unhealthy?   From what I've heard around this sub, a ton of health care professionals are just not on board with very low carb diets. I wouldn't let it discourage you.   I can't speak for everyone but I felt very little of the side effects of initially being in keto. I took a magnesium and potassium supplement and drank lots of chicken broth to keep my sodium intake high.   I planned meals so that I wouldn't cheat and made sure I was drinking enough water.   Honestly, there will always be reasons not to do keto. There will never be a perfect time to start. Might as well just dive right in.   Totally awesome transformation.  I've been on keto for about 3 weeks, no big slip ups. I simply feel better. I used to emotionally eat and now I do not. I had bad anxiety and could not sit still, now that I am eating low carb I am so much more calm. So basically, those things push me to stay doing keto. I feel better, therefore, why would I want to stop doing it? You need to find your own personal reasons to keep going!  Good luck!   Oh wow. I guess I was always worried people at a gym would be annoyed since I'm such a noob haha. This gives me hope though! There is a snap fitness by my place.   Haha the LOTR analogy is spot on. I felt this way over the weekend. I randomly wanted pizza SO BAD. I looked at my boyfriend and said, I need pizza NOW! I was randomly carb crazy. He kept me true to my diet though :D  Annnd this week I already bought all the ingredients to make awesome low-carb pizza.    Wow. You are awesome. Seriously! You're motivating me to get into the gym!   Thank you!   I'd love to read that study, it sounds super interesting! Do you have a source for that?   You have an amazing body! We are a similar height so you're sort of inspiration for me :)   Awesome! I just started my third week of keto and I lost about 10 pounds, and I lost inches on my waist. Really exciting!   Good job on sticking to it :)   Ooo I'll have to try Kalua pork, it looks pretty easy! I just love coming home from work to a delicious smelling house and a meal I basically didn't even have to cook haha!   It is kind of cool, but scary lol. I really don't like zombie stuff so when it's like RUN the zombies are going to get you it freaks me out! But it's motivating haha.   Hey! I'm on week three of keto and day 1 seems like it was yesterday! Seriously, keto is the least diet-y diet I have ever been on and I love all the awesome food I can eat (MEAT lol).   One thing that helped me immensely was my fitness pal, if you don't have one get one, because I have tons of friends from /r/keto and /r/xxketo. You should add me, my username is sperhauk on there (and anyone else can add me as well). It's nice to have a lot of internet buddies holding you accountable and inspiring you!   I read something on /r/GetMotivated that said something like, you already know what it's like to give in. What would it feel like to keep going? That inspires me so much.   I also don't have a huge budget to go on when it comes to keto so bulk buying foods (especially meat) and planning meals goes a long way into saving money!    I haven't been exercising lately but I would like to start again. I downloaded the zombie run app and used it for a few runs. I'd like to get into a daily yoga routine as well! But I made excuses.  Today marks my third week of keto! I have pork cooking in my crock pot at home right now for carnitas. I'm so freakin' excited! Last week I barely cooked at all so I'm excited to be getting back into it. Keto is much more fun when you cook.   I have issues with depression and anxiety and I definitely feel a huge improvement. Maybe it's because I'm low carb, but it could also be that I'm just feeling good by doing something good for my body. I also get a nice mood boost when I see that I have lost weight.   My depression usually makes me say "I can't" to myself, so sticking to keto helps me fight that feeling. As for my anxiety, I could barely sit still before keto. Now I feel so much more calm and relaxed, and I barely ever have mood swings.    Close! I'm in Southeastern Wisconsin.    KEELY. I know a Keely, and she is totally rude and obnoxious. Why is it always Keely's haha.   Thanks anbeav!   So you know when you're looking down at your phone and the screen turns off and you are met with a reflection of your face? And then if you're like me you get depressed because you realize just how much fat appears under your chin?  WELL after two weeks on keto I SWEAR it's gotten noticeably smaller! I thought, maybe I'm holding the phone higher than usual. But I moved it around and still, my chin fat has totally shrunk haha.  This is an awesome victory for me because the fat face in phone reflection occurrence was one of my wake up calls I needed to lose weight! Sooo yeah things are going pretty good.  PS This sub is amazing and you gals are huge motivators!   My exact reaction when I saw the pictures haha.   sperhauk   Yeah I made those excuses for a while too! Good workout clothes can come later, after you've established the habit. Then you can upgrade running shoes or buy other running gear. But making it a habit is important first!    I just started jogging a week ago! I downloaded the Zombie Run app to make it more fun. Then it's easier to focus on your run and not other people. Plus after a week of running I actually want to run now, even though I suck at it right now!    You have amazing self control. I can't imagine tasting candy as a job and NOT eating everything in sight!   You look awesome!    Oh well, we can drool at him from a distance.   Out of cheese?! I'd panic.   True, and when he was bigger he seemed like a guy I could actually get lol. Now...now he's just too good looking.   Today at work we are grilling during lunch! So I get to eat a delicious burger with cheese.   This weekend I was planning on bar hopping with friends, but now that I'm doing keto I think I'm going to pass. I just know I'd be too tempted to eat unhealthily and drink beer. I'll probably spend time with my cat who I've been neglecting all week and playing a ton of video games! I also downloaded the Zombie Run app so I'm gonna get some runs in too!    LOL that was one of my favorite stories on Reddit. I'm glad both men and women alike are totally clueless about this.    Seriously, I feel like a complete idiot when I talk dirty. What are you supposed to SAY.       So I am very sensitive to body sensations, for example, being too hot or too cold makes me anxious, or being sick, or having any kind of pain. Especially when my heart rate increases or I feel flushed. I have basically been trying to avoid being in the sun or doing any kind of physical activity.   BUT I know that exercise helps anxiety. So for the past few days I have been getting up super early to go for a walk and jog a bit, so that I won't get too hot and I stop if I get panicky because of my heart rate. Well today I went for an awesome jog after work, the sun was shining, and there were (gasp) even people around where I was running, and I WAS FINE. I had some anxious moments, especially immediately post run when I started focusing on my heart beat, but I am calm now I feel just awesome.   I know I have a ways to go with my anxiety but this is the first time I ever really said fuck you to my anxious feelings and just did something good for myself!   I totally feel you because I do the same thing. I think just not looking at progress pics would be helpful.    I keep thinking that if I don't lose the weight, I will more than likely gain weight, and keep gaining until I become obese and even more unhealthy. So I am motivated to become healthy and fit!    Oh man is that true! I am really proud of myself that I'm the kind of person that chooses to be alone rather than with someone I'm not compatible with anymore. I think it takes a lot of strength to move on from a bad relationship.    Your comment made me laugh a lot for some reason.    I'm curious about that too, because I calculated 1600 calories for me, and I feel like any lower would be torture, especially when trying to adapt to a new diet!    I'm only on day 3 of keto but I try to stay under 25g, and I've been successful! I definitely keep a really close eye on it on MFP.    I calorie count and find it pretty helpful. What made you decide on 1200-1300 calories? I used the Keto Calculator in the side bar and it recommended 1600 for me. I feel like 1300 is low but a lot of gals on here eat that much. I just want to maximize how much weight I lose without going crazy out of hunger!   LOL this comment is hilarious. I'm going to try it.    Ugh that sucks. I married my ex who I had known since high school, at 19 we married and when I was 23 he cheated on me with a friend of mine. UGH. At least she was the same age as me? Anyway, I only recently finalized the divorce and seeing happy couples still annoys me. It's hard for me not to belt out to girls HES PROBABLY CHEATING ON YOU. Cause I'm bitter, I said it.   Yeah it's never the skinny healthy relatives, it's always the overweight or obese ones. Like do you hate your life that much that you need to resort to criticizing other peoples' weights. I think they believe they get a pass because they're old and I'm young, and young girls "should" be thin. Whatever!   The same birthday party my uncle asked me if I was a lesbian. Just out of the blue. Like wtf. Who ASKS that.   Damn a half marathon?! Sounds intense. I'm doing C25k as well!    Dude fuck off. Have you ever had cats before? Stop being a cunt.    Oh my god, I would be absolutely terrified if that happened to me! I'm glad your dog was okay!    Fuck that guy. A relative I hadn't seen in a while at a birthday party just randomly sidled up to me and told me I got heavier. Like no one fucking asked you. You've been fat the entire time I have known you and I dont comment on it! Fuck. People are rude. Try not to let it bother you! You've got us girls on here to give you support :)    Awesome! You look like a different person :)    I don't have a scale and I don't think I will get one. I think it would just discourage me, especially hearing everyone talk about water weight and weight gain on their period. I just started so maybe I'll want to weigh myself eventually, but right now I just weigh myself whenever I'm at my moms haha!    I like this idea a lot. I'm going to try it myself!    I should do that! Today is my second day of keto so I have a ways to go, but yeah, progress pics are encouraging.    Nice job! You can totally tell you've made a ton of progress.    Feel free to add me - sperhauk   Awesome! Thanks for the reply :)   I've always had issues with emotional eating, and I have a ton of anxiety and depression, so I'm worried I'll go off track from keto (today is my first day!).   If I do start to get really stressed and anxious I'm gonna take a bath and then play an epic amount of video games.   What podcasts do you listen to?   Awesome! I'm actually super excited to eat today, feeling really motivated.    Just started keto today! Mine is sperhauk.   Are you serious? They didn't just punch them, they attacked them to the point of serious irreparable injury. So fuck them, they have mental problems.    Some girls are into that! This one guy posed with two guns and pretty much looked like a serial killer haha. But a dude at a shooting range might look alright.    Holy shit. When did this happen.    That would be interesting. I'm in a big city but the surrounding areas are pretty country, which makes sense why dudes would be hunting/fishing/holding guns. A lot of the dudes who live in the city just have a ton of pics of them in bars.   That's so awesome. You're quite lucky to have someone so supportive!  	83
 Tag me. It's going to happen. If not, I'll post a video of me deep throating my belt.    Haha, like, what's the protocol for this? Do I take a picture in a week when spring breaks over?    Holy shit, this kid is in my fourth hour chemistry class. He gets bullied all the time, I talked to the teacher about it last week.... Shit.... The internet's real... 0.o like... I know that kid... I'm seeing in a week... Spring break for now...   He went to Kickapoo high school in Springfield, I'm currently in a gym class with his niece. Small world.    I love you, dammit. Sorry I have nothing else to offer, I hope you find something to love, something to hang on to.   Thanks a bunch.   I have never been able to find e music video, if you could link it I would be so grateful...   How to save a life - the fray. Too many friends lost.   Thank you for telling me, and I wanted to try and get it translated by someone who could make sure the meaning and emotion carried through. But oh wells, I'm not sure why it didn't work :( thanks anyway.   "If I was a squirrel, I'd bury my nuts in your backyard."   It showed his eye    Pssssst. This is fake.    Am I the only one who thought that he stuck his "head" in and "washed"/pissed on the car?   :) Too late but you're a cool guy    I digress   ~~ today~~  On this comment thread    Halo 1, Bungie admitted that the pistol was only that powerful because of a glitch. Entirely changed the game, but not in a bad way   So today I've been working on a final paper, and I decided to work on leveling up. What I did was go into infection, and find the best hiding spot you can. Leave your guy there, because (I think) this is the only gametype where you WON'T be kicked for not moving! I've gained 200,000 xp in the past few hours just by looking up at the end of every game.   NOTE: This is for gaining XP when you're doing something else, like working on a final!      But... but... I'm a loser :(    Sorry I totally forgot the [FIXED] in the title :( sorry!!      Sure   This defines religious persecution. I see no conflict, sorry   I think this will help everyone on this thread. Just the definition of the word everyone's debating. It does not mention having rights stripped or taken away.   per·se·cute (pûrs-kyt) tr.v. per·se·cut·ed, per·se·cut·ing, per·se·cutes 1.

To oppress or harass with ill-treatment, especially because of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or beliefs. 2. To annoy persistently; bother.    No it does not, actually. I think the word you mean is something along the lines of "physical persecution," or something like that. But I understand what you mean, Just, the word does not mean what it seems to be that most people think it means.   Nah, I was just kidding. It just is a hostile picture for me, to equate a prayer to someone's faith as nothing more then this. BUT. this is the internet. So please, please don't feel the need to tell me to get the fuck over it, because i know. *you have the right to your opinion!!!* so I am not saying that you need to change. But please read the top two lines of my original post, and then read reddit for a long time. You will see what I mean, I hope. But this is MY opinion. Feel free to voice yours!   Please google the definition of persecution. I seriously do not mean conflict over this, so I will agree, that no, I have never been physically bullied. But I don't think the point needs to  be explained that people can do more damage without physical violence then you think.   **YES**   I agree, I think you're right.   That's one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard. "Jeez, why'd that girl commit suicide from cyber bullying??? She wasnt REALLy persecuted, I mean, come on!"  If you are going to go down the list of what constitutes persecution, I find that over 3000 people getting together and making fun of my beliefs constitutes persecution. The def. of that word is to be subject to hostility. I don't think anyone can judge what someone feels, and if they are feel they are persecuted. To clarify, please don't take this hostilely. What I am trying to say is that it is in the eye of the beholder in terms of who decides if they're persecuted. If I go on r/atheism and see [this](http://i.imgur.com/hcBQP.jpg) , feel very persecuted. We should respect all and everyone's opinion, because if we don't, then who can respect ours?   Is it weird I only clicked on this link because I have a giftcard to there?   There were to men working out in the hot sun digging a ditch. Their boss is a little ways away sitting under a tree reading. One digger says to the other, "Why do we have to work while he relaxes?"  The other says, "I don't know. I'll go ask."  So he gets out of the ditch and goes and asks his boss, "Why do you relax while we work?"  The boss says, "Well, am farther up in this company."  To this, the digger replies, "Why do you get to be higher up?"  So, the boss says, "I have more common sense then you."  "what's that?"  The boss then proceeds to place his hand on the tree and say, "Hit my hand as hard as you can."  So the digger does, but the boss moves his hand and the digger hits the tree.  Walking back to the ditch, confused and rubbing his sore knuckles, he hops down and the other digger asks him why they have to work while the boss gets to relax.  The man says, "He has more common sense."  "What's that?"  So, to demonstrate, the man puts his hand on his face and says, "Hit me with that shovel as hard as you can."   agreed.   K, American here. The anthropocentrism of science has formulated an inability to process without quantification. This is a fundamental flaw, and leads to the lovely fagfarts statement of knowledge being subjective, nothing is certain as true.    More people need to see this.      Excellent advice, have to laugh at your username.   NOT FUCKING SUITIBLE FOR LIFE. LIFE. There is a difference. NSFL   lol happens way too much  	41
 Alright, so we've been together for a long time. I'm not having anxiety because of a trust issue or anything like that. I don't really know why I'm having anxiety. The message he sent me wasn't passive aggressive or anything he just said "Hi I can't talk at all today and I'm sorry. I love you. So, so, so much. Have a great day beautiful." I already knew he had stuff to do today, and I thought that to talking to and/or seeing him would be something I could deal with for at least one day, since when he's at his dad's, I have to deal with it for a week or more. It's snowing. I'm stuck at home all day so I don't have a distraction. I realize that I can't be so dependent on him, and that he has his own life, but my anxiety is pretty bad. How do I stop freaking out and get him off my mind?   I have severe anxiety, and I'm only thirteen. 've had it since I was seven due to some unfortunate events; it basically stole part of my childhood from me  See, my best friend who I love more than anyone, is at his dad's. His dad is a it of a douche so, that means I can't talk to him until very late at night and only some nights. It is a three day weekend, so I haven't seen him since we went out to eat after school on Thursday. He texts me sporadically, and I text him back. I usually get no response until much later, which for most people would be understandable, but having anxiety, I flip the hell out. I get kinda shaky, withdrawn, etc. This is an awful way to spend an otherwise glorious weekend. Any advice on how to calm down?   okay, so, in highschool, the two middle schools in my district are combined. The lunches don't go by grade, they're usually just random. I'm like crying and shaking right now because the idea of not being with my friends is scaring me. Not knowing anyone scares me, and I don't make friends very easily. At all. People say I have this "magnetic personality" but new people terrify me. Is there any possibility my psychiatrist could persuade the school to give me lunch with some people I know? Because if not I know damn well I will have anxiety attacks constantly, I'm probably not gonna have any classes with my friends since we're all on different levels anyway. Not having lunch is just too heavy.    I do the same exact thing,hoping it will spark real tears.    That's what I'm on now.. Did you notice it starting to just worsen your depression after a period of time?   Did the antidepressant happen to be lexapro?   	6
 Just wondering when I will get my exam marks back, i wrote them yesterday, and this morning. they are humanities exams. one of them was for a seminar, if that's of any relevance. thanks!      whenever i open the camera app, and navigate to my photos, my phone screen goes black for a few seconds, and i hear a click, and it restarts. everything else works fine, only a few months old. running 4.4, not rooted, hoping someone knows the source of this bug, and whether or not its just kitkat being glitchy, or something is wrong with my phone.   reminds me of the clover field monster.   awesome, thanks for all the info!  i hate to bother you with more questions, but i was wondering if you knew any ontario companies as well?   I'm trying to apply to as many companies as possible, I'm really hoping to plant this summer!   Im a student, but I'd like to treeplant at least for the next 4 summers, potentially even after I graduate. are there any companies you can recommend applying to, as a first year planter?   whats the advantage of planting in the west? and is it possible for first year planters to get jobs out there?   sweet, thanks  	8
 I didn't until I got pregnant. But it was so minor I didn't notice it. Just went into the ER for heart rate not going down and they found it.    Going the other way as someone currently pregnant: stillbirth.    Same here. I'm on modified bed rest for hypertension and I'm supposed to take it easy. Doctor said no sex would be best route, and my husband misses the sex and intimacy so much. I got him a flesh light as sort of an "I'm sorry" and improvise using that.    I'm 3/4 of the way done with a crochet baby blanket :) just took time off from it this weekend which was a mistake. I'll crochet for 6 hours one day then won't crochet again for 3 days due to being burned out on it.   Bed rest is exhausting. I think I'm getting depressed. Going to make a quick trip to Michael's today to get crafty stuff to distract me (thank god for modified bed rest).    Sleep has gotten worse. Waking up every 90 minutes except from 4-8 where I actually get sleep.    Ugh yesss. A friend of mine from high school has gone super granola with her baby, talking about essential oils and posting articles shaming those who don't breastfeed, including one similar to the one you talk about.  I wanted to point out that her 17 month old has missed almost every developmental milestone to date. But I keep my mouth shut. I wasn't breastfed either.    A few years ago my 30 year old sister asked me what a dildo is after we went to go see a performance of Rent.    Yeah there's no solid proof that nipple confusion even exists.    No, it's a completely separate load since they have feces and urine on them. Some people wash them in hot water which you can't do for normal laundry.     As does the laundering of cloth diapers. Carbon dioxide output is roughly the same.    While I agree with you on every other point, the environmental impact has been widely debated.  So from a frugality point, yes cloth are more cost effective.  But environmentally the jury is still out when you take into account the laundering of the diapers.  Most say they have the same effect on the environment:  Keeping a child clad in home-laundered cloth diapers for 2.5 years emitted 1,232 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, vs. 1,380 pounds for disposable diapers. [Source](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140328084622/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/nappies_1072099.pdf)   That's borderline. Since your BP went down I would just take it easy. I had a positive dipstick pee test and BP of 140/90. Sent to hospital and all the labs (blood and urine) came back normal. Doctor out me on bedrest for pregnancy hypertension.   Just take it easy. Elevate your feet. Be off your feet as much as possible. And good luck from a fellow Houstonian :)   Same with my husband. Getting him out of bed is pretty frustrating.    Bought my baby shower dress today.  I also, at 35 weeks, bought my first pairs of maternity yoga pants.  Why did I not buy these sooner!?   Congrats! I also have PCOS and was on a LOT of progesterone my first trimester. Here I am at 34 weeks. Just keep trucking, this community is awesome :)   34 weeks here too. Pissing makes me mad because it feels like I have to go so bad but only a trickle comes out.    Normal unless accompanied by bleeding! Your uterus is growing, no need to worry :)   You're in the best place you can be! Medical professionals can help with whatever is going on, they are highly educated and are prepared for whatever happens. Just breathe deep, and try to reassure yourself they are going to do everything they can to help you and little one. Worrying will not change the outcome and the stress of worrying isn't good for you or baby.    At the interview for my current position I was asked this in a two part question: "How much do you currently make and what are you looking to make here?"  My answer:  "I will not answer the first part of that question, but my salary requirement is $X"  Got the job.   Aww my cat has been doing this to me lately too.   Where are you from and what are you expecting? Good food? Drunken night of debauchery? Line dancing? Houston has tons of things to give for any kind of good time wanted but we need a few more details.    I'll keep you in my prayers. I have medical related anxiety too, getting my gallbladder out was hell. But you have to remember that your panic is doing nothing to change the future situation. Just breathe deep and if you find yourself panicking, just think "I'm fine, I will be fine".  Try distracting yourself with a smartphone game or something while you're waiting.    There's a guy who has been filming his "prank" of putting his hands on random girls' asses in public. Sexual harassment disguised as an asshole pulling a prank. Disgusting.    Underoath   Negotiating my current salary when I was in the interview process.  I don't have a prestigious job or anything, but probably make more than 90% of others in my field.   No more pregnancy brain.  Not much to really think about on bed rest.  Great news, this week my BP has been right around 115/83 every day! Looks like bed rest is working for the hypertension :)   That's my snack too! Had one at 3:30 this morning.    Similarly, anxiety. I was always a worry wart but never classified myself as having anxiety until I started having chronic panic attacks out of nowhere where I was convinced I was dying 3-7 times a week or more.    This describes on of my friends to a T.  She has 90k in student loans, is constantly getting collection calls and ignores them.  She makes a decent wage, but had to live in the trendy part of town instead of living with her parents rent free.  She goes out 3-5 nights a week ("happy hour, it's cheaper!") and is a brand whore.  Always has her YSL bracelet on, tags her instagram pictures with #armani or whatever brand she is wearing.    Poor girl tries to talk about eventually buying a house in the next few years, but I'd be willing to bet everything I own that her credit is in the shitter.   I have suffered from anxiety and depression for the last 4 year or so.  I tried to get off my antidepressants, but I was so stressed that it was having a negative effect on my health.    One thing my psychiatrist says can really help avoid PPD is getting 6 hours of sleep a night after baby arrives.  Obviously this may not be possible for everyone, but if you can, have your SO or someone be on baby duty for as long as possible per day.    Also, anti-depressants are not the end of the world.  I'm on Prozac now at 34 weeks and will be on it after I give birth, too.  If I can't BF on it, my mental well being is much more important for baby than breast milk.     One newborn outfit with a onesie, hoodie, and pants (because Oct/Nov in Houston the weather can be anything), a couple of 0-3 onesies in case he's a biggun, and a couple of extra NB onesies and a blanket.   Only on a once-in-a-while basis according to my doctor.  She says it does the same as a benzo if you use it sparingly.     Every damn time.  "I really hope this isn't the baby I'm pushing out" even though I know it's mostly an irrational thought.   Yup.  Engineering major? Apply to jobs in Houston, you'll get a job.  I don't know one person with an Engineering degree who didn't have a job 2 months out of college (at the very latest)     No swelling.  But by the feel of the pain I was surprised to look down and see no swelling at all.  It feels like pressure.  But I've noticed throughout today while crocheting and sitting around that I get it in both feet, and my hands occasionally.  I think it's just poor circulation probably due to the positions I sit in.   Yup.  My smell changed with the onslaught of increased discharge.  I lovingly call it "swamp crotch"   Relaxing... Yeah I figure if it gets to the point where I can't stop thinking about it I'll call my insurance's nurse's line.  Thank you so much :)   You're right.  It's mostly gone and when it's here it's only noticeable for a few minutes, not even enough though to be a hindrance to my walking or anything.     Recently I was diagnosed with pregnancy hypertension.  My BP is fine now that I'm on modified bed rest, but ever since that happened I'm hyper aware of every ache and pain.  I'm sitting more than I'm up but I still might be up for a while each day to make sure I'm moving.  Yesterday for about 5 minutes I had a weird, not-severe pain in my left foot.  No swelling, but it felt like it was a swelling pain.  Pressure pain, tight, squeezing.  I've heard about DVT and one foot swelling.  I was told that because I'm on modified bed rest I shouldn't experience any swelling.    The pain has only happened again once since yesterday, for less time and less severe.  I'm just concerned I'm asking my OB too many questions about stuff, like every minor ache and pain.  Should I call a nurse's line instead?  Should I just wait and see if the pain gets to be more severe?  My OB practice is one doctor and one nurse, very small, and pretty busy.   They're actually not even open today due to a birth.     May your pregnancy be completely boring and easy!    Yup, my brain is basically Gir.  I miss that show.  Maybe I should do another watch through since I have 6 more weeks of this.       Not to mention if you have them at an earlier (yet responsible) time, they're out sooner.  My first (and only) will be here in a month or so and he'll be in college (hopefully) by the time I'm 45.  Sounds pretty good to me.   Mine was taken away at 3 weeks due to mom's milk being dried up.  Our cat is... special.  Nothing too bad, but constantly kneading a blanket we have, occasional yowling in the middle of the night.   We are entirely split because we disagree about rules interpretations.  Sounds like Christianity.  Denominations of mods.   Congrats and welcome!   I also have GAD, though haven't had the NICU experience.     34 weeks pregnant, on bed rest for hypertension, and our bank account is frozen due to fraud warning.  A new delicious taco place opened a mile from us and I'm stuck in here watching Netflix forever.   I wish foil worked for ours. They just lay down on top of it. But we got a bassinet that vibrates, and that freaks them out. So any time they jump in I just hit the button.    A baby.  Currently 34 weeks pregnant.   Currently pregnant (34 weeks) and on low dose Prozac.  I had been weaned off Celexa by the 3rd month of my pregnancy, but my panic attacks came back very strongly so I was put on low dose Prozac to help.  I'm not concerned, though.  Stress on my body with constant panic isn't good for baby, and my doctors ultimately decided that the slight risk was ok.  Plus this study doesn't seem to be very reliable anyways.   It's spinal fluid equalizing. Perfectly normal.   It's spinal fluid equalizing.  Perfectly normal.   Laganja was the one person I was thinking when she was explaining Poor Me. Poor Laganja.    They will either bring in lunch or release you to get your own lunch.    July 17th. She came back into town for the Lady Gaga concert. She will be back October 4th. I don't have many friends and the only one I consider a close friend moved away in March.   Thank you. So many people in this thread saying how dangerous a loaded gun is and how it's a deal breaker simply bc it's loaded. A home intruder isn't going to wait for you to load your gun. If the weapon is for home defense it should be loaded.   A home intruder won't wait for you to load your gun. If the firearm is for home protection, it should be loaded with the safety on.    He's so cute! And you are super mama for that graduation story! Way to go!   Chips   queso  Apple pie  I just want to live off these things    I've never had a clot or period blood come out in the shower. I guess I'm weird.    It was ok!  135/85.  Not great, but I was nervous walking into Kroger to get it checked and power-walked in there :)   Since it's a seminar, there are usually breaks.  You won't be the only one who is there alone, people may try to talk to you.  Just make small talk, maybe you'll find someone who shares an interest in things you like.  There will be a break for lunch.  I **highly** doubt they will call each of you by name.  You may need to wear a name tag.  They just need your information to confirm attendance.    They will probably have different speakers to speak about different sub-topics of the seminar.  There may be 90 minute sessions with small breaks in between.  Usually questions should be saved for the end of each session if the floor is opened for questions.  Your anxiety will do nothing to make the experience better.  It'll do the opposite.  If you find yourself getting anxious, just take deep breaths through it for as long as it takes for you to settle down.   Thanks!  I'll be going in about 15 minutes to check.  I'm feeling a lot better after a good night's sleep though.  I'll edit to update :)   How exciting! Good luck, mama! Take it easy until then :)   33+6 today. Still on modified bed rest for blood pressure. Broke my bed rest yesterday due to restlessness and I definitely shouldn't have. Doctor's appointment Monday and I have a feeling I'll be sent back to the hospital for another NST if not more. May drop by CVS at 8am to test blood pressure due to headaches.  If it's too bad I'll have to go to L D :(  EDIT: BP was 135/85 and that was with me being nervous as shit!  Gonna continue bed rest.   Awful.    They recently opened a DD about a mile from me. To me their donuts taste like satan's anus compared to Shipley's.    It's a shame Shipley's isn't a nationwide chain.  Krispy Kreme is okay, but any other donut has been tainted because a Shipley's donut is so delicious.   As a fellow nervous nellie who is far along in pregnancy:  STOP.  Stop taking your temperature.  Don't google every little symptom you have.  If you feel like something really isn't right, call your OB.  Otherwise you're most likely fine.  Worrying about it won't do anything to make it better, and your body needs to be as stress free as possible.  Just relax, it's going to be one hell of a ride from here on out :)  If you are getting nervous and ever need someone to talk to, PM me.   The only reason I can see these rules being there is to protect the technician.  I'm sure the technician can recognize things, but they can't officially give you any information that might lead you to a diagnosis since they are not a nurse or a doctor.  They are simply there to take pictures.    I've honestly only had one ultrasound done by an actual technician with no doctor in the room, and that was before I was even pregnant, to diagnose gallstones.     Pappsitos fajitas are like crack.   Sons of Anarchy. Just finished House last week.    Similarly, PCOS. Women with PCOS usually have very irregular periods, sometimes going months without them.    Not cooking much due to bed rest. New taco place opened up nearby that I am so excited about. Will probably have husband go pick some up for me with chips and queso for lunch.    I'm on bed rest for pregnancy. I've crocheted for 2 hours today and binge watched Sons of Anarchy. All I want is wine and sushi.  I ordered delivery sushi (cooked) but for some reason the credit card didn't go through despite it working everywhere else. All I wanted was a shaggy dog roll. So I made a pb j and am now just counting down the time until I can go to sleep.    Today's my birthday. I had an appointment with my OB where my urine showed +1 for protein and BP was 140/75. Went to L D triage to be monitored. Everything showed perfect, lab results were perfect.   Doctor decided to put me on modified bed rest anyways. So now I'm off work until I recover from delivery.  No exercising, no working, no heavy cleaning at home.  I can stand up, walk around and do stuff.   This sucks. I'm such an antsy person. I can't stand being home for very long. I have stuff I can learn and work on while I'm at home, it just sucks. Thankfully there isn't a financial burden. And my husband works from home so I have company and help nesting.   Guess I'll learn some VBA, crochet, work on the baby book, plan meals for my husband to cook, and feel my baby move a lot.   Anyone else on bedrest? How do you stay sane???      For the last 3 weeks or so my outer ladybits have felt really sore. I'm currently 32 weeks, and it seems to happen mostly when I'm getting up or walking around.  It's like they've been bruised or something. Ultrasound confirmed last week that baby is now head down (was breech before), so I figure that may be a part of it. But my cervix and inner lady parts don't hurt.   Anyone else feeling this?   The gist of it is this: husband notices I am snoring a lot in first trimester. Noticed one bout of apnea. Snoring continued into second trimester. I went to sleep doctor, did a home sleep test, results inconclusive and they didn't push my insurance to do a lab sleep test. Then the sleep tech at that sleep lab got really creepy, started sending me my results, pics of his son, and other creepy stuff. I reported him and made an appointment with a new doctor.   I'm not gonna dance around it. I'm obese. But for the last month or so my snoring has completely gone away. No bouts of apnea that my husband has noticed. I have so much more energy lately, and all my leg movements during sleep are virtually gone.   The new doctor got authorization for an in-lab sleep test, and the lab is super nice. But my anxiety has been up lately and I'm a little terrified to be away from my husband, hooked up to a ton of machines.   What would you do if you were in my position? Go through with it? Or just cancel it since a majority of the symptoms are now gone?   So I went to the ER earlier this week for dehydration.  I have been drinking at least 3.5L of water per day, monitoring my urine to make sure it's light yellow.  But therein lies the problem.  My pee is either dark yellow or almost crystal clear.  My nurse yesterday at my OB even kept remarking about how my pee was almost clear.  I can't seem to get to that proper light yellow color that I keep hearing about.  I've been drinking one Powerade Zero daily (or using a nuun tablet) to get my electrolytes.  No swelling.  Is urine that's almost clear ok?   I was having such great success on Celexa, but due to baby being dependent and it messing up my chances of breastfeeding, I weaned off of it.  Everything was going really well for 2 months, but this last week has been hell.  I'm terrified of dying during childbirth.  I've looked up statistics and am just convinced I'm going to draw the short straw.  I'm already 28 weeks along, so I'm going to have to birth this baby no matter what.  It really doesn't help that my husband has the same fear, it just affects his life less than mine does.  He knows someone who almost died during childbirth so that is what drives his fear.  I'm giving birth at a branch of one of the top hospitals in the country.  The city I live in has the best medical center in the world.   Yet here I am, still panicking.  Any moms out there?  Can you help me out?  I'm going back to my therapist in a couple of weeks, but I need temporary sanity.   I had been suffering for months, basically since I got pregnant.  I tried everything but nothing really helped me get back to normal until I gave in to my very granola friend:  If you're consistently constipated, try **kefir**, seriously.  It tastes like ass but I swear I was backed up 2 days ago and now my body is like "oh yeah, let's do this!"  I got the kid's kind because I'm not a fan of fermented things.  One tiny bottle of it 2 days ago and my body is happy again.  It's like birds are singing.  I can get it at most grocery stores in my area.  Whole Foods has the most variety.   What other remedies do you ladies have?   21 weeks today and I can honestly say I've never been this exhausted in my life.  I work a desk job and have a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I slept 15 hours yesterday and 12 the day before.    Could this be a sign of GD?  I get exceptionally tired after I have any carbs, which I'm very aware of from doing keto before getting pregnant.  I have had insulin resistance for the last 8 years.  I drink diet cokes for the caffeine, but they don't do much.  Coffee makes me jittery and anxious so I tend to stay away from it.  I did just finish weaning off my Celexa, maybe that has a hand in all of this.  On top of everything I ruined 90% of my maternity wardrobe from leaving a tube of lipstick in my jeans and then drying them with my maternity tops.  I just want to run home screaming and crawl into bed for the next 19 weeks.  HELP.  Edit: OK I'm so thankful to see it's not just me.  For those future mamas who work on your feet, you deserve a parade. I can barely make it through the day just sitting at my desk.      I'm 18 weeks pregnant and because of my growing uterus underneath, my stomach is being pushed out.  I was about 213 before getting pregnant, and I've never had a belly, it's usually flatter (my weight carried in my butt, legs, and thighs).  Now that my baby bump is being pushed out, it just looks like I have a beer belly and it jiggles when I walk :(    Does this ever firm up or will my belly jiggle all throughout pregnancy?   Anyone else experience very light sleeping?  My baby isn't waking me up, nor is my bladder. I just can't sleep more than 45 minutes at a time.   I thought it was my husband's snoring that was waking me up but it happens no matter where I sleep.   I get some relief with Benadryl but I would rather not take it every night. Any suggestions?   BOY!!! All the old wives tales pointed to boy. Husband is so happy, he's a little afraid of girls.   Baby boy was NOT cooperating at the ultrasound. Took orange juice and rolling around and poking him with the wand to get him to move the umbilical cord to give us a peek.   So happy!!!   See below. Bolded e's in a TIL post ~~and a cyrillic(?) letter replacing an A in a gif post title~~  http://i.imgur.com/Qj3AyaM.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/R9ZyTbH.jpg   Dreamt about donuts last night.  Went to Shipley's as soon as I was awake and they were open (at 6:45) and got a huge cinnamon twist, 12 donut holes, and a sausage   cheese kolache.  Was it worth it? I'll say yes now before the sugar crash happens and I'm back asleep at 8:30.      So I was seeing a reproductive endocrinologist until 11 weeks who did ultrasounds every week.  I was then transferred to the OB of my choice, and I admit I didn't do a lot of research.  My current OB is well-established, has a lot of experience, but no ultrasounds in-office and doesn't send me off for another ultrasound until I'm 20 weeks.  I want to find out more information about my fetus before then.  Should I change to another OB?  The only issue I've had so far with my pregnancy is low progesterone which was monitored and treated until 11 weeks.   I'm 13+3 today. Woke up this morning with a little bump and some pain underneath the bump. I've been sleeping on my back. Is it time to start sleeping on my side, or is this pain unavoidable?  Also, when did you buy your pregnancy pillows?    Most people here in the first trimester say they're not "out of the water just yet" in regards to their pregnancy.   Is there a time where you go "whew... This is really happening?" I figure mine will be 24 weeks, viability day. Is there a time before then that you feel the enormous worry weight lifted off your shoulders?  I'm 13 weeks today. I feel the worry lessening as time goes by but I don't think it will completely disappear until I hear that baby cry for the first time    Back story:  Husband and I make decent money, enough to handle a car note.  So I decided last July to trade in my 2003 Corolla and buy a brand new 2013 Prius C for $25k when I still have $30k in student loans to pay off.    Come February and... surprise! I'm pregnant.  My husband and I want to pay off our debt and buy a house.  I figure one of the quicker ways to do this is to trade in my car and get something older.    Still owe $21k on the car, trade in value research shows anywhere from 14k - 19k.  I financed through the dealer who then sold my loan to Fifth Third Bank, which doesn't operate in Texas (where I am).  I have no idea what I'm doing.  I don't even know if it's worth it to trade in for an $8-10k car just to still have to pay on my original car loan.      Edit: thanks for your input! I will be keeping the car, especially since the fuel savings partly make up for the car note. The payment isn't destroying us at all, we still make enough to build up an emergency fund and pay off our debt faster than paying the minimum.    HELP!!!  I have PCOS with insulin resistance.  Before getting pregnant I was doing the keto diet, but now I can't keep anything down but carbs.  I'm bloating like crazy, already gained 12-15 pounds (depending on the day).  My GP and OB are both telling me to take it easy with the carbs, but I can't keep anything else down.  Eating mainly protein and fats make me really queasy and I eventually throw up everything.  I've been surviving on cereal, sandwiches, fruit, and crackers but I can't stop gaining weight.    I'm well aware I'm probably eating too many calories, but with the IR carbs make me hungry....  Anyone have any suggestions?  I've tried nuts, eggs, salads, etc...  I just can't seem to stop eating, and it's all carbs.   I've been seeing an RE since I found out I was pregnant.  At around 6 weeks my progesterone levels were 10-13 so I was put on supplementation just to make sure.  Since then, everything has looked great.  Ultrasounds look textbook, HCG rising perfectly, Estradiol in the right levels.  I was taken off my progesterone supplements last week at 10 weeks (when my levels were 26).  I was told the placenta should start taking over the production.  Went back in yesterday (at 11+3) and my levels were at a 10.1.  I'm terrified.  What if my placenta doesn't take over production enough?  And what's worse is I'm now in a phase where I'm not being overseen by any doctor.  Yesterday was my last day with the RE and I don't see my OB until Tuesday.  So I guess I'll be freaking out until Tuesday.  Any words of advice/encouragement?  I know that 10.1 is technically in the OK range for first trimester, but with the second trimester so close I'm worried I won't be up to 20 by then.    I just need to get this off my chest because I can't stop crying.  I almost hit a family today with my car, pregnant mother included.  I was waiting to back out, letting cars pass me in my tiny Prius C, struggling to look around the big truck parked next to me.  Finally a break in the cars passing, so I start to back out slowly.  Then I see a woman to my right looking terrified, so I stop and look around me and I see a man yelling at me.  I shrug, say "I'm so sorry!", look around me once more and keep backing up.  More yelling as I see a 30 week pregnant woman rushing to walk out of the way as I start to back out again.  Turns out she was in my huuuge blind spot (the corner of my car).  I start crying, yell "I'm so sorry" and finally back out and drive away.  Now I can't stop crying.  I can't be for sure I didn't tap someone with my car because I didn't get out and ask like I should have.  I'm trying to reassure myself that there wasn't frantic screaming as I was trying to pull away, just me getting the finger from the man and yelled at.  I also didn't feel anything as I was backing out.  Now I'm going to live in constant fear for the upcoming weeks that the police are going to show up at my door and haul me away.  Fuck my car's blind spot, fuck my apparently not thorough checking all my mirrors and windows.  At least for once I'm not trying to blame the family, though it did cross my mind for a second.  **EDIT** Thank you all SO MUCH.  I feel so much better.  Went and got my hair cut and have completely calmed down.  DH is even taking me out to dinner to help me feel better too.  Thanks for your kind words and support :)   I'm almost 11 weeks and even though I've seen the ultrasounds and my baby is healthy and growing, I don't feel any emotions.   Husband is freaking out. Asks me "how does it not freak you out that you're growing a human in there??" It just doesn't. I've been hormonal and nauseated, but I don't feel like I've had that "aha" happy moment.   Maybe when I find out the sex I will feel something? Anyone else have this?   So today I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks 1 day.  I've been getting them every week since I'm currently seeing a reproductive endocrinologist.  I went in today and saw the heartbeat!  I also got some blood taken and this is where my question comes from:  Two weeks ago I started Endometrin 100mg once daily.  My levels were at a 13.5 at last week's test.  Then I was upped to 100mg three times daily and I got my blood test back today and my levels went DOWN to 11.5!  I'm freaking out! My doctor hasn't called me yet but I'm so worried.  Anyone been in a similar situation?   I'm 6 weeks 1 day today and we saw the heartbeat!  Nurse said it just started in the last couple of days and it's a little overachiever.   Excited!  Now hoping my bloodwork comes back showing the hormonal supplements are working. I feel like an emotional teenager. Like the world is out to get me or something!   I just need a place to vent:  I'm 5+4 today. My Endometrin dose got bumped to 3x daily.  Today was the first day I took 3 doses and I am so hormonal. I got chewed out for making a mistake on one of my 1000 tasks at work because my boss doesn't know how to listen despite my telling him I can't handle the workload. I broke down in front of him, and he's the kind of boss that sees it as weakness and doesn't care about the reasoning behind mistakes. He just wants a "I made a mistake and it won't happen again", and will flat out say he doesn't care about why it happened.   Then I come home and I'm enjoying a nice evening with my tree-smoking husband. We eat dinner, watch tv, talk a little. About 90 minutes ago he left momentarily. I found out it was to eat an edible and 45 min later he is a different person. I don't mind the occasional bowl, but I hate when he eats them. He won't accept my thoughts that it makes him even more forgetful and ridiculous. He says he's the same as when he smokes, which he isn't.    So now I'm laying in bed crying while he cooks and stinks up the house to satiate his stupid munchies. I'm pretty sure I've cried for a total of 4 hours today.   So that's it. Fuck hormones. I'm popping a Benadryl and going to sleep.   If you made it this far, thanks for reading.    Hi /r/babybumps!  I got the confirmation yesterday that I am pregnant for the first time ever at 4 weeks exactly!  I was due to start Femera and trigger shot at the start of my next cycle but it never came :D  I have PCOS so I'm cautiously optimistic, though my hormone levels are very well managed with diet and Metformin.  I've been put on Endometrin (progesterone suppository) and Estradiol (estrogen supplement) to make sure everything progresses well in the first trimester.  I just can't let myself be fully happy about this, though.  No matter if it's a pregnancy or something else, I can never let myself get my hopes up.  I'm afraid if I do, they will be dashed and everything will go wrong.  But for now I'm cautiously optimistic and happy.  Due around November 2!  Only told immediate family, best friends, work HR, and YOU.    More bloodwork tomorrow to see if the supplements are doing what they need to be doing, then an ultrasound next week!!!   I've been getting suuuper faint positives for the last few days. Got blood test done yesterday and my levels are:  Hcg: 9.11 Prog: 8.23 Estradiol: 90.5   Comparing these to the levels in September (1.5 years off bc)  Hcg: 1.00 Prog: 0.516 Estradiol: 20  Going in for a retest on Monday! I'm nervous about CP or MC since I have PCOS, but my doc said my hormone levels are good and stable, nothing is way off thanks to keto and metformin.    MAYBE BABY. SO EXCITED.    DH and I are 26.  We have been off birth control since May 2012.  We've had all the tests done.  I have PCOS and hypothyroidism but have regular cycles. Doctor says I'm probably just not ovulating.  After getting all the necessary tests done, I met with my reproductive endocrinologist and he suggested Femera with an injection to force ovulation since my numbers look good. He doesn't want to risk Clomid giving me a Kate Gosselin-like situation.  A little disappointed with the price for ultrasounds/labs for my Femera + injection cycle.  We have the money, but we are saving for a house and the payment would set us back almost a month in savings.  I took OPKs this month and they were positive. Hopefully I'm pregnant now, I'm 10DPO and took a test this afternoon.  Faintest line, can't tell if it's an evap line or not.  I drink a shit ton of water so I figure unless it's the first pee of the day, I won't be getting an accurate result.  Bought a FRER for the day AF is due and ClearBlue Digital for a day or two after that.  Dollar store tests until then, because I'm an obsessive tester.  Thanks for reading!   I left the precise numbers at work since I talked to a broker at lunch, but I remember the general gist.  Also, I've read PF's opinion on FHA loans, but bear with me here.  Husband and I are currently spending $1125/month on rent.  We know how much expense goes into buying a house after talking to multiple homeowner family members, but we just have dreams of owning a house and being able to save a little bit more money.  We were originally thinking of a single family home, but after finding out the information below, have been considering a townhome.  We were told that for a $120,000 house in our area, our entire monthly payment will be $1114 at 4.75% interest (a slightly high estimate).   $600+ for principal and interest  $250+ for taxes (not sure what taxes these are)  $120+ for PMI  $100+ for HOI.  I just wanted to know if this VERY ROUGH estimate is accurate for a FHA loan at 3.5% down payment.  Granted we will most likely be going for a 7.5% down payment in a conventional loan, but my husband's frustrated because he seems to have been wrongly estimating for the last year or so of dreaming of home-owning.   Not gonna lie, I've been on and off the keto train since New Years.  I've only gained 3 lbs back, since I'm in the gym and lifting 3x/week and walking a lot more since the New Year  I'm just finding it hard to get back into the groove of things.  I lost my original motivation and I don't know why.  I'm prepping for a meal plan tomorrow for this next week so I don't go off at all.    I just need some help and I figured this thread might help others who are finding it difficult to stay motivated.   Hello everyone!  Not sure what to say on here.  Been lurking for a month or so.  Have been getting more serious about makeup, but still keep my routine to about 10 minutes maximum.  Working on techniques, especially for eyebrows.    I'm 26 years old, married with 2 cats, working in oil and gas IT departments.  Other than makeup I like to doodle (zentangles), occasionally crochet, read, and spend time in the city since I'm currently stuck in the suburbs.    That's about it!           I see pictures online and tutorials of ladies who do this, but I feel like my lips are so defined (even towards the corners) that if it goes outside my natural lip line, it looks unnatural and messy  Is it just one of those things that's not for everyone?      If this belongs in another subreddit please let me know.  I don't think I'm breaking any rules by asking this here.  I've been using some of the online "try on a hairstyle" things.  I can't decide if I like how they look or not.  I'm chubby and I have a round face, though it has slimmed down significantly since the start of my weight loss.    My husband says I need a pointier face to pull off short haircuts. Can any of you with more experience and less personal bias help me?   Current hair (no styling, just washed and air dried): http://imgur.com/WAZNn48  Album of "try ons" (hair would still be brown): http://imgur.com/a/dbQYm  Any feedback would be appreciated.    I know these aren't the best representations, but it's honestly the best I could do with these types of programs.     I hope it's ok to x-post!  [album](http://imgur.com/a/wErK2)  SW: 229 CW: 216 GW: 155  I got really discouraged last night because the scale has only moved 13 lbs in the last 2.5 months, so I took another progress picture and compared from my first week. I chalked my lack of scale progress to my PCOS and hypothyroidism (both medicated), but seeing the small changes I've made makes me want to keep going! Down 1.5 sizes in the pants, shirts are getting a little looser.  Lifting progress is slow, but what I see is a pretty big difference!  Don't be discouraged!  Lifting schedule is:  Monday/Thursday: Upper Body  Tuesday/Friday: Lower Body  Upper Body: Bench, tricep pushdown with rope attachment, face pulls with rope (not sure of technical name for this), bicep curls, shoulder press, lat pulldown  Lower body: Leg press, squats, deadlifts, calf raises, lunges, adduction machine, abduction machine  Wednesday and the weekends are rest or cardio days depending on how I feel.  Eating around 1800 calories/day, never going over 24 g carbs.

Down 1.5 sizes in the pants, shirts are getting a little looser. Don't be discouraged!    I'm currently on W6D2 of a modified C25K called Run 5K (iPhone app).  I usually run around my apartment complex, that way if I start to have a panic attack I can just go back upstairs and relax.  But I've got a race coming up on Thanksgiving.    I'm well aware that exercise releases endorphins and can make it better, which it seems to about half the time.  I've gotten through all my runs except one without an incident.    I'd just like to hear experiences  of others with anxiety on this program and with their 5k.  I'm running with a friend and her mom, but they're both faster than I am.  I'm slow as molasses so I'll most likely be alone for the race.   Even if you're not done yet, it'd be nice to hear others' experiences.  I've been on keto for about a month now and no matter what I do, I cannot get below 220lbs. Right now I'd just like to hear others' experiences.   My husband came up with this to satisfy a craving earlier this week.  I was planning on making keto pumpkin pie, so we had a can of pureed pumpkin. This is what he did:  **Ingredients**  1/2 cup pureed pumpkin  .5 tbsp pumpkin pie spice  1-2 packets splenda  Whipped Cream  **Instructions**  Mix the first 3 ingredients. Taste to see if it's sweet/spiced enough.  Nuke in the microwave for 30 seconds - 1 minute (optional).  Top with some whipped cream.  EAT.  It's super low calorie, *maybe* clocking in at 100 calories if you use canned whipped cream. You'll get a bit of the raw pumpkin twang that you lose when baking a pumpkin pie, but i find it's easy to ignore.    I have been missing margaritas something fierce.  I live in Texas and always got a big frozen one when I would go out to get Mexican food.  My mother-in-law found [these](http://www.zilchmixers.com/) at the liquor store and they are pretty good!  Nothing like a true margarita with sugary sweet sour mix, but they do nicely.  Just FYI for anyone else out there missing their margaritas.     I need to fill my instagram with fit women.  I currently follow mankofit and yoga_girl, but I need more. Unfortunately google doesn't have many good results for this question  	117
                      Holy fuck, anyone know this woman's name?   /r/HighHeels    No bother at all :)   Found out on another sub, it's Cora Skinner :)   Dammit, I was trying to find some links to go with the names, but my internet is being shit, so I'll just give you the names.  Charlotte Poole  Nicola McLean  Gemma Hiles  Cara Brett  Chanelle Hayes  Sophie Reade      To each his own I suppose, but as far as bimbos go I certainly don't rate her the hottest in the UK, and not even on the radar when it comes to the whole world!   Ah yeah, that was it, cheers :) I'll keep it here then, I'll let the mods decide whether or not to remove it :)      Ah, thank you so much. Was the picture in this sub do you know? Or is it ok to leave it here?         This picture is sure to get some love in /r/tightdresses :)   This picture was posted either on this sub or on /r/legs, I'm not sure which. The reason I'm posting it here (and there) is because someone ID'ed her last time, and I've forgotten her name and really want to get more pics of her! If anyone can link me to the re-post (I couldn't find it), then I'll take this down. If it's not a re-post, I'll keep it here.

I was under the impression that the Full Combat Rebalance mod was created by one of the developers, is that right?.

I wonder why they're less common in certain places.               How can you tell? I'm rubbish at spotting photoshopped stuff :(   I absolutely love me a bit of Jordan Carver, but if this isn't a sweater, then I don't see how it's appropriate here. I'm not trying to be a dick, I know this sub doesn't get a lot of posts, but I do think we should stick to what the sub is about, otherwise what's the point of it?            From my experiences of cycling, there does seem to be a nice camaraderie between those of us who travel that way, particularly in cities. Often, when I stop at the lights and another cyclist pulls up, I'll start chatting to them, making the whole journey that bit more pleasant. That doesn't seem to exist with those who drive, but I realise that's because you're both in a box on wheels, and winding down the window to shout across to the other driver does seem a bit crazy. They'd probably be terrified more than anything!  But anyway, yes, this guy was being an arsehole.  ETA: I know these guys aren't on bicycles, but I would imagine there's a similar unspoken bond.   I've never been one to comment on what I think is a poor post, I just downvote and move on, but I have to break my silence for this. The joke here appears to be that OP has found something shaped like a Capri Sun carton, but it actually contains soup, is that right? The only way I can see how that would be even remotely funny, nevermind get almost 2000 upvotes, is if these cartons were a novelty or a new item where the OP was from, is that the case? I've seen a few comments here which make me think it could be.  In the UK, at least, these pouches have been on the shelves for years for all sorts of things.

They're so commonplace that it wouldn't even enter my mind that it's like a Capri Sun bag.   Ah well, to each his own I suppose! I'm off to buy aforementioned products and reap sweet karma!    I'd love it if someone recognised him and he was prosecuted. There's precedent for it apparently, according to one of the links in the comments.  [Link](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/ryan-waterman-florida-man_n_2716846.html)   It reminds me of the picture that was on here recently of the guy planking a tiger in one of those sanctuaries. Harassing an animal for no other reason than an attempt to get a few laughs is pretty pathetic.

And that mane of red hair is awesome :)   I'm genuinely curious as to what it is you find so bad about this picture. I realise you said the majority of the pics, which doesn't necessarily include this one, but that's the implication, seeing as you posted here.  She's wearing a tight dress, what else are you looking for?   How do you guys do this? I keep posting smaller pictures because I don't know how to make them high res like that.   Thank you :)   Ah thanks mate :-) I think I've always just called light blue turquoise so I'll be more careful in the future.    I think I need to get my eyes checked. I can see a light turquoise tinge in that dress but it appears I'm the only one!   I added a couple already :-) I've subbed to it, I love bandage dresses I'll post more pics when I see them :-)                              Thanks mate :-)   I'll dig around for it when I get back from work.                Can't believe I didn't recgonise her, she's one of my favourite bimbos!   Ah, sorry, didn't know the name so went by the heading on the picture which said Nichole Roedder for some reason.

I don't mean speculation at the time when Ferguson was leaving and there was still a vacancy to be filled. I mean this utterly pointless speculation about what might be if Mourinho had become Man United manager. Like I said, there are a ton of 'what if's' you could come up with that would affect the league. It's absolute drivel, and it's made worse so when you consider his position on the site. Is this really the best that the BBC's top sports writer can come up with?   I don't, sorry :(   Yeah it's the speculative nature of the post I'm alluding to. This guy is the chief sports writer for the BBC and he just comes out with the most inane stuff.   Speculation is for the tabloids as far as I'm concerned. You could literally speculate all day on football matters! What if Rooney had gone to Chelsea? What if Wenger had spent more money? etc. etc. It's such poor quality.   As far as I'm aware they went straight for Moyes on Ferguson's advice. But even if they had, the headline would have to read 'What if Mourinho had chosen Man United?'.  It's just so shoddy!   I would love nothing more than to say I took this picture myself, but sadly this is not the case.  I'm afraid I don't have a source, sorry :(   Yeah, it was the calves that got me!  No name I'm afraid, sorry :(   This guy has to be one of the biggest hacks around. When it comes to the Premier League I'm entirely neutral, but even I can see that he writes an inordinate amount of articles related to Man United, and this is his latest cutting-edge offering:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25758108  The chief sports writer, penning an article based on a 'what if?'. It's ludicrous. And to name the article 'What if Man Utd had chosen Mourinho?' is idiotic in itself - Mourinho was never offered the United job!  I wish they'd sack him and use the money they save to bring back 606!!        	183

Good luck!   It's funny because part of the building is up for lease too. Farewell imaginary government agency.  	9
 First of all, Sir Ian, thank you for being a great British actor and LGBTQ activist - you make me proud to be British. Is there anything about your career that you want to change/a new direction you want to go in? Have you regretted roles you've done? And what's your favourite wizard joke? Thank you very much for taking the time in indulge our curiosities. :D  	1
 Looks like  "Rheumatoid Arthritis" to me.   This is great, I like your job. First, i think it is real as everyone does, As an Omnia 7 user, I felt depressive; than I think there is so much renovations there. You've done a great job sir.  	2
 I'm a female and I hate this. Some of the women who fight for 'equal rights' just want the good stuff, not any of the bad things. They want equal pay and all that, but they still want the guy to pay for dinner. It pisses me off. Equal means equal, not sorta the same but we still get to walk all over men.   I know :( I'm really sad.   I'm really looking forward to that thunderstorm, too.   I think I know this guy. The guy I know is named Gary, has the same car, and is way too good at DDR...   Is it possible to fix it?   http://i.imgur.com/QrhmP.png  Every time I restart my computer, any Steam game icon looks like an IE page instead. I can give it a short term fix by manually changing the icon, but it ends up changing back when I restart again. I tried the ClientRegistry.blob trick, and made new desktop icons, but only L4D2 and MTG actually fixed, and when I restarted later, the L4D2 icon was back to the IE icon. Steam is updated, I've verified the integrity and all that.  It's not impairing my ability to play the games at all, but it looks ugly and I hate it. Googling the problem hasn't helped beyond a short term fix. I could just not have icons on my desktop, but I like having them there. As you can see, it only happens with Steam game shortcuts. If I link directly to the game instead of through Steam, it has a normal icon, but then it doesn't play through Steam.  Any help you could offer would be awesome. Thank you.   I found out he was a real person when I did one of those "What famous people were born on your birthday?" things and Johnny Appleseed was on the list.   I KNEW she looked like someone else.   Sept 26? That's me too.   yep! I love the Persona series :) Pretty much anything Atlus publishes, I adore.   Ugh, people keep commenting on that. It's just fingerprint smudges. I know, don't touch the computer screen, but I do it anyway. They are exaggerated because of the flash on the camera....   It is the same brand. What is 5htp? I am just taking D3 at the suggestion of my doctor.   As someone who honestly didn't know how to just "clean my room", basic tips like the ones I gave r2002 were very helpful for me. I can clean a basic mess, but this is a little beyond that.   I'm 25.   Thank you :)   i never thought i'd see mgs ever again   No, they're vitamin D3. They are the same brand though!   I do have a hamper, actually. It was full of clothing that I didn't want. It was also sitting in the laundry room. I got rid of the clothing, and the hamper is in my closet!   Everyone gets depressed occasionally. For someone who doesn't have clinical depression, it's rarely half as severe as those who do have that. Clinical depression invades your life and takes over and it's very easy to let it. It's like this thing that lives on my shoulder and weighs me down, and whispers awful things in my ear that make me want to just curl up in a ball and not do anything. It feeds on my energy and makes even getting out of bed sometimes a huge ordeal. Depression is more than sadness. It's apathy. It makes things that I love uninteresting.  I went a little out of control with my description but basically what I'm trying to say is, depression sucks out all of your energy and motivation. Some people would look at a room that was messy and think, I need to clean this! And then they would clean it. I would look at my messy room and think, this is a disaster and I don't know how to deal with it. Trying to deal with it would overwhelm me. It took someone else's help to get it like this, but it's going to be all on me to keep it like this, and depression is going to fight me every step of the way.  And thank you :)   Okay, I didn't know what that was so I looked it up. I'm assuming you mean the vitamin bottle? It's vitamin D3.   i'm pretty sure it was yesterday.  also this is the guy who helped me clean my room, and also, i do actually know him. his name is not daniel.   No, just asked a friend to help me out. It helped a LOT.   BIG whoop de fuckin doo! Try being unmotivated and depressed and getting ANYTHING DONE.  I thought /r/GetMotivated was for people who needed motivation for anything, and wanted to celebrate their achievements that required some kind of motivation. This is mine.  I'm sorry if it's not a huge deal for you.   Haha! Yeah! UFYH is awesome!! I got the 20/10s from there and they are a LIFE SAVER   Do it!!!! I believe in you!!!!!   * Ask for help! I could not have done this without help, seriously. * Clean in increments. Clean for 20 minutes, take a 10 minute break. * Clean one spot at a time. Don't look at the whole mess and try to clean it all at once! That is an easy way to get overwhelmed. * Don't just rearrange the mess. Don't hide it. Bring lots of trash bags and not just for trash. Anything you don't want can go in those to donate! I felt a lot better knowing the shoes I was hoarding weren't just going in the trash, but to someone who might actually wear them. * Separate things into piles and then deal with the piles. Like with like. Papery stuff, stuff you wear, I had a pile of electronic stuff. Then sort through each pile individually. * Clean the space you are in the most first. I spend most time at my desk, so I cleaned my desk.   It actually uploaded the pictures in the wrong order, and duplicated some? I already posted it over there though, I should have done individual pictures for the text post.   Thanks for minimalizing my disorder! You might just be a slob.   Yes. It's hard to be motivated to do things like keep a clean environment, and if it's bad enough, even eat, shower, or do any basic day-to-day things that a non-depressed or otherwise "normal" person is able to do without really putting much thought into it.    I do have a Ryuk plush. I got him a long time ago, before Death Note was finished. I haven't gone to a con in a couple of years, but I've been to A-Kon, Ikkicon, and Ushicon!   I threw out Dream Phone, but damn, Mall Madness is way better.   For me, anime and depression do not correlate, so I'm not really sure. I didn't even care about anime until I had been dealing with it for a long time, and I'm not really as into as I used to be. I still really enjoy and love Fullmetal Alchemist, though, so I didn't want to take any of it down.   Actually, I got most of my stuff from when the original anime was big and Greedling was barely a thing. I am a HUGE fan of the manga/Brotherhood!   Once I got my computer set up again in the corner, I did turn on some music. It helps my mood a lot!  	34
 My LGS is having sealed commander tournement.  Which deck do you think has the best shot at winning? Which deck seems like the worst?   I noticed you are making a casual deck and didn't include balance, tinker, channel or fastbond. This should probably be fixed...   Thank you for your input! I included a couple more duals as well as nixing the storm cards, I tried forcing it a couple times and it was far too weak. I was kinda aiming for a more multicolor oriented cube. Should I add more multicolor to emphasize this? Or will this just weaken my cube overall?      	4
 Any tips for while I'm in school besides breathing? Also no recreational drug use?   Thanks ill try this!

Passion Pit- Little Secrets    No way! so am i! I saw icona pop open for Passion Pit a few months back and i fell in love instantly. Not usually my genre but its so good!   thats a new way to look at it!

I have a therapist and she has explained that it's natural and that i should try not to let things get me anxious. easier said than done....   While i'm at school i have this problem of getting really high anxiety over something and having to leave class and vomit for 10 or so minutes. It only happened rarely at first but it has slowly gotten to about 2 or 3 times a week. Anyone have (or had) a similar problem?

 I've used those cheap travel sized deodorants after shaving or when I get ingrown hairs, works wonders. Of course I wouldn't use it right before hooking up, would taste gross I imagine.   Why not talk about your job? I feel like for most people in their mid twenties it's a common experience.   Aww:)   People talk about gay and straight people all the time, no one says gay and normal. That's not really a fair comparison either. Being gay requires not treatment or feelings of dysphoria that often come with being trans.   hole concept of maleness and femaleness  heh   I'd rock the hell out of that outfit. I would love to find something similar at broke college kid prices.   Interesting, I was born a female (identify as well) and went through the same thing. Hated my budding breasts as a middle schooler and broke down in tears when I got my period. I wore sports bras all the time to try and conceal them. Felt like my life was over for some reason. I remember getting into epic battles with my mother over wearing dresses to church,  but I was not having any of that shit.  I'm 23 now and am no longer uncomfortable with myself. It's really weird how this stuff (identify and so forth) works. For what it's worth I am a lesbian though. I hope you get the change you desire!   Can I ask how you correlate breasts with womanhood? Many women (like my sister for example) are practically flat-chested or have them removed for surgical reasons, but don't seem to feel dysphoria. What is it about your penis that bothers you? I'm just trying to understand what you're feeling. Would you rather have a vulva, clitoris, period etc?   They're thumb thumbs from the Spy Kids movie.    [My first thought](http://www.halftime.georgetownvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/thumb-thumbs-spy-kids-_140248-fli_1374075531.jpg)   Sorry I only use credit cards    Plasma is one component of your blood, among other things. They separate it from the red blood cells, those go back into your body.   Former Biolife employee here, there's a lot of in-house training that goes into doing phlebotomy (needle sticks). While the majority of the people in a center aren't nurses (maybe 4 tops) there's a ton of reading and training videos to go through before you even do a stick and then a month of shadowing before you're able to do sticks on your own. If you're not cut out for handling needles you'll get stuck doing reception.   I used to work for Biolife and can say the in-house training for phlebotomy (needle skills) is top notch. Can't speak for other center though.   The penis   Weird how genetics work like that.   estrogen ridden version of my mom  Wouldn't it be testosterone ridden? Assuming you're male.   That bomb pussy!   Can anyone tell me a good website to watch these kids movies? Most of them aren't on Netflix.   Instructions unclear, girl ripped in half   Smart! I want one too now.    Red Starburst would like a word with you   Pics of balls for science? (female here!)   AAALLLL the right junk, in all the right places.   No, Xanax is a benzodiazepine which has more of a sedative, muscle relaxant effect, very good for panic attacks.   Beta blockers can mediate the physical effects of anxiety, like the fight or flight response. Such as increased heart rate, sweating etc. It has other medial uses also.    Same here friend. It was never really a problem until one summer I had eight different flights in a two month time span. During a physical I mentioned the terrible anxiety I get during flights and my doctor prescribed me a beta blocker, propranolol and it worked wonders. Totally calm during the whole flight and it doesn't make me tired.    I really want to move to Oakland after I finish with my master's. Is the crime in Oakland as people make it out to be or is it isolated to certain areas?   First off, I really enjoyed your post! Second, forgive me if this is a dumb question but where do you meet other black lesbians at? I swear I've exhausted all my POC options and can't find non-white girls for the life of me. Like you, I can't really see myself with a white girlfriend and I like femmes (also femme), but I feel like white chicks are my only option or remain single for the foreseeable future lol. My going to school at a PWI in a small Midwestern town might have something to do with it:/ I really want to move   Thanks bro!    Explain please? I'm interested.    Where did you move from, if you don't mind my asking. I'm black as well and considering moving to Portland after I'm done with school. I live in Iowa now and I need somewhere more queer friendly.    I found the statistic about black physicians really interesting. I'm in the process of applying to medical schools while working on my master's at a PWI in the midwest. My freshman year there were lots of other POC that were pre-med and pre-dental hopefuls. By my senior year most had changed to something else or dropped out. I wonder what HBCUs do right that PWIs are getting wrong?   Same here:/, wanna be my first? ;)   If you're the athletic sort, my city's rugby team is chock-full of lgbts.   Thanks, much appreciated.   Do you have a source/citation for the third link?   When you first said V8 I was picturing that vegetable drink, thinking really?   Girl here, I've had it and it's awesome! But yeah mostly associate with males.   IMO, he still deserves to be treated like a human being with feelings. Someone should let him know he's "that guy".   I feel bad for you bro. Time for new friends if they have a history of treating you this way.   Done and done   Would guys seriously be attracted to this approach?   :(   Goku with an attitude.

I'm on android and the Reddit News app is ok by me. Ipad apps suck though.   People complain about reposts, but if people didn't repost I would miss most of the good content.   Will this cause you to lose the karma the comment garnered?    Same with the "Mom's spaghetti" joke. Ridiculously upvoted or sent to the oblivion.    kind of  I've tagged many of the racist Redditors I've come across. The number is startling.    This just happened to me today. Apparently as a black person I have no right to exist.   Hornets don't have internet access   If I'm at home I wash my hands before I flush the toilet. I'm afraid if I flush and then wash, the water will mix and I'll have shitty water on my hands.   What exactly is the right consistency?   Even in public?   Brother!   Diagram or detailed explanation please? I've always wanted to this!   Me too, make my poops much faster. My gf was a little weirded out though. "Why do you have a step stool in front of the toilet?"   Just shoot the curtain instead. That way you know whatever it is is dead.   Same, and use my foot to flush the toilet. Unless it's one of those dreaded automatic flushers.   Wow, sounds like a great routine. I barely leave enough time to shower and brush my hair before I leave in the morning.

Also, the way you spelled it sounds like dark magic or something.

Salt and vinegar chips, they hurt my mouth so damn good.   asperagus   I've never had autistic vegetables before.

Dude I'm black and I asked my mom this question when I was in kindergarten. When this girl said black I was picturing chalkboard black when I'm more the color of Werther's candy.   I've never committed any crime worse than jay walking, I'm a graduate student, and I'm not rude. You're quite rude actually. Your sweeping generalization fails.    I'm Black, explain to me exactly why I'm shit?   There's black people in Russia??   Yes milking the Dad won't work   My sister wanted to have her pregnancy stretch marks colored in with a tattoo to hide them, is this a bad idea?   I think that sometimes happens when people don't have regular contact with animals. My dad was like this until I adopted a husky, and soon my dad worried about the dog's feelings as much as ours. It made me smile when he took the dog out for a run with him because "he looked like he needed some entertainment." They've definitely bonded over time.    I'm curious, what was the third doggie doing when the other two were taking the polar plunge?    How much are you paying per month on their unlimited plan?   Iowa here, sounds good to me!   Man I only got Gamecast   The first time I felt like I actually fit in somewhere. In high school I was the sweet, but incredibly awkward kid. No one in particular picked on me, but you get tired of always feeling like the odd man out. It sucks to feel like you missed out on milestones and memories. Come freshman year of college I was determined to change my life and not be an observer anymore. I found some balls and went to the rugby team's practice session alone and inexperienced, and had a blast! For once being an athletic female who likes video games didn't make me weird.   Five years later many of those people are still my best friends and they totally shaped my college experience. I even met my first longterm relationship through a teammate. It's awesome to have a group of friends that feel like family and to let your guard down with.    Dexter?   Grandma might be in better shape than OP. I swear my grandma has better knees than I do, basketball destroyed mine.   My niece could take her first legal drink before I could. Kinda funny!

They are lightweight and ear pads are very comfy: [Sennheiser HD 598](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-598-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0042A8CW2/ref=sr_1_5?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-5) 2.

Sound is good for my songs that are rock or hip-hop based. Probably the most aesthetically pleasing out of the bunch. 4.

    I personally am in in any capacity to do so because of health reasons. But I'll pass the message one to those concerned. Thank you for your advice.   I am aware of that, but it's daunting. I'll try my best. Thank you!         Rollins and Ambrose are going neck and neck in terms of performances. I think Seth is the best worker on the mat and his matches are always entertaining.   Seeing the individual brilliance of Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins, and to a certain extent that of Roman Reigns, it seems like WWE has got it right with the story line, don't you think?   Oh, thanks. I'll repost it in the right subreddit.   Thanks for your reply. I think that FTL travel may be achieved in the future. The idea may seem fantasy-like and hypothetical right now, but so did most technology that we use now a few decades back. I am not writing to the moderators directly. I hope you will reconsider.   I recently discovered the Stargate franchise. Being a sci-fi fan, I couldn't believe that I had missed it all this while. I watched the first movie after getting hooked to Stargate Universe's pilot. Since then, I have been watching Stargate SG1. I think that with the basic premise of Stargates, terraforming technology creating many earth-like planets, and the presence of superior races, almost every possible fantasy/scenario can be taken care of.   For example, the Alien Universe (The Engineers = Ancients in Stargate), Game of Thrones/The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings (terraformed planets with transplanted earthlings coexisting with apparently alien species), the Marvel/DC universes (Thor franchise is directly mentioned), etc.   What do you all think?      If you can believe that people on the other side of the world on the internet want to listen to you, it's likely that there are people in your immediate vicinity who will be. Just remember this - you are not an idiot/moron/bad person. Your brain and the chemical inside are making you feel this. Have you tried seeking professional help? If not, I would encourage you to do it.   I will share with you an anecdote. A few years back, I was reeling under the first wave of full-fledged clinical depression. I was stubborn/obstinate and decided that there was no point in living anymore. I was then in a long-distance relationship. My then boyfriend listened to me and asked me to give myself 6 months. After 6 months, if I felt the same, he said he would let me do it. During the 6 months, however, my boyfriend got through to my friends and was able to start me on medication. That helped. I was able to cope better.  Maybe you can also do that. Here's a hug. Wish it were a real one.  	12

 http://9gag.com/gag/aKgyWEW?ref=android.s    Mostly just unsettling...   Yeah, that's awesome. Much appreciated!   Laughed far too much at this!    I thought I was the only one!    I also hate Christmas and birthdays. Just don't see what the fuss is all about.   It drives me insane. A friend of mine finds the sound of a clock ticking calming, meanwhile I'm over here going out of my mind    It makes a lot more sense now, and I think the situation right now might be the cause of it.  Thank you for the replies, it's greatly appreciated :)    Yeah I do fear that. I don't think he would do that again though, but it's always a thought in the back of my mind.   I only met my dad 2 years ago. He was never there as I was growing up, but over the 2 years we've been close, although recently it hasn't been the same because he lives 25ish miles away.    The title is pretty self explanatory. I (18/F) keep dreaming that my dad dies, it has happened every night this week and it's starting to really get to me.   Awesome tattoos dude :)   Ah, this is amazing!   Yes! All the time. Loved that episode   	14
 Wasn't particularly intending for it to be taken as woman-blaming, probably just worded it wrongly. Rejection from women was most likely not the cause, but I bet you it exacerbated the problem.   Probably should have put 'people' instead of 'women',sorry. Although, I would  make the assumption that the people most creeped out by these guys would generally be women.  But you're right, it isn't the women's fault for rejecting them. The sad thing is, it's most likely no one's fault. These guys are just unlucky products of something that must've happened in their past that royally fucked up their ability to form relationships with the opposite sex. The problem probably compounded overtime as they faced rejection because of it, which in turn made them more desperate for some connection, which in turn made them more creepy, which in turn made them become more and more alienated to the point where they rely on dolls to obtain any form of intimacy.  Now they're at the point were rejection is an expected outcome for probably any desire for a relationship because of this world they've created to hide from society's branding of them as a creep, a world ,which in turn, makes them even more unnerving to people.  It's pretty sad.        Can confirm that I use this site as a crutch. Not so much on the 'making friends' part,though. I'm as poor at making friends in the virtual world as I am at making them in the physical world.   Not always as easy as it sounds. Would you want to talk to these kinds of guys? They've likely been abused/rejected by women for most of their life,so I can easily see how spending all this money on something that won't reject them could be feasible,rather than possible constant rejection by real people. There's only so many times you can be alienated before you go a little crazy.   Giving her the old Kalishinyourkova.   Looks awesome, bugs and all. Have they hinted at a release date yet?   It's all a ruse,I'll tell ya! OP has us duped!   That I can dislocate and relocate my hip.  When I was little, I used to continuously dislocate and relocate my hip when I was frustrated. Like *pop* in *pop* out *pop* in. Thought everyone could do it.   Apparently not.   Is it already in the files? How'd you get it to appear in-game?   Good point. Common sense doesn't come naturally to me for some reason. Editing post.    If you don't want to read the whole thing, an analysis of a couple of chapters or so is fine.  Edit:[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9NEUm1X4z32cW0wVkRuVVlHQk0/edit?usp=sharing)  Thanks guys. :)   I've got a PhD in Cunt.   I'll designate myself for that matter. I studied Cunt Identification Studies for four years.   I'm 5'7", therefore I shall be King of the Shortmen.   This kind of makes me sad.    Do you think a 280x, i5 2500k and 8GB RAM would be enough to play this at at least medium?      Looks fucking fantastic.      Fuck.  Every time I start to feel just a little better about myself, I see shit like this. Christ, what's the fucking point in attempting anything if you're unattractive? Even if you 'improved your life', gained hobbies, yadda yadda, people will still treat you as some kind of subhuman.   I mean, fuck. Fucking insulted by compliments from ugly men? I hate existence.   Cool, thanks! It's around 16000 words,though. Do you want me to just send over a sample chapter, or the whole thing?   May as well jump on board as well. Do you read sci-fi fantasy? I could really do with some proper crit. My mum is not a very  unbiased reader.      Mate, this is how we all dance. Even the sheilas. Even the koalas. Everyone.   Got me VB, got me stubbies. Time for a gabba.   Is this for real? Or is it a scam? Sorry, I'm a little too careful sometimes.   My friends and family all think I have something planned for the future, and that I care about my uni degree. Truth is, I can't even imagine living out more than a few more years without eventually committing suicide.   I doubt this.  I have overheard random strangers discussing my face with the exact same opinion as myself.    This is what I'm worried about. I keep thinking that I'm going to waste the minimal almost non-existent chance I have of finding someone and being happy because I'm so fucked up socially/emotionally, and that the rest of my life is going to be empty and much worse off. I'm pretty much awaiting the day when I finally become certain of killing myself as opposed to being undecided as I am now.    Depression.  It slowly but surely leached all meaning from them. I keep thinking 'Why bother doing anything when my life's shit anyway.I don't really want to keep living,so why then should I pretend to care about anything in my life?'   I don't really have passions anymore.  First my passion for writing died,then reading and now even gaming does nothing for me.  I'm like an empty shell.    I would want to date her but I'm pretty sure I'd have like a 0.001% chance as I'm not the best looking dude and I weigh the same as most women my age.  I don't usually do anything social, so I probably wouldn't have anything better to do but I'd probably be miserable anyway.   I used to get stuck on the Zeppelin between Kalimdor and Lordaeron for hours at a time.   Hey,guys  So I just received an invitation from a girl in one of my uni classes to go to her birthday party. A bunch of people from this particular class have been invited, so I'm not under any special consideration or anything. However I don't really talk to anyone much in the class, so I was a bit surprised when I got the invite. There will also be a whole bunch of people there that I haven't met before so I'm worried that if I go, I will pretty much isolate myself as I don't really 'know' anyone.  What should I do?   I am the first person in existence to speak Othenai.   Eh, haircut or no haircut, I still look like a spaz.   Bugger.  I'm actually an ugly cunt, so seeing all of the people on here who aren't actually that ugly and still FA makes me feel kind of shitty.  Hopefully you fools will use my pictures to motivate yourselves as it's definitely not your looks holding you back. Get out there!  Edit: Picture time is over.    Did I tell you how much I smoke w33d? im liek a [-3] now   I'm a guy, I think it could be a little weird if I rubbed vaginal scent behind my ears.   My gooch is sparkly fresh every day and I've never been laid.  Edit: I think I may have been misunderstood. A gooch is slang for your perineum ( the skin between your arse and your knob) not for vagina. I'm a dude, I wash my gooch, not my vagina.    Depends how much effort you want to put into world building.   If I were to name a new world, I would probably base its name off of the language of the main character/dominant culture/who is telling the story in the world. You don't necessarily have to create the entire language of the most dominant culture but if you align the world's name with the same distinct style as, say, the cities of this culture, it would give it a unique flavour.    My dad went through this exact same procedure! They also took bone from his wrist to use as cartilage for the new nose. His doesn't look so fancy,though.   Very little nowadays. Even when I laugh I feel pretty empty.    It makes you feel that  the only solace and acknowledgment you will ever receive is from the wheels of an oncoming train.   Ah,ok.  Haven't really heard much about neuroplasticity  outside of the small amount of time I spent reading about it for my linguistics classes, so I'm definitely uninformed on the matter.   humans aren't locked in like you seem to think.  Maybe not so much for Alphas and Betas, but most of the stuff I've read pretty much condemns Omegas to a lifetime of mediocrity and inadequacy.    I have no idea what you are talking about as far as Omega's and your pyramid but I will say a few things  Pyramid structure probably wasn't the right term to use, I'll change that. Cheers.  As for the 'fake it till you make it', I have trouble wondering how someone would go about doing that, basing their entire life off a false persona. It is really that easy?   Right here with you,mate. I'll sit in the same spot for the majority of the weekend imagining the happy, eventful lives of others.   All the time,man.  I know that to get better and actually live a good life', I am going to have to drastically change the way I look/behave/think. Knowing this makes me bitter, and so I tell myself that even after all my struggles to get better, if I choose to get better, I'll be a totally different person and I'll hate myself for it. I'll hate myself and, more so,I'll direct that hatred onto others.   I still believe that happiness isn't something that I'm allowed to achieve in the end; I'm just not meant to ever get it, and that if I do,it will be unnatural.    Great, now I have to cancel my tickets.  Fuck.  	50
 You're a great person for wanting to help her,I admire you for it ! x  I'd just say,do things with her that you both like often,it will be great time for you guys as well as keeping her mind off of shit. Be there for her if she needs to talk,especially if you suspect she's been feeling particularly low since she might not be upfront about it.  Love in itself helps at lot !    I "lost" the love of my life few months ago,unable to let go too and shit,the situation is nowhere near as bad as your friends' tho but i want to try my best to help.  He might not be able to cut all contact with her for now ( i know i can't ) but it would be good if he tried to slowly let go of her,if she sends him a text maybe he could try to let time pass before answering. Then try to take more and more time to answer every..time. Yeah. Does he still have the hope he can "get" her back ?     Yeah.. I hope it happens before I go completely nuts because that shit ain't going anywhere good smh. Thank you for the support through it's very nice of you ! :)   If you want to talk about it I'm here,I know how scary it can get man I see my sanity going down the drain and it's fucking terrifying :/  What made things go this way ? ( if you don't mind the question,through)    	4
 Yay!! Welcome to Reddit!!!   Fantastic tips, I would definitely look into it!   Thank you for the /r/BeautyGuruChat - definitely helpful!!!   :O I love this set up!!   Eyebrow shape suggestions and lipstick colors?? http://i.imgur.com/tsjIOpC.jpg/2   I created my own make up channel recently and I feel that it'd be a great journey for me; to help me learn new things at the same time while making videos and grow.  I also believe this will hone my skills over time.  Are there any tips you can give while creating videos? What should I do and shouldn't do?  Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks!   Thank you so much for the CC, I'll keep that in mind with the mascara, eyeliner, and the lipstick shade :)   I just noticed the lower left picture that has a black line on my face - my fault.

 Hi /r/buddhism   I know you mostly don't like questions asking for help... Or x-posts. That is why I hesitated quite long to post this here... But yesterday he told me again how close he is to doing it (and that he feels good that way...) So I've got nothing to loose. I feel that my time to find a solution is running out.   I am by no means an experienced buddhist... I just try to follow the path and help people in my life. Maybe you understand why I have such trouble to just let him die.   **tl;dr: I guess all of this boils down to the question: Should I try to keep someone alive who wants to die? How do I find out if I only try to not have to deal with his death. Or only allow him to die because my life would be easier then? How can I make the right decision for his good. What weights more, his suffering being alive or the suffering of the people (his parents, friends, brother) who would loose a loved one to suicide?** _____________________________ He has been suicidal for over 7 years, since before we met. He has been in therapy for years, inpatient and outpatient, tried out a lot of drugs, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. He has made an attempt before we became a couple, said that he could not go through with it because of me.  We've been together for 4.5 years now. There have been good days, but the majority were bad. We talked a lot. That is one good thing, I guess, like he puts it "our metacommunication is outstanding". He is a psych student, ironically. He explained his feelings of vanity in deep. I listened and tried to help. Was compassionate, held him when he cried, tried to make anything going for him, helped him through assignments and work, when he had given up on it. And I understood. I am mentally ill myself. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger, still fight with self-harm. I really understand how this world can seem meaningless. I found my purpose and goals. And I really tried to help him find his.  I also tried to save him in some more practical ways which included physically fighting him to prevent him from harming himself (I am not sure about the rules here so I wont go into detail)  in a mental state where he has no other goals. He does not remember these episodes.     I don't know if he is able to be happy. I mean happy in a sustained way, longer than a few hours or a day. I feel like he might be if he had a better girlfriend. Because there is one need of him I am failing to fulfil... I can't give him what he sexually wants. (I could explain that further, but I think it is enough to say that he can only enjoy it if I enjoy it. And that is something I fail to feel or act accordingly). This is quite hard on him, despite the depression his sex drive always has been quite strong.  He is often mean to me. Cold sometimes. Angry. Saying that he'll never have real sex in his life. Telling me that I study too much, that I am not really interested to him... I proposed to open the relationship, help him find a new girlfriend, pay a prostitute... he does not want that. He wants me. And I already gave him everything, so many free days and evenings, I gave him years of myself. And with some of the sexual things he wanted - my dignity.  Then he is nice again. This almost hurts more that him being mean, because then I see what I am scared to loose.    He says that it is not my fault, that I am not responsible for his life or his eventual suicide.  I used to abstain from bringing my own feelings into this arguments ("I will be sad if you die"). I tried to find a way for him to see meaning in his life. One time he said that he basically repeated the discussions with his former therapist with me. Lately I've come to the point where I repeatedly told him, that I don't want to be a murderer. Because that how I'd feel like if he killed himself. He died because I was not good enough.   I know from a rational point of view that this is probably not true (though the sex dynamic changes things a bit). And that all of this is not about me, he is the one whos life is in danger...   I am a medical student and asked a psych professor what to do if a patient has gone through many treatments and still wants to kill himself.    His answer was: "Sometimes we can't do anything to prevent a suicide."  He had no idea what he told me there... how it hurt. No one has any idea. My boyfriends former psychiatrist (I'll call him Dr. R.) was the only one who knew. He actually told my boyfriend that if he can't prevent it, he was ready to help my boyfriend anyway, support him while he is still alive. Dr. R understood. He was so relived when I emailed him, relieved that someone hat established a rapport with my boyfriend, that my boyfriend had let someone come close to him.   That was right in the beginning of our relationship. Inpatient treatment followed (after I had convinced my boyfriend to try it). Dr. R. retired 2 years ago. I miss him. He was the only one beside me knowing and truly understanding my boyfriend.  And the only one understanding what I have been going through.  On good days I manage to do everything my boyfriend wants. And he is happy, has a thousand ideas, cuddles... And then asks me if I allow him to die now, because it would be a nice day to end it...  On bad days he says that I am sadistic because I am keeping him alive. He asks me over and over to let him kill himself.  And I am scared that at some point I'll say yes. So all of this ends. I'd never have to have sex again. I'd have time, I would be free in my decisions. I am not a good person.  _____________  Thank you for reading. I don't know if I'll be able to reply to eventual answers... But I'd really appreciate your advice on my situation.  	1
 I am already invited (because I'm in the chat channel 24/7 :3).  As already stated I currently have huge issues with my internet connection (thanks to my father), but I hope this will be fixed in about 2 or 3 weeks.    I will likely have time every night, and maybe some afternoons, escpecially at the weekends.  I am a midlane main, but if we're missing something, I can fill as I play every role at least decently.     Battlelore is a band who's lyrics entirely revolve around the world of LotR, you might wanna look at that...   Pressing B and the "down" button when trying to catch a Pokemon.  Seriously it does NOT work I promise you.       It's incorrect indeed.   "We will crush" requires 1. person plural future of "contero", which would be "conteremus". You don't really need the "Nos", because the person already is in the verb. You can let "vos" like it is I think. "Conteremus vos" would be my suggestion, but I don't guarantee that it's correct.    Kassa got reworked a while ago - he has not got a silence anymore, only an 'interrupt to channeled abilities" (i.e. a move that was invented to specifically fuck up Kata), but now he has a shield for magic damage on Q, which makes harassing very hard, since Kata has nothing but magic damage. Whenever he sees you Q casted, he just casts his, and there goes your harass :(     As a Katarina main, I really struggle against Kassadin in the midlane - especially as Kata. It's hard to harass him, since your Q damage is predictable so he can easily shield it off with Q. With his shield up, you also lose early trades, and you can not all-in him post-6 since he will either interrupt you with Q or just walk away with R (and leave you there spinning in the nothing like an idiot).  If someone has tips for this specific matchup, I'd be really grateful. Any general tips against Kassadin and how to prevent him from snowballing the shit out of my game are also welcome...   Behold, it's Queen Margaery of the might kingdom of DEBUG!    someone mentioned it in the GGLoL chatroom on EUW, that they have been added by someone who saw their name here...   Well, I think one could consider making this a private sub, since we already had the first one coming up saying "hey i saw you in GGLoL i wanna play with girls" :/    mh. maybe i accidently removed my subscription and then it deletes everything? i have no idea lol.   	11
 When I was a kid I got to visit a site where they had been pumping mud into the ground for days. I'll never forget what it felt like when the formation broke - I still can't imagine what was down there. It was like a bomb went off underground, dust rose a foot off the ground for a hundred yards around the well head as I felt my first and only earthquake.  I can't believe this shit is "up for debate".   that the school isn't justifying its end of the bargain  We narrowly avoided having religion crammed down the throats of kids that are already going to have it a lot harder than we ever knew. I'm with it, go to fucking school. Period.  It doesn't mean they have to like it. It doesn't mean what they are learning is true, but what it does mean is that they're learning to do things they don't want to do, and if that's not what life is all about I'm missing that point years ago.  Look, I can only hope there was more in a classroom today besides how to count and turn in a mediocre essay. There needs to be more substance that involves what the hell is really going on with this planet. The basics need to be taught earlier, thinktanks need to be assembled to cater to localized deficiencies.  Calling me a fuck up is like calling every kid that got a 6 year degree and has a substandard income a complete failure. It's not fair and you know it.   Next up: Mandatory Catechism, and the beatings will improve until morale continues.   Like a hot knife through butter,  Spreading my patience thin.  Killing me softly in a game of hard ball,  That neither of us can win.  They'll take what they can get, two miles to the inch,  It's not even really their fault.  Their parents don't love them, or don't try hard enough,  If they do it seems for naught.  Karma's the bitch, she gives what's coming,  What you do comes right back to you.  But if seeing is believing, and hearing is knowing,  We learn an absolute truth.  That time is on our side, these wounds will heal,  They'll grow over in a beautiful scar.  What does not kill us will make us stronger,  Just stare farther, a little longer,  Pulling horizons all the closer from afar.  ---  Cheers my friend. Here's to the wavelength we share.   Guess I just gotta man up and work at it.  It's what we do best.   A winning lottery ticket so I can travel the world freeing slaves and shooting badguys.   no you are not an idiot, at all. you hit the nail on the head.  read it backwards line by line ;)  ---  ok i tried the hourglass. reddit formatting screws it up. it changes the font, even if i indent the whole thing, and that makes the last line shorter than the second to last line.  i'll have to put it in a word processor and take a screenshot to get that right, but its a fantastic idea.   great stuff here. steamy. i can really relate to the way it's written, the anthropomorphism is outstanding.   meeting someone special is not as hard as it seems  especially when we like many of the same things  even when we agree to disagree in between  we both see its not easy being green  and when its time to come clean  when our qualities are redeemed  admitting what our dreams really mean  it's like nothing before ever believed or seen  when someone special is indeed what they seem       I've found that the more you get to know someone the easier it is to come out with words that make time spent together so special.  Meeting someone new is challenging in that you have to squeeze the most out of those first few moments in order to produce something spectacular.  The kicker is, you probably don't even know your'e doing it. There is something about you that she already finds charming, perhaps its the very fact that you don't know what it is.  I've never been good at it, no matter the situation, but I've learned that few things are more attractive than raw wit and humor coupled with confidence and dignity. These are things I strive to find in myself, and when I do I come up with something terrible, funny, prophetic, or just plain stupid because of who I am.  Everyone is different and there is no better ingredient for a good time than to be comfortable with yourself. Being self conscious has always been a big problem for me, and I overcome it by being able to step back and make light of whatever awkward behavior it is that I am exhibiting.  Sometimes it just takes time to get comfortable enough around someone special to let it rip, and it might help to look at it like a buildup. You never know when the cork will pop in a conversation, when the opportunity will strike to make an impression or a move. It's the spontaneity that gets people together, and I'd say just keep that one thing in mind when your'e around her.  Live for the moment.  ---  For you, bro:   Roses are red,  Violets are blue,  I am staring at your tits again aren't I...   callouses snag silk lingerie  grit from the days work smudges  eyeliner rolls away with sweat  moments evaporate into late hours  these delusions of an abandoned heart  that knows no bounds  and feels no comfort   Creepy right! Thanks for the topic. I wish there were more of these.   Like wine from water, gold from lead,  Beauty fills my mind, stuck in my head  Growing and spilling, out of my fingers  The scent of yours where it still lingers  Thick on my hands, but thin to the touch  Pictures lost to fires missed all too much  Your memory rises out of thick black ash  Fatal attraction, where rock and life crash  A scorned lover thrown from a cold windy cliff  To the chasm below where tides and sand drift  Carrying your body and blood out to sea  Where life starts anew, the end the beginning   At this point anything we can do to encourage kids to do better in school is probably worth it.   What's worse are the proponents of the whole "War on Drugs" which is perpetuating this kind of violence.    i bet if everyone in my building fired up IE at the same time that the emergency generators would kick on.   That's the only way laws get repealed though, for being too oppressive. If clauses exist that make a horrible piece of legislation workable then we are stuck with that legislation only to jump through hoops for the rest of our life. While I agree that something must be done to allow people to vote since this crap got passed I don't think polishing this turd is going to help anyone in the long run.  It's just a diversion anyway. [Elections in this country are a scam as it is](http://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1ops17/ted_cruz_failed_to_disclose_ties_to_caribbean/ccue8b3).   i'm glad you got something out of this. i don't typically tear into people but sometimes i feel like i can do something for the both of us when it comes to issues like this. i have a family of mixed heritage and want nothing more than for everyone to try to understand each other. it means the world to me, and the world to everyone else whether we realize it or not.  thanks for the gold and keep your chin up. you seem like a good person and i hope i wasn't too offensive with the banter.   that was a fake spoiler to draw you into reading an article about the women in your family.   thats actually what i was looking for when i found this article.   I think the train is going the wrong way. I don't know anyone in Dallas who wants to live in Houston.       Deplorable and discriminatory to you, because you're white.  That's an accusation, or at least a brain fart of an assumption.   Do you feel that you own the English language and all meanings between people?  This leading question can be interpreted as an accusation. Why ask questions like this when you can just come out and say it.   But don't try to defend everyone from themselves.  Don't accuse me of trying to defend everyone from themselves.   The reason you call the N word deplorable is because it riles up your own white guilt.  There's another accusation. Textbook even. Go read that definition again..   Don't try to put that on everyone else.  Again, accusing me of "trying to put that on everyone else".  Dude, get a grip. This is racist whether you know it or not:   I am native american, how is it different than black people using the n word?  This is entitlement:   Is this something else your culture would like to strip from us?  Nobody stripped shit from *you*. Wake up. You don't see me making generalizations about ancient history. This is the year 2013. You are a free man and you can achieve whatever you put your heart and mind into. It's like you want reparations from me. I work at 7-11 dude. Repair your own goddamn self.   Piss off with your baseless accusations, logical fallacies, bitter entitlement, and misguided resentment. The more you type the more you appear racist. I'm surprised your account hasn't been banned.  Good luck out there.  ... "white guilt" ... What a crock of shit haha....   you've had that brisket stuffed relleno and you weren't impressed? damn, tough crowd. i grew up in el paso, and corpus, have lived in dallas, san antone, houston, and now austin, and that relleno recipe is amazing.  the best relleno i've ever had was on a train from chihuahua mexico down to topolobampo. took us through the copper canyon and at every stop villagers would board the train with tamales, blankets, and at one particular stop, the best relleno i have ever eaten in my life. i didnt know they could taste that good. it was a very different recipe, but the flavor was outstanding.  when i eat somewhere new i order the relleno as a litmus test for the skill and dedication in the kitchen.  i'll admit that there have been times where i've eaten at Trudy's and it didn't come out like the first one, but that can be chalked up to the cook. the recipe is great, and that's why i give torchy's the benefit of the doubt in conversation.   that use of the N word is deplorable and discriminatory in its own twisted way. its ok for one person to say something but not another because of a difference in skin color? seriously?  how about i make one called "got_here_in_1624_and_started_stripping_things_from_the_natives".  hey, it's ok for me to use that, right? because it's true and because i'm "white"? right?  sounds good.   curious. what did you order? i only eat the rellenos but they are without a doubt the best around.   trainspotting. i've probably seen it 500 times. no joke.   Welcome to /r/Texas. Here is your keyboard, and here is your whiskey.  I have a story for you to lighten the mood.  Once upon a time, a Prince asked a beautiful Princess, "Will you marry me?" The Princess said, "No!!!" And the Prince lived happily ever after and rode motorcycles and dated skinny long-legged full-breasted women and hunted and fished and raced cars and went to nude bars and dated ladies half his age and drank whiskey, beer and Captain Morgan and never heard bitching and never paid child support or alimony and dated cheerleaders and kept his house and guns and ate spam and potato chips and beans and blew enormous farts and never got cheated on while he was at work and all his friends and family thought he was friggin cool as hell and he had tons of money in the bank and left the toilet seat up.  Edit: THE END    You've beautifully illustrated how badly broken our voting system is on a mathematical level.  -Candidate A and B represent their constituents in mutual exclusion for party C  -Candidate X and Y represent their constituents in mutual exclusion for party Z  For the sake of argument let's say that each primary for each party is won with a 51% vote - essentially half of each set of constituents. This is then representative of 1/2 of the people being governed.  And for the sake of argument let's say that we have a huge election between the parties, kind of like our last presidential election, where there is a 51% majority electing the most important actor in the country.  We then get 1/2 of 1/2 of the people represented well. If you throw in the actual number of representatives and levels of voting, something like 1/2 * 16, you get what we have today: only the most influential of the populace being represented.   That this group happens to be the wealthiest is probably not a coincidence.      Had to laugh at this one. That is NOT a "rolling prairie". [This is](https://www.google.com/search?q=rolling+prairieclient=ubuntuhs=MSDchannel=cstbm=ischtbo=usource=univsa=Xei=U1JhUrPOFOOd2QWju4DADAved=0CE4QsAQbiw=1336bih=801dpr=1) what comes to mind when I hear it described.  Barstow, let alone Orla, are hardly what they used to be. There used to be enough grass to warrant regular cattle drives to Cheyenne through the region and support huge herds of buffalo. That hasn't been the case in 100 years.  There is a great TED talk by a guy who grew up certain that the reason for desertification was due to overgrazing. He even went as far as to spearhead the massacre of thousands of African elephants.  Later in life, as scientific knowledge expanded, he grew determined to undo the damage he had done by dedicating his life to finding workable solutions to desertification around the globe.  Climate change and evolution are not called "theories" because the fact that they happen is up for debate - the debate is how it happens and what to do about it.  It's a great watch and I have you to thank for finding it because I would not have found it today. Here is the full link:  http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change.html  I actually found it on the [Circle Ranch's website](http://circleranchtx.com). They are settled up in the foothills of the Sierra Diablo mountains south of "the peak", and are known for copper, silver, and gold mining, and old drug runner airplane strips. As a note, yes the grass is pretty green there, but they are also situated on the side of the mountain. 20 miles east or west of those mountains is classic Chihuahua.  So many people agree with it not just because they are educated in climatology or part of some false dichotomy of politics, but because they've lived it.   This is the same reason why Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel, only the place I grew up on became the moon beneath our feet 100 years ago and people pushing for pollution in the name of economy and profit are the proponents of doubt.     Thank god our government doesn't work this way.   What I'm saying is that the place used to be a rolling grassland when settlers arrived, and it takes years of good rain for that kind of thing to build up.  It's not really relevant to west Texas, but I wanted to share [this image](http://www.globalchange.umich.edu/globalchange2/current/lectures/deforest/defores9.JPG) that shows deforestation in the states. I'd be willing to bet that regular rain was far more plentiful when those trees were around too. It does speak to the desertification of the place though. I think it would be difficult to convince anyone that less vegetation means anything but less vegetation, regardless of the primary cause - and not to mention the scale.  Again, digging up what I'm talking about has been difficult, especially since the last person who told me about how wonderful the grass was out there is 89 years old, and she heard it from her father in law. I did find [one of Camp Mabry] (http://climatediscovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Average-Monthly-Rainfall-Mabry-3-Drought-Periods-copy-8x6.jpg) though, and it's not very comforting. The graph clearly displays a predicable decline, albeit cyclical, but a decline nonetheless in actual rain. If only we could rewind that graph for the purposes of this pointless conversation.  I'm just saying there was a hell of a lot more frequent rain 200 years ago over a hell of a lot more country than there has been in the last 100 years. I don't care what kind of cycle it is, the fact is that there's no sign of it letting up and when it comes to the well being of loved ones the obvious choice is to err on the side of caution and GTFO. When people ask why, well then, we tellem'. If they don't like it or they wanna buy the f*cking place, good luck to them.   I never said it was a lush forest, dude. I said it was rolling prairies. It being an expanding desert is exactly what I'm talking about.  Hauled plenty of pipe out to Barstow and I know what that "green" looks like, and it ain't grass. It's greasewood and catclaw. Hell, even mesquite will barely grow out there it's so dry.    I always get pounced on when I talk about it. My family made a fortune by the turn of the century and spent it all trying to recoup losses as things got worse. It's a touchy enough subject for me because I'm basically living proof of what's happening.   I don't recall saying the millions of cattle that died had to have died within some imaginary time span that you have ascribed to my words to benefit your argument. When I say drought I'm talking about this real meaning of the word:  It would have to rain for many, many years straight before that kind of grass returns to the praries out there. My father has an ag degree from Sul Ross and he told me some pretty eye-opening things about how certain types of plants will not return to that area until it's been wet for decades. It's kind of hard to ignore or chalk up to regional variations in climate when speciation halts and all but the toughest of flora and fauna have left.  Do I hope it get's wet? Of course. But like I said, I'm not betting the farm on it because the farm is already toast.  And stop with the name calling. It just makes you look stupid.   [This](http://a248.e.akamai.net/origin-cdn.volusion.com/xsbcm.qoply/v/vspfiles/photos/tx_pecos_43_terms-2.jpg?1353173056) is obviously a google maps view of some part of Pecos county, but very telling none the less.  You don't need me to google for the images. Zoom in on the Trans-Pecos region using Google Earth and you can see that sand colored space between the greasewood.   [This](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQMhBSPrNpgsm2sK1PmYmp660LQaQUza4P2ltrRLsDoISELqZRn6Q) reminds me of the ranch the last time I saw it. Not sure where that picture was taken but it's eerily familiar. (edit: It hit me why this looks so familiar. It's just like the scenes in the photos from my family album when we lived south of Odessa when I was a kid)  The pictures on my father's wall are the most telling. They show what life was like for them in the 50's when things got real bad. The old men standing in those pictures are the ones whos father's settled the area back when indian raids were common and the land was, evidently, worth fighting for. It's $1 an acre today and the places I am familiar with, which is essentially from Marfa to Odessa (discounting, of course, the Davis Mountains, which are as green as it gets out there), are basically worthless unless you have the money to drill for deep water. It can cost $200,000 to drill a well a couple thousand feet and that kind of money just doesn't exist in the places that have been hit the hardest.  It's a sad state of affairs and it's not just Texas but this entire part of the North American continent is in for a big shift in population centers. On a long enough timeline, Corpus *will* get wiped out by a hurricane, and on that same timeline, sand dunes *will* spread beyond Monahans.   Will it be in my lifetime? I hope not. Somehow I can't bring myself to bet against it, and that's for sure. There is no way I could consider hanging on to that land knowing what I know. Why on Earth would I repeat the mistakes that my forefather's made? With the abundance of technology and information, I can literally design a map set in a GIS application to show me the perfect spot to live given certain criteria.  People back then obviously could not do that, and now it's a humanitarian crisis as people die in the desert trying to illegally enter the US as much as it is an economic crisis as families across the west board up their homes and head for wetter climes. Ecologically speaking, there is no way to sustain the cattle industry that once thrived, and farming (as delicious as the Pecos canteloupe is), is no longer feasible even for the most prepared.  For instance, we had a few square miles of pivot sprinkler lines south of Pecos a while back. The wells were not deep and the only way to get a good flow was to drill down into the Rustler. We didn't have to do that because the gigantic operation across highway 17 from us had tapped the Rustler years ago and the flow was reportedly dwindling fast.  That's old water too. Check out some of the fascinating hydrology reports that UT has done on the area. Some of that water has been underground for 20,000 years, and now it's being pumped out exponentially faster than it is being replaced.  I could go on, for sure.   Sigh..  Yes, yes. Corpus got rain this year, and good estimates are that about a quarter of a million have actually died in the past couple of years.  But we aren't talking about this year. We are talking about 20, 40, 60 years from now and the long term trends preceding this disaster.  Right? Or are we going to go out and water our lawns every day because it rained last October?  Indeed drought comes and goes, but that doesn't mean we can't do anything about it. If people need to pack up and sell their land, there needs to be justification, and they have it now.  Even your previous reference to the THSA's site says:  "Information concerning pioneer-day droughts is sketchy because of the absence of official statistics; but data on some droughts, especially those during the nineteenth century, can be compiled from individual complaints recorded in newspapers, diaries, and memoirs."  They didn't have the Internet to share information instantly back then, and so went about with their lives largely noticing only that which affected them directly. Now that we know what's going on, and that this area is prone to years of dry weather, something *can* be done about it. We can prove it to the point of a for sale sign in front of the farm.  I really don't think you are getting the bigger picture. If you really knew families who have suffered because of this then you wouldn't be so quick to claim that because it rained today that there is a reason to keep the farm for another 20 years.       Right. Because this erases my grandfather's, father's, and my own memory. I understand your mindset - you simply have nothing to lose if the south west does dry up and blow away.   Many cannot afford to simply dismiss that possibility because of one side of some argument. As you can see, there is plenty of scientific data both ways.  But for my kin, living out there in the heydey, they'd tell you the same thing: It. Is. Getting. More. And. More. Dry.  Why would they say that? To scare you? Right. That's what people losing their livelihood like to do to other people.  Why didn't I think of that..  None of that "all this is perfectly normal!" crap is going to make bit of difference. Normal or not, it's getting drier.   Do you think my family would have defended the frontiers of Texas over a pile of limestone and some tosajilla?  No. Mine and many other pioneering families saw promise in the land. They saw green, water, pristine expanse.  So when you call this ridiculous just take a step back for a moment and look at what's more ridiculous: people losing millions of cattle to a drought when there used to be plenty of water to support them, or people calling them names for trying to raise those cattle to being with.     I can't stand how people doubt that Texas is headed for desertification just because we get *some* rain periodically.  When I was a kid Corpus was like a rain forest to me. Having come from west Texas, where it's *really* dry, all that green and rain was amazing. Over the 20 years that I lived in Corpus I watched it rain less and less, and when I brought this up to my father he told me that his father said the same thing about west Texas. Not that the place has been exactly a tropical rain forest in human memory, but still..  The Goodnight-Loving trail ran through the ranch land that we settled, and it was rolling plains of neck-high grass as far as you could see. Today that area is a parched waste land that resembles nothing that ever recieves water. Nothing but cactus and greasewood with the occasional mesquite and catclaw.  This place is drying up and people who have generations in this state will tell you. We don't need science to know that something is very wrong here, but it helps.  Sometimes.   Keep changing it up buddy.   I lived in the "suburbs" of Mentone as a kid. In fact, my family ranched in Loving county for like 100 years until it dried up and blew away. My dad tells me that he and his buddies loaded the last live cattle to be shipped by train in the U.S. outside of Toyah in '64 or so. The stories I could tell if I could remember everything I've ever heard my dad talk about with his old buddies out there. Even [crazy uncle Jep](http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bclayton/jep.html) is well remembered in that part of the world.  It isn't a crappy place to be from. I'd much rather be from a place where it took real guts and grit to survive than from a place where we are slaves to a modern way of life. I'd even live out there today if I had a way to support myself, but unfortunately for me there are probable between 0 and 1 IT jobs in the region.   The area is pristine, arid, and isolated - except for the well heads every 200 feet..  I miss the big, rare deer, the rattlesnakes, playing with the scorpions, centipedes, and tarantulas. I miss the massive and most amazing looking thunderstorms only a parched desert can produce every couple of years. I miss driving around with my dad in the middle of nowhere in a 4x4 loaded with tools and supplies. I really miss living in the ancient ranch house that was literally 30 miles from the nearest human being. I miss exploring the sinkholes, finding arrowheads and ancient Spanish soldier spurs, coat buttons, and candles. I miss the gas refrigerator that was older than my dad but still worked, and I miss clanging away on the WWI surplus generator when we needed power, which was only necessary when we were building something like a shed or a porch or working on the old house. I really miss cooling off in the secret springs after a long day of moving cattle over the distance of several miles.  I miss the clear night skies the most. I know I'm crazy for wanting to go back, but it's so far away from people and their problems, and the air is so clean and feels so good to breathe that it's worth the pain to me.  Just my $0.02.  ---  It feels good to see the area getting a little time on Reddit. Beautiful? Obviously. Hospitable? In no sense of the word. I've been telling people for years what it was like growing up there and sometimes I'd just get laughed at. Seeing these pictures brought back a lot of memories. They are a testament to how rough life out there can be, but they also depict the beauty of the landscape and the nostalgia of the working the oilfields very well.   In 50 years we won't have anything to worry about as long as we put the money we make from this oil into education.   Btw, that's not an oil rig, it looks like a storage site (I don't know the specific term)  I think it's called a "clusterfuck" in the vernacular.   63 year-old woman visiting US for daughter's wedding harassed and traumatized by immigration officers *every day*  ftfy   reminds me of an uncle i had who drowned in a vat of whiskey. we tried to save him but he bravely fought us off.   You people on the left get so butt-hurt by anything you don't agree  it's this entire perspective that caused the mess we are in today. that whole "you people" crap has to go, or we are just going to be in-fighting over petty bullshit until we really do render this planet uninhabitable.  in case you haven't noticed, the people you are sitting here bashing are your neighbors, your teachers, your doctors, and your police force, and in case you haven't noticed, this whole bi-partisan system has recently derailed to produce a gigantic cluster fuck of a government shutdown.  our government is shut down, sir, and for you to sit there and pretend like the problem lies with some imaginary line across the screen in the voting booth is as asinine as some of the fucked up policies YOU PEOPLE vote for.   How deep is the well? I used to work the last few pumps out on the Tunstill lease and constantly had to soap them.  I actually spent a lot of time there as a kid. I miss it for the night skies and clean air, but every other thing about that country is as forbidding and unforgiving as can be.   Try putting up a sign at that intersection about who to contact because the signal timing sucks.  If it's bad enough to cause people to avoid the light, the line will get flooded with calls while 37 people with cell phones sit there at a red light for 4 minutes - all. day. long.   I wouldn't complain, that's for sure. I might quit my job, especially if my boss needed someone to tell them to fuck off proper, and take the time to educate myself enough to get a more enjoyable if not higher paying job.  Personally, I'd take six months off to write some software I've been wanting to produce and/or start a different type of business that I've been wanting to crank up for a while now, but I have the bills of a paycheck to paycheck dad and have to work accordingly.   Along with what you are doing, this is what I'd try:   Don't talk at all, but depending on whether or its due to illness or yelling, I may or may not try to clear my throat gently but often. For illness/allergies, I'd clear my throat and gargle with salt water every few hours. For yelling, only when necessary.  Keep a warm, wet rag on your throat to keep the blood circulating.   Take some fish oil twice a day - bit the capsule and let it coat your throat, hopefully a small amount will work its way down there.   Take steamy showers to get humidity through there.   Take some ibuprofen to cut down on the inflammation.  Take some chondroitin and glucosamine vitamins. I think vocal have essentially the same constitution of part of, say, the knee, to warrant this kind of vitamin.  Keep oral contact with sexual fluids to a minimum...  	51

 Astounding story as well   But by then you could bounce to the Far East with your riches, wait a few generations and buy several countries back from the Dutch as their empire was collapsing. I mean, we're going back in time and immortal. It doesn't matter your ancestors at that point, you've got all the cards needed to fuck shit up   It also helps with the calming down thing, especially if you are of the panic disorder type... Also whiskey is tasty   For some reason this made me think Eyedea   Abilities Color my World Mine   The FUCK?  	5
 I think you completely misinterpreted my intent.  1. I'm **probably** a much awesomer guy than I give myself credit. I'm extremely intelligent, but have no desire to **put that intelligence to use.**  2. I'm **capable of so much and I believe** I could do so much, it's just that nothing motivates me.  Meaning, I am a waste of the mind and body I'm in. I have self-efficacy and a high locus of control, but I have little motivation to pursue the ends.   I don't think I have the motivation for that anymore.   I am absolutely socially retarded  I'm probably not going to be capable of ever being in a relationship  Due to my complete lack of motivation.  I don't know what it is that **I do wrong** socially really  I'm so disconnected from  I never wanted to talk about my thoughts because I've always known **I was so different** than everyone else.  **I don't really care what happens to me** as long as I'm at peace and don't have to continue fighting or talking to people   Why am I forced to live and forced to carry a burden of guilt and selfishness if I truly don't want to be here anymore  I don't really think that's talking myself up, but to one their own.   Try going out to a social place (bar, club, etc.)  I don't drink or like being around alcohol at all. Any place loud = hard on my sensory processing disorder : ( . Loud places are hell for me. I just want to leave instantly.  	1
 You should post this to r/creepy   I wish people would stop calling these people 'Midget's' Its so insanely rude!   Is this place in France? Because I have heard real-life stories about that mansion  	3

 I forgot what it's called and a google search failed but I've had those bumps all over my body since I was a kid. Recently they made their way to my face as well, so I started using CeraVe (moisurizer) on them... and they vanished in a matter of a couple weeks. I imagine they'd work on the bumps on my body as well but it's too much of a hassle rn lol  	1
 I'll just put it this way -- my inability to meet people has screwed me over already in non-romantic aspects of my life. So I guess at this point I'd rather change things now than realize later in life that I missed out on a lot of opportunities to meet people when I was younger.   Not unless you're that alien diva from Fifth Element..   It's funny that you say that because I was actually considering making a full Boba Fett armor this year to anonymously creep people out on campus for Halloween. Maybe I should really do it. xD   I will probably try to increase my sample size. I guess this means I'll just have to be more active in approaching others then since I rarely get approached at all.   I will try to work on it. And I'm way far away from NYC. I'm unfortunately stuck in the South for the time being. ):   I don't know why this happens, because these types of people are the only ones that ever approach me. I don't really ever take initiative with asking guys out although I'll hang around them until they ask me if I'm interested.   Other types of guys have never really approached me though and I feel extremely awkward trying to go for people outside of what I'm familiar with. Usually I'm willing to give it a try if someone approaches me and I find them interesting and physically okay-looking. But right now this is the only type that I've been with, which is making me wonder if it's to do with my age group or if I'm putting out all the wrong signs.   It usually takes something extraordinary for me to approach people directly. If I like someone enough, I try to approach them by giving them more opportunities to be around me.   I've been told I give off a very intimidating aura, even though I'm really just really kind of terrified of people though. I usually can't talk very freely with people I don't really feel comfortable with yet, and that's usually misinterpreted as a sign of that I'm completely disinterested and annoyed about talking.   Also, I've just kind of had to accept the risk of being objectified as a fetish because of my race. It's something that is pretty much impossible to avoid in the geek community and difficult to detect immediately sometimes.   Well, I only had one ex that was really into anime and even studied Japanese. You'd think he would have been more into me, but he actually showed the least interest. A good summation of our relationship would be that he never saw anything wrong with playing on his DS across the table from me when we went to lunch in public, leaving me to eat by myself on the other side in silence. The sad thing is that we met through the university Pokemon League. I really tried to make that one work because we had the same interests  and he was interesting to me for almost a year.  Another had a reputation of having that kind of fetish. And then another one developed an Asian fetish after dating me. One ex that cheated on me actually said that they hoped I'd never have the self-confidence to realize that I could be doing so much better.   It's hard to say. Most of my relationships would start out okay enough before the amount of stuff I could forgive without thinking about it too much started piling up. I've had an ex that was generous but it seemed more like he was going through the motions of boyfriend-ness without actually being sincere about it. I've also had one that would act kindly but then would be completely stingy when it came to financial stuff (like telling me to pay for condoms out of 'sexual equality' but then would never offering to pay for my birth control).  Like I said before, I rarely approach people, so a lot of my exes were people who initially expressed interest in me and then seemed to just lapse into disinterest/coldness as soon as I reciprocated and it became a stable relationship. I don't really think I'm "crazy" either, so that might not be it. I've been snapped at for asking for sex too much. Also told to "get off" for trying to hold his hand.  	10
 I thought we already concluded Vechs thinks he's stuck there because he doesn't know Jsano broke the portal ;) Doesn't really matter what he's gonna do. His best option is to find 3 diamonds and move the portal over, hoping it brings him to somewhere else on the overworld.   hey /u/RubyBot here's [Pak's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzWgkndXgKk)   Notch apples, yes. But regular?   That was an amazing escape, I have been cheering in my chair!   ^^^polo?   I totally agree, never seen this before! Made me smile after some rough days :)   [Pyro's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3n61efOVkQ)  [Pause's perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mak5BUmNKIg)       Can you send me some? Oh wait..   Millbee passed 7800 yesterday in his 100th episode so you've got some (binge?) watching to do :)   I got two episodes behind in the current UHC. I watched the first two episodes of some people. Which perspectives do you guys (and girls) really recommend? I have seen Guude's and Chad's perspectives already, and seen both episodes from Pause. I have also seen the first two episodes from Anderz, Coe and Nebris. With who should I start for ep3 as well as for ep4? And can you recommend me any other perspectives I should watch?   This guy. xD Still got tears running down my face from laughing!   If really, REALLY like to watch MK8, you can also watch Millbee's daily MK8 series about getting 10K player points :) I'd recommend it, I highly enjoy watching these   There is so much more going on at the moment, everyone's busy with other series and projects. If the Mindcrackers don't feel like playing on the vanilla server, then they shouldn't. Only when they feel like it. Things will get better, hopefully..   I really liked their meetup during S1 of SoF :D   I'm surprised that even though the blue team started off with some meetups, all the people who are now still alone are on blue.    Tried this a few months ago. Watch later list was full in no time because I wanted to watch way more than I could xD now I watch anything random from my subscriptions list that sounds fun when I have time for it. I however make time for uhc   Can't wait to try it myself!   I almost typed 16 too   of Mindcrack UHC season 19!   Dutch train perhaps? :P They are known to be stuck here.   I am missing something. Guess I should watch his episode later today..   I am looking real closely but I still don't see it. Is it the strange shape?   Man I love your artwork! This is really nice :D   All of them for me. And when I put "user" in the link between youtube.com and their profile name, it's just fine. I use Chrome.   The youtube links in the sidebar to the youtube profiles don't work anymore :( The links have all changed. Instead of http://youtube.com/adlingtont it would now be http://youtube.com/user/adlingtont! I thought I'd mention, can one of the mods fix this?   Don't ask me, I don't know. I believe they pick the color of your name based on the color of the UHC team that person is in. For example Nebris is in the pink/red/purple team and all users with the Nebris flair have a pink name.   Can you add something that indicates who met who within teams?   Thanks! This is really nice for a quick overview :)   Yes you can choose both flairs. You just can't choose the color of your name and this person probably is rooting for the pink team.   To be honest, I wouldn't have time to play random videos while I was out-numbered in the middle of an UHC.   Wow, I have never seen your flair before. Sounds like Pyro was on it, who else?   Depends where you live I think. I live in the Netherlands and here it's just two weeks no lectures but still a lot of work because the semester ends in the last week of January.   Poor flair makers.. 10 faces in one flair xD   HYPE. NO TIME FOR SLEEP   The sunday sandbox livestreams? He's done a stream now twice on a sunday in which he builds in creative mode. (At least the first time, haven't watched the second one yet)   I could hear Genny talking to Chad, saying he should do what he wants and forget about the hate. That's what makes Genny so awesome too. He can play a game like I am Bread and he's in his element. I think Chad maybe has to find himself and discover what he really, really likes   I believe, if he does that, most of the Mindcrackers in the intro have to be moved either up or down which is a lot of work too!   I do sometimes.   Weekend!! :) Just have to finish writing my column and then that's done too and it's 100% weekend for me.   I would LOVE to see him livestream a bit of this!!   I like it! Neat :D   Could also just be in January, doesn't have to be now right?   A triple?   \*sweeps away a tear\*   First the mindcrackers in alphabetical order, then non-mindcrackers in alphabetical order :)   I use these every day :) So 200 times thanks!! :)   It's so cute to see how happy he was with him 3   Losing a pet is just as hard as losing a family member :( Take your time Genny. Bye Bootie..   Ahh that's so sad :( I'm so sorry to hear about it. Poor Bootie :(   Hm, that's not my experience but maybe that's because I ask things they don't know the answer to. Good to know though!   Also the blood tears on btc! Neat!   This is by far the cutest fan art I have seen in a while   I post questions there every now and then but they never get answered if I don't post them on the day the thread was posted (Sundays or Mondays I believe?) So yeah.. Everyone takes one single look at that thread shortly after it was posted, then leaves it be   I had typo matches like these when i was younger, i was evry good at it   The video is removed :(   I am playing AS for a second time and r/FTB_Indeed which is made by a small community. They have a server for both packs and they are looking for new players :)   Someone fan-art this? :D   I'm on 3.1.4 of AS, which uses blood magic to create the spawn eggs. I can look into it but for now I have actually decided to just leave the quest and get back later to it when I have started blood magic for example.   Ah alright, thanks! I made a small pool, few blocks deep, for manual fishing so I only need the fish feeder then. Thanks :)   I have restarted Agrarian Skies and I have now reached the point where I need ink sacs for a creepy doll. Since I don't feel like building a giant squid tank, waiting for a squid to spawn, and I haven't started Blood Magic yet, I decided to go the Mariculture way. I have some squid now (the Mariculture ones) but how do I get their ink sacs? Is there a machine for it, what is it called? Does it consume the fish?   You should fish in the lava.   I am so happy for him. First Ariana is born, then he hits 1 million.. It can only get better for him from now on :)   Maybe there are tools with which you can merge YouTube playlists and sort them all on time and date. And if the order is wrong, so from now back into history, there are also tools that can reverse a playlist. Then just binge watch?   ^^^^^^uhc ^^^^^^teams ^^^^^^of ^^^^^^3?   Yes but carpenter's safes can be opened by anyone, they are just 'hidden' (textures don't connect)   Kill it with fire before it lays eggs!   Good to hear! I'm hoping with you :)   100% true!   I work at a basketball and volleyball hall, in the kitchen, serving sodas and fries   Have a nice weekend everyone! I will be working a lot but at least I got my new phone, the new Motorola Moto G :D   Good luck on your research proposal! They can be really tough..   How did it go? :) Hope all went well!   Never mind. I just ran into indeedcommunity.com, I'm guessing that's what you meant. I'm registering it all now. I will also add you on Skype in a bit but my connection is really bad. So I can probably only type to you, no voice calls.   I'm sorry, do you mean the DNS tech pack thread on this subreddit or the FTB Indeed stuff? I've searched through your reddit post/comment history a bit..   Ooh interesting! Tell me more and I will take a look tonight (EU zone)   Ah that's too bad, but a server is always lighter for your pc/laptop than singleplayer because you just connect and load etc. At least that's what I have been told. Too bad you lost interest though, but thanks for your reaction! I can't handle most FTB packs.. I can handle AS or ME3 because of the small world that is generated and the smaller amount of mods in it, that's basically it.   Hello. Did you manage to get your server working again and is there room for more players? I would like to do a ME3 multiplayer playthrough! Let me know :)   Hey, I am looking for an ME3 server too. Did you find one by chance?         Oh you mean Survival of the Fittest? We just had some sort of modded UHC.   Hello :) I am 21 / f, looking for a server to play on. I can't play most modpacks because I don't have a desktop, just my laptop. I have started the first bits of both AS and ME3 in singleplayer but I miss having a few people around! So who would like to join me and has a server? :) Or do you know a server where they seek players?   Ah man I was so hoping for an Octodad playthrough by Simon and Lewis   But this is singleplayer. It makes a huge difference since this Diogo is not pushed away or even worse, off the edge because there are no other people on the track and there are no items. (although this way he doesn't get mushrooms either)   I don't know if anyone ever keeps checking this thread after Monday but I was wondering if anyone has some sort of playlist made with all of the music that Chad plays during his streams. I can't watch his livestreams because he streams at 3AM for me. Even if I listen/watch them later, I use them as some sort of podcast, it's in the background while I'm studying and I just listen to what he's gotta say and his music. And I really like the music, I just don't have the time to search through his streams for his music. Anyone can help me out here? Or does Chad have a website where he lists the music [just like sevadus does?](https://www.sevadus.tv/music.php)   Yea if I had to pick just one.. In a building contest I would be on generiks side because Bdubs can build really well already :) In a redstone contest, I pick Bdubs, etc. not sure about UHC.   Oh man, I don't know... I think Generik..?   He did it during a livestream and he uploaded a livestream highlights video, I think he doesn't spoil it for most of the people around here.   It actually just depends on which video I see first in my subscriptions feed.   Sounds like I have something to watch today :)   I really enjoy watching Deep Space Mine and Agrarian Skies   It's easy to recognize some patterns but schedules change all the time because of the person's interests and new series and new trends etcetera.    I really like a wing of ender dragons   Bdubs for sure! I love all of his S5 work!   This means we should soon be able to see which new areas have been explored since the fall of the world border! :D   IGN: train_subject7970 - would love to play modded minecraft again, especially some collabs. My friends lost interest and I don't like singleplayer :( can't come online before monday though..   Wow that's impressive! I had been thinking some more and I eventually chose for night blindness as my topic, also because I have personal experience with it. I'm thinking of maybe making a column-like article about it.   So I missed a few of these. Not because I was late but just because I have been way too busy the past few weeks. But hiiii! I probably failed my exam and I also handed in something that wasn't even looking like a scientific article.. I probably didn't pass the big course from the past two months :(  In other news, I have to write another article but this can be about anything as long as it's related to biology. Preferably something cool and easy to understand for everyone because this writing course is about writing to a larger public. For example news articles or news reports or interviews. I can't find a nice article :( I was maybe looking for something or someone important in the history of biology and trying to make a report about it because it is its anniversary but I can't really find anything. For example, Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was published 155 years ago in 10 days, but yeah.. I don't like the number 155 there. If it were 150, sure! Something like that, maybe someone has an idea? :)   Lewis and Hannah will either go on together really well or get completely frustrated :P   Yeah.. Maybe they can do something similar? Or let two others play it.   Pause and Coe.    Upvote text says "Indeed!" :D  	103
 Yay! You're amazing, thank you!!   This is so amazing! Would you mind posting the recipes for a few of these? I would try to figure it out myself but I'm a terrible cook, haha   The thing I personally focus on the most is rejecting gender norms. To me, it's a simple gesture that has a huge impact. Doing this obviously benefits me as a woman, but I believe it largely benefits men as well, who are often told they have to behave a certain, more "manly" way that can often be psychologically unhealthy.  For example, my cousin's son loves Frozen--he looks up to both the male and female characters in that movie. He already has a Hans costume from Halloween, so I bought him a hair braid like Princess Elsa's for Christmas so he can be either character :)   Between this lady and the gif of the cop pepper spraying innocent people, I'm pretty much done with Reddit for the day. Yuck.   Hearing Muslim extremists make threats like this toward Obama specifically makes me wonder who radical conservatives will hate more, and whose side they would take in this situation. Like do you think Ted Nugent would say, "Yeah, sure, ISIS, go for it!" or would he be like, "YO FUCK ISIS, NOBODY THREATENS MY PRESIDENT. EXCEPT ME OF COURSE. I'M THE EXCEPTION."   Don't focus so much on boys, because no, none of your high school boyfriends will end up lasting longer than high school does.   Communicate better with your parents; they don't know the amount of trauma they're inflicting on you because you hide from them as much as possible. Tell them, they actually do care.  Take more time to learn about things you don't care that much about--computers, cars...you know, practical things. It'll pay off, and once you're in college you won't end up frustrated and feeling helpless and having to ask your boyfriend to fix your computer every other day, or having to ask your dad to come pick you up 2 hours from where he lives and change your tire for you.   I dated a Michael, too. He was a real piece of shit.   I mean, from a painter's perspective, they're actually incredibly well-done. He has a great understanding of shape, light, and color. I'm actually a little disappointed that they're good, because I kind of really dislike James Franco as an actor and wanted to keep riding that hate-train all the way toward his art. But what can I say, they're really good.   Thrift stores and flea markets when I have the time to really search, I just find oversized, comfy sweaters (often men's sweaters) and wear them.   Fresh tomatoes, bacon, and fresh garlic. It makes your breath smell terrible but holy lord it is amazing.   Yuuup. On this note also, Kitten Forever is a great band. They're not as big as the people listen here but I dig them so much. They're more noise-punk though, so I'm not sure how much your son would like them--that sound's definitely not for everyone!   My seventh grade teacher was just like this. It was also clear that she didn't prepare any syllabus for class or lesson plans. She taught us English (as well as a few other subjects) and completely missed the point of most of the literature she assigned to us. Once, in a test she made for a book we read, she asked, "Who was the book dedicated to?"  ...Seriously?         I always date guys who have similar features--brown hair, brown eyes, slim, around 6' or taller. Of the white guys I've dated, they all had tons of freckles. Almost every one of them had glasses. I didn't even think I had a type until recently when my friend pointed out the similarities in all the guys I've dated!   This. I had a boyfriend in high school who refused to eat any spaghetti sauce that wasn't his grandmother's, and when he took me out to a fancy dinner for my birthday, he ordered chicken fingers from the kids' menu. I mean, I know we were only in high school, but seriously? Have some class, man.   Currently typing from the grave it was nice knowing you all bye   I would be so incensed if that was my family member. That is so disrespectful.   I like how he says you aren't "accommodating" him multiple times, like you're a hotel clerk or something.  He also just doesn't seem to understand that none of the supposedly logical reasons he gave you to get you to send him nudes change the fact that you just don't want *him specifically* to see them. It doesn't matter that he's giving you "confidentiality," you just don't want to send him pictures of yourself. And he argues about it so much. He seems to think of himself as really smart, but clearly he's not smart enough to understand that he can't make you do anything just by arguing endlessly.   I ate a lot of things that were definitely not for eating. Play-doh (I vommed), chapstick (I vommed), entire bottles of cough syrup (I went to the hospital and vommed). The list probably goes on, but I can't remember because I ate so much poisonous shit that I forget everything.      This comment blew my mind   "Begins the slow process of seduction" HOW CAN THIS BE REAL??   They are some ridiculously photogenic dogs  	24
 This is easier. Besides, I have a 65" rear projection television that isn't going anywhere any time soon.  Go ahead, make fun of me for not having a flatscreen.   Wouldn't the Dayman be better? He's a master of karate and friendship.   Tried it.   .... dude. Give me some useful advice or GTFO.  Everyone knows you can't trust a pilgrim. He'll just steal all my land.   He's somewhere in the far corner of the basement, near the back of the house. The only way I could get anything into the area between the   basement ceiling and the floor is a vent on the first floor, which isn't near where he is, or a small opening on the opposite side of the basement.  There aren't any openings or vents or anything in or near where this little bastard is camping out. I don't wanna just spray that area and he responds like "Bitch, please."   It's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight during the day. I hate light.   I don't own any :-(   I live alone in a two story house. My bedroom is in the basement, and Jiminy Cricket appears to be between the basement ceiling and the first-story floor.  There's no way I can get up there to track him down, and if he chirps one more time, I'm gonna burn this goddamn house to the ground.  Any tips?  Thanks.   I *still* don't know what the actual Morpheus quote is that his meme is based on.   I have a shit-load of video files in my Vuze's Xbox 360 library, and I want to be able to separate them within Vuze. Maybe create folders to put them in. Is that possible?   What was the actual quote from the movie that was misconstrued in the making of this meme?    -Cliche question, but is your dad confidence/brave enough to pull up to a street ball game in the hood and wager to win?  I assume you mean during his time as a pro athlete?   Very good question. I'm eager to hear his answer to this one.  Keep em coming, guys. These questions are really intriguing.   Amongst players, or people in general?   Just NBA, or NBA, NCAA, on the streets, etc.?   In the next couple of days at the very least. I hope that's not too late. If so, I guess I can re-post this.   That's gonna be a fun one. Can't wait to ask him that the next time I see him.   Could you elaborate more? Do you mean as in when he started playing seriously and developing his skills, or just when he started shooting around on milk crates as a pre-teen?   _____________  Maybe I should have titled this "AMAA."   Backstory if you want:  From Philadelphia, played for the Boston Celtics for only one year before a knee injury. Wasn't as good after his knee was repaired, so he played overseas (mostly in Argentina) for roughly 10 years.  Went to Rutgers Camden in New Jersey, shattered pretty much every basketball record that ever existed there, and is the only player alumus to be drafted by the NBA.  He's about 6'5, I (24M) go about 6'4, and he's about to turn 60. Why this seemingly random information? To let you know that despite being damn near three times my age... I can't beat him one-on-one. He plays every day at the crack of dawn and has the best jump shot I've ever seen in person. If you've never seen an NBA player just shoot around casually (even way past his prime), it's absolutely amazing. They're pretty much superhumans compared to us, even guys like my dad who weren't superstars.  So go ahead. AMA!  **EDIT:** A minor caveat. I did say "AMA," but there are some questions that he might not be willing to answer, so if that's the case, I'll just tell the person who asked.  Basically, I'm saying all questions are fair game, but I can't guarantee he'll answer them all.   Ah, okay.  Thanks again.   What do you mean?   Thanks for the hasty response.  If I take in the actual cooler, do you think they'd be able to match up an adapter for it?   I am broke as all hell and can't shell out the money for a can of compressed air. I've even asked people I know if they have one I can borrow, and no dice.  Is this safe or no?  Thanks, guys.   I don't know if you even remember this message, but I was looking into 12vdc cables to replace the one on my [laptop cooler](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) that shorted out, like you had recommended.  Did a quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=12vdc ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8 aq=t rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official client=firefox-a channel=fflb) and a whole bunch of stuff came up. Will any cord work? If not, how do I make sure I get the right one?  Thanks.    Are all the files contained within a single folder or are you trying to identify duplicates across multiple folders?  Many, many folders (hundreds), across two internal hard drives.   Are you considering all traits of a file when identifying duplicates? Ie. if you have two documents which are identacle in every way except the filename of one is Document.docx and the other is Document (1).docx, are they still considered duplicates?  The program I use, Digital Volcano's Duplicate Cleaner, can search for:  * Same file name * Same content * Same artist/title/album (audio) * Same size * Same created date * Same modified date   What duplicate-finder programs have you already tried which seem to be so slow?  See above.  **EDIT:** For what it's worth, I wouldn't mind doing this in segments as opposed to all at once. I know I can break it down and tell the program to only check for duplicates in such-and-such a folder, or time period, or file size, etc., but that might exclude files that aren't in the search parameters that actually are duplicates.   Most duplicate-finder programs take an extremely long time to scan all of my files (which is understandable, since I have so many). Is there any way or any program that's made to find duplicate files on large hard drives in an efficient manner?  Thanks.   Sorry if this seems like a silly question to people with more knowledge than I have, but I just don't get it.   Yeah, that's fine. No rush.  Thanks.   Will you be on in a few hours? I might not be able to test this right now.   Ah, I gotcha. [Here's what I got under "Show Statistics."](http://4.imgland.net/IKGUct.png)    I would try OpenDNS' IPs just to check (208.67.222.222; 208.67.220.220), and maybe remove the IPv6 DNS settings.  So I should set those IP addresses under my IPv4? And how exactly do I remove the IPv6 DNS? Just choose "Obtain DNS server address automatically"?   Also, are those settings in your router what Comcast told you to use? I would use (Get dynamically from ISP) unless told otherwise.  I changed it to static in an attempt to [fix a problem I had connecting to online games over Xbox Live.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/242961/how_to_open_up_nat_settings_on_your_xbox_360.html) But I still had the problem in the OP before changing it.   EDIT: Also, just a minor niggle, probably nothing: Set DNS through EITHER the computer's or the router's settings (preferably the latter).  If I do it through the router, should I just leave everything under "Network and Sharing" (on my laptop) at default or "Obtain automatically from ISP" or whatever?   You mean as in, if I had my laptop connected directly to the modem? I haven't tried that, but will do if nothing else works.   * [LAN](http://4.imgland.net/E5ddl5.png) * [WAN](http://4.imgland.net/JTRijW.png) * [Router status](http://4.imgland.net/mF6jax.png)  I wasn't sure exactly where to go, so I figured I'd just give these a shot. Hopefully one of them is right. If not, would you mind telling me exactly where to find the connection info you referred to?   Should I post a cap of my proxy settings?   First, initial basics-- Comcast provides my internet, and I use the internet on my laptop with a wireless connection via router.  The router and modem are no more than ten feet away from my laptop at all times, which (I believe) eliminates the possibility of a weak signal (plus the fact that whenever I check the properties of my connection, the signal strength is maxed out).  This also allows me to constantly monitor the status of my connection by looking at the router/modem-- whenever my internet stops working, everything is the same as when it is working. Connection lights are lit, all status lights are green and not blinking, etc. The "wireless connection" logo in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen also stays the same (no yellow triangle with the ! inside).  To specify what I mean when I say my internet "goes out": At random times during the day (I have yet to figure out any type of pattern), web pages won't load, and internet-based programs/devices (instant messenger, torrents, Xbox Live, etc.) will not connect to the internet. However, if any of those programs are *already* running when the internet goes out, they'll continue working; but if I close the program and tried to start it back up during the down time, it won't work. Hope I explained that well. Pretty much, anything that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (unlike websites) will continue to work even during this down time.  I attempted to change my IP addresses with [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup). Here are some screencaps of my settings:  * [IPv4 settings](http://2.imgland.net/a97T--.png) * [IPv6 settings](http://2.imgland.net/sje9LH.png) * [Connection details](http://2.imgland.net/0p-n45.png) * [Connection status](http://2.imgland.net/I5Dvl0.png) * [Basic settings (via router interface page)](http://3.imgland.net/f3F5a0.png)  Any help would be appreciated. If you need any more info, feel free to let me know if I left something out.   I think Insanity Wolf saw this and pissed himself.   Okay. 'Murica?  I thought that maybe there's some kind of official process that the majority of the world uses.      I have videos (MKV and M2TS, mostly) that are anywhere from 1-3 gigs in size, and I need to convert them to MP4 (or AVI, I think) format so I can stream them to my Xbox 360. I used this program at the behest of a user on this subreddit, and it worked much better than software I had used in the past. It generally takes no longer than 10 minutes to convert (since it doesn't reconvert or transcode if it's in H264 already) despite the fact that most of my files are at least an hour long.  MkvtoMp4 converts M2TS files fine-- no issues with the sync of the audio and video. Converting MKV files, however, is a different story entirely. Every time, the audio is always about two seconds ahead of the video. I've tried changing certain settings, but nothing has worked so far. I've used search engines to troubleshoot, but haven't had any success.  Does anyone know a possible solution, or perhaps an alternative piece of software?  Thanks.   All while pretending that if you don't do everything in time, the refrigerator door will slice your arm off, right?   If you open it less than halfway, my refrigerator door closes slowly, like gravity is pulling it.  But now that you mention it, I do not how it does that o_o   If not, I'm a weirdo, and I can live with that.   This thread didn't go as well as I'd hoped...   Store owner: Go away! Stop holding door! You let flies in!   How are there over 1,000 people who felt such disapproval with this thread that they couldn't even ignore it and go on with their day, and instead took time out of their browsing to actually downvote the submission?    You can't do it externally; you can't set some kind of option to control the pace of the game, but the pace can change over time.  Yeah, I didn't mean like that. I just meant, for example, if someone's rushing you constantly, you can use counters and/or powerful attacks to keep distance between yourself and your opponent and make them play at your pace.   "Damn, bitch. That's a shitty tattoo."  "It's a picture of Jesus."  "... fuck."   Yeah, but most fighting games generally have a constant pace that it's "supposed" to be played at, right? Like, you can't turn a match into a slow, methodical, systematic fight, or a fast-paced, offense-oriented, depending on what you're good at/what you prefer.  Can you?   Now, is he saying he'd encase the immortal in an ocean of concrete, or that he'd give him/her/it the cliche "cement shoes in the ocean" treatment?  And what would stop the immortal from dragging you down with it? You'll drown eventually. The immortal won't.   Maybe I'm kind of weird, too picky, or whatever, but I've always loved this in any type of competitive game, but mostly fighters.  Games with matches against one-on-one opponents, where you can take your time, play defense when you need/want to (by using an opponent's moves against them if you're good at countering/blocking, for example), and at times you try to out-think your opponent instead of doing everything physically and/or frantically. That's normally what a real fight between two professional fighters is like.   Am I mistaken here and most fighting games actually are like that? Are there certain fighting-game franchises (or iterations of franchises) that have this feel more than others? How do they achieve that type of gameplay successfully while still retaining the fun factor? And lastly, does anyone disagree with my opinion on this?      I'd tell him that I'm going to end his undefeated streak and I'd make a big deal about it every week and try to convince everyone that it will happen. Then I'd give it my all on the day of the battle and probably end up losing when I make a critical mistake or when I get too tired/beaten-up to continue.  ... oh wait, that's Undertaker at WrestleMania. Nevermind.   Find something you're good at that others around you aren't, and offer to do it for people, for a small fee. For example: fixing computers, home improvement, car repair (or even washing/waxing cars), lawn care, etc.  The only thing is you wouldn't be licensed at any of these positions, thus you'd likely have no insurance. You need to let potential customers know this fact immediately and make sure they understand. Also, charge them less than an insured company would, obviously, to make up for the fact that you have none.   Sorry if this is really obvious to a lot of people. I don't own a smartphone, and whenever I borrow someone else's, I'm amazed at how the phone knows how I'm holding it.   You might have jumped the gun with this response just a tiny bit...   How the fuck are you not fired yet?      Would you accept it? Would you try to prove yourself wrong? How would you do it?   All while someone tries to take the hook out and probably makes the wound worse at least half the time?  Does it not hurt them?      Close enough.   Did that first bee take a bath in a tub of Cheetohs?   http://i.lvme.me/6boekf5.jpg   Well-played. Not even gonna lie, this made me laugh.   Admittedly, I only got it because my friend has worked there for five years, and he vouched for me before I even did all of this         It is, if you can afford it.   Then give me Option B. I don't see how watching a gruesome death once every seven days would be as much of a detriment than having no arms or hands.  I bet some people watch slasher/horror movies more often than once a week.   A blowjob.  I'm very lonely.   Can I get prosthetics?   Another user proves my point. There's a difference between being chronically depressed and "not being in the mood to do it." That's an excuse a girlfriend uses when she doesn't feel like fucking.  What if I'm so miserable and pissed while I'm there that I try to just keep to myself and pretend I'm not there, but people keep trying to talk to me, and then I have a massive panic attack?  Different story, right? Thought so.   I hope this doesn't turn into one of those "On the Hunt for Bigfoot" shows. Nobody ever finds any hard evidence. We'd have *heard about it already.*  Granted, I didn't read the article because I"m tired.    Do you really want to know how it is to have special needs? I bet not.  I **DO** have special needs. You're proving my point. Special needs are the same, psychologically or physically. My ailments might not keep me from being able to walk, but physical illness doesn't turn your world into a nightmarish abyss where no one understands you and anything bad or uncomfortable that happens to you can trigger a massive panic attack.    People are shit to people in wheelchairs, **the absolute majority only helps if it's their job to help.**  Or if they're family.  Unless you think every parent in the world would ignore their child's needs if the child was temporarily confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk.   But I want someone I'm comfortable talking to. Hell, I'm not even comfortable talking to my father about this, and I'm as close to him as anyone. That's probably at least partially due to the fact that he just doesn't get it (plus he grew up teaching me the whole cliche "Men are supposed to man up and bitch-slap their emotions whenever they feel sad" thing).  He and I just think way too differently for him to relate, and it's incredibly frustrating.    For video editing etc yes I would look for professional series cards like the nVidia Quadro series  The laptop I'm using now has an NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M, and it gets about as hot as the surface of the sun.   If either are located on the bottom of the laptop your cooling is going to suffer severely whenever the laptop is sitting flat on a table etc.  Would that apply if it was on a laptop cooler?   Tried therapy. Wasn't surprised it didn't work. I hate talking to people about my problems, especially people I don't know.   I hate light. I actually used to be terrified of the dark, but now it comforts me.  I live, alone, in the basement of this two-story house because it's the only room that doesn't let in sunlight.    People aren't going to cater to you just because your depressed  "People aren't going to cater to you just because you're in a wheelchair."    And the drowning man will sink should he not use his arms to swim.  And I am swimming. I'm taking psychiatric medicines and talking to my physician weekly about my mental health.  But going to this wedding would make the metaphorical "current" stronger and harder to swim against, if not just temporarily.     if you don't go you'll feel shitty in your comfort zone and wallow in it for who knows how long  I wallow in depression already.  "A drowning man cares not about the rain."   You guys are here, and that's great. I appreciate it. But support from strangers on the internet can only go so far.  As far as meeting people, I don't want to meet people. I hate people. People are the reason I spend 18 hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call I receive on my cell phone.  I can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me. The only reason I'm even considering it is because I owe my dad big time. He is truly the *only* reason I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. He refused to abandon me when I was in desperate straits, and he goes beyond that very often (for example, allowing me to live in the house he owns, rent-free).  So basically, I'll feel like shit if I don't go because he's done so much for me and I'd feel like an asshole for disappointing him.  Or, I can feel like shit if I do go, because it'll be boring, because I hate crowds, I hate people, and I hate being out of my comfort zone.    is true strength really a single beam bearing an unbearable load until it can bear no longer, or is true strength having the faith in your fellow man to be able to show your weakness, and be helped by them.  Who's gonna help? Nobody. The best my father does (and I appreciate it) is help me out when I need money for my meds. Other than that, he thinks this whole issue of psychological imbalance isn't even real.  Us 20-somethings (or at least myself and most people I've seen) have parents who come from a generation where a lot of people thought depression/anxiety/mental disorders were all either fake excuses for laziness, a product of literal insanity, or simply hypochondria. I really wish people would read up on things or ask around. My dad's not an idiot, he's just used to old-fashioned values and beliefs. But he's not much of a reader or one to watch educational/documentary programs.  I just want someone, ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE, to understand that having severe depression/anxiety/both is just as bad as being terribly ill physically.  Instead, they think it's not, because there are very few palpable physical symptoms, many of the habits that occur because of depression can be easily confused with laziness, and if you're extremely unhealthy psychologically, you don't need to go to a hospital to stay alive (with obvious exceptions).    So, apart from the whole smoke and mirrors raging at life thing, why do you actually not want to go?  I don't understand what you mean by "smoke and mirrors," but it's simple.  This (my home) is my comfort zone. My mind doesn't like it very much when I leave my comfort zone. I need to stay in it as often as possible to avoid spending the rest of my life in a straitjacket.  The only time I'm willing to drag my broken, psychologically crippled ass out of bed is to go buy something I want/need, or to go to work. I don't think it's asking too much that I wish to remain in solitude otherwise.   That might have been your brain just thinking crazy (no offense) thoughts because it knew you wouldn't act on it, since you couldn't, what with the building being only two stories.  If you lived on the 28th floor of an apartment building and looked out the window, I'd be willing to bet that you wouldn't have that sudden, out-of-nowhere urge to jump.  But as others have said, there's no reason to take the chance and end up discovering that this isn't the case, before it's too late. Professional help is always good, and it's much less taboo/stigmatized than some people realize.   I have traits of a selfish, arrogant, condescending asshole, and I pretty much hate the entire world, but I would take a bullet for one person and one person only-- my father.  If it wasn't for him, I'd be penniless and homeless right now, having lost my job two years ago. He lets me live in the two-story house that he owns, while he and my stepmother live together a few minutes away. He's always willing to help me with anything even somewhat important, and he constantly refers to the home I live in as (and treats it as if it's) "My house," despite the fact that I haven't given him a dime in rent money.  Funny thing is, I've never been close to a situation like that where I'd have to potentially die to keep someone else from doing so. I don't know how I know I would do so for my father... I just know that I would. Without a doubt.   If it makes you feel better, your brain compounding negative occurrences with negative thoughts is actually your brain trying to help you.  http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/12yk37/how_i_feel_right_now/c6za4xk  I'm not 100% sure he's correct, but it seems plausible and makes sense to me.  My advice would be to see a doctor or a psychologist. The latter if you think talking to someone about your problems would help (a lot of people in your situation are the complete opposite, and it's understandable), or the former if you think psychiatric medication would be better (it's worked for me... kinda).  Hope you feel better.   A few months ago, I told my dad I'd go to my stepsister's wedding (Sunday, August 11th-- tomorrow as of this writing). I'm not close to her at all, or my stepmother, but my dad just married my stepmother and he really wants me to go.  One problem-- I feel like utter and complete shit right now because of recent events, and I know I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. I guarantee he's not gonna want to hear any of that, though. But if I was in the house coughing up blood, vomiting and having a fever of 102 degrees, I bet you he wouldn't give me shit about not going. Those physical ailments I just described are pretty much analogous to how I feel psychologically right now.  * "Man up and go."  * "Stop making excuses."  * "You're being ridiculous."  Would you say that to someone who was extremely sick physically? Of course not. But if you feel like shit psychologically, for some reason, it doesn't count.  Also note that I'm 24 years old and I live alone, so he made it clear that since I'm an independent adult, the choice is up to me. It's not a "If you don't go, I'm gonna beat your ass" or "I'll kick you out of the house if you don't go."  My dad is a really tough guy, and he doesn't show great sadness and such very often. But if I don't go, I get the feeling he'd be as close to heartbroken as he's been recently, because he (like many people) doesn't understand what depression and anxiety are like separately, much less combined.   **EDIT:** Another reason he'd be really upset is that he'd think I was doing it out of selfishness, disrespect, or both, not because I feel terrible. Do you guys think there's any way to convince him otherwise?   So, in the future, should I look for a similar make and model of graphics card, just one that doesn't suck ass? What's the best way to tell before purchasing a laptop if the GPU will be able to handle the load that I'd put on it?   There is absolutely no hard evidence or physical proof at all. None. There's just speculation, assumptions, blatant untruths, misconceptions, etc.  Meanwhile, despite the onus being on the theists, there is MUCH better evidence for the lack of the Christian god's existence.  Put it like this-- I've said this before and I still think I'm right:  **There's more evidence to support the existence of Bigfoot than there is to support the existence of God.**   Save. Your. Fucking. Money. You. Retard.  -slap-    the only laptops in my experience that achieve mediocre success when it comes to idle temps are gaming laptops that have been designed to tolerate and perform under heavy system loads for extended periods of time.  It's funny, because I remember asking a few people if I should just get a gaming laptop so that I'll know the GPU and everything will be on point and able to handle a heavy load. They all said no, since gaming laptops are designed explicitly for gaming, and won't do as well with video editing as I thought.  Is that correct?   Very good explanation. Another thing to consider is that the free safety, being quicker and faster, is usually the last line of defense in a defense with only one player back.  He's also usually the better safety, between the two, at guarding receivers, so they may assign him to a WR if need be, where a strong safety is more likely to blitz or maybe pick up the running back.   The best explanations I've seen (which isn't saying much) are "Such-and-such happened, we don't know how, so it must have been God."  Things like evolution, or the fact that the Earth is almost perfectly positioned to support life, or the fact that atheist claim that the universe was created from nothing, etc.   What type of specs should I look for in a new laptop? GPU, CPU, RAM, etc. I need to be able to use high-end video editing programs (Sony Vegas, Adobe After Effects, etc.) without the computer feeling like it's about to burst into flames.  I assume the best GPUs are going to be in the most expensive laptops.   Remove dust how? Simply by hand?  I don't trust myself to do that. I'm not very... handy. I'm afraid I'll screw something up.   [This is what my GPU usually looks like after I've been browsing the web (no videos, no games, nothing that should stress the graphics card).](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) Not good. So I decided to do the following:  Shut my computer off for the night (not sleep, not hibernate, completely shut down), and thus, it cooled down for a good 7-8 hours. Then, I turned it on, cut off my wireless internet connection so no programs that use the internet would activate automatically, and didn't run any programs save for three: Task Manager, Speccy (to monitor GPU), and Core Temp (to monitor processor cores).  After 58 minutes of idling (most of which was spent with the display turned off, since it automatically does so after two minutes-- just the display, not the computer itself. Like a screensaver), my GPU was at 65C, and my processor cores were at 59 and 60C respectively. I had absolutely no applications running (if you had looked in my Task Manager "Applications" tab, it would have been empty).  The computer was also hot to the touch, despite the fact that, just to make it clear, I didn't touch the computer once after starting it up and running the Task Manager, Speccy, and Core Temp.  Now, I know there a few possible solutions, and I have some questions about those.  * Compressed air to clean out potentially clogged fans/heat sinks. I'm REALLY broke right now, but I'm trying to scrounge the money to grab one or two. Let's say I do, and I use it, and it still overheats? Then what?  * I also have a laptop cooler that I used to use that actually helped keep the computer a little bit cooler, which is better than nothing. But there's a short in the power cord now, and I don't have any soldering tools or expertise to fix it myself. I tried to search the internet for somewhere I can buy just the power cord, since buying a new cooler would be pretty pointless. Nothing wrong with mine except the power cord. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a power cord for [this cooling pad?](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) Also, is there maybe a common household item(s) that I can use until I get a new cord/cooler?  Thanks, and if I left anything out or wasn't clear, please let me know.   Would the lack of sunlight cause health issues? If not, gimme that. I love gray, cloudy days. The sun can eat a dick, making everything all bright and shit.   Thanks for the quick response. I'll probably have a little more to add to help you guys help me.  For shits and giggles, [here's my motherboard](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/Motherboard.png). I assume this is almost a direct result of the piece of trash NVIDIA calls a GPU.  No bueno.   A person's name affects their entire life?  Oh, boy...   I've never in my life seen so much embarrassing nonacceptance in one place.   Don't act like Hunter isn't a badass first name.  Triple H agrees.   Hey, guys. I don't accept other people's viewpoints on things! That makes me cool, right????   None, because parents can name their kids whatever the fuck they want.   [Here's the specs on my GPU.](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) I wasn't doing anything except browsing the web (no videos, no games, not even an animated smiley in an IM program). As such, you can see that it kinda sucks.  If I have the CPU idle, my GPU temp shouldn't ever go over like 40 or 50C, right?  Also, what's defined as idling? Would that be when the load is under a certain number (and, presumably, "System Idle Process" is in the 90s)? Can you leave a computer on as long as you want and still have it be considered idle? I was going restart the computer for the night so it cools all the way down, and then leave it on for 30 minutes with no programs running, except Speccy to monitor the GPU.  Good idea, bad idea? Did I have any misinformation above?  Thanks.   This only counts if you got her phone number. Unless you knew her already. But have an upvote anyway for the clever line.   Is there a way to check if background processes/bloatware are even the problem? I don't wanna go through all the processes and then find out it was never an issue.  My CPU generally stays at a load of 5 or below when I'm just browsing the internet or something. It's just that I think the video card overheats for no good reason, which overheats the motherboard, which makes my laptop feel like the surface of the sun to the touch.  **EDIT:** For example, right now, like I said, I'm doing nothing but browsing the web. I've got 12 tabs open, but nothing at all that should cause a heavy load. I'm running no other programs except Core Temp, Speccy, Yahoo IM, AIM, and Task Manager.  Despite this, my GPU is at 69C (very high, according to [this](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png)), and doesn't appear to have any plans to drop below that at all any time soon.  I'm not watching any videos, I'm not using anything like Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects, and I'm not streaming anything anywhere. I'm convinced my GPU just sucks balls.    I think it's unfair to call someone's marriage that ends in divorce a result of solely bad decisions. People do change.   I can understand that. I just have an aversion to the logic in the OP since it implies that the nature of marriage causes divorce, not the people who get married.  Kinda like the whole "Guns don't kill people, people kill people" thing.   I really don't like it when people say someone has such-and-such a chance of doing something because that's the average. If a person is careful who he/she marries, when he/she marries him/her, and makes sure that everything is as stable as it can be, I'd say they have a much better than 50/50 chance.  The fact that half of American marriages end in divorce, or whatever the hell the number is, has no bearing on a specific marriage. It's not the idea of marriage that causes it-- it's people's bad decisions.   Hehe, #3 looks like the Monopoly guy   I'm not an expert by any means, but I own several external HDDs, and all I do is plug em in, select the files I want, select "Copy," choose the (C:) or (E:) drive, and let the computer do the rest.  I don't know how many files you want to copy or how large in file size they are, so there may be a more efficient way.   Gotcha, I understand.  Thanks for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it.   There's really no way to do it without taking the laptop apart in some manner?   I'd probably end up killing myself, my computer, or both.  Let's say I do get my hands on some compressed air. What exactly should I do to ensure I clean the interior of my laptop as thoroughly as possible?    The fact is, you have a Dell, they've probably disabled whatever features, if any, might be used to safely downclock in software.  I thought underclocking would affect hardware, not software?   I know this will sound like I'm being stubborn, but I honestly do not have enough faith in myself to take apart and reassemble a laptop. I practically live on my computer, so if anything happened to it, I'd be pretty screwed.    What? Could you open up task manager and tell me which program or process is causing this?  It's always something that could not possibly be the cause, like Task Manager or Windows Explorer. The computer just overheats so much it can't even handle simple tasks for the time being.  **EDIT:** And what's the best way to disable background processes, and knowing which ones I should and shouldn't disable? And what's "bloatware"?   I'm telling you, I can't get ahold of a can of compressed air. Unless there's a common household item I can use as a substitute, this isn't happening unfortunately.    You mean like an external hard drive plugged into the USB?   [Overall system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/Speccy.png)  [Motherboard](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/Motherboard.png)  [Processors](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/CPU.png)  [Graphics card](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/GPU.png)  All taken within the last 2 minutes.  Now, I've heard (and not necessarily saying I don't believe) that most high-end laptops can handle 100C without potential system damage. But the issue here is that the computer reaches temps as high as 80 or above (shown in screenshots), despite the fact that I only have the following programs open:  * AIM * Yahoo IM * Firefox (admittedly, 9 tabs, but just Google, a message board, Reddit, Wiki, and TV Tropes) * uTorrent * Task Manager  Now, I believe my graphics card (NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M) is known for being a piece of shit, mostly in terms of playing video... but I haven't watched any videos since I turned the computer on an hour ago (confirmed in Task Manager). I haven't run any other programs other than Speccy, which I closed after taking the above screenshots.  Like I said, I haven't done anything but browse a message board or two, as well as Reddit.  It seems like underclocking/undervolting are my only options. There's no way I can take my laptop apart to clean the fans (I have no experience whatsoever in doing so), and I can't get my hands on a cooling pad or a can of compressed air (long story).  How much can I underclock/undervolt? Is there a limit? I'd really like my laptop to stay below 60C at almost all times. If this means a sacrifice of performance, I can live with that. I just hate the feel of a scalding hot laptop (I can feel it even as I type), and it causes the computer's CPU Usage to jump to 100% at random times when I'm not doing anything that would consume enough power to take the laptop to full load.  Any comments, questions (if I left out important information or anything), suggestions, all are welcome.  Thanks, guys.   They may have been a friend at one point, but eventually, they became an enemy without your knowledge.   It does come from your enemies. You just don't know they're your enemies yet.   I have some pills I have to take three capsules of, three times a day. So what I do is I take 9 out of the big container, and put them into a smaller, empty container. That way, I have what I know is a day's worth in one container, so I know it should be empty before I go to sleep.  Not trying to steal OP's thunder, just something I thought I'd share.

Firefox   When I want to Google something, all I do is type a word or phrase in the address bar and press Enter, and it searches for it on Google.  Somehow, and I honestly can't remember how, it got changed from going to Google to AOL. Can I change it back?   I wanted one of those so bad. And tbqh, I still do.   Touche. But it wasn't in the form of a question I WIN!  _   So, who's gonna make the lewd comment about the boy's mother saying his jacket smelled like "bush"? Any takers? Going once...   What if I told you it's supposed to be?      Isn't it illegal, via the terms of service of most sites like this, that you don't share your account with anyone?         My internet goes out randomly for 2-3 minutes at a time, and I've determined that it's not some kind of electronic interference from other appliances, it's not the internet connection itself, and it's not the signal strength.  As such, I was suggested to change what's apparently called my "DNS switchboard" from my ISP to Google Public DNS.  On [this page](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup), step four of the process reads:  *Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.*  I have both IPv4 and IPv6. How do I know which one to choose?   So that if you drop of a glass or a plate, it doesn't break into a million pieces.         I've always loved the *Saw* series, and I find myself enamored with John Kramer's machinations. I've often thought of what kind of "game" he'd force someone I know to play, or even myself. So hit me, Reddit.   Oddly enough, this is one of the few times when I hope this WON'T reach the front page. That'd be a lot of work.  **EDIT:** Also, depending on how many I have to do, I might not be able to get to these tonight. I'll try my best, though.  **EDIT 2:** If you don't mind, let me know if you're male or female and your age. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, it's okay. Just don't even mention it in your comment.      Russian Roulette, "Chicken" on railroad tracks, you name it. Anything where a life could potentially be lost.  And whatever you can potentially win, you have to provide 1/5 of that total. So if your number is $10,000, you've got to be able to throw $2,000 in, and four other people will do the same. This info is just there so you can think about if paying 1/5 of [x amount of] dollars is worth doing something that could kill you, or make you five times richer.  If you wouldn't do it for 1/5, would you for 1/10? 1/20?                        Once I start taking them, you're really gonna make me call my doctor every time I get a refill, even though I brought in the confirmation note for the prescription the first time?  I'm over here losing my goddamn mind because of Xanax withdrawal, and I have to wait til tomorrow to get a refill (haven't had any since Friday) because I have no minutes on my cell phone and I was forced to make an appointment with my physician.  Ugh. Just venting. Sorry if this sounds bad or weird.      [General computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)  [Graphics card specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/07/23/gcard.png)  As you can see, the graphics card overheats (which I think is a consistent problem with this specific video card), which causes the motherboard and processors to over heat, and that causes my laptop to stall and struggle to run the simplest of tasks because of the excess heat. Plus I don't think that a constant temperature of ~75C is healthy for a laptop.  I'm looking for anything, *anything* at all that even has a chance of maybe helping with this problem. Software, BIOS updates, changes to any settings on the computer (such as under Control Panel, etc.). Anything. Anything at all.  Thanks in advance. If you need any more info, it shouldn't be a problem at all for me to provide it. Feel free to tell me if I've omitted anything important.      [Computer specifications](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png)  I can't watch a high-quality video (even on YouTube) without the graphics card overheating, which then overheats my processors and motherboard. At that point, the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100%, and stays there while I can't do much of anything. I can move the mouse and click things and everything still technically functions normally, just *extremely* slowly. As if the computer is struggling to carry out the simplest tasks because the video card is so weak but is also trying its hardest to maintain quality video feedback (which it doesn't more often than not).  What are my options other than "Buy a new laptop"?   We know one wild bull will gore everything with a heartbeat, but what if *another* bull was introduced? How would they act towards each other and towards the matador?   I mean, how badass would it be to see your supervisor, maybe some older fat dude who doesn't look like he's ever been in a fight in his life, pull a gun during an attempting robbery at your workplace?   [My computer specs, courtesy of Speccy)[http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png]  And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.), even while I can't access web pages.  When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.  I made this thread before but forgot about it, so I wasn't able to confer with other users. I was given the following advice:  ***You could try adding Google's DNS to your settings, it's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Or some other DNS service.***  ***Try this. It sounds like a service on your router is crashing (probably DNS) and the 2 or 3 minutes if how long it takes your router to notice and restart the service. Using an external DNS will solve this by removing your dependency on the crashy DNS server.***  So, three questions:  1. Is this the best way to remedy this? If not, what is? 2. How do I go about doing this?  Thanks   And what, if anything, did the FCC have to do with this decision?  **EDIT:** Just in case some people don't watch the show, I'm referring to the TV series *South Park.*   I made this thread a few days ago, starting off with "Zoologists/animal experts of Reddit," but now I realize that pretty much anyone could have a good answer for this thread.      Other than "Holy shit I can't believe the religious conservatives haven't gotten this cancelled yet."         I've attempted to convert four MKV files to MP4 format. The first three had the audio out of sync with the video, but one of them had no sync issues whatsoever.  Any ideas as to what the problem could be? Should I post the codec info for the videos that didn't work and the one that did?         **NOTE:** This is a re-post from last night. No one responded (I assume they wouldn't, since it was late), so I hope doing this isn't against the rules/rediquette. I did read through them both to make sure it isn't, but if I missed something and it actually is against the rules, I apologize.  [Here are my system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png), courtesy of Speccy. As you can see, my graphics card kinda blows (I wasn't doing anything that should strain the video card-- not watching videos or playing games. Just surfing the web), even though I believe it was touted as one of the most powerful when it was released.  My laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation (released in 2008). I will admit that at times, I do use strenuous programs-- mostly Sony Vegas for video editing. I have a CM Storm laptop cooler, but there's a short in the power cord and it won't work unless I hold it a certain way, and I can't do that and use the computer at the same time.  Unfortunately, I can't afford a new laptop cooler, much less a new computer. Are there any ways to keep my laptop cool consistently, or to cool it down when it gets past my preferred temps (without shutting it down or putting it in Sleep/Hibernate mode)?  I've actually heard of using ice to keep one's laptop cool-- does this really work? I can't remember the specifics, but I definitely remember reading that at least twice on this subreddit.  **Also, a disclaimer-- I'm 99% sure that I won't be willing to take the laptop apart at all. The warranty expired a long time ago, and I know jack shit about advanced computer hardware.**  If you need any other information, don't hesitate to let me know.  	170
 Thank you, I haven't herd of this site but, I'm going through it and it's very comforting to see others with issues as well. I greatly appreciate it.  	1
 Those geodes are awesome!! I catalogue fossils at school, and we have nothing like that...   felix-means lucky   I have a picture of myself as a baby, wrapped in a yellow blanket. I looked like a melon with a head. Hence, train_subject8771.    I see your point about Agravaine. He needs to go if Arthur is going to succeed.  However, what I dislike about him is that he acts like a leech. He doesn't act independently and needs Morgana to tell him what to do to get his own revenge. If he was a real villain, he would act on his own accord and not on someone else's.  And you know that once he is exposed, he's just gonna run away like a coward.    This episode made me optimistic about Arthur's progression. His outpouring of emotion seemed genuine and I hope that he will uphold his word in future episodes.       I agree with you on the snow and rain thing. It's amazing what a little precipitation can do. All of a sudden it's like "OMG!! THERE'S RAIN/SNOW ON MY WINDSHIELD! I NEED TO DRIVE LIKE A MORON NOW!" My dad was one of the smart parents who taught me how to drive in both.    Personally, I think it means loving someone more than yourself and knowing that they feel the same way and they'll do anything to see you happy.    No. It sounds like devotion. Good for you.    I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you will find someone else who will appreciate you more.       I'll keep that in mind.    There are lots of unmarried couples who have kids and live together, with every intention of staying together. And there are lots of parents who are married with kids that get divorced anyway. That's why I'm questioning the purpose of the institution of marriage.    Just one question then. Why were you engaged for so long? Were you still unsure?   I like that. I hadn't thought of it that way before.    These days, people get married all the time and then get divorced. The divorce rate is astonishing. What's the point in getting married anymore? Do you think there is any meaning left in the promises of marriage?   Girl Genius! That was the first comic I started with. It's very well done. I also like the V for Vendetta suggestion. http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/    You make a valid point. There are a lot of people on the road who shouldn't be.    I can make a clover with my tongue.    Wow. That's crazy! I've never heard of that. In Pennsylvania, licenses last four years.    Hahaha..Different sides of the family.    Nice one. You would be correct. I am a teenager, but I've been driving for 2 years.   	22
 I tried for 2-weeks and then stopped as I decided to get tested for apnoea before trying SRT (yet) again. SRT can be brutal and I think a lot of people get anxious about it. A quote I liked from a book called 'The Effortless Sleep Method' is:  "If you are lucky enough to be referred to a sleep specialist, you may be unlucky enough to be advised to embark on a sleep restriction programme."   I don't think sleepio can hurt in the long run as long as you don't kick yourself if you don't succeed at it. I am not sure that therapists know how difficult SRT is or the anxiety it can cause some people who don't have the willpower to stick with the programme.   Good luck kittenmitten. Can you not switch to another doctor if this one is an ass?   CBT-I seems to have up to 80% success rates as far as I read and it is well worth re-itterating it's success rates. I think you are also right that sleep forums in general are filled with hopelessness. People who solve their issues get on with their life and don't come back, leaving the forums with only people who have problems!  However I did read a small clinical study involving 5 people where 2 of them failed to be able to adhere to the SRT program. In both cases there cortisol levels increased just before they went to sleep. The study didn't suggest why it rose but I would hypothesise that they got anxious about having to sleep at a specific time.  I also read a book called 'The Effortless Sleep Method' and while I didn't like the 'faith healer' style of it I did contact the author as she had said in the book that many people fail using Sleep Restriction Therapy. When I emailed her she said she had 100's of emails from people who were upset that they couldn't stick to the program.   I wrote more about this here:   https://trackitude.com/article/sleep/sleep-restriction-therapy-for-insomnia-more-harm-than-good/  It is also worth remembering that physical problems can also cause sleep issues. Depression, vitamin/hormonal deficiencies or apnoea. If SRT doesn't work for you then push your doctor to get more and more tests done. Many doctors are dismissive of tiredness, so I generally advise taking a friend/family member with you to back you up.  Anyway, a great positive and helpful post - thanks.      I think aches and pains can be attributed to calcium build up in the muscles. Magnesium Citrate (500mg an hour before bed) or Taurate (not oxide) can potentially sort that out and can help regulate sleep, it is also usable for depression which also gives aches and pains. Do you also get little twitches in the muscles sometimes? They may be myoclonic jerks (often perfectly normal and possibly a throwback mechanism when we were monkeys living in trees) or to much calcium in the muscles. If you haven't already tried it then pick some up from Amazon or a health food shop. I have been taking it for about a week now and it makes a huge difference to me. Holy Basil (Tulsi extract) may also be useful. I really don't know much about these but my minimal reading so far suggests that they can help suppress cortisol levels. They are both a cheap and easy thing to try.  If it doesn't work then get to a doctor. If you are aching all over then it may be more serious. Maybe take a friend of family member with you who can testify that you have a problem so that they don't fob you off. I felt fobbed off for almost two decades.  Good luck, I hope it works for you.    It sounds like you are having a difficult time of things, I have been there as I am sure that many have.   I have no idea why it came on 'suddenly' but I assume that you have had trouble sleeping for quite a while and it is the '3 days' with no sleep that has come on suddenly. It can be a long path to find something that works for you.  For me the problem seems to have been a magnesium deficiency but it is a little too early for me to be sure. Magnesium is linked to sleep problems, muscle aches and depression (which causes sleep problems). You may want to try Magnesium Citrate or Magnesium Taurate supplements (avoid Magnesium Oxide as it does not get absorbed very well). I take one 500mg supplement about an hour before I go to sleep. You can get them from health food shops or order from Amazon. I have read that you also need Calcium to help with Magnesium absorption but I think a lot of peoples diet are calcium rich and magnesium poor and so I don't take Calcium at the moment - you may want to bear that in mind though if the magnesium does not work on its own. I also take 600mg of Valarian root and Holy Basil (Tulsi extract) at the moment. For me the difference is extreme - I hope it is for you as well.  Some people will also take Melatonin. If that doesn't work then you can try the base building blocks of Melatonin which are 5-HTP and L-tryptophan. They form a chain so that L-tryptophan makes 5-HTP which makes Serotonin which makes Melatonin. Experiment with each walking deeper down the chain if the one above fails. Some people have reported that Melatonin does not work for them but 5-HTP does.   If you do not get enough light then that could interfere with your circadian rhythm. Try to go outside in your normal subjective morning (whatever time you used to wake up when you felt OK) for 30 minutes. I know this can be difficult if you are very tired but humans developed near equator where the day length is long and sun is very bright. You can also use a light box if you can get hold of one (£150 for a Philips GoLite which is quite good - is linked to age-related macular degeneration though over long periods)  Don't try to do too many of these things at once as it can be overwhelming to try everything, and expensive. I would try one at a time to see what does and does not work. Start with the supplements as they are easy.  Also chat with parents/tutors/doctors that you trust and let them know that you are having trouble. It doesn't do any good to try to fix this all on your own. Close family should try to understand if they are good but I have heard that some can be nasty and unhelpful.   Good luck, I hope you manage to start making progress soon.    My average is 5.42 hours a night this month, often broken and at unpredictable times.  I find that it is not the number of hours sleep that I get but how I feel when I wake up that is most important. Remember that you can get 9 hours and feel rotten or get 4.5 hours and feel pretty good some days.        Thanks for posting the link as it is an interesting twist.   Maybe I haven't thought about it enough but 'acceptance and commitment therapy' seems to have no underlying difference to CBT. They both try to make you relax. I am not even sure that the technique used is any different:  "[A]CT helps you see how futile it can be putting energy into trying to change the thoughts and feelings that crop up around sleep.  ‘It teaches you to accept their presence and let them go, which in turn pushes you towards sleep.’"  CBT also tries to make you 'let go' and so I can't see any difference. Isn't this just a marketing gimmick?   	9
 same..   I honestly kind of like them...very minimalistic.  But the new Aero blur would be beautiful as well.   I'm on a Surface as well ;)   ..my-my eyes....      It's still Windows 10, either way.  I just thought the Defender app and my desktop wallpaper went especially well together. :)   I think that design choice may be up to the app (in this case Spotify) developers, not Microsoft.   seems she took it down - same fate as the last teaser, CanSeeCanDo. here are links for both.

 This, probably just a gift that got damaged.  Could've been a stone saying "I love my wife" or something I dunno   Nope        I would think so  Plastic + dirt is never a good combo   Actually a friend of mine put some in his car and boy is it dirty (his is black though and I live in a dusty little town)  I'm not sayin the vinyl looks bad but the design is... Well... I wouldn't drive that personally   I would imagine the upkeep must be a pain, imagine washing this and then a part of it comes off and you're like   Seriously?!    Why does coal need testing?      I don't know if that looks awesome or if they just screwed up that car...  *scratches head   Oh hell yes, hold my beer  *Jumps in*  The foam! It does nothing!

 I just read that whole article. Some ... things... need to be wiped off the planet. THIS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN IS WHY WE DONT INBREED    Got it! Thanks dude!:)   Everyone is welcome to join me  GT Troop4921   Hey guys; Im going to give you a few of the shortcuts I have found that still keep it legit. [Spoiler](#s "THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS")   SQUAT JUMPS WORK WONDERS    Well, I dont need the points so here you guys go! W0WTH-ISN07E-V3N7H-47HARD-H4H41   Guys I just beat it:D #GetOnMyLevel      Okay I guess your right about first posting this in /r/Morrowind. Its not that he traveled back in time, it starts in Morrowind and with him being a vampire, he lives through the time into Oblivion, then into Skyrim. I planned on it being a series through all three games. I will x-post this over onto /r/Morrowind and see the results there first. Thanks!   I agree. I dont know, cause not all the races only have babies with their race.   Hey guys ac here! So, if any of you saw my last post on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/1gy6l5/troopor_train_subject896_plays_skyrim/) I do youtube videos of Skyrim. Now the ones that were linked were before I got my Roxio Game Cap so they were all recorded on a little flip camera. Well, a few months ago I got Morrowind GOTY and had started playing. I stopped and thought about it for a second, and I said to myself "Why not make a series?!"(BTW This was before my Skyrim videos flop) So heres the pitch on the series: Its a semi RP. My character is a Dark Elf assassin, sent back to Morrowind from Tamriel because of a slight crime commited(petty theft or assault). He is in his mid to late 20's and is very agile and quick moving. He quickly decides to become a member of the Dark Brotherhood to progress his abilities further. Along the way, he decides to become a vampire. After advancing all the ranks of the Brotherhood,  he realizes his true calling(main story) and does that. Knowing he now has the ability of immortality, he sets out to conquer all things, Morag Tong, Thieves Guild, all sides quests. After doing so and amassing a horde of weapons, armors, and ancient relics, he creates a tomb for himself where he rests for ages. Until he is awoken upon a ship bound for Tamriel. He asks a shipsmen what day it is and he responds : "I believe it to be Morndas, on the 3E 433. Why do you ask?".  What do you guys think? Please be open and responsive!:)   I say roughly 200+ years AFTER Skyrim. I wish your character could be like the descendant of like any famous character from previous games.   I try for the DLC cause I need achievements   Okay Idea for a tag since RDDT is out of the question. R37? R for reddit, the 3 to somewhat represent the D, and 7 for Bungie and T   Hell, you can get a good 1Tb for $100 and thats what im doing in a month. Id suggest the 32   Idk if theyre down but there is so few players it's almost impossible to play. I just hopped off and there were only 205 players on   After a long night of ODST and eventually a bit of 3, we decided to flip the Elephants in Sandtrap. /u/The_Amazing_KyleClam, VPR Viper, Sinisterspade7, and myself succesfully flipped it. I know its not the first time this has been done but we were so proud when we got it flipped!       13,343   7,777      alright turning on my xbox now lol had to wrap up some things   Alright, I'm getting on now so if you want to work on some, message me!   This is genius but not my favorite. I love Dominion and the DLC playlists to much to have to deal with a bunch of people who arent there for it. The DLC list is very worth it cause I remember in Reach, you could hardly get a DLC match cause of the people that didn't have it.   Woo! Halfway in and I've already beat Halo 2! Now on to ODST!   Yeah, im using a crappy free live streamer so this is the best quality and fps i can get. As for the audio, I don't know whats going on       Yess sir! Im going to play all the games on 7/7 for the pure enjoyment    Why not July 7th?(;   Alright, im working on them now since I have a bit before I start my livestream again          Hey hey, /u/IKissMyCousin, I didn't recognize the name but recognize the GT! and /u/Mercutio77, I might get on XBL later tonight. Keep watch!   Hey guys! I'm back after a 9 day hiatus (went out of town), and ready to play it up! So, as a few of you might know, about 2 weeks ago I posted that I was working on 100% of the Halo series. Well, I still am and I want to work on the Vidmaster challenges of Halo 3 and ODST(preffered). So if you would like to help me get any of these please message me on XBL @ Troop4921. If you want to see what achievements I am currently still working for, you can go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1fztc6/working_on_100/)   GT: Troop4921 hmu if you still need help   Got a solid 3/15 now. Pretty proud.   Any size idea? like are we talking 4 GB or like 14 GB   I use the Triton Halo 4 series and they work wonders for me.    x-post this on /r/ODST and hope. There are some people who view it regularly.   Yes there is and I just so happen to be a moderator for it!:)   Would you please put this on /r/ODST for me:) Trying to get some people on there:)   Um yes Ill order ten please   I loved 3's    I would go to Trevalyn    Very dissappointed with myself. Only got 1/5 and that was #5 cause Cole Protocol was my favorite book that I read three times. Jeez. I need to fill up on my knowledge again.   Alright thanks:)   Thank you! It was such a time consumer but it ranks up there with my favorite Halo achievements. We've decided soon were going to LASO H4 and see how well that works. Any advice?      Hey guys! Itsa me! AC! /u/IKissMyCousin , /u/Yummy_Tiger, and I [plus a friend whose not on Reddit :(] all tackled the Ach. Vidmaster Endure in Halo 3: ODST which is to ENDURE 4 whole sets of fire fight. If you never played ODST firefight, heres a break down. There's sets which are composed of 3 rounds which are composed of 5 waves. If you did the math, we did roughly 64 waves (including bonus). It took us our estimated 2 hours but was very satisfactory in the end. If you wana look at a bit of our results, check it out [here](http://train_subject896.imgur.com/all/). Past that, contact us and we'll be more than willing to help again I'm sure!   Yes, Yes I would! I haven't very many and I'm working on 100%ing all the series so YES! Gt; Troop4921   I should also add my GT is troop4921    Id be up for it!      Can't say as I blame you but I think if I do get the Exxone it will be JUST for Halo 5   TWAT?! WHY NOT?!    okay then. I aso had a few friends clarify for me    Consider me in. Problem is, im pretty sure you get the Mark VI from solo legendary. GT Troop4921  	57
 Bad Diary Days by Pedro the Lion. Originally heard it as a cover, fell in love with it, and then looked up the original and fell in love with it even more.    I was introduced to this magical delicacy over thanksgiving. I ate the entire tray of them.    My favorite shirt in sixth grade was a bright orange tight fitting shirt with white stitching that I colored green. It was slightly see through too, so I thought it was cool to wear different patterned tank tops under it. How I  thought this was a cute look, I will never know...   Oh my god, I'm not alone! I usually notice it and just squeeze it out.   This is so true! I grew up on military bases, and some military wives have to be the most horrible people I've ever met. My mom has had "friends" go to the Sergeant Major of my father's unit saying that she burned us with cigarettes, locked their children in closets (she baby-sat these women's kids a lot), and some other made up shit. Why? Because one of these women was cheating on her husband and my mom told her that she didn't think that what she was doing was right, and said she did not want to associate with her anymore. Luckily the Sergeant Major realized they were full of shit and just wrote it off. Military wives can be vicious.   For humorous purposes.   Wow, I am too jealous of your hair! It looks amazing :) I have the same type of hair you do, so I'll definitely have to check this out if it makes your curls look this great!    Maybe he means pedestrian as in somebody who doesn't stand out?   	8
 The father is full of shit then.   A child cannot have phimosis. It's normal for the foreskin to remain attached to the glans until puberty for some kids.  ...non-retractability (in the absence of scarring or other abnormality) can be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.  http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/96/9/449.long    A child cannot have phimosis. It's normal for the foreskin to remain attached to the glans until puberty for some kids.  ...non-retractability (in the absence of scarring or other abnormality) can be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.  http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/96/9/449.long     Can you explain why I still get ovulation pains while on birth control?   I support financial abortion for men because I don't believe in forcing anyone into parenthood, but sorry, as a woman I just don't believe a man should have any legal say over whether or not a woman has an abortion. It's her uterus and body being risked, not his. It's unfortunate if he wants to become a father and she aborts, but she was bearing the full weight of the pregnancy, not him.   ...wat   You saw this enforced?   My parents wouldn't even let us blow bubbles into our soda cups, let alone make a huge mess.   Even China has mandatory break laws.    Even if it is just an option and a woman can choose to send a baby to the nursery for the night, it is not necessarily narcissistic. Many loving mothers do this.  Of course, but that's quite a bit different from sending them away because you don't feel like dealing with them the very same day they're born. This story was coupled with her comment, "I'll be dealing with her for the next 18 years."   That's because more students in Sweden leave home when going to college than American students.  Swedish students pay for their costs of living themselves and American students live off their parents.   Tech schools would be tuition free too.   Being tired as hell and letting someone else take the baby while you nap isn't quite the same as saying, "Take her all night, I want to sleep and I'll have to deal with her for the next 18 years anyway."   Growing up, I always heard about how when I was born, after everyone had saw me and held me, my mom told the staff to put me in the nursery instead of leaving me in her room for the night because, "I want to sleep, and I'll be dealing with her for the next 18 years."  I never thought that was odd, and no one in my family acted like it was odd, until I told my boyfriend about it and he was horrified. I've told the story online a few places, and the responses were the same.   My mother had done plenty more nmom stuff throughout the years that were more severe, but that stands out as a very early sign of how our relationship was going to be. No, no bonding time. Just put her in the nursery.   He was probably held under and drowned.   Well...that's upsetting.   I can find no good source for this.   I don't consider this to be immoral. Age of consent in most places is 16.   Eh. I don't find that to be that bad.    Source?   Anastasia Romanova was a bully. She was known for biting, scratching, and hitting her cousins.  Yeah, she was a child, but still...;)   I only see white and gold when the picture is washed out.    People were dismissive of the actor playing Enjolras in the film, even though he was one of the best singers in the whole movie, just because he was too masculine-looking.  Funny, of all the actors who have ever played Enjolras I thought Aaron Tveit looked the most feminine.    I don't get to see the night because if I stay up late, I'll be tired for school/work the next day.  Nothing to do with fear.   Huh, my panic attacks cause me to hyperventilate for several minutes along with feeling like I need to tear my hair out and curl on the floor.  And it's never brought on by anger.   They're degrees, not vocational certificates.  The point is to make society more educated. The only goal of education isn't to get a job.   TIL Germany, Denmark, and Finland are communist.   The point is to get a more educated society, not to hand out degrees.   America: where things other countries do daily are considered impossible.   Does this mean countries like Germany, Denmark, Finland, etc are infantalized?    Not everyone will go. Not everyone goes to college even in countries that offer it for free.   Way to make sure the poor can't get an education.   I think you missed the word "tuition" there.   Holy crap, I can't believe there are still people who deny marriage is a civil right.  Really? This is the first time you've ever heard that there are people against gay marriage?   When Eisenhower did it in the 50s did it bring employment to a screeching halt?   It didn't hurt jobs too badly when Eisenhower did it in the 50s.   Eisenhower did it in the 50s.   Reddit is made up of thousands of people.   Eisenhower did it.   TIL 1950s America was Communist.   TIL 1950s America was Communist.   A Republican president did it 60 years ago.   Then Eisenhower was a socialist.   TIL Eisenhower was a socialist.   Eisenhower did this in the 50s. Did people leave?   The richest people were taxed at 90% in Eisenhower's time, and America had some of the most booming business in the world.   Socialism: a way of organizing a society in which major industries (meaning something that produces goods or services) are owned and controlled by the community instead of individual people and companies.  If you still have private business and private industry you cannot be living in a socialist economy.     Someone else? You're as entitled to use the education you pay for as anyone else.   Socialism is the workers and community taking over businesses and the means of production for themselves and keeping the profits for themselves.   Tax funded education is no different from tax funded fire departments, police, or roads. None of those are socialism.   Oh, so now America goes from striving to be #1 in the world to just attracting people from developing countries and calling that good enough?  Good for you, South Korea, Japan, Finland, UK, Canada, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany etc. We'll never be among your ranks in education because we're just focusing on being better than developing nations instead of being as good as we can be.   I've taken to downvoting anyone whose comment only consists of one word:  "Free"   Not saying it's perfect, just better than the USA.  And I'm still here because it costs a shit-ton of money to emigrate.    Tax funded college isn't socialism.   Is paying for K-12, firemen, and police stealing too?   Plenty of countries already have free or cheap college.   Norway and Israel both have compulsory military service for men and women. Women who can't handle combat roles do something else.  80% of military positions aren't combat anyway.   4.5 years   http://www.businessinsider.com/inequality-and-mobility-in-the-united-states-2013-7  Income inequality has made it so you're unlikely to move out of the income group you started in no matter how hard you work. If you're born in poverty, you're unlikely to move out.   I'm sure those 20 people praying had everything to do with terrorism...   Because the 20 people praying clearly had something to do with terrorism, right?   ISIS thinks God wants them to kill everyone who opposes them - and that includes other Muslims.   ISIS and Muslims follow the same god Jews and Christians do.   I've heard my mom say to my dad, "You're the one that wanted kids."   There's one of her at the beach as a toddler.   Honestly, any time a parent wants to refuse medical care for their child and it puts their child at risk like this, they should be ignored and the team of doctors allowed to do whatever is necessary.   But a friend of mine who is a psychologist said that one of her clients actually suffered traumatic flashbacks because of that scene. And it makes me so sick to my stomach to think that even if I did express this to these people, that at least one person was forced to relive one of the worst experiences of her life because DD just couldn't resist adding in another pointless rape scene, reddit still wouldn't give a shit, because lol triggers and lol only war veterans get ptsd.  And it sucks for that client. It truly does. But GOT is known for its violence and sex. It's a very adult show, as anyone who has watched 5 seasons of it would know by now. It isn't up to the writers to cater to people who have sensitivities. Chances are there is someone who would be triggered by anything violent shown. Hell, I'm sometimes triggered by "Roseanne" because Dan and Roseanne's loud fights remind me of my parents' fights, nights of hearing my dad tear the house down in anger, and crying myself to sleep as a child. But the writers had no responsibility to cater to me. If you know something it bound to have aspects that upset you, don't watch it or at least wait for a summary. Also whoever said rape victims don't get PTSD? You must be confusing that with when we make fun of people who say they got PTSD because some asshole wolf whistled at them.  Finally, how do you know this rape scene was pointless? It existed in the book, just for a different character than Sansa. And how do you know it doesn't play a part in continuing Sansa's character arc?   I love how they're saying Sansa being raped takes away her agency and turns her back from being a player into a pawn.  Because there's no way a strong and willful person can be raped.   Laxatives.  It cured my constipation but I was shitting all freaking day even after passing the problem stool. I had to call off work.   So the State can get them away from parents early and start programming them. Smooth.  This is a quote from someone in this section.   Plus, the world needs cashiers and waiters and whatnots.  And yet still doesn't want to pay them enough to live on.   No, there is no evidence for it happening at all. In fact, Norse and Hindu mythology have similar stories.   The Old Testament tells the Hebrews to kill everyone who doesn't believe in the same god as they do, but the vast majority of Jews ignore that part.   It's the same with Muslims. The vast majority don't follow that part. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, and the world would be far worse off if a huge number of them took to killing people.   Nicholas II, not Alexander III. And there is no evidence that he ever slept with Alexandra.   http://www.amazon.com/Anne-Frank-Diary-Complete-Unabridged/dp/8182522218/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt   I love that someone cut the hands off one of his statues.   The boys were probably as old as 15, though.   This is nothing but a founding myth.   You're a troll because you think violence against innocent Muslims is a reasonable response to that.  ISIS kills other Muslims who oppose them by the thousands. Not all Muslims are the enemy.   Well said.  Your comment deserves more than just an upvote.   Tagged as troll. Thanks.   Male fetuses don't start off female. Someone explained it pretty well earlier:  Human fetuses don't start out female. It's a common misconception that I see all over the Internet. We start out undifferentiated. There's a genital tubercle that contains the rudiments of both the male and female external genitalia, and the Wolffian and Mullerian ducts-- the internal plumbing--are both present. If the fetus has a Y-chromosome, then the SRY gene kicks of the masculinizing program: the female plumbing degenerates, the labioscrotal swelling closes up to make a ballsack, and the glans and urethral folds enlarge to make a penis. In the absence of that signal, the male plumbing degenerates, the glans diminishes to make a clitoris, and the labioscrotal swelling remains open to make labia with a vaginal opening. The female program seems to be the "default," meaning that if something goes wrong with the masculinizing program, the genitals often resort to female development (though they can remain in sort of an intermediate intersex state). Maybe this is why so many people think that we "start out" female.     Human fetuses don't start out female. It's a common misconception that I see all over the Internet. We start out undifferentiated.  *Thank you.* I get so sick of seeing this everywhere.   The only goal of college isn't to get a job. It's fine to have that goal, but it's for general education as well. It's beneficial to have a well educated population.   I'm happy to pay for this, just like I already pay for public schools, libraries, roads, fire departments, police stations, etc.  We know it's paid for by taxes.   A goal of college should also be general education so you have a well educated population, not just training for a job.   These people would probably defend those rabbis who suck the blood off of the penises of babies after circumcising them.   Not caring if someone is killed in front of you isn't a crime.   I've been in retail.   As long as you don't make a mess they have to clean up, they don't care what you do.   When I have panic attacks I'm too busy trying to breathe to take a selfie.   $400 a month is pretty common for America. Some people pay as much as $800 a month.   The same reason why everyone has to pay for everyone else to have access to fire departments, police stations, roads, etc.   Those services are well worth it.   I'm happy about it.   Except our [economic and social mobility](http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Economic-Mobility-Across-Developed-Countries.png) has been dropping off in the last decades.   You're very likely to remain in the same economic class you were born in in the USA whether you work hard or not.    Just like you're paying for other people to have firemen put their houses out.   Denmark and Germany (as well as a few other countries) have free college. Their professors are paid through tax dollars, like firemen and policemen.   Despite their high taxes (or because of them) they have a much better economic mobility than we do.  You can actually crawl out of poverty in Germany. The USA? Good luck.   Do you think other countries with free education pay their professors with unicorn farts?  It's funny how America claims to be #1 but sees things other countries can do as impossible.   I've been through a living hell since October 2014 (my whole life really, that's just when it got worse).  I am not intentionally starving myself and do eat when I feel a little hungry, but I have lost all appetite almost. I was at 136 lbs when I last weighed myself am now at 128. Still a healthy weight for my height, but I am feeling the affects on my body already. The shakes, the dizziness, etc. As someone who used to cut and is no longer able to, I get the same satisfaction from it that I used to get cutting. So I do enjoy it a little.  As I said, it isn't that I am hungry and am ignoring it. I'm just not hungry. If I felt like I was hungry enough to eat an entire hamburger, I would.  But I do wonder how long this will go on.   In anthropology class we were discussing how archaeologists discovered the bones of a person, thousands of years old, that had a limb pretty cleanly amputated, probably to prevent infection in an injury from traveling.   Understandably, everyone in the class inhaled sharply and started discussing how much that had to have sucked. This was in the days before adequate painkillers, so in all reality this person was probably just held down while they went to town cutting his arm off.   I said, "I think I'd have rather just been allowed to die." A guy beside me gave me a funny look and said, "*Really?* Sure it hurts, but at least you're alive afterwards."    Someone else chimed in, "Yes, and once it's healed you go about your daily life again. I mean, at least you're still alive."  Just...wow. As someone with depression I have contemplated ending it just because I can't take the emotional and psychological pain anymore. I can't imagine electing to go through removal of a limb without anesthesia to stay alive. It's completely 100% not worth it.  Also related, this Cracked article:  http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1604-major-surgery-with-no-painkillers-5-things-i-learned.html  The writer went through surgery without general anesthesia (including having his ribs spread open, which the local would not help) because they were working on his heart, and they were worried administering anesthesia would make his heart stop.  I'm afraid if that were me, I'd have to say goodbye to my loved ones and tell them I am choosing to die instead of letting them spread my ribs open without painkillers.   I guess this attachment to living is something I will just never understand. I haven't had a single experience so far that I would undergo surgery without anesthesia for, and I can't imagine I'll have any in the future.   Just knowing I have work the next day drags my entire day down. Do you have any tips?  Oh, I should add that I don't really hate my job, it's just that I feel like a sucker working to pay for a life I don't want. I'd rather die.      If I spend any extended time outside when there is a cold wind - or even a breeze - I get this horrible pain in my ears. You know the feeling when you sleep with your ear folded over and when you wake up your ear is stiff and painful? It's a lot like that, except the pain extends under my ear (almost where my jaw starts) and goes up to about two inches above my ear. It can be so intense I have to lay down with a blanket over my head and just let my ears warm up.  Also, I know it's the wind because if I put cotton balls in my ears or wear a hat, I'm fine.      I was in kindergarten or thereabouts. My aunt moved close to us after living far away for a long time. She had no kids of her own yet so she liked to take me around and do things. I learned right away I liked spending time with my aunt more than my mom. Mom always had something mean to say and made me feel like she didn't really want me around. She complained and groaned whenever she had to take me somewhere. I heard her talk about her "goddamned kids" on the phone before and knew what she was talking about.  Well, one night my aunt was dropping me off back at home and I threw a fit, as 6-year-olds do. I said I didn't want to be left with mom and wished my aunt could be my mom. My aunt just said, "That's not very nice, your mom loves you," and left.  Well, after that, mom grabbed me and said, "If you don't want to live here anymore, you don't have to. I'm getting you a suitcase and you're packing your things to live in an orphanage. I'll get another kid who isn't a little brat." She hauled out a suitcase and forced me to start throwing my things into it. I was wailing because I believed her 100%. I thought I was never going to see my dad or grandparents again. I thought I was never going to see my dog again. I had just gotten a kitten, and I thought I'd never pet or hold him again.   After packing all my clothes, she made me go to bed. I lay there and sobbed into my pillow the entire night. It wasn't until the next morning when mom went to wake me up for school that she found me still crying. She said, "Did you really think I'd send you away and bring home another kid?" Honestly, yes. Yes I did. What does that say about you?  Even then she made no real moves to comfort me or even apologize. She just made me get dressed for school.   Apparently my grandparents (dad's parents) read my mother the riot act when they learned about this. My grandmother even said, "But don't you know even if you were sent to an orphanage, your grandpa and I would come pick you up right away?" So at least I got a little comfort from them.  Oddly enough, I never really understood how fucked up this was until I told my boyfriend about it. I knew it was horribly mean, but I didn't realize it probably counted as psychological abuse.  Also, to this day my mom insists it was a just and fitting punishment.   Growing up, I always knew my mother was awful to me and my dad did some awful things too (although not nearly as bad as mom) but since the entire side of my mom's family is like that, I always saw it as normal. "Yes, today my mom called me a worthless idiot, what's for dinner?"  Then just 2.5 years ago I met my boyfriend and we were sharing childhood stories. I remember my boyfriend looking shocked or offended at some of mine and finally one day he said, "Your mother is awful and you should cut all contact with her."  Later I brought this up with my friends who I've known since middle school, and their replies were along the lines of, "Yep, we can't stand your mom." They just never mentioned it to me.   I lived with it for 20-odd years, but it never occurred to me until it was pointed out.    Anyway, I decided to make this post because I just found this subreddit and I already relate to so many of your stories. I'm sure I'll go into details at a later time, but right now I'm just reading other posts and coming to terms with the fact that I lived with emotional and psychological abuse for so long without realizing it. It's certainly had an affect on me. I've had severe depression since I was younger than 9 (9 is when I learned what suicide meant and could put a term to the feeling I'd had) and my anxiety can be pretty terrible too. I may have had those issues anyway, but my mother has made them 5 times worse at least.   I still think about small and unimportant things that upset me when I was a child. I am constantly replaying my worst experiences in my head.  Worst of all, tips to stop don't seem to help. "Go for a run." I'll ruminate while I'm running. "Find a hobby you enjoy." I'll ruminate while I'm scrap-booking.  What are your experiences?   She had cancer for a little while, but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder, so we decided it was time to put her down.  So I was there in the office with her, crying my eyes out. The vet said I could hold her, or just put her on the table and pet her. I felt absolute dread at the thought of her going limp in my arms. I was barely holding up as was and I was afraid that would make me lose it. It was taking all my strength to be there at all. My sister had offered to take her in so I wouldn't have to, but I was determined to be there in her last moments. So I rubbed her back as she was euthanized.  Now I am extremely sorry I didn't hold her. I know she didn't know she was about to die. She only knew she was in a place where she had been before and I was petting her. She passed away peacefully feeling me pet her back.  I know even if I had held her I would find something else to be upset about, but I can't shake the feeling that I wasn't properly there for her.  As I said, I've had her for 18 years and she was always there for me when my depression was at its worst and when I needed her most. Now she's gone and I feel I didn't return the favor on top of it.   She had cancer for a little while, but blood in her urine told us it spread to her bladder, so we decided it was time to put her down.  So I was there in the office with her, crying my eyes out.

JK Rowling used a werewolf as a metaphor for someone with AIDS (or so I have heard), and while the social stigma is probably very similar, there is one huge difference: Someone with AIDS isn't going to kill you, and a werewolf is his natural state will rip your throat out.  In his first and only year, Lupin almost killed four people. If Sirius Black hadn't been there to fight him off, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Snape would have been werewolf chow. And if by some chance they survived, they'd now have a lifelong curse.  What's the most damning is that Lupin forgot to take his potion (that keeps him in a human state of mind after transformation) himself. Snape didn't sabotage it to out him, and no one else did anything like that either. Lupin simply got distracted and forgot. Who's to say that couldn't happen again?  It's very unfortunate for Lupin, but if you turn into a deadly animal once a month, you probably shouldn't work in boarding school. I can certainly see where parents of Hogwarts students were coming from. CMV.  Edit: Yes, he resigned, but it was because he knew he'd eventually be fired.         My nearly 18-year-old female cat has sprouted a tumor on her side. I've been away so my family isn't quite sure how long it's been there. Some quick research makes it sound cancerous, since it grew sort of quickly and is hard to the touch. She doesn't seem like she's in pain or having trouble moving around.  I'm going to make an appointment with the vet on Monday, but I'm prepared for the worst since it seems cancerous, and her advanced age makes treatment difficult.   Anyone else gone through this?   I've had one, but it was after learning to relax my ass. It took a long time.   I downloaded some mods, now all of a sudden I can't finish quests. I'll get all the way to the end of one, and it won't finish. It won't disappear from the journal, and the marker won't go away. I killed a dragon, and once it was dead, it just laid there and didn't burn out. The marker didn't leave from it, either.   I have...  Skyrim School of Witchcraft and Wizardry  Arissa, the Wandering Rogue  Noble Wedding Dresses  Hearthfire God Chests  Cats of Skyrim  Skyrim Trading Posts  Goldleaf Pony Farm  Prince and Pauper  I have some others, but those have worked fine for a long time. Anyone else have an issue with the mods I listed above?    I've looked around the official medicaid site and couldn't find the answer. I am in Ohio, if that matters.  I am applying for medicaid, and I know it asks what your yearly salary is. The thing is, I have only had crappy jobs and I jump from one to the next. Do I just use the amount from last year's tax information? Or do I have to estimate what I'll make this year?   Maven leaves notes around Riften, saying that she'll have to take the losses from her mead out of her employees' salaries. I've been collecting them because they seem interesting, but I haven't found anything to do with them.             I'm hoping to get onto Medicaid next year since at $8 an hour pay I am too poor to afford any insurance. On top of that I tend to have expensive medical bills. I have a $500 one right now that's ruining my credit.   I had been hoping that I could get braces on Medicaid. Now, my need for braces isn't cosmetic. If it were, I wouldn't bother. Crooked teeth don't bother me much. My problem is that the two teeth beside by front teeth came in in such a way that they put pressure on the front teeth. This causes them to crack and cavities to set in very quickly no matter how on top of brushing and flossing I am. Not to mention the terrible toothaches and headaches that come with constant pressure on your teeth.   A dentist told me that without braces there is really nothing that can be done besides just filling in the cavities when they appear. All that can be done for the pain is ibuprofen. I can easily finish a bottle of those a month because of this. Nothing can be done for the cracking either.  But Medicaid only pays for braces for those under 21. So I'm pretty fucked. At least dental care is included in Medicaid, so I can get the cavities filled if nothing else. I learned for some states, Medicaid doesn't cover adult dental care at all. Federal law makes them cover dental care for children, but it's up to the state if they cover adults.  What's really infuriating is that when I was about 12 the dentist told my parents this problem with my front teeth would likely happen, and unless treated with braces, it would cause cracking and pain. Excellent spot on prediction. But my parents decided it was too expensive, and "not necessary because he's probably wrong."  I am completely for children receiving medical care, but they aren't more important than adults.   I don't know how to create an album on Imgur, so I'll individually post them here:  http://i.imgur.com/GFGKTee.png  http://i.imgur.com/AtPU9bd.png  http://i.imgur.com/Pr9igNy.png  http://i.imgur.com/DxznyMh.png  http://i.imgur.com/0Jlbq9I.png  That was 4 years ago. She's gotten fatter. These are more recent:  http://i.imgur.com/TQUNDS3.png  http://i.imgur.com/7Zgw9w0.png   I've been having a very difficult few months. I haven't cut myself in almost 2 years but I really needed the release. I was seriously dizzy afterwards and now my heart hurts, but at least I could relax a little after I had done it.  It doesn't have the same affect it used to when I was younger. Less release now and more dizziness and pain.   I feel like I don't really have a place in the world. I'm unlikely to ever get a job that pays very well and I'm still dependent on my parents at 25 years old. I am so sick and tired of living and the idea that there's a higher power watching over me is very attractive. It would be nice to think that it doesn't matter if this life is a complete failure because there's something more important afterwards.  My family seems to get a lot of comfort out of religion. It gave my grandma strength when my grandpa died and it seems to give my formerly-atheist cousin a place to fit in and feel good (her church is pretty liberal).   The only problem is is that I just don't believe it. I may as well wish Hogwarts was real. This is something I've always been a little jealous of religious people for.    I am just getting over the flu, and I have such a severe phobia of vomiting that I refuse to eat or drink anything if I feel nauseous. (A serious risk of dehydration, I know) And yet I threw up a few times despite not eating or drinking for 8+ hours. The vomiting lasted as long as if I had actually eaten something, too.   Why would I vomit even if there is nothing in my stomach besides normal fluids that are always there?   Inspired by my case of the flu. I vomited and was bawling the whole time.  It's probably because I hate it so much. Whenever I vomit the one thing I want most in the world is to stop. However, I learned a lot of people don't seem to mind throwing up much. I've had both my dad and my boyfriend ask why I was crying after vomiting in the past. They couldn't understand why it upset me so much.  So ladies, how do you handle this unpleasant situation?  	126
 I read this as "I loved and thrusted her".    X by Ed Sheeran   23, Single, I would go as long as I needed to pay my student loan debt completely. Afterwards ...... Well, I think you know what that means.    I don't know what's funnier: this comment or your username.    Last month, side effect of medicine, home   I remember when I was around 9 years of age, I woke up in the middle of the night due to a violent thunderstorm. My mum came into my room and watched the thunderstorm with me. It was small, but it meant a lot.    A Tale of Two Citiez, easily. The middle of the cd is basically my favorite: A Tale of Two Citiez, Fire Squad,   St. Tropez    I came here to say 2014 Forest Hills Drive by J.Cole. OP, you beat me to the chase. What's your favorite song on the album?   Other artists that I have been listening to lately are the 1975, Lil Wayne, and Lana Del Rey   I love that album    Play with my hair and I am yours    My ex girlfriend and her friends took one of my belongings and would not give it back. Instead, they kept on tossing it around. She was trying to assert her dominance over me so she said that if I wanted it back, I needed to be a man and come take it. I could not understand why the girl I trusted the most, and these other people that I also trusted, wanted to embarrass me.   As I was walking my girlfriend to her next class, I went into the stairwell and lost it. The worst part was that we were exchanging Christmas gifts later that night.    Mine started around that time as well. Similar to you, I didn't start getting help until I was 21; the main reason for that was I thought it was some sort of schizophrenia.    Has anyone ever cried while doing a compulsion? If so, tell us your experience.    I have gone to therapy on and off for about two years. I'm 23. I should have started earlier when I was referred to go, but I didn't.   I went to therapy for OCD and Depression. For depression, therapy has been wonderful. Therapy for OCD has been somewhat helpful. I will say that I have learned so many things about myself and my past; I never would have learned these things if I did not go to therapy and I understand myself so much better.    I have OCD too. When were you first diagnosed?   I don't cry but I definitely agree with you OP. Crying definitely helps cleanse the soul.   The last time I cried was over six years ago when my girlfriend (ex now) humiliated me in front of all of my friends.    If I feel like giving a compliment to either a guy or girl, I will give the compliment. If I give you a compliment, that does not mean I want to bang you.    Either very energetic and touchy (but not in a sexual way)   or very quiet and calm.    How It's Going Down   No matter what you do, you cannot force someone to love you; one of the most painful feelings is loving someone who doesn't love you back.    *Ask a girl out: 13 *Go on a date: 16 *First kiss: 14 *Hold hands: 14 *Have a first GF: 13 *Sex: 17    I dance around my house all of the time   You Guessed It    Some people advise not to drink by yourself. What are your personal opinions on drinking alone?    I definitely do tell my dad I love him on the phone; it may not happen every time but it happens most.    I used to be fat but I lost a significant amount of weight. I'm still hanging on to some chest fat and I hate it   I just answered this in another comment on my post, you should be able to see it.   However, my issue with this Duluth website is that it implies that only men commit abuse.    I linked [two](http://justicewomen.com/handbook/part2_e.html)  [articles](http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140620/ARTICLES/140629975) that provided evidence. You are right with the comment that the Duluth model focuses "on a female centric idea of abuse". That is where the main logic in innocent arrests is born. Police are trained to believe that men are always in the wrong, even when the police do not have have sufficient evidence.     I normally don't talk about this because I seem to be surrounded by radical feminists, however, I am a supporter of the Mens Right Activist Movement. I think, similar to most movements, you will not understand the validity of the movement until you have a personal experience with the problem.   However, when you have laws such as [the Duluth Model](http://www.theduluthmodel.org/about/) that enable police to arrest an innocent man, you will start to see the need.  When your wife is beating you and you know that you cannot defend yourself because you will be imprisoned, that is when you will need help from this movement.   Also, I do not think that most people understand truly understand what feminism is. My beliefs are confirmed when I hear feminists claim that they ["drink male tears"](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--l5XyX-6W--/851773464789881491.jpg). Most people who argue that they are feminists tend to use radical feminism to insult men. True feminists will not do this, however, I don't know if modern feminism is true feminism.   Ultimately, people view men as if they are the source of evil. However, women commit just as many wrongs. Mens Rights is not simply about oppressing women, it's about justice.    Maybe something is wrong with me, but I've smelled old clothing items that have my semen on them and sometimes it smells like fruit   I'm 23. I've had OCD since I was 17. I started taking medicine at 22. I also am clinically depressed. My parents have no knowledge of this, whatsoever. I've paid for the medical expenses myself.   For those who have told their parents/families about their OCD, could you share your experiences? Did you find that it helped?    My entire family likes to be involved in my dating life, therefore, I stopped bringing girls around completely. After they realized why I did this, they stopped. Now, things are normal when it comes to my dating life.    I always do   Kraken   Dr. Pepper. You will thank me later.    Hello there! I just wanted to say that I have shared this same obsession for quite awhile now. I wrote [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/2leh5b/my_ocd_story_a_journey_into_scrupulosity/) similar to this. I'm not writing this to promote my post or anything but I just wanted to share it so that you can know that you aren't alone. However, I still have these obsessions so I cannot offer advice as to how to overcome hell obsessions.    Very sensitive    This is caled scrupulosity. I suffer from it too and it's the worst thing. I'm currently doing Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) therapy and part of the therapy is to write down my intrusive thoughts multiple times so that they don't bother me anymore.    Whenever I open up, I either feel like a burden or I feel as if people don't want to deal with my sadness; therefore, I usually just avoid it.    As a child, but never as an adult   But, what if I want flowers?   Same here, I've tried to become more comfortable naked but it's not my thing   I like to see pubic hair in the form of Nike symbols   I wouldn't have a problem with it   The last time I peed the bed was when I was 18. I had a dream and I thought I was using the bathroom, but alas.    My mother, when I was either 6 or 7   I remember when I made my first friend with OCD and I shared this same feeling. For me, it reassured me that I was not alone. OCD is almost similar to a foreign language; you have to speak the language to understand the struggle.    Religion, Violence, Sexual   It lasted from when I was 16 all the way until 19. I'm 23 now. We were everything to each other: first love, first sex, etc. Things were going well until she started treating me like dirt. We had been on and off and I tried to give her so many chances but she never changed.   The first love is always memorable because that is the first time you love with complete vulnerability.    Could I have proof of the correlation between brain tumors and bottling up emotions?    Trunks   I would return to the age of 18 and tell myself the following 4 things:  1) I know you love ice cream, but stop eating so much of it 2) She really doesn't love you 3) Don't get too close to him, it won't last 4) You're not crazy    I wish I could give this the gold    Many guys in today's culture are afraid of being perceived as gay; we are losing our humanity. You know your own sexuality. You don't have to prove anything to anyone else.    I'm not emotionally close with any of my parents. They emotionally abandoned me as a child   	54

 Hey there! I'm 15/F, and I'm really interested in space travel and exploration, engineering, and technology. I don't do much outside except photograph sunsets and sit outside quietly (I get tuckered out after climbing stairs), but I'm learning physics and hoping to get to calculus, too. Music: [Gorillaz, Django Reinhardt, Neon Indian]. Shows: [Star Trek, Cosmos, every 90's Cartoon Network show in existence].

Nuclear fusion reactors are currently being developed, and if successfully built, they can create a substantial amount of energy (more than nuclear fission), and produce less nuclear waste.

 Thanks so much. I woke up and cried this morning then when I got into work I remembered to check and all the comments really made me feel warm    Thank you :)    I have therapy currently, but the UK NHS will only pay for 7 sessions. Which ends soon. I'm hoping we will be able to pay privately after that. Other wise I'm at a loss as to what to do    Yeah that's it, every month. I build myself up and I actually start to feel happy, but that's because there is hope then. When I get my period it's ground zero, and I have to build my way back up, trying not to hope but never being able to stop is creeping up, such a wonderful feeling to have. If you can get what you're hoping for in the end, when it's dashed month after month, hope becomes everything I detest and hate, hope currently makes me bitter and angry and jealous of all my friends, who I desperately want to be happy for and I can act happy for them. Inside I'm dying for what they have. It really feels like I'm dying infront of them.    I've got a little chihuahua who is wonderful and loving, and gets my constant mothering. She really is our little baby    This community is great, and always helps. It just helps to know that actually, you aren't insane and crazy, because every woman feels the same in the same situation. It helps that i'm not alone but also makes me so sad....that i'm not alone in this. It upsets me so much seeing how so many women are feeling as broken, useless and desperate as i am   You put it so perfect, it's the most challenging mental workout i've ever had. One that I can't control. I've just started therapy as well :(    Is that your little doggie? he/she is very VERY cute. Thank you 3   I called in sick most of the week, and hid away in the dark. Crying and screaming and stamping my feet and banging doors on purpose. Then trying to reign it in for when my OH gets home so he doesn't see how mental this is actually making me (little doses, he's a gentle soul haha)  I feel so pathetic for needing time off work, some months i can handle it, others i can't. Usually the months when my period is late, it screws with my head so much.  I'm sorry you're going through this too, where's our F'ing stalk when we need him eh? big hugs to you as well x   Thanks Fabulous Mrs O ;)  It makes me feel better that there are people going through what i am, feeling what i am, doing what i do. Then is breaks my heart that there are so many women, all over the world who are feeling and hurting like i am. We all deserve babies, my newest and most overused thing i say is 'but why don't i get a baby and the bad mums do?' i'm getting sick of myself   I'm so sorry you went through something so awful :( I had a miscarriage two years ago and that was something I'm sure I will get over, I can't imagine holding my baby in my arms and seeing what could have been. I'm crossing everything for you that a week late means good news and that you have a happy and healthy pregnancy.   This is the third day I am late, it's been two days late before but not three, but then it isn't really three until the end of the day.   I'm not holding out any hope though, I know I'm not. I'm not going to do any tests and upset myself more when they are negative.   I was told two years ago that I was infertile and I thought over time it would get easier, but it doesn't, it just gets harder.   Why am I not entitled to something so many women get by 'accident' ?   Thank you 3   I remember when I used to be pleased when I got my period, and almost pleased when they were irregular 'woo not pregnant and not so many periods' now I detest getting them but getting a late/irregular/non existent syke you out one? Worse.    That's the worst part, the hope. I know I'm not pregnant, I've been here many times before and done test after expensive test, willing it to say positive only for my period to arrive, finally and I'm devastated.  So this time, no tests and no hope, I know I'm going to get my period and that's that, but it's not. With every hour, heck with every minute that goes past there is a little bit more hope.   What gets to me is the constant toilet trips I'm having to take because 'OMG it's finally here' oh no false alarm.   	14
 Thank you! I think I was relying too much on the packaging I am familiar with.    Thank you! I didn't know that. Though the shape and length look different, I think it's the perfect thickness!    Thank you very much! I have yet to spot a Müller so I'll look for one.    Stereotypically, people always say that Germany is full of introverts, people don't talk to each other .... maybe that's the truth in big cities like Berlin, but definitely not where I am (which is still pretty big in European standards, half a million people). People here are so friendly, some will talk to you for no particular reason. I used to live in Montreal (more than 3 million people), and unless you know someone, you don't look at them, you don't acknowledge them, you stay in your lane. Germany so far has been different.    And the only odd or outcasts I have met in my life were all in primary school. Primary school was good for me because I was just "shy", and not anxious or asocial. In High School, they were no outcasts. It was an all-girl school so I guess we just got each other's back (doesn't mean we all loved each other, but everyone had at least a group of friends). In College, I don't see how it's possible to spot those people when you barely see the same people twice in the semester, unless they're in your class. And in class, it's hard to tell who's odd or boring or whatever.   I personally don't really find people boring. I mean, their personality cannot be. I could think that something they're interested in is boring for me, but the fact that they're into it is not. For instance one of the person I'm living with is into Stark Trek. He bought this Stark Trek board game, and I enjoyed watching him play. Would I play myself? Never. Too boring (plus if you need to talk in a game, I'm not into it). But watching people into it playing was really fascinating and cool.    Thank you! Yes, they are the very thick ones, and very long. They are almost like a diaper, sometimes too big to even fit your underwear. I have seen the ultra ones and they seem so thin!    Thanks for the links and the info! However, I do not like thin pads, and I do not like short pads. I really don't care about looking like wearing a diaper, for some reason, I am extremely prone to accidents and those "diaper-like" sizes have been the most helpful.   And yeah, Always sure is expensive, but it works well! : )  Edit: Okay, you said expensive. I was thinking like 5-6 euros for a pack of 20 (since it was 7-8 dollars in Canada), but I went on Amazon, and the cheapest I found was 75 euros. What?!?!   Hello. I am a girl, dealing with girl stuff once a month.   I just moved to Germany two months ago, and, well, that time of the month is about to come by for the third time. I planned ahead before leaving, and I bought enough pads for the first two times. However, my supply is already running low. So my question is, [where can I find this specifically](http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/492963/220.jpg)? I have been to Rossman, Lidl, DW, and all I can find are thin pads or tampons. I do not like tampons. Please help?  I am in Hannover, if that changes anything, but honestly, I am willing to travel far and wide for those pads.   Thank you : )    I have social anxiety too, actually. And I had therapy for that. My therapist had a hard time understanding why I wasn't trying hard enough, even though I really was. She would force me to do those things I don't naturally do, like looking up when I walk or look people in the eyes during a conversation. I wouldn't start conversation with strangers (or anyone) unless I had to. I think the anxiety is milder now, which I am thankful for.   I have had some pleasurable social interactions, but they were usually because I was doing something I loved first, and people just happen to be there with me. Back in my home city, there was this hipster café I absolutely loved. I would go out with a couple of high school classmates there only because I knew that, one, I loved the atmosphere, it helped my anxiety calm down. Two, there is wifi, and being young adults, we love our internet (so quiet time for me). Three, the food was amazing and I am a food lover (more quiet time for me). Them being here was no problem, and being in a place that promoted non-awkward silences helped a lot. But that doesn't really make me happy. I want it to make me happy.   Now I have been in Germany for two months. I have no friends or acquaintances at all, and I seldom talk to people back home. It doesn't bother me, I don't feel the need to go and be sociable. But the people I live with, a lovely couple and their baby, are so happy that sometimes, I can't help but wish I had their life. However I know being in a relationship will not happen, and having a social life is unimaginable. I think I could be a mother, but how good of a mother can I be? Another topic, still figuring myself out in that department.   Anyway. Sorry this came out long and uninteresting. But having depression, anxiety, and SPD at the same time? It's like someone wanted me to have a shit life. And they've been successful so far.    Thank you! I have been trying meditation for a while but I'm having trouble "quieting my mind". Any advices?    Ah thank you. When I will be able to get help, I will ask if I can try it maybe. I'll read about it first though.    I understand, that I am not SPD, but I still have it. It was not a choice, and I am finding it hard to accept (at least right now). My brain is in constant contradiction mode. The things I want to enjoy are things I cannot enjoy. I can get out of my shell, fake the best social skills in the world, go out with a a few high school classmates with whom I felt comfortable to talk with, and .... I don't enjoy it. I can't enjoy it. I want to go home and be alone. Then I go home, see them interacting with other people, then I get envious and sad.   It's just a very annoying thing to go through, and I don't see how to fix it.  I just moved to another country and I still don't have insurance, plus because of what I am doing, I don't think therapy is a wise thing to go through. For the next year at least, I can't get help.  I'll probably feel better soon, get over it, go back to my old hermit self. But next month, I'll reach another low, then another high (it's really 'median'), then an another low.    From depression comes envy, from envy comes depression ... how do you deal with it all?   Uninteresting life story/rant below.   Lately, I have been quite envious of seemingly happy people I see. What they have that seem to make them happy are things I will most probably never have: a relationship and friendships.  I don't care for those things actually, but to see so many people seemingly happy from those, kind of make me envious. On top of that, nothing really makes me happy, and the only emotions I get are from looking at these people's lives. And from that envy comes my depression.   It's currently 1:50 AM, I have to wake up at 6 AM, and I am sitting on my bed, listening to a recording of rain on repeat, and wondering why I was doomed with this shitty personality disorder. Why I was doomed to be boring, asexual, unattractive, you know. All the traits that should keep me away from a relationship. What made me boring, odd, a bit of an outcast. All the traits that should keep me away from friendships.   Not the greatest night, to be honest. But thank you for reading.    There was a similar case of a woman letting her boyfriend use her credit card. They broke up, she wanted her money back. Judge Judy simply said: Too bad, not his problem. (and added, if he were a decent human being he would reimburse her, but legally, the judge doesn't have to force him to do it). However, he seems to acknowledge the need to pay her back, so that would ruin his case. If he acted like it was a gift or the mother allowed him to use the card without reimbursement (which is believable, happens all the time between parents and their children), he would have won.   Time for me to watch another show.    I've been watching Judge Judy on repeat for the past week or so.  He can legally bring his mother to justice if this actually belongs to him. And he most probably will win, since legally, it's his.   No it's fine. : )  And I wondering that, too. I read a book a while back about the man who was born in a work camp (Camp 14), and who escaped. Even he went to school, and school was highly enforced in his camp. Of course, it was mostly half day since he had to work in the fields most of his time.  What's odd is that in those camp, or at least in camp 14, they do not talk about Korea 'the country' or the peninsula. They don't teach history, geography ... they don't even mention Kim Jong-Il, his son or his father. I thought maybe they wanted the country to be literate just so they can have everyone read and write about their great leaders, but then I don't see the purpose of schools in camps, especially when most people are there forever.    It reminds me of when my dog was a puppy (about 2 pounds) and he fell on his leg, which hurt so much, he cried for a while. While trying to check on him, he bit me and I didn't even move my arm or said anything because I felt like he was terrified enough and there was no way for him to comprehend that I was trying to help him. Fast forward to the present day, I am taking care of a child who tends to bite when he's unhappy (he's learning how to walk and falling on his butt is something he hates, even though his diaper is enough cushion to make it all painless). I respond with a 'no biting' and I move away. I don't feel bad about it, simply because he can understand that I'm not trying to be mean, while I feel like my dog would have thought that I was trying to hurt him.   I know this is a mild example compared to suffering and death, but still. I think animals are just too innocent, as you said, to know what's happening.   Ok, and how often do you actually play the game?   You're right. I'm sorry.  Here's the link I fell upon though. At the bottom they quoted the CIA's informations. I didn't notice that the data was 5-6 years old!  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_North_Korea   But these types of maps at not just for the pretty colours. It can open up discussions, for instance you can lesrnwquote a lot of history (North Korea) or demography (Portugal) from those maps, especially when each time there is one, a different group of people get to discuss what the map shows, so different type of knowledge is exchanged.   It's actually 99%, according to a world fact sheet I believe published by the US government, and when Wikipedia has them as a source, it says 99%.  I wish I could find the page I'm talking about but I'm on mobile   I don't know how the 70s were since I'm a 90s kid (⌐■_■) But maybe it's culture? In South Korea, grown men (and women) kiss kids, boys and girls, and they're not labeled as perverts. I guess the difference is that in Korea, the children I've seen being kissed were 6 and under, and their gender did not matter (and the kiss didn't come with those unnecessary compliments).    Why are you acting like someone somewhere knows where they came from? We just know Judaism started somewhere around that area, and nothing is proving the opposite. Unless this was taken from what the traditions say (and it was not), you can pretty much rely on that because trust me, Historians don't just guess out of the blue. If the first synagogue of those Chinese Jews was similar to those of people of that region, or if the traditions (actions or prayers, clothes, whatever) are similar, it's okay to assume they were contacted by them at some point.  We literally cannot know if anything we haven't personally seen is 100% correct, but educated guesses are as good as it gets. Please.   It started somewhere un the Middle East, like all three monotheistic religions. I said Israel because that's what tradition says.    Usually so called smart people never say they need less work. They actually enjoy doing more in order to fine-tune and master whatever they're learning.    One billion dollars.   I would buy my citizenship (if possible) in France, which would then allow me to live anywhere in the EU. Then of course, if I were to live in France, it would be in Paris. If not, then Hamburg, Germany it is. I would not need a big house. I enjoy small spaces and simple furnishing. IKEA would still be my #1. Then, I'd adopt children. I would pay extra just to make the process quicker (I don't mind the numerous home studies and such, but if there was a way to have my files studied faster, I'd pay for it), and I would adopt at least four children. No nannies or anything, I would do this on my own. Then the rest of my money would be for my children. Obviously, I won't be like "Here. Have 100 dollars and be happy for the day." However I would pay for 'field trips' to the museum or whatever they're into. I would pay for whatever activity they want to do. I would pay for that trip to that place they want to go. I would not let them know that we're extremely fortunate until they're much older, so they wouldn't grow up to be entitled. I would encourage them to make their own money for the frivolous things they want, but still help out if I think they're working hard enough. Then once my children would have graduated school or found a long-term job, I would give them my fortune (split equally between them). I would keep maybe half a million, or whatever I would need to live in a city I love, in a small studio apartment.   Oh, and I'd buy a Tesla.    Honest answer here.   I would not say I am ugly (not a lost cause), but I am definitely not attractive. I don't really care about it. The few times I got hit on (literally 3 times), I hated it. I flt gross and objectified, I wanted to disappear and forgotten. I have social anxiety so that could be it. I'm glad I am not attractive enough to have it happen often. I would hate life.    Haiti whenever it pops up on the news. Lived there most of my childhood. When the earthquake happened, I remembered seeing all those places I used to see on my way to and from school. The worst was the presidential palace, which is still destroyed. I used to love this place because every morning at 7, they play the national anthem, and if you happen to be near it, the men (or the driver? My mother never got out, but she never drove the car herself) of the car had to go out and put his right hand on his heart. This, to me, meant I would be a couple of minutes late to school, and it also usually was when I would practice my acting skills (faking a stomach ache or something to miss a day).    Well yeah, of course. Like I said, Judaism either has groups of converted people of the same small region, or people you can historically trace back to Western Asia/The Middle East.    Again, not saying all Jewish people came from one couple from 4000+ years ago. I am saying that they did not mix much, meaning the religion stayed within the same race(s). At first, it started with Middle Easterners, then you have converted (a few mixed) Africans, the diaspora that spread throughout Europe, and converted (a few mixed) Asians. And even among those mixed communities, they do not mix very much either. All of this of course is compared to Christians.     It is surmised that a small community of Jews, most likely from Persia or India, arrived either overland or by a sea route, and settled in the city, building a synagogue in 1163.  So, some were converted by those Western Asians, or born of one Jewish parent from Western Asia.    Wikipedia has a date, but it is based on what their sacred texts say.  It's not hard to believe that Ethiopians were converted. Say Judaism started in modern-day Israel. It is known that the Jewish community then went to Northern Africa (Mediterranean sea), and from Northern Africa (from Egypt), the went a little South. Judaism started roughly 4000 years ago, and apparently, Ethiopian Judaism became a thing some time during the 4th century.    But aren't they of the same 'race' as well? I mean, of course it is a diverse race with different communities, kind of like the word 'White' means both Spanish and Lithuanian, despite the differences.   In Africa, you have the Northern African Jews, who are part of the 'Mediterranean Jewish' community. Then, you have the 'Beta' Jews of Ethiopia and surrounding regions (about 150 000 individuals), then descendants of European Jews who went to South Africa after the war. They don't mix very much, so they still remain the three communities of Jews in Africa.   As for Eastern Asia, from the little I know, most were converted, or born from one Jewish parent either from Western Asia or Europe.    I am American, though I never lived in the US ... but I spent 10 years of my life in Canada before moving to Europe, so I guess that's close enough.  Anyway. I have been in Germany for two months, and I DESPISE how inconvenient it is to live in such a country when you're used to being a lazy bum. For instance, people seldom wear sweatpants here, because it's seen as lazy and you're labeled 'on social services'. Meaning, I have to wear pants. No "messy hairstyles", meaning, it's better to lose your train/bus or wake up earlier than it is to just make a messy bun. Very few pre-prepared food in supermarkets, meaning either cooking or walking to a food place. And inconvenient business times (many places close at 5 pm during the week, and everything is closed on Sundays). Of course, it doesn't bother Germans since most do their shopping before, but my lazy ass would sleep-in on a Saturdays. What do I do now? I actually leave my house on Saturdays. What is this blasphemy?!   I know most other countries are like Germany. Only Canada and rich parts of Mexico seem to be as lazy-inducing as the US.    The thing is African and Asian Jews were relatively recently converted, when European or Middle Eastern Jews have been into that religion form many generations, making it kind of exclusive to those few races.    No. Pretty sure they meant just going back into the family tree of jews who were born into that religion, and see that they are all descendants of the same people.    Same here. I'm actually terrified of the colour of deep water itself.  One day, [I was looking at a false colour image of the Sun](http://copypast.ru/engine/modules/imagepreview.php?image=http://copypast.ru/uploads/posts/1265760739_sun_stereo_4dec2006_lrg.jpg), and the blue of the background reminded me of deep sea. I still get anxiety from looking at it.    I would keep my period tracker just so I can celebrate every time my period would have been due. I would buy red velvet cake, drink strawberry daiquiri and sleep in the nude on my freshly bleached white covers.    We're going on a trip **in** our favourite rocket ship, **zooming** through the sky, Little Einsteins.  Please. Respect the artists!    One day I farted under my covers.  Never again. That shit gross.    Sorry, I was thinking of the wrong thing. My mistake. I meant to say that since they're so low, they're still within the Earth's magnetic field, but that protects them from solar flairs, not radiation.    But I don't understand how being in the ISS is comparable to being in actual outer-space. Isn't the ISS located in a relatively secure place? Protected from radiation or anything potentially lethal? And don't we know already know what happens after a prolonged time in 'space'? Why not send people further away? I understand the ISS is the safest place we've got out there, since it's so close, but wouldn't it be more effective to work towards having a mini training and studying (as in, scientific studies) village on the Moon? We have the technology to send people there, that's for sure.    Why does whenever a question like this pops up, people act like Reddit is the only good thing about their life? It's really, really sad.    Totally agree with you. Period blood is two things: blood + bodily function. Every hates to see at least one of those, so imagine a combination of the two. I think the only bodily fluid I have seen on Instagram was snot from a baby's nose.   Now, if that was on another website (like Tumblr or Reddit), I would understand the reason why people were getting upset. Those two websites are okay with pretty much anything, so it would seem misogynous to censure such an image. But from Instagram? It's 100% normal.    As much as this is dumb, dumber adults will see this and think "Well, they are too young to have fully mastered the art of multitasking behind the wheel! I can do it because I've been driving for 10+ years!"  Adults do this too, unfortunately. But for some reason, it's more okay than if it's a kid.    How so? I think it makes the Earth looks like a sphere we're inside of, especially since you can see light from the horizon.    Since there is about one total solar eclipse a year, just find a plane and follow the path of the moon's shadow. Sometimes, the path is in the middle of the ocean, down in the South Pole, etc. Other times it's at convenient locations (eve more convenient than this year's). Next year, it will be right on some Malaysian/Indonesian islands, and I believe in 2017, there will be one in mainland USA, so this will be quite possible to see again : )   I think it was done on purpose though.    It's very hard to capture stars with (what seems to be) a very basic camera phone.    Well, you know the human body unconsciously reacts to things that could be harmful to it by giving you chills or making you feel creeped out or uncomfortable around it. It is why some people get the chills when looking at certain mushrooms, or holes (trypophobia). Your body is telling you "Don't you dare try eating/approaching this." Because that thing is potentially lethal and some of our ancestors learned it the hard way.    Or funniest, most interesting, etc.   I missed one English class once because I was feeling depressed as fuck. I went to a place that could help me calm down  (and not deal with social interactions, as I have social anxiety as well). The next class, the teacher was kind of harsh to me for missing that day. Guess who never stepped foot in that class ever again.   Thankfully, my therapist helped me get my failing grade cancelled. To this day I am still extremely thankful.   Too many would be to have slept with every humans on Earth. Actually, no. It would be very impressive.    My mother is a master at getting compensations, but I think the biggest has to be virtually getting a free smartphone. We were asked to pay it monthly, but due to a mistake (that we could have avoided actually), the company decided to cancel our bill for it.    People usually don't know, simply because you look normal. Obviously bad depression makes you look sad and grumpy and tired all the time, but who isn't in High School/College?   However if your thoughts always involve death, if whenever you go outside you count the many ways you could die "accidentally", or if you start giving up on your responsibilities because you're not afraid of future consequences (meaning, you believe you won't be there to have to fix them), then yes. Those are very obvious signs of wanting to attempt suicide.    I don't think it would change much, since most Christians only care about the "Son of God" part. I think Jesus definitely believed to have been important enough to have "God talk to him" and maybe "called him his son". People would just have to accept that he might not have been born from a virgin, executed on the cross, yadiyada (which some Christians see as symbols anyway, and not facts).   I think the biggest issue would be his race.    Growing up in a third world country, I never had tap water. Maybe twice after moving to Canada, and it legitimately gave me stomach aches (despite being healthy). I only drink bottled water or filtered water.    Who has been making your smoothies? Either make it home or go to those hipster places where you see them make their food. It's only frozen fruits (and vegetables, sometimes) and water.    This reminds me of an episode of American Dad, when Stan gets super excited for his wife's high school reunion because his wife used to be homecoming queen, and he wanted people to know that. The runner-up got fat and stopped caring for her appearance (from depression), and she became Stan's laughingstock. But then a time capsule from prom revealed that the runner-up was actually the winner, and so Stan momentarily leaves his wife and goes on a date with runner-up. Stan was a shitty person for thinking the 'prettiest girl shall be his', even though all this happened 20 years prior.  This post makes you sound like a shitty person for the same reason.    Also, they're not "trying too hard", and will not insult you just for the sake of insulting you (despite putting on a show, they don't go overboard with the insults). Ramsay/Cowell will insult your entire family line, then tell you what you did wrong to deserve such insults. While that girl, whatever her name, I don't know what she was trying to do, actually.    I'm a fat black girl and I have social anxiety (no sass from me).   MY GENES FAILED ME!    I live in Hannover. Yes, dogs are extremely well-behaved but not the owners. They seldom pick-up after their dog. There's dog poop everywhere. I was walking down my street one day and I saw dog poop on someone's windshield. Not even surprised anymore as I've seen some on walls, windows, in the metro ...    Random but my linguistics teacher says it's starting tone universal. I honestly don't understand how she can say such a thing when a country like Canada has two different sign languages, and the BSL and the ASL, which are both English, have different alphabets and signs.    Well, you know, around the world, the sounds used by ambulances, fire trucks, etc. change. Maybe they live some place else where it resembles the busy signal.    Thank you for this. I'm struggling to be fun, to be honest. I have such a mellow attitude, only very young children can be tricked into believing that I am a fun person. Thank goodness the child I am looking after is one year old. However even with him, I feel like I'm not doing enough. Oh well :/   Eh. This comment makes me feel uncomfortable. My country is an ex slave colony of France, and that was kind of one of the "arguments" from France to remain one of theirs. "Without France, you'd be nothing, ungrateful bastards!"   Let's put it this way. It's your first pregnancy, you're carrying twins. Say you live in a country where the time of birth is not noted, so you only know they both came out the same day. Then three years later, you give birth to another child. Is this child your second or your third?    I don't think it's a good reason. Japan will not lose their culture if they allow other cultures to immigrate massively into their country. Look at Germany. Their immigration bureaus are booming with new immigrants and refugees every day, yet the stereotypical image of Germany is still present. Still lots of beer and pretzels, still the amazing Christmas markets, still the traditional clothing (for special events), and still the same holidays.    Same with the Caribbean. I would like to know what's the average age of my home country, please.     The standard Apple alarm tone has given me so much anxiety (chest pain, hyperventilating ... yes, my body is quite dramatic) from hearing it so often in ads that I now use another one. I can't stand this sound.    Something I've noticed with myself, I pick up other people's mannerism quite rapidly. I am now living with someone with facial and vocal tics, and apparently, I now have facial tics too that I do control, yes, but I unawarely do them.   Does it happen to you?    Right! And what bothers me the most is when I hear other Black people (I'm black, from the West Indies) who talk down on LGBT people. Not too long ago, we were literally going through the same. I don't understand why the majority of us isn't supportive of them, especially since we can relate on a personal level??   I am living with a wonderful Host Family in Germany. They are a married couple with one young child. From their behaviour, you would guess they're newly weds (sorry for the stereotype), but their relationship is 10+ years old. They're so in love, and loving to their child.   If it's not for the spontaneous embraces, it's the silly kisses while preparing the baby's milk. If it's not for family time spent trying to get baby to walk from Mom to Dad and back and the congratulatory family hugs, it's the comforting cuddles after a long and exhausting day once baby is asleep.   We were at the zoo once, and they randomly started hugging and kissing each other (all three). I don't know what triggered it, we were just in front of the hippos with a dozen other people, but it just happened.   And I thought Germans were reserved (sorry, again, for the stereotype).   Last night, a depression I have been fighting away creeped back in. Being around so much love feels like a slap in the face. It is as if life is telling me: "Look! Look at what you never got! And look at what you'll probably never have in your life!"   Here we go again.    ALTER FALTER? I'VE BEEN SAYING ALTER VATER FOR THE LONGEST TIME (I'm obviously not a native speaker).   Thanks!    Definitely self-confidence, plus other people (especially mothers!) can feel it, so they worry for the child in question. Especially if you are a man or a young person. They'll think you don't know what you're doing.   No, it's not that it is unfair to use *her* as an example. It's dumb to make an example out of the situation. She' was a prime minister who just happens to be a woman. It's the wording. You said it like the UK elected her "to see what could happen" like having a female PM was a test. Then, in the same sentence, you made it sound like said "test" was inconclusive because there were ups and downs, as if that was not a thing with other world leaders, who are mostly men. Basically you made it sound like she was incompetent only because she's a woman.   A pillow that was handmade and given to me at birth. I am only 19, but I still have it, and I literally carry it everywhere with me (if I am going to sleep wherever I am heading). It automatically makes any sleeping circumstances comfortable, somehow, despite being pretty small. And it smells comforting.    Have you ever tried cracking your knees? Just stand up one day and move your legs inwards without moving your feet, and crack. Best feeling.    Mine personally are bad because I produce giant blood cloths on the last two days, and my uterus goes into "baby delivery" mode. It used to be way worse though (fainting, all orifices expelling anything they can find, etc.) so I consider myself lucky for now. I started having my period at the age of 9 and since then, yearly, I talk about it with a doctor, but nothing happened. They all blamed it on my anemia ...    Thanks. I very recently learned 'payed' was actually paid (english not my first language). For some reason I'm still adjusting to the news.    No really it is a boy. It's [Mason Moon](https://www.google.de/search?q=Mason+Moon client=safari rls=en source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=wxHhVMXEF8OzUcuJhNAG ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ biw=1440 bih=838). A boy. Mason.   He is now 7 though.    It's really weird thinking of children like this. It is as if we were talking about puppies ...    But that's a boy.    I would recommend going to /r/AskHistorians because not only will you get informative answers, you will get sources backing them up as well!    Same. I guess the only change to my life would be calling sleep a "hobby" instead of a "necessity".    There is this movie from Quebec, quite a classic, that is titled "Aurore". It is based on the true story of a little girl named Aurore who lived in the early 20th century, I believe. She was recklessly abused by her father and step-mom, who eventually killed her (indirectly, she died as a result of her injuries). No one in the village believed her, despite her obvious injuries. After her death though, everyone felt terrible. The priest felt so guilty for not helping sooner, he ended up committing suicide. It is truly a sad film. The original version is apparently worst, but in the newer version, the abuse and her death are still enough to make you sick. I have never cried so much for a movie.    [the xx - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gxNW2Ulpwk). This version is not the best. Seamless edits are better because the song's tempo doesn't suddenly drop. There was a 10 hour version on YouTube but I think it got deleted. It's a simple enough tune that you can put it in the 'background' of your brain.   Edit: Found a [better version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4UtBYUMVJk). 2 hours and 45 minutes!    Of course, no one is denying the fact that poverty, whatever the race, makes it hard. But there are so many other factors, one being historical oppression which leads to most minorities thinking they are better off getting those easy jobs so they can get money right away, since they are usually poor. As for middle class people becoming poor, I think culture has a lot to do with it but that's a personal opinion.   Also, if no one in your family went to college, chances are you are not going to go to college either. It was harder for minorities to go to school in past centuries, therefore the number of ancestors who have had a higher education is fewer, so descendants are more likely to follow that path.   Lastly there is still racism when it comes to employers. I used to live in North America, and it's crazy how people employ others mostly because of their name. In Canada, where I lived, a vietnamese last name guaranteed you a job in the medical industry and plenty of patients, while in America I believe it's an Indian last name. My sister's husband is a doctor in the USA, and during his residency, future residences were chosen based on their name and their picture. The school he went to was mostly full of Indians and Asians, and most chosen residents ended up being Asians and Indians because they chose each other. The same would happen in majorly white university.    I think it all started with historical oppression, then culture. Minorities have been set back for so long that it is harder for them to reach the top, which could then lead to an overall feeling of helplessness, which then leads to some minorities feeling like effort is not even worth it anymore.    I am assuming you are a man or a woman who never looked into it, but a hysterectomy is not an easy procedure to get done. At least not in North America. Usually doctors refuse to give it to young women (so, under the age of 35), especially if they are childless. "You might change your mind!" is their excuse. As for birth control, they do not always stop or lessen your blood flow. They do not always get rid of the pain. They do not always control your mood. And for some women, it's just not something they're willing to pay for.   I read somewhere that in four countries including South Korea, women get a day or two off per month because of their menstrual cycle. Payed or not, I would totally be okay with that. I rather die every month comfortably in my house than in some dirty public restroom.    I agree! But I read somewhere that you cannot (legally) start the process before the age of 16.    I agree. Some people have good hearts *only* because religion says so. So we better let them believe in whatever they believe in.   She is other people's best friend. Why can't I be special?!   Everything but food. If I were to housesit for the Royal Family, I would leave everything intact, even if there was an open chamber with cash in it, but I would take the food.    Same here. When I was in High School, I even noticed they would treat you differently depending on the High School you went to (based on your uniform, or lack thereof). My friends and I were never really followed or asked to leave our bags at the front because our school was known for having "good catholic and studious girls", but kids from nearby schools that were labeled as ghetto were often followed or even asked to leave.    By being an au-pair, I not only wanted to take care of a child as a live-in caregiver and live overseas, I also wanted to use it as an excuse to force myself to develop my social skills. See, I have a personality disorder that interferes and therefore completely messes up my social behaviour. I look like a 'loner', a 'no life', and these are actual comments coming from psychologists who have spoken to me about it! Said personality disorder is obviously not treatable, but people with it can have pretty good lives. However they are all hermits, and thrive more when alone.   I boarded the plane to Germany, saying to myself that if I must fake those social skills and it makes me physically ill, I will (and it has been making me sick). But despite what I think were great efforts, no conclusive results. I am still the same as I was before this journey.   I personally don't care about how good or bad my social skills are, but I do owe it to this family to be the best person I can be. They are so nice to me. So caring and they trust me a lot. I just want to be a pleasant person to be around, for them. I want them to be happy with the decision they took. Really, they deserve so much and being pleasant is the least I can give them.   But I am scared of them giving up on me. They have not shown any signs of disdain or anything, but I know I am not the best person to be around. If they don't like me, they totally should look for someone who is more compatible, I think. On the other hand, I enjoy their company! But it's not about me only. I don't want to disappoint them and I just don't know what to do to be the kind of the person they would appreciate. I am so disappointed in myself. Please help.   Or, are you incapable of missing people? In French, we sometimes say "Loin des yeux, loin du coeur", meaning (literally) far from the eyes, far from the heart. Pretty accurate way of describing the situation.   I have been living away from my family for three days and I have to remind myself that they even exist. The moment they were out of my sight, I forgot about them. Prior to moving, I spent a month away from my mother and dog, and I thought I would at least miss my dog but ... nothing. Forgot I had one, and it was strange to come back and have him around.   Anyone like that?    Pizza can fill you up with just once slice, depending on the crust and what's on it. So maybe they wanted to make it last.   I think people like this are bragging about the fact that they managed to graduate high school without reading books, and not so much bragging about not reading books at all.    She would be really popular in /r/cringepics . Just a bunch of people bullying others for their social faux pas, when very often, it's people who very obviously don't know how to approach others (not their fault).    Yeah I'm sorry I did. Obviously not all. But unfortunately again, we can only hear the loudest.    With the Black History Month in full swing, I think I need to address this.  There is a difference between being African and being African descendants.   "Duh!" you might think. Well, no.   See, I am Haitian (ethnicity, and I lived there for the first few years of my life). I am not nationalist at all, but I do appreciate it when they show a picture of a Haitian person and they say "Hey, here is a Haitian guy/gal who did good."  I go on Facebook, this "Black pride" page posts a picture of Toussaint Louverture, a Haitian man who started the revolution that led to Haiti's independence. Great! Thanks for mentioning the guy, but why is he called "African leader"? This man was born and raised in the territory we call Haiti today, and he personally considered himself French. Haiti has been its own thing as a territory since late 17th century ... why are we still called Africans?   Our roots are Africans, and to be honest I get all happy thinking my ancestors may have been from Ghana (I love this country). But from the 17th, 18th century, my ancestors have been born and raise in a new location, with a totally different culture and name. We were influenced by the Europeans and the Natives as well. We were on our own, with no real ties left between Africa and said new location. We were French from Saint-Domingue, then just a few years later, Haitians. First independent Black nation in the world, and the second oldest nation in America!   Why now, should Haitians hide under the "African" pride, when really it's Black pride first, and Haitian pride second? We are not Africans. From very early on, we had this established. Haiti's first "head of state" considered himself French, and so did many other people of Saint-Domingue. Because Saint-Domingue was a colony then, a colony of the French. And later, thanks to Napoleon really (though that's not what he wanted), a sense of nationalism was revived and we became Haiti. Can't we, at least, be called Haitians? For once? Pretty please?   Now I'm saying this on the page, and people are saying I must not be Black to say something like that. Because I know my history? Others are saying I'm brainwashed. Because I know my history? Lastly, icing on the cake, I was called stupid. BECAUSE I KNOW MY HISTORY?   Very few of those people were Haitians, and all were living in the United States. Nothing against the States but lately, it's like Black Americans like discrediting everything that is not directly African. I think, honestly, it's because Black-Americans were not "allowed" to have a proper identity, so they go back seeking comfort and an identity from the Motherland. Which is understandable, but not all Black persons feel this need.     Literally anything in relation to health or appearance. You can google "beauty mark" and you'll find atrocious growth the size of footballs on the back of small children. It's always the same thing, whatever you're looking for.    Thank you! I will start doing this now.    Thank you for the comment! Actually, I was told not to ask too many question. I don't do it well. I sound like an interviewer, so I try not to ask too much.   In some countries, homosexuality is so out of the question, friends can look more affectionate than most couples from Westernized countries do. South Korea has this thing called skinship (I think Japan too), and it's basically all about being very touchy, usually amongst friends. Taking the metro in Seoul was quite the adventure for my very closed-minded father.   	106
