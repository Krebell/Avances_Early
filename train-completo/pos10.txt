 I believe we get it next week.   **Dark Horse**  * Neverboy #5  **DC Comics**  * Batman Beyond #2  * Lobo #8  **Dynamite**  * Masks 2 #4  **Graphic India**  * Grant Morrison's 18 Days #1  **Image**  * Jupiter's Circle #4  * Outcast #10  **Marvel**  * Amazing Spider-Man #19.1  * Darth Vader #7  * Princess Leia #5  **Valiant**  * Imperium #6 This issue is suppose to have Divinity in it right?  * X-O Manowar #38  **Vertigo**  * Vertigo Quarterly SFX #2   I have actually never seen Batman: Year 100 mentioned ever...how is it?   When is year 2 due?   I didn't know I wanted Zack Morris as Green Lantern until now. I agree with the reasoning.   Find a strain that causes weed-induced psychosis for the general populace, much like how any weed can cause psychosis in the few, like me, that are just unlucky. That's a way to get someone to 'cure' their addiction real quick...shit sucks yo.   It was crazy hard and you couldnt save between rounds.  I remember just leaving my Playstation running because I had to leave for a Midnight Mass.   Because people like. I know I do and everyone I know that watched it did too.   That final boss fight tho. Took forever to beat.   I had the same problem with reading it. Maybe that is the point?   Still waiting for 7 :/   Enjoying the new art more honestly. Not to knock the old style, but this is easier to follow.   I did that with issue #3. It really keeps pace.   A weird issue. Just a giant flashback.   👽   **Dark Horse**  * Fight Club 2 #2  * Mulan Revelations #1  **DC Comics**  * Gotham by Midnight #6  * Justice League 3001 #1  **Image**  * Mythic #2  * Tithe #3  **Marvel**  * Black Widow #19  **Valiant**  * Ninjak #4  **Vertigo**  * Suiciders #5   Suiciders from Vertigo.  Divinity from Valiant.  Supreme Blue Rose from Image.   I read them as they were released. It is a really weird story.  It did introduce me to a favorite artist of mine, Tula Lotay.   Locke and Key. I didnt really expect much, but I was wrong. It is great.   It was an ok issue. A lot of questions as to what exactly is happening. Art is cool tho.    Been needing to get the second volume of Project Superpowers. Good thing this bundle will last a month.   I like the feel of it. Can't wait for my issue to come in.   Valiant is finally starting to have a following here. A couple weeks back all their issues for the week were on the top 10.   **DC Comics**  * Dr Fate #1 * Martian Manhunter #1  **Dynamite**  * Project Superpowers Blackcross #4  **Image**  * Low #7  * RunLoveKill #3  * Trees #10  **Marvel** Just got a car so got to cut down on comics so since I have MU Marvel has got to go mostly  * Old Man Logan #2  **Valiant**  * Bloodshot Reborn #3  * Ivar Timewalker #6  * X-O Manowar #37  **Titan Comics**  * Doctor Who the Ninth Doctor #2  **Vertigo**  * Madmax Fury Road Furiosa #1   No big deal. A Family of 11 was pissed they couldnt sit together when the bought their tickets at 7:33pm for the 7:30pm showing on a Saturday night.   Lines around the building of course   Only if you film it in Britain   So excited   Looks decent. The last one had a ton of Locke and Key   **BOOM!**  * Lantern City #2  **DC Comics**  * Constantine the Hellblazer #1  * Redhood Arsenal #1  **Dynamite**  * Reanimator #3  **Image**  * Savior #3  **Marvel**  * 1602 Witch Hunter Angela #1  * Inferno #2  * Inhumans Attilan Rising #2  * Secret Wars 2099 #2  * Silk #5  * Spider-Gwen #5  **Valiant**  * X-O Manowar 25th anniversary special #1   Basically it is saying that it won't be a typical hero movie.  It is not exactly a big deal, but a huge sigh of relief to get confirmation that the movie is on the right track.  Either way I highly suggest picking up a volume or two of Sandman. Few rarely regret it.   The guy next to bizarro's shoulder kinda looks like deadpool o.O   According to the article Levitt has been talking to Gaiman.   The 30$ Books collection are very much worth it.   I'm going to leave [this](http://imgur.com/jQlWPKx) here. **8** comments at 2:5**8**  It is 8s all the way down....   So who was the one cheating in relation to Jupiter's Legacy?    Jupiter's Circle #3   So you say *everything* is wet *all the time* ?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   Complimentary Digital codes with exclusive scratch and sniff stickers included!   **BOOM!**  * Plunder #4  **Dark Horse**  * Neverboy #4  **DC Comics**  * Batman Beyond #1 - Finally get to see where Futures End winds up.  * Lobo #7 - I am interested to see how it continues  **Dynamite**  * Blood Queen vs Dracula #4 - It was a good mini-series.  * King The Phantom #3  * Masks 2 #3  **Image**  * Jupiter's Circle #3  **Marvel**  * Amazing Spider-Man #18.1  * Darth Vader #6  * Groot #1  * Princess Leia #4  * Secret Wars #3  * Star Wars #6   **Valiant**  * Dead Drop #2  * Imperium #5   Not there. Actually no options for going left or right :/   WE WANT 100 CARD DECKS AND WE WANT THEM NOW!!!   Before I updated to 5.0 the lockscreen had a music control bar on it. After the update now the background of the lockscreen is the album cover. I am wondering if there is a way to put back contols on the lock screen. I don't mind the album artwork, but I would really like not having to unlock my phone to skip a song or pause.   One of the best current(ish) runs. I want them to bring Constantine into the mix.    Didn't the beard come when he was in office?   How much all that run you?   I do that too for some reason. Alphabetical Left to right by series, but chronological right to left within a series.   The conclusion released today was excellent. Can't wait to see me.   I like it. Interested on where it is heading.   It is getting good.   Very well done and amazing art as always.   At least it is still their universe.   The splash page when the planet gets obliterated was well done. The dirt seemed to be moving.   Now back to your regularly scheduled programming!   Issue is as funny as always and I can't wait to see how the brothers react when Ivar brings them back together.   **Ivar, Timewalker #5**   Oh wow. The art gets me everytime, a bit easier to follow the flow than the last issue. Just one more left. . .   A decent end to the first volume. Can't wait to read Imperium #7 and then Divinity 2   Good to hear! We need more Valiant readers here.   All this narrated by Deadpool of course.   Let's get us Blade/Deadpool crossover!   **Divinity #4**   Shadowman and Bloodshot are both part of Valiant. The comics got rebooted from the 90s a couple years ago. Since they are all pretty fresh it is easier to play catch up on. From the looks of it you would probably like The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage and Quantum and Woody, but really most Valiant titles are pretty spot on. Today Valiant actually released the trade for their 4 part series called The Valiant, in which Bloodshot plays a main role.  Now for other classics check out the other comments is this thread, but a personal favorite of mine is Vertigo's Sandman.  Comic can get expensive and a good place to find trades on the cheap is instocktrades.com.  Also check out your local Library!   Speaking of Alan Moore, Providence #1 comes out today ^.^   I'm glad Sandman still made the list despite massive delays.   If you are not looking to sell them as singles or sets, http://www.mycomicshop.com/ will buy whole collections.   I could be wrong, but this is not the right meme for that.   And probably less than 1% of Drivers are avid climbers, so it may just scale. . .   You see her grinding up the gold for a second during one of the scenes.   They have been hinting that it is yea.   A Sound of Thunder has a song called Punk Mambo, which is about Punk Mambo from Valiant's Shadowman. The track is pretty solid.   **Avatar Press**  * Dark Gods #7  * Providence #1 -Looks good  **Dark Horse**  * Fight Club 2 #1  * Mister X Razed #4  **DC Comics**  * Convergence #8 -We are finally here  * Convergence Booster Gold #2  * Convergence Infinite Inc #2  * Convergence Plastic Man and the Freedom Fighters #2  **IDW**  * Ragnarok #5 -Been pretty decent and a fresh take on Thor.  **Image**  * Outcast #9  **Marvel**  * Black Widow #18 -want to see how it plays out after the last issue  * Inferno #1  * Inhumans Attilan Rising #1  * Old Man Logan #1  * Secret Wars 2099 #1   **Valiant**  * Divinity #4 -Cant wait to see how it ends  * Ivar, Time Walker #5 -Still enjoyable  **Vertigo**  * Sandman Overture #5 - Only one more to go.  * Suiciders #4 -Been enjoying it so far.   I wouldn't mind a Sandman movie. An Animated movie would give them way more room to tell the story.   My LCS sold out pretty fast and I cant find it online to order :(   **White Whale**  **Holy Grail**  **White Whale**  **Holy Grail**   Yup typo. And Bible lore   SexymadbadDrWho  well....that is pretty much an Endorsement.   Should have offered to clean them fo her.   Description of the Bug: Cannot select 3rd area quests.  Game Version: 1.28  Phone Manufacturer: HTC  Phone Model: M8  Service Carrier: ATandT  Android Version: 5.0.2   If anything she will avoid helping the Winchesters at all costs. They made her murder her forgotten love. I'm thinking she is gonna just decide to upset the balance further, I mean if the Book can get rid of a spell by God, what else can it do? Hell on Earth? Sap all magic from everyone else?   "Like a good neighbor, ~~State Farm~~ Chuck is there"   2nd to last episode of the season. It is mentioned the airfield is closed due to a missing pilot.   With that comment the current script for Season 11 has been scrapped...   You clearly are high.   It was bold and unread right?   Learning new spells to become more powerful = powering up.   Well the Mark got zapped up into the sky after leaving Dean. When then see the same zaps hitting the earth where the Darkness escapes from.  Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast.   Rowenna probably just used her time to read other parts of the book to power up.   That's exactly how we look and sound like in Texas during tornado season.   Well the Host of the Trinity did ascended Gid knows where 2000 years ago  and the Word of the trinity is potentially being held captive by Metatron who has the tablet. Surely the Father will finally make an appearance now that the primordial shit has literally hit the fan and is going everywhere.   Didn't realize the decay was partly due to his immense power.   Season 11: God reveals himself by saving Sam and Dean from getting swallowed by the Darkness wave, since they are the true vessels for Lucifer and Michael (God needs them to defeat the Darkness again of course) who both get let out (Due to the huge potential power of the Book of the Damned) and end up using Sam and Dean as their all too willing hosts. All of them go through the whole season in typical hunter, monster of the week, fashion fighting the Darkness.   If anything I figured he got elevated to like Angel status or something, but never thought he was God.    I think the Darkness' influence quit being built up after he passed it to Cain, but he was still pretty sour that God cast him away for a long time due to something Luci had no control over. I think the influence is finally gone, but the resentment is still everlasting.   Was he never followed up on after the episode *Fan Fiction* ?  I was reading up on him and when did it get revealed he was God? I don't recall that, just him being a Prophet.  Was Calliope in *Fan Fiction* really going to try to devour God?   All I know is I can't wait for the inevitable Series follow-up comic by IDW or Dark Horse. Not that I want the series to end any time soon.   Thinking on it, doesn't Death know the order of Reapings? If so, he knew that his time had come and knew the Winchesters would never kill each other.   Did I see right: In the beginning of the episode we see an unopened email from Crowley(?) With the subject line something like: "S11 See attachment".  ?   What else can the Book of the Damned do if it can remove a spell that was cast by God himself? That is going to be a huge plot point next season if anything.   If the Darkness being released has retroactive effects on its host I can see that. Lucifer was probably still salty about being locked up for dam near eternity.   Well Dean didnt know they finally got the spell ready to remove the mark, he was probably planning to let Sam lock him up again.   Well it wasnt the previous Death...so Dean kills God.   It was a Magic scapel of course.   But was anything ever done when the prophet/supernatural writer showed up at the end of that episode?   He can possess people, just not for long right?   There is a huge potential for extra lore. If the book can remove a spell/curse done by God himself, what else can it do?   Well an article posted elsewhere in the comics is saying that they are offering full returnability for the issues on top of a big discount. Also the following issues are going 1:10 instead of 1:25. I would think selling the Geomancer at a high price (40$ like midtown?) Might help recoop the costs some while waiting to return un bought issues.   Well it is $40 on Preorder at Midtown currently if you really want to read it. I know I got mine pre-ordered already.   I agree with this. The meta is heavy here. It isn't even on the Book of Death checklist page in the Previews.  	107
 No I was just passing the offer on. You can call and ask   Gold's Gym just posted an offer on their Facebook page:  https://www.facebook.com/goldsgymrichmond  "Join by 7/31 and get 50 days FREE or only pay $9.99 per month, no contract!"  You would have access to a few of the Gold's Gyms in the area including Willow Lawn, the Fan, and Mechanicsville. Willow Lawn would be the closest to Short Pump, about 15-20 minutes.    In my experience a lot of guys who have kids just leave that section blank. Pretty much a dead giveaway they not only have children but they have a lot.    Must have changed since I checked it last.    Lol, just saw this   Funny, when I was complaining about the off-leash dog problem at this park on another thread months ago, I got downvoted to all hell suggesting that people leash their damn dogs.   Wow, not only am I flabbergasted that I got denied LTD insurance, I can't believe all my comments are getting downvoted. Nice attitude folks.    Yep you're exactly right, apparently drinking myself half to death or smoking pot would have been a better option in the long term. Absolutely ridiculous.   thanks for the info. I'm going to call them on Monday and ask for clarification given the fact that anxiety and depression are so widespread.    Thank you. I was absolutely shocked when I got the letter. This is such a common thing in America with doctors diagnosing it left and right and handing out medication like it's freaking Skittles or something.    So basically I'm screwed for life, along with a large percentage of other Americans?   I recently applied for long-term disability insurance through work. They go through Metlife. I had to fill out an application asking all sorts of questions about various conditions. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety about ten years ago and put on medication - I was dealing with the death of someone very close to me at that time. I have not been on medication in a very long time.  I received a letter from Metlife today saying that I was being denied LTD coverage due to "a history of depression and anxiety". WTF.  I was shocked they would deny me due to this. It's so common, I don't know a lot of people who haven't been diagnosed and medicated at SOME point in their lives, especially because doctors hand that stuff out like candy.   What am I supposed to do now? Am I marked for life because I went on medication when I was 21 years old? I'm kind of freaking out here. I own a house now and was in my first car accident last year. I had very minor injuries but it really woke me up to the possibilities of what could have happened. I don't want to lose my house if I become disabled, just because I was depressed when a family member died. What in the world???   Well, there's a lot more information on strobist...   My grandmother had two kids. They don't visit much even though they live in the same town. She lives in one of those independent living type senior apartments and is doing fine, other than being pissed off that she doesn't hear much from her own children.  Having children is no guarantee of anything. Sure, there are families out there that are close and when the parents get old the children do everything they can to take care of them. There are also a ton of people who just stick their parents in a nursing home and never visit. Total crapshoot.   Personally, I feel a safer "investment" is taking the money I would be spending on kids, and putting it in my retirement account and toward long-term care insurance.    Thanks for raining on my parade.  It's the biggest one I've seen in Richmond so far, personally.      Talk about faulty logic there. Wowza.  Using the same logic... you can't be miserable and resent your kid and fuck them up royally until you have one   I'd like an invite pls   The same reasons people on full frame buy an 85mm?   I work for GE. They are selling off/discontinuing a lot of GE Capital assets in order to make the company more industrial-focused and less focused on the financial industry, which can be more volatile (2008 anyone?)  Synchrony Bank is indeed new but was a spinoff of GE Capital. Pretty much the same thing, for all intents and purposes.   Duh. But there's a lot less room for error with digital.    I bought a film camera last summer and used it all of twice. The second time, the film didn't rewind properly and I opened the back, losing the entire damn roll of film. That and stories like yours are precisely why film died   From what I've read, the Fuji lens is sharper. Those Zeiss lenses didn't sell well and I read on dpreview yesterday that they are being discontinued. For the money, you are better off buying the Fuji. I have the 35 and it's amazing.   Awesome. Thanks!   You mean the Arts District?   I would love to take photos of that Brookland Park corridor because I too believe it will be changing drastically soon. Is it safe to walk around during the day?   No different than the crap I get on OkCupid and Tinder.    I live in the area and posted something about this on the local reddit several months ago. From what I know it was drug related and the person responsible was well known by the police and friends of the victims. They just didn't have the evidence. I don't know how accurate that is but it certainly wouldn't surprise me.    Nope...   Nope, don't live there   Glad I'm not the only one that thought this   I'm finally ready to date after taking some time for myself after a breakup. I'm 33, white female, about 5'6, brownish/blondish hair, fit/athletic build.   I work out regularly and while I'm not psychotic about it, it's important to me. I have a gym schedule that I stick to about 3-4 days a week. I have hobbies that are important to me (photography) and I'm looking for someone to complement my life, not BE my entire life. I like taking random road/day trips and exploring new places. I also like staying in and having a movie night or whatever.  I've never been married and don't have kids. I also don't want kids, including yours.   PM to exchange photos.   Edit: Douchebags looking for a hookup need not apply.  Edit: Married men need not apply.   Edit: Men outside the Richmond area need not apply.  ^ That other post where someone was wondering why women don't post on here? This is why.   Times Square is tacky and boring. But if you want photos of tourists, that's the place.   Clearly from all the downvotes, OP does not want to hear "don't get one."  Plenty of people survived college without credit cards. It's amazing what can become an "emergency" when you have that card available. There's a reason that credit card companies love students.    None. I didn't have a credit card until after college and I thank god I didn't. I've seen students rack up ridiculous credit card debt ON TOP OF their student loans.   "Plus around 24mm is the same look you'd get from a phone camera, and people like to stand apart from that."  The pictures I can take with my Fuji 23mm 1.4 are COMPLETELY different than those I can take with my iPhone.   I'm not sure what's worse, that he is making money off other people's work, or that people buy his work. Seriously, that amount of money for an Instagram screenshot, wtf??  	36
 Thank you for your reply! Don't get me wrong, I know that having money wouldn't solve all of my problems, all I'm saying that if I had a stable financial background then I wouldn't have to worry about how I'm a burden to my mother, who is really supportive, but sometimes hardly make ends meet and that feeling just slowly killing me. While the other part of my family is very rich... but that's another long story. So yeah, there are all type of anxieties out there, I know it's not always about the money.   Self employed? In which field? I'd love to be self-employed and I am willing to learn new skills, just don't know where to start. I worked in an office as a back-office employee and I really hated it because of my coworkers. Though they weren't that bad, they were just making me nervous all the time.   Oh yess! And how awfully frustrating it is!    Thank you for your kind words! Yeah, all I can do is hope and try and try again. I know.    Thank you!! Since then I explained them that I just want to do something where I don't feel that bad all the time. They always tell me that it's "working", not "playing", no one likes to work, but we have to. I know that's a really negative approach and I don't think that they feel what I felt when I was working.    This is a growing problem for people in their 20s. I'm in a similar situation, had a desk job for a year but I had to quit because of my anxiety. Looked for online jobs but I couldn't find any promising offer, especially because I'm from a not so developed european country. I don't know how we should make money, but I think it's gonna be a huge problem for us and younger generations in the future. I have time, I'd work 10 hours a day, if I could do it from my home with my laptop. Actually all I have is time...   I feel like that sometimes. Like this world is a dull theatre with only one role you can act. Sometimes I want to be more than the avarage stupid humans I see everytime in the city, but then I think about how much work I need to do to be someone respected and powerful, how could I be that person when I can't even function like a normal human being.   As I read your words I remembered my favourite lines from the BBC Sherlock series, I can really identify with:   Moriarty: Well. Here we are at last. You and me, Sherlock. And our problem. The Final Problem. "Staying Alive". So boring, isn't it? It's just... staying. All my life I've been searching for distractions. And you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you.    Oh yes, I'm in a similar situation, left college, was working for a year, then one day I just couldn't do it anymore.. went to psychiatrist, got meds, none of those worked. Right now I'm a lot better and everyone encourage me to get a job but I've been unemployed for two years.. and it's hard even to think about getting a job. Ironically I have friends, but they don't understand my problems at all and try to motivate me with such cliches.   	7
 what platform do you like?   What do you do?      When my grandma says "come" in normal conversation. And like that's a normal word to normal people so I have to hide my gag reflex.    I'm a writer/director working on a pilot that's going into principal photography in a few weeks.   If you're in LA area, PM me, and I'll give your daughter an internship. It's for the 24, 25, and 26 of Oct and the 7, 8, and 9 or Nov.

 There are plenty of videos out there celebrating the ups and downs of Fatherhood too. I'm sure there'll be plenty more when it's Fathers Day. This video however an advertisement by a card company-reminding people of Mothers Day so you'll buy their Mothers Day cards. This video is not sexist in the slightest towards men. It's just talking about Mothers in particular. Are you a parent? You compared Motherhood to being an on call doctor. A doctor gets paid. The UK and US have laws and have to allow breaks, booked holiday time etc. Being a Mum doesn't allow for that. On call.  When children are content and safe, Mothers are usually cleaning, not sitting on their arses reading a book-unless it's a kids book and there's a kid on their lap.  Most Mums do not get enough sleep, due to doing more house work/working from home or dealing with nightmares and nappy changing.  Most Mum's do not expect Dad to get home from work and muck in a whole 50% because Dad's been working too. At least he got breaks and was able to eat his lunch in peace. Regardless this video was created with Mothers Day in mind. -Not a men's rights activist/everything MUST be pc do gooder.        I add a little oil to stop it sticking to the pan and it works a treat.     If you get kicked in the vagina it hurts. Trust me, I know.    Bad trousers that don't fit properly or are a horrible colour.        No it really isn't.      This is really old. I remember a customer coming up to me at the bar and saying this.  I haven't worked in a bar for 3 years. . .    You should never look in your neighbours bowl to see if they have more than you, you should only look to see if they have enough.                      You can do it if you truly want to.    But at the same time, you are spending your whole life worrying/caring about someone who considers drugs more important than you. It's very loyal and noble of you to stand by her, but don't don't forget about yourself too. You deserve to be happy and not constantly worrying too.    Confession bear?     I was 19 years old and the only female on the main bar with 4 guys. Club music was blaring in the background as an elderly 'gentleman' with bonus walking stick, came up to the bar. He said, "Darlin, I'd be honored to take you home and make sex to you." My male colleague came over and politely and asked him if wanted a drink and if not to leave the bar. "But, she's beautiful" said the gentleman. "She looks like my wife used to".       {O.P's girlfriend}That's awful. Schrödinger was rescued at 4 weeks old by a chav that was going to drown him. I brought him to full health and he's been the softest, cheekiest cat that even dared to pinch our doberman's food on occasion. Today was fucking horrible and I have to tell my 7 year old daughter tomorrow. :(      Nicee!    My hand.    Not sure if you're male or female, but either way there is a solution. Wear trousers that are the same colour as the tan. This will camouflage all tan stains and also, people will think you're naked from the waist down, at first glance. Always a conversation starter. especially if you're hot!    It interesting to see how times have changed. White skin and rosy cheeks used to be considered healthy, glowing skin. Now the media tells us to top up our tans' for that healthy glow. Obviously sun tanned skin is a sign of sun damage not a healthy glow! However it seems that porcelain skin is making a come back as celebrities are throwing away the bottles of St Tropez. It's so damn easy to walk in to a Boots store and pick up a tan in a bottle that we're now finding that we're bored of it, as a society. Now we want a change. Bring back REAL healthy skin!!!    Meh, he'll just have to make it up to me later, with his tongue :P A guy not orgasming at all makes me feel a lot worse. I feel I failed at my goal :(    In England, you always fill up then go inside to pay or pay at the pump.     Ex dancer/pole dancer from England. I never did this myself as I prefer my pale skin but the other girls would use fake tan{whole body}. They said it looks good under low light and helps to cover some blemishes. Also conditioner was recommended for shaving, but I find using nothing but moisturiser and a razor works best. Rub in the left over moisturiser to help relieve any razor rash you may get. Don't use scented ones though. Also If shaving whilst in the bath/shower, use luke-warm water instead of hot water. You should also use the same for hair washing.  If you get any spots, try using strong tooth paste instead of Oxy or whatever{on your face not the kitty!} If you're looking to work the. .  . kitty, make sure you shave a good few hours prior to said action. This helps any inflammation go down before the potential friction starts. Use a mirror. It sounds simple, but if you can't see what you're doing and you're after a close shave, you're more likely to cut yourself if you are blind. Hope that helps :)     Because she was told that at age 4, when she asked about it. She still believes it and I like her thinking babies are made purely out of love. When she starts asking more questions, I'll answer appropriately depending on her level of understanding. She comes from a split family, so her knowing that she was still made out of love is good for her.    My daughter believes that you have to love someone very much to make a baby. You have to have lots and lots of cuddles. When you've had enough cuddles to make a baby, one starts growing out of all the love inside the lady's tummy. A baby is the start of a new family so only people that aren't related can make one. My partner and I are trying for a child currently and she's always telling us to cuddle each other to make one because she wants a baby sister. She is 7.   Well hello there Hansom. .    Whistling. My 7 yr old even tried to teach me. Pffft.     Damn humans, playing with nature.     Did it work?    With a shot gun.    Was your Dad having sex with anybody/thing in particular?   Lucky sod! {referring to the 'tragedy-free life'}   I never want eat again.   A queen usually only eats her kitten if 1}they are still born/damaged or 2}someone/thing else's scent is on them, possibly through handling.    I thought the were symbolic. Hence the size.    I think I prefer the left out of these two, still maintains the true colours but adds more of a depression feel.     My friend and I thought it would be a nice idea to cover my Father's pond with daisies to make it look pretty with 'mini lillies'.  Little did I know his prized large koi carp would eat them and die. I got the belt for that one.     The difference being, you trust your sex partner not to kill you. You usually fancy them too. . .   No milk. . . a cup of tea fixes everything.    Yes it does, in the UK.    My favourite is; Dehydrated spunk bubble.  #3232;\_ #3232;   C.S.I style   Balloon   Pubes + braces = bad times.    Unless she's older than 16   I say 'brang' instead of brought or bought. My partner has been trying for 4 years to change it.    Awesome Teacher   No naming and shaming here.    Has anyone tried the 'restricted' approach?  If you go to your 'friend's' profile and click the friendship tab, you'll get a list of lists. Basically,  you can put your friends in to groups. Family/Acquaintances/Restricted etc. Each group can be modified so you can stop groups seeing parts of your profile and posts. The Restricted group's default setting is to allow the group to only see the same amount as they would if you weren't friends. Excellent for work colleagues! Oh and no one notices unless they actually try to be nosy whores and go through your photos or whatever.

Here's a then and now pic of her. http://imgur.com/a/UVb4e   A good cup of tea and sex.    England here. I have a 6 year old daughter and due to an on going custody battle, social services are involved.{asked by the courts to see if residence should be swapped, not because she's at risk of serious harm}  MY six year old told them that she gets in to bed with me for cuddles in the morning when she told them I was naked I got in to heaps of trouble. I'm her Mum. I've been told that she must not see me naked at all. Not really sure what was so wrong about it. I'm surprised at how difficult it is to do this. We used to shower and get dressed together because it's more efficient in the mornings. Now we have to do things separately which she doesn't like. It's made trips to the swimming pool a whole lot harder too.    It doesn't happen. I've been doing that for ages for my six year old, her skin is still the same shade.    You only need to add half a tea spoon in, It doesn't stick to their skin, the bubbles do though!     Ah I've been doing this for ages, I make bath time a different colour for every day of the week. She loves it. Pink is her Favourite!   	66
 Thank you so much for your kindness. But honestly, I don't think he is completely to blame. I just think we were both in the worst state at the worst time to be together, and that is why we clashed. If things can't be sorted out, then I will start thinking about separating, for the sake of both of us. But right now, I want to be able to face him and talk. I just don't have the courage or the confidence to, and it makes me hate myself   I have, and ironically, he wants to be left alone and in isolation... and I want to be near someone. What should I do...?   Thanks so much for your reply. My boyfriend actually has a mood disorder, and to his defense I think he was in his bad mood swings. However, I also feel that I have explained what I want when I am feeling like this to him before hand. Do you think he is just getting tired and annoyed of me and my depression? The word abuse has cropped up before from my therapist, but they see me as in denial  	3
 Mine were very useful. I was initially assessed as per their guidelines, after which they had the choice to offer me either self-taught assistance eg CBT courses, counselling, or psychotherapy. I had some serious issues and so was offered 12-16 sessions with a psychotherapist.  My therapist was professional, but friendly and welcoming. Each week I had to complete a questionnaire about my moods and feelings over the last two weeks, this was very quick to do and she would let me complete it before the session so that we had as much time together as possible.  I had one session per week, each one lasting a little over 50 minutes.   Completely free on the NHS. I had 12 weekly sessions.   I switched to Decaff tea about four months ago and I have really noticed a difference in both my anxiety, and IBS symptoms. I am so glad I switched :)   Depression, Generalized anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, medicated and seeing a therapist for the last 14 years on and off.   Thank you :)   Even this morning he is so much better - and no sickness in anyone else yet!   Thank you :)   Thanks :)   Anti-bac spray, hand sanitiser all being used, confined him to his room (with books and 3DS) to try to keep him away from his sister.  The mindfullness I am good at writing down during an attack after a LOT of practice. It is keeping those thoughts going I have trouble with!   I am trying very hard to be calm and not 'catastrophise' him being sick.  I know he is sick because of either a tummy bug going through school, or something he ate.  I know that the chances of us all getting it are reasonably low, especially with good hygiene.   Even if we do all get it, it will be over soon. I will manage.  It is not going to be this way forever. This too shall pass.  It does not mean I am letting people down if I have to cancel things because of this.  I will get through this.   Yes - and I am still trying to overcome my need to please everyone ahead of myself to this day :(   Have a listen to this before you go to the airport, and see if it might be something you can use :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07j2hshKShs   I also am not comfortable with the use of 'spoon theory'.  It bugs me in similar ways as it does yourself OP. It is an oversimplification of issues, with a long and drawn out explanation of what it actually means.  I have depression and anxiety, as well as a chronic joint and muscle condition. I have days where I can do some things, then the following day I can barely walk. My muscles become easily exhausted, and also take longer than 'normal' to recover from exertion.   I don't really see why it can't be as simple as saying, "you know what, I really overdid it yesterday, and I am paying for it today".   Sometimes I feel there is the overwhelming need to feel 'recognised' with an invisible illness. Creating the cutesie terminology gives a sense of bonding between people who go through the same issues. But I also feel that it can be seen as belittling a real problem that millions suffer with every day.   Low level panic attack, up to 24 hours.Mid-level, anywhere from 2-3 hours. High level, between 20-30 minutes. Cyclic attacks going from high to low level rapidly, anywhere from 2-3 hours to 24 hours.   I killed Hitler by throwing a bomb into the closet he was hiding in. He took a school hostage and I went in there and took him out, rescuing everyone else.   if you are eligible, you get the auto-pop up wherever you are at the time it goes live    Hi, I have been on Buspar for the last 6 months alongside Citalopram.  I currently take 7.5mg twice a day. It really has helped me with my anxiety and panic attacks. It took a little while to start feeling the full effects, but I guess after two weeks I could really feel a big difference.  As for side effects, I didn't really have any at all. I was pretty lucky. In fact, it has actually helped eased some of the side effects of other medication (non-anxiety related).   I hope it works for you too :)   This owl looks like Radagast the Brown   It's a known issue, pretty much all EU servers are down and have been since yesterday. Blizz are updating their twitter feed, but no eta for a fix yet. Which sucks as I DC'd just after killing the Headless Horseman :(   Please listen to u/sayleanenlarge. You need to see a Dr if you are having seizures.   Hadn't looked to be honest.   I have an EU and US account. There was a glitch that meant 6.0 has updated on my account and now I can't play until tomorrow when the patch goes live.  On the plus side, I got to see the awesome new intro early.   Wooo I score 9 - do I get a prize?  (actually I do have Hypermobility syndrome and I am waiting on diagnosis for Ehler-Danlos Type 3 (Hypermobility))   The top comment on here (posted 10 hours ago) is a link to the local news piece on him being missing.   Glad I can make you feel a bit better :D  It's weird, but because I have lived with it most of my life, I don't really notice it unless it gets really bad. Every now and then I have to suddenly correct my posture or stop myself from locking my knees back, but other than that I don't notice it as often as other people notice me for it - sometimes I stretch my joints the wrong way and freak people out accidentally :)  But yes, the pain sucks!   My dad used the quote and credited Homer Simpson during his wedding speech :)   Basically, diagnosis comes from assessing how hypermobile (super-bendy) you are, and then running every test known to man to rule out anything else they can come up with ;)  I have to make sure I don't get fatigued, stand or sit the wrong way, dislocate or sub-dislocate my joints (I can do my fingers and toes for fun!) and basically just try to exercise as much as I can to maintain muscle strength without doing anything I have just said!  It is pretty hard to keep going some days, especially when you live almost everyday in pain.   Right now I am going through a really bad flareup. My hands and fingers are swollen and so is one ankle. Lots of anti-inflammatories and hopefully it will settle soon.   I am hoping it was a one time thing. I have IBS and gastro issues from the hypermobility syndrome (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type3 really).  I do love the WoW community :)   I feel for you with the stomach issues. I had ulcerative colitis last year and I cannot imagine the pain of having more than one episode of it.  I hope are well at the moment :)  Have you tried Skyrim? ;)   :)      Mental health issues seem to be a common issue being 'helped' by WoW. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt eh? :)  I deal with anx and dep frequently because of the side effects of pain meds, and because of being in constant pain at times.   I hope you are going through a good time right now :)   Yeah, you don't realise how much you use your wrists in day to day life until you have pain in them.   Maybe with the new expansion and people coming back into the game you will find a raiding team :)     I hope you get to feeling better over time. Have you read about PTSD and Tetris? I saw something recently that was implying a positive effect on PTSD symptoms from playing Tetris.   Now I want to play Skyrim again too :)  I am glad that you seem to be in a better place now. It is pretty incredible the number of people that have had WoW have a profound effect on their lives.   I will have to have a look at that.   I would say it counts. Depression is a big issue with chronic pain conditions.  I was always a bit of a misfit too, WoW vanilla was one of the first places I actually felt I could be me and happy.   Very basic at the moment. Comfortable chair, reasonable desk. Wireless mouse and keyboard so I can have the freedom to move it to where I need it. Splints for my wrists to stop me moving them too much. Mouse mat with a gel cushion, looking for one for my keyboard too.  I have to have room in front of my desk so I can put my legs up if needed.   Similar playing history to me :) I played vanilla to Cata, then dropped in and out depending on how much I had going on in my life.   That is so sad :( But I am glad he had friends online to help him forget for a while.   It does seem to let people get away from health issues for a while :)   It does help pass the time! :)   I have always played a hunter though in different specs. I always prefered the ranged dps over melee.  I think when WoD comes out I will continue leveling my new hunter (just switched between USA and EU servers) and roll a new lvl 90. I need to think on how I want to go with it though.  JRA is a horrible condition, I really feel for you. I have hypermobility syndrome and I am waiting on a diagnosis for Ehlers-Danlos type 3. Basically on a good day I am fine, on a bad day I can't move because the ligaments and tendons all over my body are inflamed.  Do you modify your set up to account for wrist pain? I am looking to try to find a more comfortable way to play.   Yeah, I got hooked back in seeing an advert for WoD. Thought about the fun I used to have playing and before I knew it I was logged back on ;)   Not really, no. I am genuinely interested.  But some people are asses....   I have played on and off since 2005, but recently I have realised that I play more when my chronic pain condition is bad.   Immersing in the game actually lets me do things I want to be doing IRL without pain - walking, traveling, socialising. Also, getting wrapped up in quest lines and grinding mats makes the time pass faster between doses of painkillers :)   I was just wondering if any other players do this?    **edit** so lots of us then :)    I started it 3 weeks ago and it has been good so far.   Much less panic and anxiety, not too many side effects (felt nauseated for a few days), but the pros far outweigh the cons.  I am taking 7.5mg twice a day alongside 20mg citalopram.  Hope it helps you too x   Thanks :-)    http://imgur.com/k1EaqpK     Thanks :-)  Not doing too badly considering!  I am now on BuSpar for the panic attacks, and I can continue taking this until I am back in the UK and under a Dr there.  The kids are doing ok, they have been free to ask any questions they wanted to. My youngest is having issues with anxiety and worry, but we are working through it. My eldest is angry and upset, but again, we are working on talking through feelings. They both have people outside of the family that they can talk to aswell.  We fly back in two weeks from today. In fact, in exactly two weeks we will be in the air on our way home right now.  Thank you for your thoughts, it means a lot xxx   That the Aswan Dam was built in Egypt (?) and named after President Aswan. Due to stopping the natural flooding that occured each year, the soils along the river became nutrient depleted and there was also a correlating rise in the incidents of bilharzia, and disease spread by small aquatic creatures.  Thanks to Geography lessons 20 years ago.   Thanks :-) Took my first one last night and certainly noticed the drowsiness. I slept pretty well. Taking one this morning will let me know what I am in for during the day, at least I am not in work today!   :-)   Weird! I will look out for that :-(   About to start on 7.5mg of Buspar twice a day. I already take Citalopram 20mg daily and the new med is to try to relieve the panic and anxiety issues I have been having. Has anyone else used this combination? How did it work for you? How were the side effects? TIA x  edit: bit worried about trying it now :(   Thank you x   I have to tell my two kids (4 and 7) in the next 24 hours that my husband and I are separating and that the kids and I are moving back to the UK without him in about four weeks (his choice pretty much).   My IBS panic symptoms have set in, I am nauseous and have an upset stomach. I am trying to breathe, but it keeps getting overwhelming.  My husband is not offering much in the way of support towards this, in fact he is at the bar with friends right now.  I am out of lorazepam (got anxious about seeing the Dr and now can't see him until next Weds).   Please help me through this.   Actually 12 weeks ago he told me he didn't love me, and 11 weeks and 6 days ago he said he didn't know.   If I am responsible from trying to work something out rather than just ending it all when he wasn't sure, then yes. I did that.   He is refusing to go to any further counselling.  He has agreed to allow me full residency of the children whilst I am in the UK without him. We are trying to arrange financial agreements right now.  We will be telling the kids at the end of this week. It is going to be hell and heartbreaking to do, but they need time to ask questions.   Thank you :-)   Thank you :-)   Thank you x   It was pretty negative and basically blaming me for the breakup. Trying hard to forget what they said and focus on the positives.  Thank you x   Thank you. It feels very strange right now. I guess almost a feeling of relief coupled with a great amount of sadness.   I guess I can always truthfully say I tried.   I had to smile reading this comment, as I have actually just sat down with a cup of tea :-)   Because he is refusing to return to the therapist. He does not want to fix the issues.   I have given him space for 12 weeks. Would you want to be in the same situation, 4000 miles from family and not knowing what your future holds? The therapist herself told him that he needed to make a decision and stick to it because of the emotional and physical stress he has out me through.   Thank you. It feels absolutely horrible right now, and as if it is my fault the marriage is over. But I really dont know what more I could have done.   **TL:DR** I have finally taken the steps to end the marriage and to get me and the kids  back to the UK. I wish I had taken r/relationships advice sooner, but was caught in in what I can see now is an emotionally abusive trap.  First post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21za91/i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has_just_ended/  Second post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/229eea/update_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years_has/  Third post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22ghra/update_2_to_i_34f_think_my_marriage_of_9_years/  Fourth post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22nsyx/continuing_the_saga_of_myf34_husbandm32_not/  So basically (in case you don't want to read the previous posts), 12 weeks ago my husband told me that he no longer loved me. He became unreliable, unhelpful and swung between begging me to stay and telling me he wanted a divorce.   Up until this last week, he had refused to see a marriage therapist. Saturday last week, he told me again it was over and he wanted a divorce. Sunday he begged me to stay and promised he would come to my therapy session on Thursday.  He did come along. Lots was discussed about my control issues (stemming from panic and anxiety issues along with abandonment issues). I knew I needed to work on this and had been working on strategies with my therapist for the last two months.  He admitted that he didn't want to make any decisions because it was too hard for him. The therapist identified some issues with him that she feels need addressing soon, such as his inability to react positively to responsibility in the family unit. He feels I am trapping him into decisions and becomes beligerent and shuts down when he feels like he doesn't want to do something.  The therapist told us that the issues we are having are very workable, and that if he chose to work though them, she felt he may be able to resolve the reasons why he feels he doesn't love me anymore.   She said it was important to work though these feelings so that, even if the marriage ended, he would be able to move on in a positive way with his life and not fall into a reccurring pattern of these feelings.  He asked to have until Saturday to decide whether he wanted to go on with trying to work on the marriage and going to further sessions with the therapist, or whether it had gone too far to be saved.  At this point I had been emotionally thrown around for the whole twelve weeks, with him messing with my mind, my feelings and I am physically exhausted and affected by all the stress.  I asked him Saturday evening if he had come to a decision. He sat with me for a long time in silence, occasionally asking to clarfiy certain things I felt, or had said at the therapy session. He then fell asleep on the sofa. I woke him and asked for his decisiin and he started to get angry. Finally he snapped at me that we would separate and 'there, I had my answer now'.   Sunday he came into my room and sat with me. He started crying about separating and how he was miserable and would miss the kids etc. I told him that if he felt so miserable about his decision, then maybe it was not what he actually wanted. He agreed to think it over and to talk to me again last night.  Well, again he could not make up his mind. He was being really nice to me, telling me he was still physically attracted to me etc. I told him that was innapropriate right now and that for my own sanity he needed to tell me what he wanted. He got up to go and get a soda from downstairs, and when I went to find him, he was asleep on the chair. I gave up and went to bed.  This morning, he was in a bad mood. I sent him an IM as sometimes he responds better to indirect conversation, but he ignored it. I gave him a while and asked if he wanted to talk. He told me that if I had anything to say I would need to go to the basement with him as he was going to work out before going to his friends house.  I went down and asked him if he had made his mind up. He started to get frustrated and I reminded him that I was going throug hell and deserved a decision so that I could be looking to the future one way or another. He told me that he had already told me his decision (despite the tears from yesterday and not knowing what he wanted). I told him that saying that was no good to me and that he needed to give me a straight, honest answer. He looked at me angrily and told me he wanted us to separate.  I went back up to my room and skyped my mum and dad. They have been aware of the situation for a few weeks and have offered a lot of support and a place to live temporarily if I went back to the UK.  I then wrote an email to the guy in charge of my husbands tour in the US and asked him to let me know if they can help me get back to the UK with the kids. They pay for most of our stuff here and are responsible for flying us around. I am hoping they will agree to get me and the kids back to the UK and to help me with any paperwork needed. I have told them the situation and made it clear that I need to get out of here for my emotional and psychological well being. I told them that my husband has tokd me that he wants a divorce and no longer wants me (and through that the kids) living here.  Obviously it is a holiday weekend in the US as well as in the UK right now, so I will have to wait until tomorrow at the earliest to hear from him.  My parents are starting to build supply kits of food etc that I can take to a new home as soon as I can find one in the UK. They are also looking out to get furnishings etc for me and the kids.  Husband has not told his parents any of this so far. They arrive for a holiday here in three weeks. I am not responsible for him anymore so I am leaving it up to him to tell them. In fact, recently he requested that I did not talk to them until he had done so. If they ask why I didnt tell them, I will let them know.  I am emotionally drained, devestated and physically exhausted from everything that is haooening, and from holding everything in for the last 12 weeks. I have been trying to keep my kids from being affected, even though I know they are picking up on the tension in the house. They are great kids and I am going to keep them as safe and happy as I possibly can.  For the record, I offered (to see his reaction TBH) to leave the kids here with him, and he couldn't agree to it, despite his protests about missing them. Apparently the feeling only goes so far.  So, I have done it. I am cutting 15 years of my life away. But it has to be done, or else how can I show my children what love is?  Apologies for spelling etc. I am still pretty shaky and not entirely functioning right now.     Lisa calls him because she is lonely at the camp and asks him to tell his old stories I believe. He gets tired of talking to her for once!   15/17   Bread roll :-)   Thanks :)  Yes, lots of unnecessary procedures, blood draws, and antibiotics!  I have been on citalopram for the last 10 years or so, for the depression more than the anxiety. It seems to help me stay balanced enough to just about cope, without loosing all ability to feel.  I hope it does get easier!   Looking back with my psych, we have identified GAD symptoms as far back as when I was six. I probably began to be heavily impacted by them from when I was about 14-16. I was misdiagnosed several times as Drs sought to find a 'physical' reason for my symptoms. I was officially diagnosed when I was 19 following a breakdown at university.   For me the anxiety was definately an escalating issue, but as I do not really remember a time when I was not anxious, it has always been with me.  As for panic attacks, I had mild ones as I was growing up, they usually manifested in throwing up and shaking uncontrollably. As throwing up is common in kids, no one thought it was out of the ordinary.  More recently I have has severe and dehibilitating panic attacks that have left me with agoraphobia and claustrophobia issues, difficulty in socializing, depersonalization and physical health issues. I was medicated for a short while when these started, but have tried to manage them without meds more recently. I do miss the security of popping a tablet and feeling the calm descend  I am however, still holding down a job and managing to look after my kids. It is just about possible to function with high anxiety and panic, but it is extremely exhausting both physically and mentally.   Thanks! :-)   Will do!   Nope, they quoted me the same for both types :-(  I think I also had a grumpy store assistant with no xmas spirit!   It is good to see ECE getting some love for once :-)   Nor did I until I went to post my stuff! :-)   Just a warning, if you are posting overseas, the USPS charge cardboard envelopes and bubble wrap envelopes differently.  I was sending some xmas cards to the UK. In a cardboard envelope, they were going to be $6. In a bubble wrap envelope, they were going to be $36.   The difference is that they class overseas in bubble wrap as a parcel, not a letter.  	81
 They're bout a 34 waist on a whim and the inseam is the same as my other pants (34)    I'm down.  I live in Westwood and shoot with a Sony NEX.  I've been wanting to step my photography game up too.   Bah gawd!    Is there anyway to read this for free w/o Kindle?  I left mine at home and I'm out of town for the next 3 months.     I can imagine.  I do photography as well and you've inspired me.  I typically make people the focus of my pictures but I'm going to try something different for a bit.   I honestly wish I hadn't.  My phone has been super slow and the battery drain is ridiculous.  It's also hot all the time too.  A lot of issues are reported here:  http://www.techtimes.com/articles/50388/20150504/more-lg-g3-g2-android-5-0-lollipop-problems-reported-by-users-battery-drain-slow-charging-wi-fi-issues-continue.htm  A reset doesn't seem to solve them as well.   Good premise but I was disappointed that at the end of that article it was just an attempt to sell some books.  The "Keys for Life" are too broad to just follow as a how-to on their own.  This topic could easily be organized into a 5 step tutorial with pics (i.e. sample wardrobe combinations).   We must find her with Cerebro   Dunbar needs "a southerner with a penis" to win.

Correct me if I'm wrong however.   I've watched this show since the beginning... This is easily the worst season yet    I got a Merry Christmas text out of nowhere.  It was hard but I looked at it, and put my phone down and didn't send anything back.  The hardest part is feeling like I'm a jerk for not responding but I think it was the best thing for ME.   Great way to put it.  Sometimes people think the pain gets easier but you're right, you just deal with it better.   See this is the tough part...  Normally I'd agree with you but in my experience what happens is that if you respond to a quick "Merry Christmas!" text it will quickly be followed up by a "So how is everything going?" text.    Then you feel obligated to respond to that too and everything comes spiraling down.   Sorry, I meant to say we broke up with each other.  It was mutual initially, because we'd always break up and get back together.  This time was different because I wanted to get back together and she disagreed.  I edited my post.   That's tough.  I'm in a similar situation (her family lives 4 miles away from mine, bigger city though).  I actually hope that I don't see her.  Is it possible for you to avoid her at all?  At least bring an accountability buddy with you for support and to prevent doing anything regrettable if you see her.  Best of luck.   My ex and I broke up over three years ago and initially the thought of not talking to her for a month was AGONIZING.  Fast forward, I spent numerous times breaking NC and trying to work things out over the years to no avail.  I would have a REALLY hard time staying strong when she initiated contact.  I'd say, "Well, what's the harm in engaging in conversation?"  It ultimately would lead to me being more hurt than before.  I can honestly say that now I'm finally ready to move on.  For so long I kept hoping for closure but **I realized that closure comes from within.**  There's nothing more for us to say to each other.  Previously, I would look at my NC counter nervously as it got above 20 days.  I'd dread the impending contact from her side.  Nowadays, I'm excited as the days pile up.  The momentum is great.  I say to myself, "If I can do a month, imagine how three months would feel?  Imagine how a year would feel??!?"  I'm sure a lot of you still have hope of getting back with your ex or a lot of you don't really want to never speak to them again.  I know everyone's situation is different but from my experience I can say that you're better off just sticking with NC.  I wasted 3 years going back and forth.  If I would have just stuck to my guns in the first year I'd be better off right now.  I'm proud of myself and I look forward to being even stronger and taking back control of my life.  *There is one small caveat in which I think it's okay to break NC.  If and only if the person makes it clear that they want to get back together AND it's what you want.  Any other small talk is pointless and will only set you back.*  MERRY CHRISTMAS! (if you celebrate that kinda thing)  I just wanted to share this with you guys.  Stay strong.   Take it from me, don't respond.    It only alleviates their guilt and makes THEM feel better.  Some people could see it as rude but what's the point in responding?  What will it accomplish?  The only time I think folks should respond to an ex is if they're clearly making an effort to talk about reconciliation.  Anything else is just pointless chatter that will get your hopes up and ultimately set you back.  I to have asked myself what I'd do if I got a Christmas text and I'm preparing to ignore it as well.   Cool.  That's how you feel.  They still should've talked about this way in advance.  As a matter of fact it should have naturally came up in conversation due to the similarity of their names.   I might be in the minority, but I don't think he's being irrational.  It's not uncommon for men to want their wives to take their last names.  With that being said, you guys obviously have communication issues and should've discussed this way before the engagement.     Yeah man, you hit it on the head with the fact that recovery is not a linear  process.  When I went through my first major breakup, I went through the same emotions as you.  Hang in there.  Even years later I'll see something that creates a flashback to happier times and it makes me momentarily sad.  But the moment always fades.     Thanks.  Your intuition is right, she didn't want that kid.  It came out of a one night stand.    I appreciate the rest of your advice as well.   Thanks.  I'm more than prepared to go No Contact.  I dealt with a serious relationship ending a few years ago.  I've kind of developed a "breakup action plan" now.  I"m more concerned with how to deal with my day to day thoughts   I've been trying to practice Stoicism for awhile but this caught me off guard.  Never in my life could I have imagined this negative scenario and prepared myself.  I've decided to come here instead of /r/BreakUps because I find working on how I view and react to the events more useful than talking about why things happened.  Because honestly, I'll never know why.  So far the best way to frame this that I can think of is that it was a blessing in disguise.  That I now no longer have to stress about how to find a job near her or how I don't have to worry about any other pressures with her.    I'm curious to know you guys' thoughts.   Can you share your spreadsheet?  I've been trying to do something similar for awhile.     You're not ugly.  Perhaps your standards are too high maybe?  Perhaps you come off as clingy.  Who knows.    Rapgenius is the best that OP is gonna get.  He could always dispute the lyrics to get corrections.   You still have feelings... It's impossible to not give a fuck. Nothing anybody says here is gonna change that. Just don't make an ass out of yourself. Matter of fact, you should seriously reevaluate if you should go.   If you still have feelings you're likely gonna have a bad night. Sorry.     Where'd you get that rug and how much did it set you back?  I want a nice rug but they're so expensive    Welp, just entered grad school and this destroyed my hope of taking my time to find the right person.    Ah yes, such is the way of life.   Exactly.  So many times in my life things started off as "let's just have some fun" and escalated to tears and "why can't we be together?!?!"    Smart men see the future and wisely leave it alone.  Everyone single mom eventually wants a real relationship and father figure for their kids at some point.   Can you explain this further?  I don't quite understand.  Was Seneca against forming relationships but more a proponent of deep friendships?  What does "passionate love" mean to a stoic anyway?    Everyone hates it but "After Earth" is pretty much a movie about stoicism.   A tenet of Stoicism is imagining negative future events to prepare yourself mentally for if/when they happen. (i.e. loved ones dying, etc.)  Recently I sought to put this idea into practice before going on a jog... to get my mind clear.  As I started the exercise I started imagining myself breaking my leg or getting severely injured and stopped.  I was horrified at the thought and realized that **negative visualization may not always be a good thing for the psyche.**  I couldn't see how imagining the worst case scenario was going to help me in that instant.  Could some of the more experienced Stoics chime in?  Am I thinking about this in the wrong way?  Please help.  Thanks   Or you could just do it now and stop being a punk.  It would save a lot of future headache.   I need to determine if this is real or a photoshop first.    This is the perfect perspective to have but man is it HARD when you're going thru it.    I need this too.   http://i.imgur.com/Z7lEKH1.gif   So beat him up then   I have.  I haven't taken Prozac in over 5 years.  See here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ch7i1/who_else_is_taking_this_journey_drugfree/     Sounds like /r/gonewild beckons you   Yes.  I even went to ER for it.  They hooked me up to an EKG and everything.    Nothing was wrong and they gave me some Xanax.  My hospital bill was crazy too.  After that I've learned to ignore it when I feel like I'm having a heart attack and chalk it up to just a regular panic attack.   Gracias por su ayuda!   It's good advice but I've learned as I get older that nobody really follows it.  People get lonely yo.   Someone accused me of stalking in another post.  The compulsion comes from human nature.  I don't obsess over my ex or even dwell on it.  I randomly clicked a link and there I was, back in the past.    I only shared it in case someone else can relate and to show how quickly it happens.  A lot of times people treat NC as a once you do it it's a done deal type of thing when in reality people slip up all the time.   Wow. Sorry that you had to go through that.  I hope you're much better now.   I joined.  I look forward to this!   Yeah thanks. I haven't even bothered to read most of the other comments. I literally relapsed for the first time in over a year and I'm a stalker.  lol  I just wanted to share something with what I thought was an inclusive community... I guess I was wrong.   Hmm...  I feel like a Buddhist or Stoic should come in here and talk about the danger of needs and desires.  	51
 Washington it is. Born and raised. Now, I must apologize, but I have to call it a night. It was awesome talking to you, and I really am glad I met you. Feel free to send me a message anytime. When I'm at work (like I will be for a chunk of the day tomorrow), I still manage to find a bit of time to lurk around. Take care, Wiscy! Keep on writing and keep on kicking ass! Have a good night!   LoL - Well, hm. Let me consider the facts before me. You type with an accent, which suggests a bit east from where I am on this blue dot. Well, quite a bit east of where I call home. But, based off this one small clue... New York? No, no... not even close, what was I thinking? ........Wisconsin? Possibly?  As for myself - I live 20 minutes outside of a city I like to call Sea-Town.   If he's saying things like this to you, and insisting on doing things that make you uncomfortable, then, to me at least, it doesn't sound like he's in it for 'you' or 'us'. It sounds a lot like he's just in it for him. If he's not making an effort to understand what you're going through and support you, than I'm with scratch on this one - start exploring your options. Yes, it's scary trying to think of the future when you're so unsure of the present. But don't let that further cripple you. Talk to your parents about moving in with them temporarily until you can get back on your feet, financially and emotionally. If he isn't taking the steps to help you, then start taking steps to help yourself. Small ones at first, bigger ones when you feel more confident. But the small steps are important, because each small step leads to a small victory, and with each small victory, you come closer to a larger victory - those big steps you can take. And while you're winning those small victories, your confidence will grow. Take care of yourself. If you feel you don't matter to him, don't let that effect your mindset. You do matter. You are worth the fight. If not to him, then to someone who can and will support you and seek to understand you. I hope you the best of luck in whatever you choose to do, and  I sincerely hope that your situation does improve. Keep fighting. It's worth it. It may not be easy, but it is worth it.   That's great! In two weeks, you'll be back at that table-saw woodworking! You love boardgames, eh? Have you considered combining these two passions, along with your writing skills, and possibly making a game of your own?   Or maybe your light has just dimmed to the point you think it's gone out? Loneliness is a burden that can be crushing. But, I honestly believe that if you, when you're alone, you take that time to use to soul-search; explore why you feel how you feel, explore the ways it effects you. I believe that we all have a light inside us, but this light is... well, almost like a plant. It has to be nurtured, tended to, and encouraged. It needs to be fed - when you find your light, and I truly hope you do, the best way to nurture it is to expose it to the light of others. The flames will entwine while you're together, feed each other, and when you go home, having been fed and nurtured, your light has a much better chance of continuing to glow and grow.   If you don't mind me asking - is your condition permanent or temporary?   You're welcome!   In a lot of ways, yes, I am a loner. I have a small group of friends offline, small enough to count on one hand - but that's how I like it. But I'm also the type who does, from time to time, like to bust out of my bubble and socialize - when I do, I'm a bit of a social butterfly. I like to talk to different people, learn who they are and what drives them. You meet some really interesting people this way. Hell, it's how I just met you! As for my username... well, I don't know if this will make sense, but here's my quick and dirty of what it means. train_subject1457 means, to me, 'memories'. Past experiences shrouded by time, that still echo around in my mind. Some of them are good, some of them aren't. But to me, it means to remember your past, and where you've been. But it's in the past, which means I'm not chained to my past - if anything, my past will help shape my future, not define it.  As for hobbies, I have a few. I cycle through them from time to time, but I like to play my guitar from time to time, I like to draw (even though it's not something I'd consider myself very good at, but I'm learning), and like you, I like to write. In fact, writing is my favorite hobby. I don't do it nearly as often as I used to, but I do bust out the pen and notepad from time to time. Like you, I like writing poetry as well. I've dabbled in short horror stories myself, and explored other genre's as well; shorts, mainly, but fantasy and sci/fi.    That's a step. And I can relate - if I ever sank so low as to go back to cocaine, I'd be gone within days, if not hours. It's unfortunate, but in a lot of ways 'once and addict, always an addict' is true. But that shouldn't define you. Again, I'd encourage you to give your guitar another shot. If you can't think of a song to play, then make a list of the songs you know, and pick one at random, and just play it. It's something I do, and I do it - even if I have to force it. Because once you get a song or two out, it becomes easier to just play. If you don't know a lot of songs - well, even better! Pick a song you love, and learn it. Even if you do know a lot of songs, learn a new one! Or go on to YouTube, find a guitar tutorial, and learn some new techniques.   And every life is worthwhile. Every story is worth writing. Don't come down on yourself so far for 'ending up' here - a lot of us have, some of us as a last resort, and it's helped. You seem like you're at whit's end, but instead of making the choice to step out of this life, you ended up here. With us. People who are, at the very least, willing to listen. Remember that next time you're down and come back. And yes, please, lurk the shit out of this sub! You'll be amazed by what you find. I know I have. Hope this helps, and take care of yourself. Like I said, and I'll say it again. You. Are. Worth it.   Don't apologize, you're going through some really rough times. Watching someone you love sink into the depths of alcoholism is rough - or so I hear. From my wife. Like you, my father was an alcoholic, like his father before him. And, like my father, I found myself struggling with alcoholism for a period of time in my life. To this day, I still have trouble with it - I still drink, occasionally, but I'm not the 6-pack a night that I used to be. But even then, I still have trouble putting the bottle down from time to time.  But the sins of the father don't always translate to the son. It sounds like you've done very good so far. You have the strength to stop yourself before it goes too far - that's very admirable. People like me have trouble doing that, so when we hear of people like you, who can find a sense of control of that, it gives people like me hope. I'm sorry, but I don't know what to say about your -fathers- situation, but this what I'd like to say about your own - You're doing good. Coming here, getting it off your chest, that's a good step to take. Whenever you're feeling down, come back. Post again about what you're going through, because what you're going through is tough. Watching someone you love eat away at themselves, feeling like there's nothing you can do, it in turn eats at you. And if you don't get that out, then you risk suppressing it, and the more you suppress it, the more you run the risk of following in his steps. Talk to people. If you don't feel comfortable talking to friends irl, then like I said, come back here. Lurk. Comment. Whatever you need to do to help you through it, do it - you may even find other people who can relate to your situation, and then you'll have more people to talk to. But keep doing what you're doing - keep fighting. You're doing good so far, but that doesn't mean it's easy, and it doesn't mean you haven't suffered. Obviously, you have - you are. But keep fighting. You're worth the struggle.    Thank you, Wiscy! Hope you don't mind me callin' you that, but I think that sounds pretty bad-ass myself. And as for the support - well, isn't that what we're here for? Hope this isn't a longshot, but based off your full username, I'm guessing you like to write? Do you write much?   Yes, this post was worth it. And don't apologize - sounds like you're going through a lot and in need of expressing it - when you apologize for how you feel, you're apologizing for being honest. Never, ever apologize for being honest.  Reading through this, what I want to ask you is this - have you tried alternative methods to expressing your anger? If you have, try again - I'm sorry if that sounds cold or insensitive, but I'm only saying it to help. In relation to my own depression, when I start to spiral into a darker place in my mind, I pick up an old hobby; sometimes I pick up the guitar and spend a few hours playing. Or I grab my pen and notebook, and write. Sometimes I draw. But they all tend to be temporary - mainly because they help, at least for a time being. But if it helps me get through the worst of the feelings I'm trying to get through, then I consider that a win. Maybe a small win, but it's a win. When I was younger, I was picked on and bullied constantly, which lead to suicide attempts, which spiraled out into substance abuse - and I can tell you from experience, the alcohol and the drugs (hopefully just weed, but if there's others, I'm not judging - I'm no saint myself) may help in the short-term, but in the long-term, they'll only enable the depression, and add a new depth to your depression - and considering how depression can sometimes make people feel like they're 'drowning', adding more depth to that ocean is the last thing you want to do, because you'll only sink deeper and deeper every time.   Now, to address your feelings of loneliness - again, the depression - but here we have the chance for a win. It may be small, it may be huge, but you won't know until you try. What I'm driving at is - you're not alone. You really aren't. And I hope you find that out here in /r/depression. Lurk other peoples posts, read the comments, see what others are going through - you may find someone who is going through something similar to what you're going through to a degree. But give it a shot. It's worth it. You're worth it. Based off this post alone, I can tell you've lead an interesting life - maybe not the easiest of lives, but at the very least, an interesting one. You have a story to tell, and a unique one. Tell it. Keep telling. Because as you continue on through life, you'll add chapters to your story. And those chapters, those stories, as you tell them - it could save someone's life, just knowing that there's someone out there who can relate, even if it's in a small way. I know life can be a struggle, to this day I still wonder how I've made it this far, but I keep fighting. Even if it's day to day. If that helps, then do it - day by day. Step by step. Keep fighting. Because you're worth it. You really are.   Other people may have 'tougher' situations to go through, but those are their situations - this one's yours. That doesn't diminish what you're going through. I'm sorry to hear you've been going through so much, and what you're going through sounds rough by anyone's standards.  With that said, hi! I'm Echo. Nice to meet you.   	13
 be there for her, but dont be her world. if she relies on you for everything, you will eventually fail because that isnt a burden you are meant to bear, and it will break her   yep   LMFAO   dude thats awesome man congrats!!!   sonya curry   Am I actually an ENFJ? I am very good at talking to people and I'm generally not nervous, but I think about everything so much and am so internal. but I also start to feel lonely and even depressed if I'm alone too much.    hahaha you're right. maybe rinse*   you go in there??   my fight coach was getting frustrated with me because i kept thinking i understood the instruction but actually didnt. he got mad at me and said "YOU DONT LISTEN". seemingly small but it really messed with me and i got surprisingly sad   i love it. i think its worth the risk   I've learned that a lot of guys just think "water will get it" but man that is not true. Especially if you play sports, you have to scrub your feet, and everyone poops, you have to have to have to soap your butthole.    did you ask her what she expected? was the card made of like cheapass cardboard and old newspaper with a pen? i mean jeez. sounds like you did a good job to me lol   i like the question you posed. i know in sunday school they taught us a lot that god is a jealous and self loving god. and the barbie doll argument. like if you programmed a barbie to say i love you, would it be meaningful. no. god does the same thing. he gives you a choice so it feels better when you choose him. just quoting what they taught. think its stupid either way like yeah. ur gna give them the "choice" to love you then send em to hell if they choose wrong lmao   dadbod   drink a shot of protein powder to that   hahah it was the most i could comfortably do without being too sexual   i think i successfully masturbated in class twice in my life. had to use my left hand both times. RAGING hormones as an 8th grader.    into a tissue   oh trust me i have not forgotten. i'm watching every single one of these games rooting for lebron. im not a cavs fan but goddamn i would HATE to see gsw get a championship   if he calls you a slut, id be a bit worried. but when i think of myself and my friends, we wouldnt really say the word slut in front of a girl. its really judgmental and we might be joking about it as bro talk with each other but yeah definitely never in front of a girl   best to err on the side of caution. thats what i thought was best too. i think its easier to explain/ ask for forgiveness for being too civil than for being too aggressive   	21
 "'Have I gone mad?' 'I'm afraid so. You're entirely bonkers. But I'll tell you a secret. All the best people are.'" - Alice in Wonderland   I don't know why, but this quote has stuck with me throughout my childhood. I guess it just makes me feel better about being my normal, weird, kinda crazy, self.       I have stopped cutting for a while, but the scars are very visible and go all the way up my forearms, so i really have no reasonable excuse for them. I normally wear long sleeves but its been getting pretty warm lately, so ive been using henna tattoo pens to draw on my arms in the hopes that it will distract people from the scars. its worked for me for a while. if its recent cuts, one of my friends suggested saying that its make-up and you were practicing doing special effects make-up art.    thank you. I didn't know that existed until now.   not sure but at this point I'm too afraid to ask.    probably required a helluva lot of beer for the guy   Diana is a very conflicting name for me. on one hand I have my best friend. on the other I have my 390 lb aunt who has 6 children from 5 different one night stands.    Diana, you are a self-centered waste of space who has earned the title "Jabba the Slut" from most of your family.

 Fucking spawn camping for politics, purposeful misinformation tying the opponent to some shit.    I wish I had a gf for just this reason.   Its my version of knifey-spoony.   I know. But no one else seemed to get the quote, so I called it.   Guy I knew, fully grown adult, believed that the moon landing was faked because it would have been cheaper to mine the surface of the moon then, than to send a probe to mars now.   There's no way you dated Jessica Simpson.   EDIT: Thanks for the gold guys, but you really should donate to the Abused War Sheep of New Brunswick Silent Bachelor Auction and Rickshaw Race for Peace in Occupied North Texas.  EDITEDIT: M'lecherry popped!   Interesting dynamic/ abuse of powers... Same thing.   No. There are general rules for health and the population, many are really more like guidelines, others are better defined.  For example, smoking and overeating is bad for 99% of the world, whereas maybe 65% of people stop growing at 16.    A security council membership or automatic veto would be an interesting dynamic.    In a rapey, knifey stabby kinda way, sure.   Well apparently I am a machine.   Fuck you OP.   Worth it.   Not as far as I know.   Ask the demon from HR.   This cup of coffee says no.   Fuck you too.   North Florida is to Florida politics as Lions are to house cats.   I have worked as a bouncer, I've seen the worst in a lot of people, but this shit sets a new bar (pununintended.) I just want to drink and read reddit.    Shitty. Depression, static from my family, drinking is my refuge.   Me too.   I must disagree, having worked with the democratic party in florislda for years and by being a resident for 28 years.      Who will then vote as religious conservatives.   Just need to go from Orthodoxy to Protestantism. Not really a stretch.   War isn't kosher.   Man, Nathan's is fucking up hardcore.   As you wish?   As a progressive, I might agree with Ron Paul on something, but good luck getting me to admit it.   No, but the keyboards went missing.   Uhm, yeah. If you'll remember we sent out a memo about this....  I'll see that you get another copy.   A.C.M.E.? We use DerpCo here.   Terrorist/freedom fighter same thing.     Will it blend?   How do you drink a permanent seat license?   So am I. :(   Florida.   Don't rear end them, it won't do anything. Put your front tire just behind their back tire and spin them into oncoming traffic.   If you're gon act like a bitch...   Boom, knowledge. Source would be nice though.   Pillows.   Heh.   Not a squat, but I leg pressed 1200 in high school. Loaded up all the 45s and 2 classmates on a recumbent leg press and got it up.   I know it sounds like bs, but if you saw me in person it'd make sense.   So that's what happened to Megan Fox.   Yea...   Apparently its early access too. Maybe they'll release the full game with explosives.   Playing the field against name recognition and AFAIK there's still a decent chance he will run.   You're paying for it in other ways, like poor roads, water systems, underfunded schools...   They just raised the property tax here in Blount Co.   I was trying to sensor the i with an asterisk, but I'm on mobile its just a pain in the ass to format on bacon reader. Also should have added the /s.   The internet really needs a sarcasm font or a reverse italicized thing.   I am evolution's prolapsed anus.   You can get 32s in glass.    Be gentle...   I really think we should tone down the rhetoric here, tr*ggered refers to a tr*gger and I don't want victims of gun violence to feel unsafe.   Because I don't want to hand my phone to someone and have them snooping around my dick pics.   Empathy, legacy evolutionary traits and because you're a little bit tired.   If only that were the case here on reddit or in the real world.   Ah yes, the maybe if she laughs at my jokes, I will stop crying about my life strategy.   You can, but I like to spice things up a little. You know some good old fashioned sounding.   So Pineapple Spice instead of Pumpkin?   Of course we've seen women. You think we just masturbate to ourselves and MLP?   Sears catalog get old?   Maybe Huron and Yankton are shitholes because they aren't the capitol.    Yer mum.   Boom.   In all of my time living in Orlando, I never once paid to go to Disney. I don't do theme parks.   You know what you are Trevor? You're a fucking hipster.   Its amazing what a lot of money can do.*  If my dream is to have a couch made of Pringles and enough booze to give a blue whale alcohol poisoning, as long as I can pay for it.. Amazing.   Free parking my ass. More like free parking and 20 minutes of walking through a frying pan.   So that was the sex on the beach thing...   M'spelling.   Florida man quit for a while?   I'm pretty sure resources are on a separate algorithm as it tends to be more related to difficulty. Fewer luxuries equals lower happiness and being a insular/warmongering nation is harder if you have to trade for iron/horses/oil etc.   Spend some money to become their ally, receive the bonus influence to be allies for an extra ~30 turns.   Check your advanced settings. Resources may be set to sparse.    Nope.   But I do feel like people think I'm lying when I say my height on dating websites.    And then I helped an old lady cross the street, but then a cop decided to give me a ticket for parking at a red light, but he got called to a bank robbery so I had to wait for him to come back because he took my license. And then my blood sugar was getting low so I had to stop at mcds and get a burger but there were like 3 cars full of stoner kids in front of me and they all wanted 50 things... And then....   Til I'm user #73264 in karma rankings.    Connely or Tyler?  Oh yeah, both.   I know. Fetish troll probably isn't looking for a dude, so I was trying to fuck with their fun.   Of fucking course she does.   I know the statement required unlimited resources, that also could be created in a manufacturing process out of thin air.   (Qualification ad infinitum)Simplified statement= ELI5.   Hamilton  Jefferson IMO.   The only thing that this country could get people to agree on in a 75% majority is that this country is filled with idiots.   I'm sure someone considered him to be the Michelle Bachmann of his time.   So the strongest economy would be the consume, consume, consume kind?   As long as it gets shot from a satellite made of sapphire penis jokes.   Would you like a side of kitch to go with your campiness?   You mean the sleeves aren't supposed to end halfway up my arm?!   Do you really have to ask. :)   Its more than that. Greece has a very corrupt system when it comes to paying taxes. Like if I made 100k euro I could pay he tax man x euro to say my income was 25k. This corruption was systemic, it wasn't a lack of work, it was a lack of responsibility.   Combine that with austerity measures, government officials make less, thus increasing corruption, and reducing tax revenue.   I'm trying but /u/pepsinext is fucking shit up.   Downtown/Afghanistan same thing.   Once it gets kicked out of the EU crime will go up. Organized shit will work if the deal in euros, banks will still take euros, but good, local business will not.  They will be on hard times, crime goes up, tourism goes down... Anarchy in the heart of democracy.   Austerity doesn't work. Accountability + investment does. At least in the case of Greece it should.   Culture. My tourism is pretty high at this point of the game.   Sell false tax returns. That's prohibited right?   I'm not your friend, buttbuddy.   Eh, forgettable.    Try out Marconi union and The Mercury Program.   Listen to your partner and your trusted friends. Friends will say if your partner is treating you badly, your partner will tell you if you are treating them badly.   Trust and communication. Listen to yourself, your partner, and those you trust.   I don't trust people, so I'm sol, but I hope few are as fucked as me.    And they keep scoring from halffield.   Not enough. Wanna do it for me?      15% is the income tax for the highest bracket?   If I made $20k a year I'd be paying that rate...   Global warming is about entire climates subtley shifting. Climates are about the whole picture not one day. Also, snow requires an interaction of warm and cool air, so stronger winter storms fit the global warming bill.   Depends on the contract.   If a city state is removed from the game the number of votes required for world leader is also reduced.   Its like vampire weekend but bloodier.   Tithe counts other civs and city-states. Add Religious Texts for a nice bonus. I've sat around just keeping my cities in my religion and the passive influence will keep me making 25-30 gpt.

So +2 sight for america or the UA is only active when you build your 'Empire Wonder'?   I think everyone's wonder would have to come at the same time or I'd have to wait for the industrial era to get the White House versus Egypt getting Tuts Tomb in the late ancient era.   That's like saying most rock bands sound the same because 99% of them are kids in a garage band.   I'm on mobile, providing a well structured and cited response is difficult and more time consuming than I'm willing to put in.   But, I've offered a different view, a reasonable alternative and it seems like your ideology is getting in the way. Fuck off.   I didn't say there aren't unions, I said that there are bigger and more compelling issues which result in lack of modernization.   Also, a Wikipedia about the afl-cio and a biased opinion piece don't really count as good sources. If you want me to believe that unions are the biggest issue, you need better evidence.   	113
 Thank you, I also wish you the best too. That sounds like a great idea. I am willing to try anything. From memory my mum has a few oils, will give her a buzz and borrow some. I'm willing to try anything. I do breathing exercises which helps anxiety a bit but my depression isn't so easy today. Thank you again for your response, I really appreciate it. Feel like I'm a record on repeat, seems to happened every 6 months or so that depression gets the best of me. Was close to deleting this as I hadn't had responses. Thank you again.   This has helped me a lot today, Thank you. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 15 years ago. Today isn't a good day for me, one of the many thoughts in my head is that I should "suck it up" and "other people have it worse". I know it won't last and then I'll feel silly/stupid for my mood. Want to give a shout out to my partner and family. They have gone through it all with me. Everyone deserves to be heard.   I have a feeling she is going to be getting a lot of attention today. Lots of hugs just to start with. Could watch her sleep all day. Thank you.  	3
 That's such an incredibly kind thing to say! Thank you. After reading the comments in this discussion today and thinking about what I'd like to do in the future, I think that volunteer work could be a really great option for me. If there's one thing that still makes me feel good, it's helping other people. And I'd really like to be someone who does that on a regular basis.   Thank you very much :)   I've actually started looking into some local charities after reading your comment and I think it would actually be a great way to get myself out of the house and do some gratifying work while I'm applying and if I end up getting part time work. The reason I've been hesitant to go back into retail or good service is that they're kind of mind numbing, but working for a good cause might actually really help with that. Plus if they're an accepting environment I'm all for it :)   Well, I know that I wouldn't be able to tend bar ever because I'm a grandma already and I cannot stay up late for the life of me haha. But I did wait tables to put myself through school and I'm strongly considering going back to it while taking classes or doing an apprenticeship/internship/volunteer work. The tips were excellent.   Nah that's what I've been most afraid of. Thanks to all the advice here I think a discrete "freelancing while taking care of a medical issue" is going to be my plan. Neither is a lie since I actually have done a small amount of freelancing and I've been taking care of a very big issue :)   I'm so so sorry for your loss, but very happy to hear that you've managed to land your dream job, that's amazing!   Aw thanks! I figured I would ask here before the employment subreddit a because I thought I'd get more empathetic feedback around the whole story here and because I thought that it might be relevant to others trying to get over the same hump :)   I think the conclusion I've come to really is that I should ease back into it with something part time. It's been kind of hard to swallow my pride and admit that I'm not going to be in a competitive position in my field right away and that's ok-- it's a step forward and for the first time in a long time, the right direction.  Thank you for the feedback-- I really do feel weirdly just less alone knowing that others can relate to how hard the step back into the real world is.  	7
 We've only found 2 but it's not like we go to goodwill every week, not even every month. Sometimes you'll freak out and then realize it's just an inscription from a grandma or something    When I see the other person checking every hardcover in the store I'll know it's you    Hahhahahha. Also works with trivial pursuit. Every damm goodwill.       Hey, bud. I had a similar experience where I was someone (an ex that things should not have ended but they did) I had zero contact with for a year after things ended. I was in a relationship, but the interaction alone made me question everything in my life, left me unable to stop crying for days, and gave me my first real suicidal thoughts. It's been a few weeks though, and I came out on the other side. I don't really have any advice (other than to keep talking it out) but I just wanted to let you know to keep breathing and you'll make it out too, eventually. Your mind will focus on some other worry and it'll pass. Here if you need anything    You're neat. I like you.    Ah gotcha. What I do sometimes when I'm really bad is make myself a self care checklist. So everyday I have to brush my teeth, get dressed, eat a healthy breakfast lunch dinner, do 30 minutes of any kind of body movement a day, and check to make sure my environment is cleanish. That way no matter how bad my day is, I still accomplished those (positive) things.      Can't say I didn't think it haha    hey! welcome. i did the same thing sort of i went to a pediatrician for really bad tension in my neck and joints that i knew was caused by depression. when she suggested i do yoga, my mom took me to a psych.   anyway, ive had a few stints in therapy since then, and some have been great. definitely look into SOME kind of help, theres no reason you need to be suffering (at least not without trying something)    Is there any way you can get set up with a vocational rehab counselor? like at your county's visual impairment center? they might have information and guidance about this stuff    hey man, sorry to hear everything is so shitty for you. its shitty on my end too. have you ever considered/tried going to therapy? just asking because it wasnt listed on your post and it may be something else that you can try to turn this doom around   here if you need to talk!   yes yes yes yes even up to like very recent decisions where im like YEAH THIS WILL BE GR8 and then a week later im like fuck me    ugh i know youre right. im just so confused like we had 3.5 sessions that were going great why bother do this???? it literally broke all of my trust for her. im so gd sensitive to begin with    for the love of christmas christ. im resentful about everything lmao so youre right i definitely would. i have this week to grow some balls and figure out what the hell to say    jesus. that must be exhausting starting and ending with new ones like that. necessary, obviously. just exhausting. hope it turns around for you. ill speak up with this one      i love writing and do it frequently. now im wishing i wrote as soon as i got home from it. thanks for the suggestion   ah thanks, im conflicted cause apart from this incident i really liked her. i think i need to be more assertive in letting her know how i feel   not a psychiatrist though. but thanks for the reassurance, im going to try to explain to her how im feeling next time, but honestly probably wont confront her about what she said--unless im feeling brave in the moment    Check out r/glitch_in_the_matrix. They'll appreciate this    giggled at Ty(ler) Pennington. anyway, this is beautiful.   hey! so it sounds like youre having cyclic thoughts, i get these too. something that has helped me (i had ones regarding death too) is everytime you realize you have these thoughts, acknowledge it. you can consciously then change the subject, and acknowledge that youre "just worrying" your brain is allowed to wander, its what it does, and recognizing that youre doing it without pulling your emotions into is helpful. hope something in this ramble helps.      I once heard "it's okay to grieve the time you lost to your mental illness"   I hope this helps   I am so successful, and I am also severely depressed. Comparisons with depression are useless, because everyone's is so different. Your feelings are valid!   The amish   You've put into words, thank you.    Hey, I'm proud of you. You need this. Sending good vibes.   ditto. saw them at bamboozle and then went to college and found out they were the high school band of some girl on my floor    holy shit, yeah. winter was always bad but i am so sick of hearing people talk about winter seasonal depression. the summer is also worse for me than the fall/spring tends to be.    wow. this hit me.    alright in that case id google non profit legal aid/organizations in your area. i saw an attorney this past winter due to no heat in my apt and they laid everything out on the table--all the options, consequences, etc.    I would love this too   By any chance is she a student?    Please don't ever let the power go to your head. The worst I've seen in law enforcement were guys and gals on some sort of sick power trip because of they're position       Ran into an ex person after almost a year of no contact. It was unexpected. We made eye contact and then just kind of stared at each other. The customer who he was helping was just looking back and forth at us    go. personally, seeing all their social media about the trip while youre stuck working would drive me nuts   underarmour tysm   	37
 Also, as a person who lives with depression, anxiety, and is a recovering alcoholic,  you are not obligated to talk to your family about these things, but i think it is important to let them know you need help. Leap and the net will appear.   I hear you. More than you know. I understand this deeply, from experience. this is what we call a geographic change. Changing your environment or surroundings as a solution to a problem.  Depression has a lot of factors, and I think it can be tricky. Personally, I would love to tell you to go for it, but I know from my own experience, changing my environment didn't change my mindset, my thinking process, my depression or anxiety.  Fresh starts are so appealing. Whatever decision you make, I support it. I support seeking happiness, just think it through.   What do you mean? More school, less work? Working out more than I do? There are so many factors.   I'm 23. I stopped taking my meds because they were making me aggressive and I started suffering from dizzy spells. I feel better now that I'm off, not AS anxious. They worked for me until I grew out of them I guess. I don't know. I think a lot of it is not being as active as I should in AA and the fellowship right now. I've done the steps, I've tried sponsoring, it's just being a young person in AA, it can be hard to find groups of people who take it seriously.  I'm just so tired of feeling this way.    I'll be the millionth AA/NA person to say how fucked up that is. Also, I've done that.   Ok more pls   Does anyone else get that fucked up feeling like your back is exposed? Like there is something there? Fuck me, man. ALL THE BLANKETS   Why even go there?   I hate that guy. So much.   I can't handle this   Oh man my brain can't handle this   Thank you! And yes, I've tried many, in therapy, rehabs, dual diagnosis facilities, all of em. I was the only thing stopping me from being happy.   I literally just posted something similar, and I'm beyond happy to see someone else feeling this too!    How about we stop the suicide train?    Yeah it was in good way! Better, just consistently sad in the back of my mind. Same old. You?   Hahahaha I'm a chick, But yeah, I feel. I just don't know what to do with feelingswhen I feel them.   Thank you!!  	17
 Ohio, USA. Grime all day.   It seems like most of the 50+ yard TD's were actually underthrown and really only caught because the WR beat the DB coverage pretty badly.   I could be being overly critical, but if your WR has a 5 yard lead on the DB, you should be able to hit him in stride on a 40 yard throw as a starting NFL quarterback.   Blink. Mek on Tide really isn't that great because he has a pretty trash mana pool.   The servers haven't functioned well for the past year and a half.    Yeah the servers are trash. Just got an hour ban for not connecting even though I finished a 60 minute game 5 minutes before queuing with zero issues. But as long as you keep giving Valve money for hats, why should they care about the quality of their servers? You rant and rave all day about how much Valve doesn't care about the quality of the game and only the money from cosmetics as you spend $10 on a set for a hero you barely play.  Idiots.   Just tried to join two games, unable to establish connection both times.   Unfortunately I cannot give gold for it, but I'd love to see an upvote gif made out of this.   All these comments and no mention of the MP5 from CoD4. Ah children.   I tried a game 30 minutes ago, was pinging over 500 the entire time when I'm usually sub 100.  Loading into one now, we'll see what happens.    That's still watching television, you fucking twit.  I don't own cable, directv, hulu, etc. If I want to watch a movie, I putlocker it. If I want to watch a TV series, I projectfreetv it.   I'm pretentious for wanting to watch programming on my own schedule when I'm available, and not paying money for what is essentially half advertising being shoved down my throat?  Okay.    but I have never earned anything in my life.  Well, maybe you should give it all away, start from scratch and accomplish something difficult and time-consuming that you've always wanted to work for. Then at the end of it, you can look at whatever that might be, smile, and say "I did this."  If not, the aspirin thing isn't even going to work. It's actually really difficult to commit suicide by way of the aspirin/acetaminophen type of drugs. IF it even works, it'll take a good 6-10 hours of you experiencing severe liver failure and vomiting. It's not a quick process.   Hitler   I'd collect every alcoholic beverage and nicotine product in the world, create a monopoly by making sure I'm the only one distributing them, and become the richest man in the world/automatic world leader.   Unmotivated, Suicidal, Alone  I just want it all to end, but can't bring myself to put the work in to fix my situation, nor just kill myself. And I don't really have anyone to talk to about it.   Told a cop he cock blocked me when he busted up this party we were throwing because of a noise complaint after he pulled me and a girl in our underwear out of a bedroom. I was hammered and in handcuffs in the front yard and basically yelled it at him. Then I asked another cop if I could hit the cigarette he was smoking.  No idea how I didn't end up in jail that night.   /r/blackpeopletwitter   I'm still not over the fact that my ex left me 8 months ago, I'm unemployed, completely broke, in massive amounts of debt, an alcoholic and possibly soon to be homeless.  And I have no idea where to begin fixing it.   He's not hard to play. But it takes a massive amount of skill to play him to his full potential.    Oh my god the little kid getting drilled in the face at 3:47.   Beautiful.   [KillSomeTime](http://www.killsometime.com/) used to be my go-to before I discovered reddit. Haven't been on here in years though.   As much as I agree with the rule, I've been 21 for 5 months and I'm not interested in anyone that can't come out to bars and drink with me.   In most of the United States the minimum age of consent for sex is 16. And in most of the ones that it is 17 or 18, there are stipulations that allow for "close in age" exceptions, that actually follow half your age + 7 pretty well.    I used to work at a casual restaurant for a bit right after high school, and a couple of my bros came in to chill at the bar before my shift ended.  This girl I knew who I shit you not could pass as a goddess came in to get some food. They know I was crushing on her pretty hard, and I got a bit nervous. When she came up to talk to me, after the hello's and whatnot I made the mother of all mistakes, especially with two of my friends right there.  *laughing about something* "So like, do you come here often?"  I just hear both of them burst out laughing for half a second and then try to conceal it, and the girl smiles as I'm trying to play it off and says she'd text me and left.  God I still haven't lived that one down.   When I started getting a social life and realized it wasn't common to have three generations in a 3 bedroom house.   Currently lying to ~15 members of my father's family about how I got a laceration on my hand the night before my sister's graduation party.  It's easier to tell a bunch of older folk that don't enjoy alcohol that I got it by dropping a glass table I was moving for my mother rather than I was up drinking for 10 hours and me and my best friend decided playing with knives would be fun.   If there is an audible change, the dj is using effects.  If there isn't, the dj is most likely setting up the song that will be mixed into the current one by getting it to the correct BPM, EQ'ing out frequencies, getting it to the part he needs to start the track at, etc.   One thing to keep in mind is that, at least in my experiences, a dj can throw on his headphones and play both tracks, but make it so only one plays through the speakers. This allows lots of tweaking and button pressing to a track that isn't being played over the speakers to get it necessary to be mixed and transitioned into.  Or in the cases of shitty dj's, the mix is pre recorded but the dj is still required to do something to hype the crowd instead of just standing there.   Because you absolutely have no idea how it works when you're mixing.    is a dj   everything is pre recorded  Then he's a pretty terrible one that won't go anywhere with it.    Don't Panic.   Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er... I dunno, "does what no other dildo can do until now", latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!   Probably Peruvians so I can play Dota 2 in peace.   In Monty Python Search for the Holy Grail, where Galahad goes into the castle full of women. I watched that movie maybe around age 11 and no idea what oral sex meant. At that time, I thought it was just talking about sex, and didn't know why it was so funny.  Watched it again when I was 18 or so, laughed my ass off.   The title is the only way I can describe the sound, just kind of like rushing air. I'm 21 and been able to do it for as long as I can remember, but I've never really been able to explain it to someone, and nobody else I've found has shared this "ability" I guess. The only way I've been able to explain it is that I guess I'm somehow flexing something in my inner ear, or increasing pressure somehow, and it generates the sound of whooshing air and people just look at me like I'm stupid. Also nobody else can hear it.  Thoughts?     [Antonio Brown strikes again](http://i.imgur.com/sGzPQKn.jpg)    You’d think the San Francisco TSA would have had experience with hung guys before, but I guess not.  My sides.   http://i.imgur.com/T4z6KaE.jpg  Taken last night when I changed my gauze. Potato quality, don't have the best phone camera.   QoP is really easy man.   Go mid, take 2 points in shadow strike and 1 in blink at 3, then 2 in scream. Get Null and Tangos, and use Q+auto attacks to harass the enemy mid. Unless they're full health you should be able to kill them with a full combo and some auto attacks at 6. There are only a few heroes that can actually take that kind of harass, and her high damage should make cs'ing easy enough. Gank a side lane if you get a good rune.  After the laning stage I like to rush Aghs. There is a lot of fighting in this patch, and having a 40 second cd 450 nuke at level 11 is massive, especially because that's before BKBs and you should be able to land your scream for another bunch of damage.   After that I'd usually go Scythe or BKB depending on which I needed first, and then Octarine is sick on her as well.   Remember: she may be squishy, but her auto attacks definitely do some decent damage.    It looks like it destroys the stopping mechanism too? I guess you'd have to buy a completely new saw. Which is still better than losing a finger though.   Yes sir. So all was not in ~~vein~~ vain.   I think it was a firecracker, maybe a M80. A couple of those in succession and being in a pretty ghetto part of town, I can understand it.   Well herpes isn't transmitted through blood, and that's the only fluid we shared. So I'm ruling it out.   A cold sore popped up on my lip today. Could be a coincidence or from one of the girls I hooked up with recently, but I'm not positive.   Most definitely. I'll forever have a wicked scar now to prove it.   Happened last night. So my best friend lives in Denmark, I live in the US. We are both hardcore drinkers, and he is back for a visit. We got all of our best friends together for a raging party at their house with lots of alcohol and some fireworks.  It's probably around 3 AM. After an uncountable number of beers and rum and cokes, we decide it would be a good idea to becoming blood brothers, to solidify the best friendship. We went about that by taking a knife, putting a small slit in our hands, and doing our handshake. Well, he goes to cut my hand and slices a ~~8~~ 3 or 4 inch gash into the side of my hand because alcohol. Uncontrollable bleeding, it's all over the floor, you get the picture.   20 minutes later, 6 cop cars show up outside. Apparently they were called because a neighbor mistook the fireworks for gunshots. Well, they looked inside and saw the blood, and immediately busted into the house with guns drawn putting everyone in handcuffs.  We were eventually able to talk our way out of the situation and nobody got arrested, but for a minute it was looking like we were going to be taken to jail for attempted murder. They bring paramedics, I end up going to the hospital to get 8 stitches in my hand. Worth it?  **TL;DR: Got really drunk, shot off fireworks, tried to become blood brothers with my best friend, cut way too deep, I bled everywhere, cops mistook fireworks for gunfire, busted in and almost arrested us all for attempted murder because there was blood everywhere, ended up with 8 stitches in my hand.**  **Very late edit: I confused the size of the gash with the number of stitches when typing this, it's a 3 or 4 inch gash that required 8 stitches**  **Double edit: [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/T4z6KaE.jpg) a quick picture I snapped of it last night when I changed my gauze.**    Puck. When I was first learning, I never even attempted the hero because I could already tell I didn't have the skills to pull off his combos correctly.  One day decided I was going to make a smurf account when I considered myself more than adequately skilled and starting trying out Puck. I Instantly loved it. There's just something about being so slippery in team fights that gets me right (relevant Weaver flair).   It's just a flesh wound!   Uh, no. There's a difference between "you're small and weak, that's why you're vulnerable" and "this is how you protect yourself if someone makes an attempt to rob/rape you".  Everyone should know basic self defense techniques, regardless of size or gender.   I agree. The problem with this in schools is the zero tolerance violence policies. It's completely stupid.   Look at it like this. If a kid confronts you in the bathroom and threatens to beat you up for your phone or lunch money, the school teaches you to lay down like a little bitch, let yourself get beat up and robbed and tell a teacher afterwards. Yeah, the kid might get punished later, but look at it in a real world situation. If you're being mugged, are you going to just let yourself get robbed for your wallet and then tell a police officer afterwards? That'll do nothing. It's far better to teach children how to defend themselves, so that later on in life they can protect themselves against potential robbers.  My dad taught me how to fight when I was growing up. I got robbed at gunpoint by someone smaller than me about a year ago. I broke his arm, kicked the gun away, beat the living hell out of him, and robbed him back. Got around $400 out of his pocket, so I'm assuming he'd been making rounds around the dark parts of my neighborhood all night. I guarantee that person will think twice about robbing people from now on.   Watch videos on youtube of very high mmr ES players and try to replicate what they do in bot games. I avoided ES like the plague until I saw I think a Jerax video of him playing it (could be wrong, it's been a bit) and decided to try it out because I was bored.  Took me 4 bot games to get the combinations down, went into ranked and won 2 games in a row at 3k. He's not super hard. Although this was before his 6.84 nerfs.      The only difference between ranked and unranked is that ranked shows your number and people generally try harder to win than just playing for fun. Your MMR will increase/decrease by around 25 for every win/loss.   My advice in ranked? Only play heroes you are good at. Ranked isn't the place, usually, to experiment with new heroes or new builds. Having just reached level 13, I can guarantee you're not actually good at any heroes yet, but pick the ones you normally do best with. When you pick a hero you know in and out, you are able to focus more on map awareness, game situations, priority targets in teamfights, etc. That's how you improve.    Darqueze Dennard hardly played last year, but when he did I saw some great talent coming from him.  The only problem is the Bengals are still riding the dick of Terrance Oldman who can only reliably play the first half of a game, instead of letting Dennard get experience.   This isn't dubstep, and is also quite terrible.    People on the lawn can be seen playing cards, scrabble, doing crossword puzzles or **sometimes playing cornhole**.  This needs to be rephrased.       What we ~~we're~~ were   i cabn foinal;ly d5r4ink alchol.  n this st8ujpid cuntr54y    people don't take us seriously as a contender because we can't beat the patriots.  I think it's more of the fact that you're in the easiest division in the league. The Texans are your only threat, but you're pretty much guaranteed a playoff spot every year.  If I'm correct, I think the Colts have been in the playoffs every year except 1 for the last 15 seasons.   And comparable to Dan Marino too I believe.   Go to skyline. Get a 5 way wrapped in a tortilla. Best thing ever.   NIP/NAVI take 1/2.   I'm sure you could go back into 6.83 and find an overwhelming amount of games where players made poor item decisions and played stupidly.  Stupid/bad players will always be stupid/bad regardless of what a patch did to the game.   FIRST   TIL Tobi, 2GD, Sunsfan and Sheever are all older than Draskyl.   Now if your team doesn't have any real disables and you're facing something like a storm or AM yeah the early orchid or hex is probably more viable. But if you've got good disablers holy hell it's a fun build.   What I've noticed is that since early pushing is somewhat back into the meta, especially with the rise of Undying, Leshrac and Death Prophet, you're going to be a ton more beneficial to your team by hitting that gigantic AoE ultimate every 40 seconds than say an Orchid or early Hex that focuses more on single target pick offs.   You don't really need an Orchid if your E/R drops multiple heroes by 700 health (most likely over half of their health pool pre 20 minutes even on carries) in a half second, and the buildup of Aghs is easier than Hex.   If you haven't played QoP yet this patch, I'd definitely recommend trying her out. My build is Null/TangosBottleTreadsAghsBKB/Octarine (BKB if I need to fight now, Octarine if there isn't as much disable and I can get away with it, then into BKB)Shivas/Hex.  A 15-20 minute Aghs on her is retardedly strong, and Octarine means you lifesteal 25% per hero hit, so a 3-4 man Sonic heals you for close to 450-600 even through BKB on a 30 second CD. I think I've gone 8-2 on her in the past two days, would've been 9-1 if our fucking FV didn't super throw the last game I played.   This is one of the best shitposts I've seen in a while.    I'd get very comfortable with 3 heroes per role. That's 15 you could potentially choose from in a game. You can still spam single heroes, but like other people have said, if somebody picks it first or picks a hard counter then you're shit out of luck. Having a wider hero pool will allow you to still be able to play the game, and also making you an all around better player by being able to perform every role in any situation.  My go to heroes per role are PA, QoP, Centaur, Mirana, Dazzle. You don't really need to worry about which heroes are the strongest, just whichever you're best at, in my opinion. Back in 6.83 people said PA wasn't anything against a Troll, but since PA is the safe lane carry I'm best at, I still shit on most of them that I encountered.   I saw the little armadillo running around for the first time and had no clue what it was. I eventually clicked on their heroes to inspect and saw it was a cosmetic, and then got stunned and died.  Volvo plz   A tempo controller is a hero that wins 1v1 fights and can create a lot of pressure around the map. The examples I listed are all heroes that can easily punish an out of position support or core whenever they want. By doing that solo pickoff, you can then translate the 5v4 advantage into pushing a tower, winning a team fight, or taking Roshan.   Basically, in higher MMR brackets a tempo controller being hidden off the map means the enemy team should be scared of where they are because they can be solo killed. In a MMR tier such as 750, I don't think the people even know what the mini map is, so you can use this to consistently roam around the map picking off their heroes, keeping the pressure up, and giving your team the advantage.  Tempo controllers are NOT heroes like Medusa or Spectre that require a lot of time and farm to come online and have less solo kill potential, or supports like Omniknight or Dazzle that are more geared towards 5v5 teamfights to be the most effective.  If you prefer support, Lion and Lina are great at this because their high amounts of magic burst is great for solo'ing heroes as well.   I'm actually considering trying out the new Solar Crest on him. The buildup is pretty easy and the evasion is good for when you aren't using the active. Maybe BKB into Skadi afterwards.   Happened to me a bit last game but only before 10 minutes. Fixed itself after that.    I personally prefer playing him as support. Lightning Storm is retardedly good in lane and any setup slow or stun is an easy kill.   I'm 3k and I haven't had any problems with Ursa or Undying. They've been in a few games but we've been able to handle them.   Not looking forward to the return of Death Prophet. Fuck that hero.  I've been shitstomping with QoP so far this patch. AghsOctarineBKB is ridiculously strong.    and he's not a support that buys wards or couriers.  Well, in their defense, Leshrac is usually more viable as a core.    What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.   If I ever have to play support, I play one with high amounts of annoyance for the other team. Mirana and Disruptor are the two that come to mind first. Random arrows and TP glimpses help lighten the mood when your 4 hard carries are bitching about wards for 20 minutes.   If you can convince a support to help pressure the SF early it'll go better for you, but SF will have the advantage once he hits level five.    In the test patch,  Is that possible in the main client or did it get patched?   Synd and Tobi    iG .. if you put them T1 , you should look at their recent performance , re-evaluate   Losing a few games doesn't drop you from T1 status. IG has been one of the dominant teams in Dota for years.    Leshrac, Zeus, Undying    people who get paid to calibrate accounts.  So the player can drop like a rock after they lose every game because they're truly a 2k player calibrated at 4k.    Maybe you're not aware of how TBD works? If you're a 4k player, you're not going to get someone who is 1K TBD in your game. Their hidden MMR is equal to yours, they're just in the calibration stage which means their game results are taken with a greater level of uncertainty.  For example, if you already calibrated and you destroy a game, you get +25 for a win. If they're TBD and they destroy a game, they might get +100 hidden for a win.    The Indianapolis Jones one kills me every time.    I got called a retard earlier for suggesting our 5th pick support should be something with lockdown for the enemy Storm Spirit rather than an Undying.  I hate people.   I feel like it will be best on initiators and tanky front liners. Similar to a Blade Mail, where they go in first and pop it, forcing the enemy team to either ignore them or have their spells reflected. This hesitation could buy your team the 2-3 seconds they need to get into position and take an early advantage in the team fight.   One downside is I'm feeling the return of the "DP insta pick ggpush" pub meta.   I'm loving the changes to the comeback mechanic though.   Question.  I'm assuming the ultimate would still mean multiple UAMs could not stack?    Get you TO 3k. Not really any farther than that.   5 cs per minute on a consistent basis is enough to get you to 3k.     I usually play quite well but then my team just plays awful.  Mate, you're well below the average skill of a player for this game. You probably play just as poorly.  At that MMR, any hero can destroy if you're more skilled than your opponents. The issue isn't the hero you're picking, the issue is that you aren't better than them.   The easiest way to win, regardless of hero, is to outfarm them. Focus on getting 5 cs per minute throughout the game on any carry, don't take stupid fights or make stupid decisions, and watch your MMR rise by a thousand.    This is why I only try to play Dota overnight. Less children are online at 3 AM.    It's so annoying when an easy fight turns into a disaster because I accidentally disarm my carry. Valve please!  Try not sucking. It's not Valve's problem that you make mistakes.   You want a specific report for essentially not trying?  No thanks.   That would be insanely overpowered but I like the idea of the non-killable aspect. It techincally is a skill shot to hit because it isn't unit targetable, so making it last the entire duration barring a purge would make him much more viable in team fights as opposed to the almost purely single target damage hero he is now.    i'm not even sure if he's not slightly OP in competitive.  His biggest strength in competitive is the vision from his ultimate. He's still extremely easy to kill if you target him. He has great magic burst, but his entire arsenal is countered by a BKB.   If you take away the mini stun, I feel like it's a nerf he doesn't actually need.   Lina, QoP, Axe, Io, Tiny is my guess.   Technically it reduces 1 armor per attack, which if maxed occurs every .95 (if that's correct) seconds. I guess that isn't terrible, considering it takes 4 hero attacks to kill it, which leaves you 5-6 of the bug on the target if they immediately start attacking it, resulting in a 5-7 armor reduction.   I'd need some time to do the math, but since it doesn't scale, I'm pretty sure maxing Geminate does more damage over that time period than maxing Swarm. You'll get a geminate attack every 3 seconds if it's maxed.   I think his biggest problem is stat gains.    He doesn't really need mana regen. If you're safe lane, you shouldn't need to W for last hits, plus the buff to E makes last hitting easier in general. If you do need to W often, tread switching beforehand should be fine.  Even if you did, the Aquila is more than enough to sustain you until you get your Skadi, which should come sub 20.  Also, at least in my opinion, you need the Skadi as soon as possible  because his STR/AGI gains are abysmal compared to other Agi carries. The maelstrom would just delay that further, yeah it's a nice farming tool, but again the problem is that your team needs to be ahead for that to work out. If you're behind, there's no way you could afford to get it because Weaver isn't even that great late game compared to other Agi carries.   Weaver is my favorite hero. But ever since 6.83 he's been shit to play. He can't flash farm, he can't rotate to jungle early unless you buy a MoM/HotD (something I actually haven't tried yet), he takes forever to come online, he is bad at base defense, his solo pick off potential isn't really much to write home about against anyone other than squishy supports and his late game isn't even that great.   I was really hoping to see a strength gain increase in 6.84, but the only thing they did that benefited him was slightly buffing Geminate. His Aghs isn't good if you're playing him safelane carry, and The Swarm isn't worth more than a value point as opposed to stats, which he desperately needs because if you do manage to lock him down, he's still squishy as shit.  The build I ran in 6.83 and am continuing in 6.84 for safe lane is AquilaTreads then immediately rush a Skadi. After Skadi I go either BKB or Butterfly depending on the game situation. Rushing Linken's delays your damage items too much in this meta. Lotus Orb is kind of cool but only if you're against a team with multiple single target disables.   It seems like the only way to play Weaver currently is to make sure the other 4 people on your team can secure you an advantage while you take forever to farm your items, because if you're losing, a Weaver definitely isn't the ideal carry to rely on to bring you back.  Thoughts?   Don't know the exact psychology, but carries are the ones that get all the big flashy items. Carries are the ones that see their names pop up on the screen for Triple Kills and Godlike Streaks. Carries, in most MMR tiers, are generally seen as "in charge" and the team leader. Carries usually do the most damage and control the game.   Supports get commanded to buy wards all game and get reported for feeding when you go 2-10-25.  Which would you rather play?   so what could be the reason so many people under 4k hate playing it?  Because people under 4k are stupid, think they're the best on their team automatically, and think that if the game isn't theirs to control, everyone else will shit the bed and lose. Then when they don't properly carry, they blame the supports.  TL;DR: People are stupid.   Speed 55, Decel 50, DPI is whatever the default is.   You're not supposed to cast Unrefined Fireblast at the start of the fight. The Unrefined Fireblast is only supposed to be used in an absolute "Oh shit I need a stun NOW" situation, or when you're at lower levels of mana because the cost drastically reduces based on your current mana.  Honestly, the Aghs isn't really worth it. Get a Eul's+Force Staff for a bit more cost and you'll usually have a much higher impact.   since the Aghanims change.  What are you referring to? Unless I missed something, his Aghs upgrade has been untouched for a long time.    its a really hard game to get in to because of the learning curve.  It's a really hard game to get GOOD at because of the learning curve. I had zero MOBA experience when I started playing Dota 2, but I was hooked instantly. You need to accept the fact that you're going to suck for a while. If that turns you off, then Dota isn't for you. However, you're going to be in games because of matchmaking with players who are usually equally as terrible, so in theory it should balance out, and you'll have the occasional games where you do really well in comparison to the nine other players in the lobby.    i was playing life stealer   i soloed a 4k health pudge in literally 1,5 sec  Lifestealer's Feast deals 7% of their current HP as damage at max level. At full health, that will do ~280 damage to a Pudge ON TOP OF your auto attack damage. ~260 on the next attack, ~240 on the attack after, etc. Pudge also has shit armor, and doesn't usually build items that grant him any additional armor, meaning physical attacks are barely mitigated.   Lifestealer destroys heroes with high HP pools and low armor regardless of a Moon Shard. It's working as intended.    The learning curve is extremely steep. If you have zero MOBA experience, it'll take you over a thousand game hours before you have anywhere near a grasp of what you're supposed to be doing in given situations, and another thousand before you're considered above average, assuming you keep improving over that time period.  My recommendation would be to read multiple beginner's guides when you're first starting to play. Play the "Limited Heroes" pool of heroes, as these are a grouping of heroes that are relatively low skill cap and friendlier for beginning players. Choose between three different heroes for every game. This allows you to learn a specific hero's skills and interactions easily, and allowing for more focus on in-game mechanics, map awareness and situational decisions rather than trying to focus on learning a new hero each game.   You're going to be terrible for a long time. There's no denying it, and the only way to improve is to keep playing. Dota isn't a game you can pick up and be good within a week of playing it. Every "I probably shouldn't have done that" moment is a learning experience. You will make tons of mistakes. You will die tons of times. If this discourages you, Dota is not the game for you. There isn't some magical recipe to suddenly being godly. The only way to improve is to keep playing, keep reading guides, and keep learning the game.    Ignore everyone saying you need to rush Linken's on Weaver. You don't. At all.   What I've found to be the best build is Aquila, Treads, then rush a Skadi. Weaver can't flash farm and he desperately needs the stats early on if he plans to compete at all with the hyperfast farming carries (Troll, Jug, Sniper) of 6.83. I max W/E and take 1 in Q, skill the rest in stats and take ult 6/11/16. After Skadi go Butterfly if you feel like you can still farm effectively, or BKB beforehand if you need to enter fights. After that it's pretty much up to you. MKB/Daedalus would be my recommendation.  Also this is for safe lane Weaver and will probably carry over into 6.84 without much change, although a Lotus Orb could be pretty nice in there somewhere.   Lina  Necro  Tiny  Centaur  Meepo  Treant  Doom  Chen  Windranger  Razor  In no order.    If you're gonig to be harrased, always get a stout shield and consider PMS as an upgrade.  It depends on the type of harassment. If the harassment is coming from physical attacks, then yes stout/RoP/PMS is the way to go. However, if you're going to be taking mostly magical damage (from spells) it's better to forgo those items for extra regen instead.   I saw a video where he placed Stone behind enemy, pulled, kicked back, rolled in, ulted. It's how I was practicing in bot games to learn the hero. Tried it out in a 3k game and it worked a bit, unfortunately our Troll and Sniper were god awful and even though I got some solo kills and counter ganked pretty well we ended up losing pretty hard.  Is that combo good or bad?   Probably a couple weeks ago when I was solo'ing the second Rosh as Troll while the rest of my team was fighting 4v5 mid lane. I was so focused on getting to the fight as soon as possible to shift the fight in our favor as a Troll with two lives that as soon as Rosh died I Phase Boots'd my hardest to get there, ran in like Rambo and unleashed everything I had.  Unfortunately, it was at that point that I died. And died, as I realized after computing for a few seconds why I wasn't respawning with Aegis, without ever actually picking up the Aegis from Roshan's lifeless corpse.  Derp.   A pinch over 200,000 people on this subreddit.  Almost 11,000,000 unique players in the game this past month.  I guarantee I could pull this off in over 95% of my 3k pubs.   I just learned how to play him too :(   Blink Dagger will now become more core than Force Staff on OD. I've mentioned this before, but this patch essentially solidifies it.  Think about it. Blink+Aghs. There's three heroes clumped up, blink right in, aghs ult them, imprison them, allow the rest of your team to get into position, and then wreck them. Perfect setup for a vacuum+wall, ravage, supernova, chronosphere, axe call, etc.    4x = 0 cooldown for long cooldown ultimates.  I don't think it would work like that. If you had a 100 second cooldown, the first Orb would take 25% of that away. Now you're at 75 seconds. I believe the next Orb would take 25% of the reduced cooldown away (25% off of 75 seconds, not 100) leaving you at 56.25 seconds. Another 2 orbs would leave you around 31 seconds cooldown.   Buff Weaver strength gain kthxbai   Someone else is playing on his account.   Sorry bad english  Where you when Sniper is kill  Icefrog plz nerf now  	120

I know it is standard for qualified nurses but it takes a bit of getting used to      Hi folks, I am a 19 year old male student nurse and I've completed my first of four years as a nursing student. Here in Ireland I'm qualified to work as a healthcare assistant, and I'm starting a summer job as one in a local nursing/care home. Is there any advice you can give to me as a young and relatively inexperienced carer, that would benefit me and the other staff there. I'm really looking for tips that will help me integrate with the rest of the care and nursing staff and prove that I'm competent and useful. I'm confident in my clinical skills and bedside manner. I want the other nurses to react well to me, and not think something like 'Oh no, im on the same shift as him, looks like extra work for me' or 'he knows nothing'  I'm also quite aware that the rest of the staff will be older than me, and I'm anxious that perhaps they will not take to me as kindly as someone who would have a lot more experience.  As you can tell I am quite nervous about starting. In my previous roles on placement as a student I've performed very well at the point of care and proved myself as an interested learner with good skills. Now as I shift from a student to the working world, I want to know what should the new guy look out for, and what to and not to do.   TL;DR Student just got a summer job as a healthcare assistant, how can I be effective.

We love our irish cider.   Safe. Was in fact just cheap, gone off cider. As far as we know, safe   So after my sister threw a house party for her 21st birthday; I come home the day after to find that a 2 litre bottle of cheap cider still had half its contents. Satisfied with the prospect of some free alcohol, I decided to put away my prize for staying out of the house.   Tonight I decided to get buzzed watching TV and retrieved the bottle of cider from the press. I sipped through two pints of the cider, finishing the bottle, and had some fun watching Drifters and The Big Bang Theory in the process. My dad came in mid way through my second pint and asked my what I was drinking. Surprised with my reply, my dad said to me "I seen that too but I didn't touch it, Would you not think of how every other drink in the house is gone except that plastic bottle of cider? I thought someone pissed in it"  Horror struck. I sat upright, eyes darting around the room. I noticed how the cider was semi-flat. The salty taste on my lips. The lighter-than-usual colour. It couldn't be.   Immediately I texted my sister with my concerns. No reply. My sister is currently driving home from college for the weekend. She will home in about half an hour. Reddit this is happening right now. The salty taste on my lips worries me more and more.  The answer, paranoia or piss, will soon arrive in my driveway.  TLDR: Found some strange tasting cider after a party, Currently waiting for my sister to get home to tell me if someone pissed in it.  EDIT: Yes I live with my parents, I'm 18 in my first year of college. The legal age for drinking is 18 here. 21 is still celebrated for some reason.   wow   I really enjoyed this post, That's a great, unique and engaging hobby OP   It's actually hard to tell whether we're looking at the front or rear in this pic   It's not a scratch on sheriff street though, also op bring a knife  *knives, FTFY     Not to mention Rathkeale   Hey what county are you staying in?  	108

Children and family are the only people I don't swear around (outside of a professional setting)   Having someone else tell me I have a chance is wonderful. And of course I plan on wooing her. It would be foolish of me not to   It could be true, but I refuse to believe it. I would have to be the same...or brainwashed to be compelled to like her then.    This is true. That, and I'm assuming she's like me, not big on jumping on the relationship boat   I had leftover credit from my app store, and your comment was reassuring.    Thanks for the vote of confidence   But...she's 23   I don't think 23 qualifies as teenager though   I will. Just you know, not aggressively    You think so? I'm not 100% sure but the only things that are 100% sure in life are that we will pay taxes, and George Washington was the only unanimous choice for President   It's such a weird way of wording it though    I honestly believe I do.    Of course. I have enough past mistakes to know when something coming up is about to be wrong on my part    I have a shot?    That could be it. I'm thinking positive on this one   And that double negative weirded me out    I'm with /u/RulerOfSlides on this one   Well, I told her what I've been dealing with lately, and she said that it's almost fascinating that I can seem so level around her, and in general. Anyway, I apologize for being so distant and not making that extra effort to charm her. That goes over well; and I ask her if she really likes me (insecurity on 100 right here) and she tells me that she doesn't not like me. Idk how to feel about that.   Likewise, if a rep tells me they don't need an e-mail, then they are looking for another source of info   That is wonderful. I'm sure mine would do the same, but I haven't seen any evidence of it in the last 7 years...minimum   I wish I had that reassurance from my dad. We have no common interests, but I wish he would tell me he cared, without being forced to do so   At least yours tries to give you direction. Anymore, my dad and I only exchange the small talk you would see between two people forced to be in the same elevator together   Mine has been around physically, but it only seems like he is around to Harp on the slightest thing I've done wrong, never offers any positive encouragement, and blatantly favors my brother in every facet of life   I posted over in /r/depression with all the details about my situation, but I had a separate question. What's it like to have a loving, supporting father?   I'm not suicidal (anymore)    And I'm able to get myself out of bed on a consistent basis for things other than work.   I just wish I had 2 parents who cared about me and wanted me to happy and prosper in life.    He's not off the cheeseburgers, lookin like that.

Blue state vs red state differences    Reading is my Xanax for when Xanax isn't available. And I'm reasonably good at making first impressions so I should be ok.    That's because it is medically legal in Illinois, as far as I know   I was told that it was more than likely going to be worked down to a littering charge, which would be a moderate fine and some community service   I'm thinking it will be fine. I'm only 21. Just some fines and shit to pay   It was what the state trooper and CO I talked to told me. I'm just a little worried because I've never been in legal trouble before. Not even a speeding ticket   That's funny, but no one around had a sense of humor   I am 21. I was forward with the officer, told him what he would find when he searched the vehicle, and admitted what I had was mine.   Yeah. Idk if Narcan is even legal as well    If I'm caught with anything in the next 5 years, it's an instant felony with jail time, so I'm going to be overcautious   Thank you very much. They got me a quick court date, so I'm thinking they have more important cases...or its a decently quick court system in Indiana   He probably didn't bother with reading my rights because the most talking I did was small talk on the way to booking.   That is interesting   I'll just see how everything falls into place tomorrow.    I've talked to a few people who have been in my shoes in this state. They said that I could get the charges pled down to just a fine and either community service or rehab   This is why I'm seeing a lawyer   Well that would be insanely fucked. Then I probably would find my way into a jail   What did they get you for, and what kind of punishment are you looking at, if you don't mind me asking?   I was thinking Miranda v Arizona but I don't know if that will apply here   Uh it's literally a Supreme Court precedent. Miranda v Arizona   You're telling me. At least I have drinking. I can legally do that   Probably not, but I don't plan on being back in there in any capacity, so I honestly don't care about that.

I figured he would either take it himself to smoke, or throw it out.    I'll still ask either way, but I don't expect it to change a thing    What state is that? Because mine is going to likely be fines. They could press for jail time, but I have no priors, I cooperated with everything, I'm in college and have an almost full time job.    Not set up. Just the CO started telling me about people who went down the wrong path in life while I was changing into my jail clothes. And the other guy just happened to be in the same holding cell as me...they said he was arrested about 25 times in his life.    Talking to my lawyer tomorrow about it, hoping everything goes well when court rolls around. Sending good vibes your way!   My dad called me a drug lord. The CO and I had a heart to heart, and I had a long talk with a habitual offender.  	108
 Your name says it all.   This subreddit is basicly c9 territory.    Yea you're right ofcourse but it just seems impossible to go. I mean i have 2 hours left until my bus leaves, basicly pulled an allnighter and my mom is also awake already telling me she will chop my head off if i don't go because she doesn't have enough money to pull me through all of this, which is true. Yet i'm convinced that i won't go. I really don't think i have the potential to be honest because right now im just acting like a self-destructive child who is also a big burden to his mom and whole family. Maybe i'm just still too egoistical... And i might not even care...fuck   Yea i know these random bursts of motivation just too well. However i don't really know how to use them yet. Sometimes i feel this motivation is only in my head and i somehow lack the physical energy to do something with it. But then again the lack of physical energy might also just be something that is not real and my brain just makes it up as an excuse so that i can be lazy and don't have to worry. But the fuck do i know, i'm by no means in a healthy psychological condition to judge myself correctly.   Also best of luck to you. Hope you get that job.   I've not been watching the NA LCS but i always check the post match threads, and it seems like Gravity is storming through NA right now. Anybody who follows the scene closely is willing to tell me how they compare to Fnatic and some of the stronger LCK/LPL teams?   Common hype is fun. Let us dream a bit. :)   Fnatic are still a good team though and probably will perform decently at worlds, which is all that OP said. They obviously have extremely slim chances to win the whole thing with the top korean and chinese teams attending, and no one with a brain thinks otherwise.   I think you simply don't understand that kind of humor then. Have you ever watched an cabaret artist? They use insults, stereotypes and hypocrisy as jokes and people seem to get it. Saint has always been like this and it's very obviously just his kind of humor. I mean i'm from germany and also have some slight form of nationalism (aka german beer and cars are the best) but i still could grin about both statements saint made.  	8
 Depression sucks, and I'm really sorry you have to go through this. My first suicide attempts were when I was 12 years old. Luckily, I was sent into treatment, and I find a new love for life. It's been hard ever since because this new found love was mostly stemmed in finding people who not only related to me but actually cared. Since then, I haven't been able to make any strong relationships where I felt like I was truly cared for. But, if you can find a strong support system of friends or family, it can be life changing. But you have to remember that if you've had friends/family in the past who were not supportive of you, they will not change. I know that can be hard to hear, but you absolutely have to try to find people who will allow you to love life.  But like I said, I haven't found a good support system. I guess what keeps me going is a belief that I have a purpose. I think there is a reason I am here on Earth, and I have to do my best to see that through. I also know that life is a rollercoaster, and bad days mean that good ones must follow. I learned when I tried to kill myself that the only permanent thing in life is death. All problems can be solved in some way or another. You just need time.  Sorry if this was kind of rambly. I hope you feel better soon.   I just want to start this with saying that I really don't even know what to write. Just thinking about this makes me feel... weird. Like I don't know how to feel about it. Like, I'm happy, but confused, I don't know. So if this sounds kind of rambly, it is. Sorry.  Anyway, I guess I'll start here; I've been going through a sort of rough patch lately. I'm about to start my senior year of high school and will soon be auditioning for collegiate musical theatre programs, and I'm fucking terrified. That plus just a general feeling of self doubt, family issues, angst, etc. has got me feeling just down. Some times I feel great while other times I break into tears because I don't like who I am.  What's really been upsetting me about all this is that no one has really noticed. I feel like I've gotten too good about masking my feelings and hiding my depression that no one can see that I feel like I'm drowning. I've literally found ways to cry in front of people without them even noticing. Even my therapist basically sent me home because I seemed fine.  But today was different. I was at a voice lesson, and my teacher sat down and asked me if I'd been scared the last few weeks. I was nothing short of shocked. I've been waiting for someone to notice something was up, and it finally happened. And it wasn't my parents, my friends, or my therapist. It was my teacher (who I must say, is probably the nicest guy in the world).  So we talked for a while, and he said a lot of really encouraging things, and I'm very grateful for that and for him. But, I have to say, I guess I'm still just shocked. People tell me *all* the time how confident I am and all that while I cry myself to sleep because I don't think I'm good enough. I've actually opened up to people about how much I doubt myself and they straight up told me that I'm confident. But, suddenly, someone finally saw me. He saw that I was struggling and that I'm not confident and that I'm fucking human. I just don't know what to say other than that. Like I said, I'm in shock. I wonder what I said or did differently in front of him that made him notice, but I also wonder if he's just the only one who cared enough to see the difference.  I guess that's all I really have to say. I'm still just baffled. I wish it wasn't so shocking for someone to really care about me, but damn it is. Feel free to leave your thoughts below. Thanks for reading this monster of a post.   All I have to say is: on fleek.   Yeah, I'll think about that. Thanks again.   Exactly. I just feel like I'm dreading something, but I have no idea what it is. Thanks for posting.   Oh God yes, I have absolutely had this. Waking up is a nightmare when I have this running through my head. Sometimes I would think of what I needed to click to get up (The Sims) or other times I was just constantly adding numbers together from the time I went to bed until I got out of bed the next morning (2048). I cannot explain how mind boggling that was.   Like /u/ThaGivingTree said, you really can only know if a professional tells you so. For the short term though, depression (to me, at least) feels like you're trapped in a pit and no one can see that you're dying. If that resonates with you, definitely go seek some counseling. And if not, counseling wouldn't hurt anyway.   I'm sorry. I know how you feel. But I must say, you are the most dashing penguin I've ever met.  I wish I had something better to say, but honestly, I don't know how to combat it either. It fucking sucks, and it's only worse when you're around people who simply do not understand. I'm so sorry. I wish it was easier.   I'm sure you've given it away already, but I thought I'd put my name in anyway. In any event, thank you for being you. That is such an amazing way to use a subreddit. You seem like a great person. Just reading this totally made my day.   That is such a happy accident! So happy for you. Good luck on this new journey. I'm glad you're alive.   I have Naked 1 and I love it so much. It's practically the only palette I use anymore. That being said, I've never had Naked 2, but I still wouldn't trade mine for the world.   IT'S SO PRETTY!   What the fuck is this?   I don't see how this is relevant to this subreddit.   Just in case you didn't see, he did survive. The onsite medic pinched the artery, and the player received over 300 stitches.   Huh, that's interesting. Thanks!   I can honestly say it's one of the best things you can do for your child. My parents did not do a particularly good job of teaching me Catholic teachings or morality, but they did send me to a wonderful school. I am beyond grateful that they did that for me.   Where do you live, if you don't mind me asking? I would think the difference in reactions would be a result of difference in cultures.   Yeah, it looks like Kat Von D might be my winner. Outlaw looks *perfect!* Thanks for the input!   For sure. Thanks!   I've only heard of lipcote being just alright, but honestly for the price it's worth a shot. Plus if I add it with a color that stays anyway, maybe I'll be better off. Thanks!   Wow, thanks! I'll give it a go for sure!   Wow that sucks. Glad to hear they're doing okay. I'll check it out!   Thanks!   Thank you so much! I'll definitely be checking those out.   Ow.   Hey there!  I am preparing my look for a musical I will be in soon, and I'm on the look out for a really solid lipstick/stain. Because I will be on stage, I need a very bright red. I also have an onstage kiss, so I'm searching for a product that will absolutely stay on my face and not his.  If you know of a good product, please let me know! Thanks so much. xoxo   THANK YOU FOR THIS   http://www.local10.com/news/courtroom-school-reunion-between-judge-suspect/33963678   *points at username*  go for it.   You better do something nice for your mom.   I like you.   OP said he grew 2-3 inches.      Let them know you genuinely want to get to know them. Chances are they won't give a shit about the curriculum, but if their teacher likes them, they'll be 10x more likely to have some interest in at least impressing you.   I don't like Piper as a person, but her character development has been so fun to watch. It pains me to watch her create so much pain for herself and others, but I think she's just developing into who she always was deep down. I think she's just a manipulative person who will do what it takes to "survive" (really just get what she wants and find temporary happiness). Whether or not she'll ever be able to become a decent human being who can function normally in the real world is hard to say. I'd say probably not. That's probably the last thing on her mind, though.   I think the writers tried to show that he'd been considering it, but he found it best not to really let her in on the fact that he was considering it. I mean, he literally tells her while walking out the door. He didn't want to face her reaction and risk changing his mind.   FUCK!   Thanks for the tip! And, to be fair, those pictures were actually taken before I dyed my hair, so it actually is a little bit darker than pictured. Sorry I failed to mention that!   Thank you so much.   Thanks for the input!   I've wanted a change for a few months now.   Thank you.   Thanks so much for sharing. Because I saw her when I was younger, I now feel like I need to make it seem like everythings okay now. I am kind of afraid to tell my mom that I want a new therapist though. She doesn't even really know why I'm going so telling her that I need to see someone new because I'm too afraid to open up seems scary, I guess. Thanks again.   There's nothing ugly about you. Big, beautiful eyes, strong cheekbones, lovely chin, amazing smile. I could go on, but I think that suffices. Very pretty.   Absolutely not. Like no no no no no. You're very pretty. I have no doubt.   Yeah I completely relate with that. I hate myself, I think I'm horrible at everything, and the world would be a better place without me but people are constantly telling me how confident I am. Even when I tell people I'm terrified of anything and everything, they don't really seem to believe me. I've cried in front of people without them even noticing. It's so damn hard, and I'm sorry you have to go through it.   I started going to therapy again recently. We talk about my relationship with my family and everything that I used to, but something is different. I think I've become too aware of what is wrong with me and what is bothering me that I'm covering it up too well. My problem is that I hate myself a lot of the time. I think I'm not good at anything and everyone would be better off if I wasn't around. I'm not suicidal like I was last time I went to therapy, but I feel like I'm suffering in total, deafening silence. Now my therapist can't even see it because I'm too afraid to open up.  I don't know what to do anymore.   Hi there. I like my hair, but I want some change. I really don't know why or what so I'm hoping someone will have an opinion. I don't want to cut it, but I'm considering a color change. I've included some pictures for reference. Please let me know what you think!  http://imgur.com/a/595Gx   I like 3      I feel like everyone thinks they can relate to what I'm feeling. Any time I tell someone of my insecurities, they reflect with "I feel that way too," or "Everyone gets that way sometimes." They don't realize that it eats me alive. I can't live with my mistakes, myself. You might not think your pretty, but I think I'm freakishly hideous. You might not want to get out of bed, but I don't want to wake up in the morning. You might feel embarrassed by an awkward first encounter, but I can't stop thinking about it until I crumble. You might wonder if someone does or doesn't like you, I pray that someone in the world can stand to be around me.  And no matter what I say, no one seems to understand the gravity of my fears and pain.   This is very true for me too. It can be very little things too. Like earlier today, I misheard the lady a the cash register. I thought she said $3.## when she really said $6.##. I couldn't shake it off. I felt so stupid even though I knew it was a simple misunderstanding. Why did I do that?   This is exactly how I feel. The person who is the closest thing to my best friend never hangs out with me or anything. I don't hang out with anyone. I'm alone and no one seems to want to change that.   Will I ever be normal? Will I ever be able to sleep at night without blaring music or video? Will I ever be able to be alone with my thoughts and not cry? Will I ever be able to be vulnerable? Will I ever feel like a real person? Will I ever find life worth living? Will I ever not search for the hate hidden behind every comment? Will I ever be able to live my life? Will I ever be healthy? Will I ever be normal?  Probably not.   I've found my life's passion. It just sucks because I can't do it full time right now. I have to finish out this last year.   hey fam,  So I've been going through a bit of a funk lately. I'm about to enter my senior year, my sister just graduated high school, and I'm feeling kind of stuck in my circumstances. Being that summer's coming up, I'm looking for a way to kind of step out of the norm and feel a little more like myself than the person I'm supposed to be. (Yes, I am aware how angsty I sound. My apologies.)  So, how do you guys step out? How do you break the norm? How do you express yourself? I don't care if it's advice or just your own story, feel free to post below.  xoxo   I used to enjoy school, but as I started growing up and beyond my friends, it's become difficult to find motivation. I used to enjoy learning, spending time with friends, pleasing my parents, etc. Now I use any excuse I can to get out of class.  By the way, I go to a private, religious school. The school itself is great. I just really don't like school anymore.   Congratulations!! Also, you are very pretty!   I'm going through a really, really tough time right now. I don't really know what triggered it, but I know that I need to get out of my daily routine for a while. Even a week would be enough. But I'm stuck, and I'm worried that if I let this continue I'll spiral into suicidal tendencies again. I feel like those times are the only times anyone is willing to help me, but I don't want to go through that again... I want to be stronger than that. But all I need is time to talk it out. But I can't. I'm stuck in school and can't get away.  That probably was all very rambly, but I needed to get it out. Thank you for reading. Comments are recommended and appreciated.   I'm trying to find a dress, but can't really find anything... Where are you going?   Yes. In fact, He hopes you do.   Hello /r/Christianity,  I haven't been on reddit in a long time, but I'm going through a really stressful time right now. I am going to be trying out for an officer position this Friday on my school's dance team. It's a really taxing process and it's bringing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that I can reach out to my fellow brothers and sisters and ask that you all pray for me. My name is Nicole and my main goal is to get Captain, if that helps.  In addition, this may seem ridiculous, but I have to ask because it's gnawing at me. I've been trying to ask God for a sign to hint me toward the outcome. I've been asking for so long that sometimes I wonder if He's trying to answer me or if I'm just making it up. So, if any of you feel any inclination or experience anything that suggests I either do or do not make an officer position, I would love it if you could share. Like I said, I know it's ridiculous, but please forgive me. I'm under a lot of stress right now that I am having trouble coping with.  Thank you all so much, and God bless.  TL;DR: Please pray that I get through a very stressful tryout process.   The goal of Christianity is to get as many people into Heaven as possible. As Christians, we believe that God created you and the rest of the universe out of His unselfish love. He asks simply for us to live holy lives and return His love. If you do not accept Him as your loving Father, this makes your salvation much more difficult.  Thank you for your question. I find it really beautiful that you search out the facts of religion as opposed to simply denying yourself of the opportunity to educate yourself. I would recommend you try praying. This may sound silly, but just try speaking to God. You may not believe it but plan out your thoughts in your head or aloud and simply ask Him to reveal Himself to you. He may choose to send you a sign and reveal Himself to you. This is merely a suggestion, but I hope that you might find the comfort in the love of our Lord that I and many others have. I'll pray for you.  God bless.         You probably won't find this worthwhile anymore, but I don't go on Reddit much... It was in the news. [Here's an article discussing it.](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/nurse-contracted-ebola-called-cdc-flight-official/story?id=26232809)   I moved here for warmth. I can complain all I want.

Even before she flew back, she had a 99.5 fever, asked if she could still fly back to Texas, and was given the okay. She didn't just say, "Eh, I'll be fine."   That's a joke. The vast majority of Texans do not want to secede.   Most Texans feel that way, but that doesn't mean we (they really, I'm told I'm not a real Texan because I wasn't born here) want to leave America.   Youth of Texas here. Please no. We deserve it, but don't leave me here.   Texas here. We deserve this.   Oh yeah, if this had been a Precal test, no way I would have trusted myself. I understand that   Much improved. Hats off! *golf clap*   Yeah, it was 4.5   Yes, that's correct.   Yeah, it's panacea.   We finished at 11, but they made us stay until 12:30 because fuck me.   Yes! The math was *so* much easier than it was last year.   You're about to get fifteen emails a day. I am not kidding. Fifteen. It would be a good idea to invest in a new email address.   You'll take it sophomore and junior year, won't you? My freshman year I didn't take the PSAT either. (Btw, I'm just assuming you're a freshman because of the tag. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.)   I put wrong because passive tense is a no-no, but most people are saying it's correct.   You can shorten this up a bit by realizing that every other answer was the same, so because -1 is the first in the sequence and 1 (first) is an odd number, the 19th number must also be -1.   You probably neglected that -1 (or 1 I don't remember) was the first number in the sequence and made 0 the first number, throwing off the count.   -1 because 19 is odd.   As I was writing down my answer I was contemplating how many people would forget it was diameter and not radius. They definitely did that to mess with us. Sorry about that, Atomichawk.   Yeah, those are both correct.   Same. That's fine.  	91
 Not really dire at all. I'm well nourished and water is free. :p I can chill for as long as it takes. Yes, I've tried fast food, dishwasher, retail and temp.   I wasn't really looking for sympathy with this. I was hoping to shed some light on the dynamic of mental illness combined with homelessness based on my experience and my observations of other homeless over the past two years. Thanks.   Thank you.   Urban camp is just outside the city in a park that is pretty wild. Coyotes and owls at night and only an occasional jogger in the early morning.  A local nonprofit gives me a mailing address to use and I can shower there every other day.   There's a college nearby with public WIFI and LAN access.  I do a job search on all the major job boards, customize my resume or cover letter and sen them off. that takes two or three hours. If there is a job close by that wants applicants to apply in person, I'll go do that. Otherwise I cruise the net, do some reading or socialize at the college.   Communication (singular brainiac).   I have applied for many of these types of jobs, retail and even dishwasher. I did dishwasher as a temp and didn't mind it at all. Thing is, it is an employer's market and if I am overqualified for this type of job, they seem to want to play it safe by hiring someone who does not have upward ambitions as soon as the economy improves. I am getting help finding a job through a nonprofit agency and in theory, they should be able to help overcome this obstacle.   Thanks for the well wishes. I have had the help of family before but there comes a point where it becomes a burden to them and also to me for asking.  I have a fixed mailing address and have a Google Voice number with a microphone headset so I am not really disconnected in that sense. Thanks again.   LOL!  	7
 Jolteon    Vet tech here...   Personal experience, the spay/neuter procedues effect on calming or curbing certain behaviours in dogs varies GREATLY.  That being said it can certainly calm a dog however mostly I've noticed this in dogs that are sterilized before these behaviours start. Sterilizing a 3 year old agressive/bull headed ect ect dog is not going to solve your problem since the behaviour is already sorta set in. Only training can help you. Some dogs (usually males)  will still mark after bekng neutered.  Depends on the dog.       Yes..  The force is strong with him. :)       So over the weekend my brother (let's call him C)  was assaulted by his gf for the third time (lets call her B). They were in his car (she was driving) they had two passengers in the back seat. C received a phone call from his friend S.  S is currently at a strip club (to be clear the call is a "face time") so this for some reason sets off B. She grabs his phone and throws or at the car window. I assume she was trying to throw it out the window. After this fit some reason she attacks him. Punches my brother in the face several times, scratches him, tears a piece of his ear off. C manages to escape the car. At this point they were almost at the campfire thing they were going to.  B steals his car and drove off not to be heard from till the next morning. Meanwhile my brother C has run off into the woods. His friend finds him and drives him to my mother's house... So at this point I received a call from my mother and little sister explaining what happened.  My mom takes photos of my brothers face and body (hes bleeding and his clothes are torn) I called the police, however since my brother refused to talk to them and i was not a witness i am apparently powerless to report this crime. After a few hours at my mother's place C goes to his good friends house who happens to be an OPP officer.  (Ontario provincial police).  Over the night i guess his friend has given him advice since C does not wish to report the assault. He gave his gf an ultimatum (move out or he reports her to the police)  problem is i have no idea if he actually said this to B or will even follow through.   This is not the first time that B has assaulted him. In the past she's hit him before (not this bad) and has smashed a lap top because C would not move a couch at 3am from the curb to the house. (couch her dog destroyed).  And she forbids him from using social media and checks his phone all the time. Any female friends are not allowed ect. I don't really know why C accepts this! I feel like my brother is being manipulated and physically/mentally abused by this psychotic woman. They've been together 4 years and is never really been good between them.   So what I'm asking basically is, what can i say to my brother that will convince him to reports B to the police? He has 2 witness and photographs. How long does he have to report the assault?   tl;dr brother been assaulted by his gf for the 3rd time. This time he has witnesses and photographic evidence. How to I get him to report it to the police?    Heart worms are in the blood not the stomach or gi. The meds can sometimes cause upset in the gi though.   Animals with worms in the gi will often barf them up, especially if the burden is high enough.          Yes I feel weird about it. Like the old me has been replaced with this new depressed me that gets no joy out of anything. I'm scared that I'll freak out my SO and he'll vanish. That to me would be devastating.       I am a beautiful person who is the best way to get a little group on a warm day go up to barrys bay and I will be nice to have a good sleep and I will be nice to have a good sleep.  I love you too can be used to be a long night and I will be nice to have a good sleep.     I wear dainese ladies drake air pants they're really nice and not super expensive    Cavan Hills is great    I prefer el caminos for burrito    Procaliber.com sells new oem parts that arent too expensive.  I bought a left faring for my 08 zx6r and it cost about 150$ you have to order the heat shield pads as well but all very inexpensive imo   I absolutely love it    Same bike here c:   Oh yes i plan on making a viewing. It's just always nos to hear what people who lived/live there think of the place.  Other tenants,  renting from aon in general I supoose. Thanks for the input though.    Hello fellow Ptbo people. I was wondering if anyone in here lives/lived in the apartment building at 235 King Street. Just curious as to how nice they are inside? Hows the underground parking? Is it clean ect ect? Just a review would be wonderful. My SO and I are looking for places and this place seems affordable.   	20
 Very sad situation. It sounds like you're a great guy, and I feel for you dude. I don't understand her end game though. You said she has an agenda. What is it? Why is she keeping her kids from a good father? And then being plain mean to him? Just...wtf!?!!   I've been pretty neutral on gun control in the US. This story did it for me. A house party turning into a battle zone can't happen in most countries because of sensible gun laws.          Thanks guys!   This is a subject I don't know a lot about, so all input is appreciated. When I hear HSBC say things like "the world economy is like an ocean liner without a lifeboat" it makes me wonder what's going to happen to my RMB. That, and I'm sure China's plateauing growth can't be good either, but I don't know how that works either.       It's real. In China, that might be tofu powder in Daisy's urn. Pictures like this are common to prove the job is well done.       HAHAHA The magazine finally gave credit to "The Moth and the Flame actually not cheesy for once..." Just when I thought they couldn't get any sleezier...they totally redeem themselves!    Shitty China internet. I can't read the graaaaaph   More!    "Cherry red chariot, excess is just my nature."   Craziest story here! What's the custody situation? Did you bring up her trying to murder you in the divorce proceedings?    If he's working for or the equivalent of Goldman Sachs/Marryl Lynch, it's no surprise he's working these hours.       A mentally impaired man lived with his adorable parents in the house across the street.  I never saw him out of the house unless he was being led into the family's Lincoln Towncar. He shuffled. He mostly stared at the ground. He really was just a sad kid in a middle aged man's pot bellied, unshaven body, but at 6 that made zero sense to me.   So when he was hunched over the fence, ogling me as I biked up and down our culdesac one summer afternoon, I was confused. When he asked if I had rope and tape, I was scared. When he opened the gate and chased me back to my driveway, I was terrified.   I still have a vivid memory of me jumping off the rear bumper of my dad's car to reach the rope hanging from the bottom of the garage door, and turning the lock.    [New Slaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg)   A good cuddle session can be better than sex. I think everyone just wants to feel connected to someone, even if it's just for a night.    Good stuff. If you don't mind, I'm going to go through your links later and ask some follow-up questions.    It's magic to me. What equipment do they use? What software? And how are they using that equipment and software?    Oklahoma Joe's?  I haven't lived in KC for a few years.    we got a badass over here!    "Forgetful tourist?"  	21
 I um, had an abortion earlier this year. I have been lactating a tiny bit for months now. I also recently became single and have been thinking about doing some porn. Maybe I should try and make some money off this while it lasts.   Yeah I am really into being a sub. It's super hot. I also really like pain and stuff.    :)   That's not the problem. It's either from my eds or fibro. I just don't know which.    I don't even know.    No, like when I watch an episode of something and someone else shows up and decides they need to watch it. Or someone wants to rewind the movie five minutes back.      If it were up to  me it would be an easy thing to avoid.    Thanks. Some of those are duplicates. I am constantly in between meds. Right now all I'm on is cymbalta, an anti inflammatory, and melatonin. But I'm about to start lyrica.    Oh I'm so honored.    Yeah its fine. I am sad and all but I have way more shit to worry about so it's whatever.   But they taste exactly the same.    It's just some yuppie thing.   There are still a lot of squatters. Hence all the couches on the side of the road with no cushions. Haha. But yeah everyone is pretty pissed about the St Roch market opening back up.   Yeah that would be sketchy.    When was that? I will still go a couple blocks at night. Or wherever when I'm on my bike.    I don't know. I guess just knowing people. Ha. I was in a really shitty sideshow for a little bit which was fun. Only toured with a band though doing their merch.   Well also once there was so many abandoned houses all the squatters and punks came in. It was only a few years ago that there were still squats in the bywater.   I don't think I have ever even been there.    I do what I want.    Yeah I lived in the 8th ward and worked in the 9th. It's weird that it's not as sketchy as you would  think because there are so many white punk kids there. I love it there.   It is Tia isn't always at the rescue but she is always doing something for the dogs.   Yeah I probably never would have noticed I did that.   I wasn't stumbling. That is actually the only time I have preemptively taken my knife all the way out. But yes.   Um. Ok.    A bat. I would totally ride that shit.        Yes I know the username is relevant so we can just establish that now.   I read a book about something like that before.    I just became single yesterday. My life is a bit of a mess due to my health so I am just getting treatment and trying to think about what I want to do when I get better and how I will do it.        I am going to try and learn new tricks so I can go back to sideshow performing as well as practicing more music. When my hands let me anyway.    Re watching something I just saw.        I really liked watching my ex play pool. It was hot somehow.    How so?   Not live and I don't know if I ever made it into the show but I worked for Villalobos Pitbull Rescue of Pitbulls and Parolees. It's actually pretty straightforward. Those people are actually just trying to rescue dogs. They are genuinely decent people. Tia especially is exactly the way she seems. She is a total saint so long as you're on her good side.         All the money that is donated and gotten from animal planet goes towards taking care of the 500 or so dogs they have and they really need it in order to keep the place running.         I know it's a shitty answer.    Just became single yesterday. I have a lady body and my personality isn't very shitty.    MwaHaHaHaHa.   Rubber chicken.   Who is touching me?             Interacting with people who are not nice.   In a school bus. I may have just been having sex with myself. But still. Everyone was sleeping.    Bleach. It's all the same.    I love porters.        Also tequila.           Half man. Half bear. Half pig.   I actually heard about a store in one of the dry states (that don't sell booze on Sunday) that had listerine on ice up front. I also heard of a guy that only drank listerine. Like bottles of it a day.        People are insane.    Heroin. Seriously. I could never get addicted to that shit because I was so disgusted with myself.           Edit: Apparently mistakes are okay unless it's a typo.   Some old crack head tried to rob me (small female) in the ghetto of New Orleans  and I scared him away. I was drunkenly walking home by myself super late after a show and already had my knife out, open, and in my hand. He was pretending to have a gun. I'm not afraid to act insane.        It was right next to a friend's place so I just stayed there that night.    I have been practicing those kinds of parenting skills with my drunk friends. Not really by choice.    The line "Jesus freaks, out in the street" always makes me imagine Jesus having some kind of tantrum or mental breakdown on the sidewalk.        Dude, did you see Jesus freaking out in the street earlier? Shit was crazy.   Every time a guy has been like "I really want to be with you."         Those are always the most neglectful partners.    I know all the words to American Pie. It's almost a problem. Also anything Jim Croce I need to sing along to even though my range is nothing like his.   And get all gay.   I secretly like it. I hate everything else popular for the most part.    If there are dogs around I use it as an excuse to babble nonsense to myself. I will start out talking to the dog then just go on making weird noises to myself.    There were several. Just broke up yesterday.    The smell of garbage bags being opened that were full of towels soaked in dog urine and poo after it had sat for weeks on a hot wet New Orleans day.        That almost knocked me on my ass.   I went to an abortion clinic in the south. I'm assuming that at least a couple people that work there are Christian.    "Curiosity killed the cat."         There is a second part which is "and satisfaction brought it back."   I don't even know what all of my pain is from anymore. Ha.   Yeah it sucks. I'm not positive of everywhere I have it besides my hands. But I am pretty sure it's in my hips, wrists, elbows, neck, and jaw. Probably not too bad in most of them.   Thank you so much. I'm glad you found it relatable.    I'm still all about forts at 23. Not so much chasing plastic bags around.    That's what I was hoping for. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.   I don't get the dread fluff part I guess.    So you haven't performed with a sideshow or anything? There is generally more money in busking but touring is a blast.   Fluff fluff? My hair is actually flat and straight and asian. And my bangs are actual bangs. And those pictures are like eight years old. I am attractive.    Thanks. They were actually just sitting there and that was the best way I could set my phone so my instrument wasn't way louder than my voice.       Thanks for the feedback. :)   He was only in one scene.   Thank you.         Shit. I have too many doctors appointments for this thought to exist.    That makes more sense.    Start appreciating yourself. Don't let other people's bias impact what you know about yourself.         Trust me, this is coming from a sideshow performing musician with hairy armpits  (femaleish). I really don't care what people think because I know I am a decent person and my preferences are my business.       What I am saying is, be the person you know is great and it should work out.    I went to the doctor. Maybe some old lady that would have had my appointment won't get in until tomorrow and will die of a UTI tonight or something.       Wow I feel really hypothetically awful now.   As a teenager?    It has never been a problem. We don't judge each other. I can't really work anyway but regardless I don't mind living in a van if it means I get to travel. I don't really care for nice things and no one tries to obligate me to.   Yeah it was before your time. You're missing out.    "Fuck my lungs, the rest of my body is fucked anyway. I doubt I can make it much worse. At least cigarettes are helping keep my blood pressure up. Fuck. I want to be normal."   First off I have female genitals. When I was 11 or 12 and my sister had moved out I would go through her room and look through all the stuff she had left. Under her bed I found a VHS tape titled "Women in Red".  Yeah it had Ron Jeremy in it. I would masturbate to it when I was home alone.    First off. How old are you?    My dad likes to listen to that song and cry every time. It's weird.   You mean the Coneheads song?   Any kind of short term injury.    Life.   Most people I know that have them wear them as earrings.    I messed up a few times but didn't have the energy to do another take. It's also not done and still needs a better bridge. But I thought some of y'all might appreciate it anyway.          https://youtu.be/lcs67xhaZfk   Actually, my standards are different than yours so it is fine because I don't associate myself with people who judge me.   She.   Yeah I bet. His last few albums have been awful. It's sad.   Edited.   Edited.   Edited.   Do it. Manson fans are supposed to be shitty.   It can work. I still have a bunch of piercings in my face and now I have tattoos. I dress a little more punk rock now. Wear what you like, it doesn't matter. One of my favorite articles of clothing is a knit body suit.   It was the eat me drink me tour but I was actually pleasantly surprised that he only played like two songs from that album. He was actually pretty good. And he played rock n roll jigger which was awesome.    Ha. Yeah.   I couldn't log in. :(   Yeah I'm still a weirdo.   Actually I was female but yes I am now an Asian male.   Half white. Not wealthy. Just a fucking punk.   I have a cousin named spike. I think you're good.   Maybe not the saddest, but Trouble by Cat Stevens always makes me want to kill myself a tiny bit.   I fucking hate showering with anyone else. It's the worst. Making sex out of the question.   I'm all about that shit.   I never liked it until my current boyfriend. He's kind of a big guy so it is easy for me to be on top of him. We 69 regularly and it is pretty great.    My meds that I have to take on an empty stomach. If I wait too long to eat I stop wanting to. Which doesn't work out well because I need to take other meds with food at the same time.    Story of my life.    Um. I was actually 16. Like I said. Soooo cool.   I just like to have sex with people.    You should have just played it off as a joke.   I still ask people. If I actually like them anyway. Not just a random hook up though I guess.    I was the goth kid. I made my own pair of those awful plastic cyber goth dread falls and wore them to a school dance with a corset and shit.        I also used to shave my eyebrows and draw them on which was fine after the first year once I had figured out how to do it well. It was rough at first though.        I am going to see if I can get on my old MySpace and find embarrassing pictures.         EDIT: I couldn't get into my old account. Here are some pictures but they aren't as embarrassing as the ones I can't access. http://imgur.com/a/mYsgg   Dude when I was in high school I took a bible to a Marilyn Manson concert and tore it up and threw it on stage. I was sooooo cool.   If it makes you feel any better I had actually been with at least twice that many people by 18.   That's the sort of shit I do all the time. No fucks.   That's beautiful. Like some kind of performance art exhibition.    Thanks. And yeah I also have osteoarthritis and fibro. As well ass fatigue but that comes with the territory. I'm somehow lucky enough to have no back problems.       But yeah I appreciate hearing from you.   Thanks.   Well now that you point it out I realize there is a typo. But there was nothing intentionally wrong. I am just a huge fruit when it comes to that song.   Thank you. I do spend time on /r/chronicpain and /r/ehlersdanlos which I have found to be very helpful.       I appreciate hearing from you. I know there are tons of people out there like me. It's just frustrating. I have talked with a pain psychiatrist, it was nice to be validated that I am handling my health like I should. But I kind of already know that. This would be so much easier if I could get my regular doctors to trust me enough to treat me.    Yeah I can't really stand almost any new popular country.   The coconut oil actually helps. I have tried several things and nothing really gets rid of it. I guess I don't care that much about it, not many people see my ass in person. I just feel a little self conscious about it sometimes.         I had cystic acne on my face until this year so I'm hoping the rest will go away on its own eventually too.   When I say bluegrass community it includes other things like folk and whatnot. Most of those musicians play multiple genres revolving around the bluegrass scene. It's mostly just the musicians that hate the song and don't want to play it. Which is really the only part of the scene I am familiar with.    I know the guy that played the fiddle in that version and we would always give him shit.   Yeah the regular demographic it works for. But there is actually a bluegrass karaoke with a live band somewhere one the west cost. People pay $5 or something to sing a song with the band. Wagon Wheel costs $100.   	119
 I have decided just to get him a trim on his legs and tail and groomed up nothing too extensive [before](http://i.imgur.com/jX1QUmJ.jpg) after soon to come.      Should I get my handsome boys hair cut? Does it ruin the coat? [Here is an album of Dexter] (http://imgur.com/a/kKp0R)  if he does get a hair cut what type should it be?   John Wilkes Woof    I'd watch him on that balcony... Didn't go so well for  Abe    More like ambush bursts Lucian    Stereotypes are stereotypical    Kind of sad that animals have that whole diversity thing figured out before we do.   No one knows what it's like to be the batman... To have no fam.   But that's a puppy.   Blues a girl...   Blues a girl...   Thanks, it means more than you know    He is currently at a foster home for 6 months with people I know. Complication with housing him but I'm working stuff out he has helped me with my severe depression and anxiety I honestly would not be here today. I miss him so much and it's been so hard with out my second half.      My golden scratches up his pads on gravel a lot but I got him some stuff called paw butter   Just a tip:  maybe work on proportions his necks a bit too long, but good work none the less    They are helpful to a degree and I go to public school. But nothing will teach me to go to school like taking my license away the only means of transport I have to school    I'm 17 and I suffer from sever social anxiety and depression. I  don't have the best school attendance, last week was on of my worst weeks, the house I lived in all my life was sold and I spent my week being in it for the last time, I had to send my dog to a foster home for 6 months due to the moving and other complication with the move. I've been having panic attacks all week. Yet my school, who knows what's going on and with slips from my psychiatrist they chose to fine me for truancy and suspend my drivers license for 6 months to top it all off. It feels like all they care about is a good record and not the student at all and honestly this some whit pushed me over the edge and I have been having scary thought for the past 3 days now but the only reason I don't off myself is because it would be selfish.      Omfg yea!!!!      NA      Love it!      I'm a pretty lonely person, not many friends, and I really miss just human interaction, I've had severe social anxiety and severe depression since I was 7. Need someone to talk to.   Thank you so much we love it !!!         thankyou!   why does league have such a rude and mean community? i know there are really cool people on LOL but there are a lot more Dbags in LOL  and its not so fun to play when you make a minor mistake, LOL used to be something i could use to take my mind off my depression but now it just makes it worse. Sorry for the rant but it just really has me upset and depressed.       I love you mcnugget   Amazing movie    Wolfcop 2 2015!!!!   Thank you, it good to know I'm not the only one   I just feel so alone, I barely sleep anymore, I can't help, but just break down into tears every night, I am so self conscious that I don't even know if my friends really do care, even when they reassure me they do, my grades are shit I'm only 17 and my life and future isn't looking too good.   I see a therapist every week and I'm on meds for severe depression and anxiety.      Yours is better      That's a lovely horse    Ever since I was 11 I was diagnosed with sever depression and social anxiety, my life's pretty much a roller coaster with major ups and downs. And I only have one real friend and she happens to be someone I love more than anything in the world, she knows I am in pain but I have recently found out she is really hurting bad inside, and it tears me up inside knowing how she feels and what she's going through, there is nothing I can do to make her not hurt and that just destroys me. I'm a very selfless person and I always put others first but no matter what she will always be first even though we are just friends and always will be I will always love her, and it makes me feel so sad and hopeless that I can't help at all, that I can't take her pain away , if I could take her sadness and add it to mine I would in a heart beat just to know she's happy.      It's cropped enough it was to show he was in the bathroom too lol   Be careful with that because dogs can get pneumonia just as easly as we can       Thanks, that actually helps a lot !

Don't make me snap my fingers in pentagram formation!   Tummy rubs soon followed !!!       Omfc (oh my fucking chuck) that's beautiful       You're like that one kid in class who goes " I was going to raise my hand and say that" after someonelse answers the question.   Gay lovers       For Ex.    My cousin is adopted and before he was adopted my aunt and uncle had a daughter, she passed away, 2 weeks out of the hospital from being sick.        So my cousin Ty was around 3 and he's never learned about his sister who passed away. (my aunt and uncle were waiting till he got old to tell him)so they are driving and my aunt said she saw Ty playing with a toy in his car seat but she still asked "what do you have there?" Ty replied "an elephant, baby Ciera gave it to me" (that was my cousin who passed away).    But all of her stuff was in the attic where Ty couldn't have gone there by himself.     Ok thank you  :)  	77
 I'm sorry you feel that way. The article was meant to open debate (hence the question of the header) and so far I'd say it's been pretty successful. Doesn't mean we have to agree. But my points are pretty concise and my opinion comes across well enough for many other's to have contacted me and discuss it. There's no need to be disrespectful.    Did you even read the article?!? Because there really isn't any point in having a discussion about something that I've already explained...   Well this is exactly what I explore in the article. Is society partly to blame, especially among young people and do we need to start taking responsibly for how the media portrays women? Personally I don't think it's a simple yes or no answer as there are many factors, this article focuses on one of those aspects. Thank you for your comment :)   Of course if you only read this post I would totally agree with you. Having had depression, and as you noticed my suicide attempt video I also self-harmed as a teen and now have anxiety and generally I did suffer badly from mental illness. What this post questions is could it partly stem from the way society views women. Thank you for reading xx   Ah well thanks for the super lovely and positive comment. I am actually trying to help people who maybe felt like I did back then and believe it or not many say I have helped them. Don't like it, don't read it.  Oh and I'm not a teen - I'm 30 years old and no longer suffer from mental illness. But who are you to say teen angst isn't a gateway to more serious problems? It is exactly because of attitudes like this that people are afraid to speak out about how they feel so thank you for proving the point of my 'whiny' blog.  	5
       Thank you :) I definitely see now how that makes more sense than what played out in my head.    Wow thank you for such a thought out response! The responses here has definitely opened my eyes. Sometimes, because of my BPD, I am quite delusional and cannot think clearly about things so it's always nice to get a second (or third opinion). I'll definitely try those things next time I'm feeling down.   I've depressed (diagnosed BPD) for about 9 years and have recently attempted suicide multiple times in the past year. I am currently on medication and in treatment but sometimes, the bad thoughts and suicidal feelings come around again.   My boyfriend is diagnosed with bipolar disorder so he has problems of his own. I understand that but sometimes when I'm having these bad thoughts, I would message him about how upset I am and he'd tell me that he can't talk at the moment and that he hopes I feel better soon.  Specifically, this happened two nights ago when he was out with his friends. He later told me that after I told him that I was upset, his mood was ruined and he had to go home.   I know my thinking is selfish but I'd love to get a second opinion on this. Am I wrong to feel like he should've done more when I tell him I'm upset?   Tl;dr: upset at how boyfriend reacts at my depressive episodes    Really good reviews though! I really wish I could go :(    I have two reservations for the following event https://www.paintnite.com/pages/events/view/toronto/883973. The event is currently sold out.   There is a cancellation fee if cancelling within 48hrs so I would like to sell my tickets to someone!  $56.50 for both!  I hope this is allowed but I am quite desperate to get rid of these :x    On Thursday, I will see a psychiatrist for assessment to see what kind of treatment and medications I will need. I'm so scared. I don't know what to expect. I don't even know if I want any help because I don't think I will ever get better.    I'm a 22 year old female with BPD in Canada. Feel free to message me :)    Always night time. But sometimes I get it mid-day as well and that's quite scary.    I took oral antibiotics but they didn't work so now I am on IV antibiotics for a week.    That sounds unlikely. Cat bites are very prone to infection and are unlikely to heal without antibiotics.   Both our cats are female and they are both spayed.   Unfortunately, calling animal control is out of my control now as the doctor I saw in the ER reported it himself (by law). The neighbours have no reason to be angry because first of all, this is the second time their cat has injured someone and second of all, their cat was trespassing when this happened.   First of all, we do not have a cat door. Second of all, I live with other people and can't exactly keep an eye on the door at all times. Please do not assume that this occurred purely out of my stupidity.   	14
 Judging by the state of the bathrooms at the bars here, I'd say not. Also, who has a Sharpie on them at the bar??   That damn Miracle of Life video they showed in 9th grade sex ed? I remember that. I also wondered for a long time how they got that shot.   When someone comments in /r/cringepics or /r/creepyPMs that something is fake. Who gives a fuck? No one has any way of knowing. Yes, people CAN be that cringy. If it made people cringe/laugh/feel uncomfortable, then whatever.   Are you related to /u/MesVonOtto?  https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/3drenk/all_i_can_think_about_is_how_that_barb_would_feel/ct7x32w   I like how you add the "comparatively" in there. No climbing shoes are comfortable.   I used to play Diner Dash when I was bored working as a server.   How is this hurtful to self-esteem? If I was a male, I'd think higher of a woman who took such precautions regarding her safety.   I've been with current bf for 7 months (ish?) and just yesterday changed my status to "in a relationship". Why do people care so much about what's on Facebook?   RemindMe! 5 hours "Find update"   Unless you own a 22. Can't find ammo anywhere.   Three days ago, I paid $5 for 20 Lortab pills and $75 for 15 antibiotic pills. None of this makes any sense.   We have a fence like this for the horses. You can hear when the pulse gets sent through. And it's really not that bad. Maybe 3-4 times as strong as licking a 9-volt. I imagine you can change the strength though. Our horses don't try to walk through the fence, so they don't need much.   I came here to say migraines. I can't imagine there being worse pain than that. My migraines have made me want to shoot myself just for relief from the pain.  How do they know if an attack is a migraine or a cluster headache?   Every single one of these posts says that fph harassed people off-site. WHERE IS THE FUCKING PROOF??  Edit: downvote me all you want, but that still doesn't prove anything.   Drunk one night, I dropped my phone in water. Figured it was fine. Plugged it into the charger and went to sleep. Woke up the next day and it wouldn't turn on. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Bf says put it in rice. I don't have rice. Go to store. Now I have rice. Put phone in bag of rice. Four hours later, still no change. Convinced phone is dead. Start looking at getting a replacement from Apple ($300). Leave phone in rice overnight, hoping for a miracle. Next morning, have lost all hope, check phone. Screen lights up. "Charge me!" it cries. Plug into charger. Phone turns on. Works perfectly. We rejoice together as I check my neglected Snapchats.   I think this too. Especially if I post a lot of comments in a short amount of time.  Am I annoying anyone? I'm sorry :(   Me too! People on the phone can never figure out what I'm saying, and I have a very common name, but one that has subtly different pronunciations. I just mumble it, I think because I'm not sure how I want to pronounce it.   Maybe he stood up to straighten the top of his desk, then was sitting to straighten the rest?   I'm 26. I teach 3rd and 4th graders computer science. I explained to them one day about what it was like to get on the internet when I was a kid. I found a clip of the dial-up tone and played it for them. It was hilarious. They were blown away by the idea of not being able to be online and talking on the phone at the same time. That whole experience made me feel very old.   I have a new couch and shelves coming next week and I'm super excited about that.   /r/reallifedoodles needs to do something with this.   I'm introverted enough that my friends have gotten used to me saying "I'd love to, but I'm going to stay in and not deal with people today."   For example: It's a gorgeous sunrise. The sunlight is shining through tree branches and illuminating streaks of light through the morning fog. I snap a picture to capture it, and end up with a photo of... a nondescript tree with some light behind it. Why doesn't the camera capture the image like I'm seeing it?   Blinds only do so much, unless you get the ones that are made to block out the light.   How do they do in the daylight, and do you have a link? I need some black-out curtains and could only find decent ones around $50 or more.   Found the graphic designer.    will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.  I am assuming this means that whole "safe space" bullshit that started all the recent drama. Lovely. Looks like I'll have even more disappointment to look forward to as the site allows a place for racists, but not one for people who dislike an unhealthy lifestyle.   To all those saying the house is shit (read to the end):  Propelling a piece of straw at a palm tree at a distance of 50cm at 320mph (the world record for recorded wind speed at ground level), the straw only managed to penetrate the tree a quarter of an inch. Even firing at the tree while it was bent (to increase the size of the pores in the surface of the tree) at point blank range added no additional distance into the tree. A piece of reed was tested as the sturdiest organic object that might be mistaken for a piece of straw. At both ranges, the reed only managed to go about two inches into the tree. Additionally, Jamie tried a piece of piano wire, and at 50 cm, it flew not only through the tree but through a sheet of plywood on the wall behind it, partially embedding itself into the cement wall.  Sauce: [Mythbusters](http://mythbustersresults.com/episode61)   Add this to the list for Mythbusters: Reddit Edition.   Depends on where you live I think. I understand the need for sunny days and rainy days, and seasons. But 5ºF and 30mph winds I could definitely do without.   Nothing is better than a cold shower after a nice run or bike ride on a hot day.   Getting a tattoo. I always get way too worked up beforehand, and then it's really not too awful.   I eat Taco Bell at least once a week. Back when I was 18 and could eat all day long without gaining a pound, I ate Taco Bell nearly every day. Never have I had any intestinal or poop problems as a result.   You must have been asleep for yours. I was wide awake, not even laughing gas, and it was the worst experience of my life.   [Apparently, too much can make you not want it anymore. This is a shitty article from not a reputable source though.](http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip_100/145_love_tip.html)   I had a good one for "[What do you add to your ramen noodles?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tyv8g/what_do_you_add_to_your_ramen_noodles/)", about 5 months ago.   Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.  Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.  Enjoy.  The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious."   I know we've all had questions where we have a really good a answer, but the thread is 16 hours old and no one is looking at the "new" comments anymore. For what question did this happen for you, and what was your answer?   "Fairy tales are more than true. Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten."  -Neil Gaiman   And give it back when the owner needs it back.  I had a friend borrow my motorcycle helmet for his girlfriend while my bike was in the shop. I ended up getting the bike back earlier than anticipated, called up my friend to ask for my helmet back and his response was "no, why do you need it back?" Motherfucker, it's mine. I'll take it back anytime I want!   That first one made me nearly jump out of my skin. But then I laughed about it. Until the second one. Noped out of there after the fourth.   I like how you say "starring" and then list other roles the actors have played.   This would never happen at a VA DMV unfortunately. First, the 50s are letter C. Second, they don't put the extra zero at the front. No ticket fun for us on the east coast!!  Sauce: was at VA DMV last week, twice, for the same thing. Was given ticket numbers C53 and C59.  Also, you can make an appointment at your DMV?? I'm living in the wrong state.   This whole conversation made me laugh far more than it should have. Good job :)   Absolutely not. But I feel like using a fake name on a protest petition is like writing in Micky Mouse for your presidential election vote.  I actually don't know why I feel so strongly about this.   But that's not today's date...  One of us is very confused.   I just mentioned something about this on the /u/ekjp apology post. Reddit just loves fatties apparently.   Do you not own anything with the date on it?   That's as good as not signing. If a petition is to hold up legally, a legal person has to sign it. The signature count on change.org means nothing if a petition is to actually be upheld for anything.   I won't be happy with anything you say until you can provide concrete evidence to support the banning of the subs that you banned (yes, some of us are still immensely bitter). I noticed that /r/badfattynodonut is now banned even though they were blatantly strict about instabans for any and all harassing behavior.  Transparency is important when you shit on 150,000 users for what seems like (to those users) no reason.   I thought of the Doctor Who episode: The Curse of the Black Spot.   /u/kn0thing came to my school too. Giddy with the excitement of actually meeting one of my idols, I had him sign my copy of *Without Their Permission*. Then I actually got to have a drink at the bar, with him and others who went to the talk. I looked up to him. He's one of the main reasons I'm a startup owner now. This feels like a slap in the face from someone I used to idolize.   I've been a redditor for almost two years and have never once heard about this "self-promotion" policy. Sounds absurd.   He probably fake-gilded himself. Many of his comments are gilded, but downvoted to hell.   They have these in the grocery stores near me. For wine. It's nice. I'll drop a bottle in and then let it chill while I'm shopping. Perfect temperature to pop open on the drive home.   How would this scam even work? Would they have asked for all your information at some point? Seems like a huge effort for that.   This is why I own a gun. I'm a small female living alone. I can't imagine if anyone were ever to break in and all I had to defend myself were my weak punches. Thanks for sharing your story with us.  I am surprised there wasn't more hassle with the police. I always assumed that a situation like this would still result in court hearings and the like. Sounds like it was pretty cut and dry.   Some people just need a swift kick in the ass to help them see a better way to be. I'm happy that FPH could do that for you, and I'm happy you're caring more about your health! Go lurk FPH on Voat, and fph .io. Or shoot a PM to me or any other FPH person if you need someone telling you to stop being a fat piece of shit and to make healthier life choices. Then you can join us when you've become person-sized, and help motivate others like you.  Edit: I tagged you as "Fat guy needs encouragement", so if I see you somewhere on reddit months or a year from now (if I'm still here), I'm going to ask you about your progress.   Liars*   I have a question for you, with the goal of having an honest discussion between two people with opposing views.   I believe hatred gets humanity nowhere.  I agree with this sentiment, but I want to know your thoughts on the obesity epidemic in the States and what it means for the future of humanity. Obviously FPH's goal was not to motivate people to lose weight, but there have been many personal accounts of individuals claiming that FPH was the final kick in the ass they needed to make better lifestyle choices. How do you respond to this?  What is your response to the Health At Any Size movement, and what would you suggest we do, as a society, to help combat rising obesity rates?   If you're going to mindlessly degrade someone, at least make an effort to proofread your post. Misspelling a four letter word makes your insult laughable.  Maybe your fat fingers can't hit the keys properly?   Thank you for being the only one so far to show how easy it is to fake web content in a screenshot.   Share the evidence with us. It's one thing to claim somenhing happened, but people will believe you if you can prove it.   They won't release any evidence of mods encouraging hatemail to Tess Munster (or anyone else), because there isn't any. I was a daily FPH reader and active poster, and never once saw any encouragement like that of any kind. As far as all of the accusations being made against FPH, I can't think of a single instance to support them. Yes, we're a community of assholes, but that doesn't stop being true when we're offline.  Unfortunately we seem to be in an age where people want to change the world if something hurts their feelings. What happened to people putting on their big boy pants and getting over it? Or considering that maybe they do have a problem that they could fix? We live in a world of adult-sized children.   It wasn't even that the mods at FPH didn't allow non-np links. It was that linking to ANY part of reddit at all was off-limits. Screenshots only, with all username and subreddit identifiers censored. Some submissions were removed due to the OP's username still being in the screenshot. The mod team was on top of that.   Am woman. According to this I'm a man.   # #HealthAtAnySize      This was reiterated in February of this year.  [“We will not ban questionable subreddits,” Reddit’s CEO, Yishan Wong, wrote in the aftermath of that catastrophe [The Fappening]. “You choose what to post. You choose what to read. You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce. We will try not to interfere — not because we don’t care, but because we care that you make your choices between right and wrong.” That echoed Reddit’s official line on the Violentacrez scandal in 2012: “We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits.”](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/02/20/how-the-reddit-exodus-illustrates-the-state-of-free-speech-on-the-web.html)   No, actually, I didn't want to eat breakfast this morning. So fucking gross.   Congrats to you and your team on a great run! I hope I can work up to a hardcore 15 miles one day.  Fatties will never know that overwhelming, full-body, amazing feeling of having just finished an awesome run or workout, as well as the energy and motivation it gives you for the rest of the day. It's better than any food. Their loss.   Me either. Wrong thing to click on at 1 in the morning.   I used to ride competitively in high school (time trials), but haven't been on one in years. That might have to change soon haha. Plus, you can go much farther on a bike. Better scenery 15 miles out, than the few miles around town that I run.   What's the best adblocker for Safari? I've never had adblock. Just kinda... dealt with ads.   It's so awesome to not have to worry about weird skin irritations due to body parts touching when they aren't suppose to!   They do like to give me nasty looks when I jog past them though. Those nasty looks are better than the best pump-up song.   I don't have a bike! I should really invest in one. Much better on the joints.   You're one brave person. I'll go sub to /r/chrysler just to see if you make it through as a mod. Good luck!   Sorry for joining in the chaos and posting an inappropriate picture here. I'll take it down, if you guys haven't already. It's just that I've just lost my reddit home and don't know where to go :(  Thanks for the words of support though. It's really been astounding to see just how much support we're getting from the other subs, even the ones who didn't like FPH at all. Lots of respect to those who are making this purely about the censorship.  	78
 Awesome will do, I'll see how it goes! :)   Yea of course man that'd be sweet! I currently live on an island and internet is just mobile so I'm fairly out of touch with stuff at the moment! Cheers   Awesome I'll look in to those, looking for something anonymous in case people prefer that. Cheers!   Why? Why possibly take on the responsibility of someone else's life?  	4

 Something something, "oh I can't believe you let your four year old get a tattoo" something something...   Came back to Scotland from a week away (in Barcelona! :D) last evening and it was such a lovely cheery thing to come back to! Putting it up somewhere I can see it and get my pride on :p I love the pony stickers too, totally gonna stick them everywhere, btw ;)  Thanks! :D   I know right? These things are very heavily influenced by diet. I'm not saying I disagree with the immune system thing, I've heard that before and it sounds interesting but I don't know enough about it. But as for actual smell, I'm surprised* people jumped to racial differences before, you know, diet being a big factor which varies between culture.  One time during my teenage years I went for a good long while without any dairy in my diet. After going back to dairy I noticed my clothes did have a noticeable sort of dairy-ish smell to them. Apparently that's a very distinctive part of how those with a typical Western diet smell to those from places where they eat little to no dairy.  Edit: *You know what, this is Reddit, maybe I'm not so surprised after all :(   Whaaa I'd love one if there are any left :D I'll pm you my address   Such a cool thing to wake up to. I love the glittery flag stickers :p Thanks a bunch, this is the first thing I received through this sub and it certainly got my day off to a lovely start. The fact was interesting too; I didn't realise that about the flag!  Thanks :)  P.S. That little Reddit snoo stamp on the envelope is adorbs   Eat the spaghetti to forgetti your regretti   This happened close to where I'm from in England, it's a really uncomfortable and sad part of our local history...

I'll PM you :)   So sorry to hear that, I'll happily send you guys a card :) I'll PM you now   Thanks, PM'd you :)   I'd love one over here in Scotland, shall I PM the address?   I'll happily send you a card from Scotland if you PM the address :)   Hi there! I'd love to send a card, just PM the address :)   Thank. Doot.   My first thought was squished raisin...   I can find a similar ish one in the UK that's not too pricey for all my fellow Brits http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daiso-Japan-Natural-Pack-Charcoal/dp/B00O7TPOIS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8qid=1433861281sr=8-1keywords=charcoal+peel+mask  We should totes all order them and report back with results :p   Male or female, inside we are all skeltals. Doot doot   Thank you so much   Ah right, I've been started off with 20mg, perhaps that's partly why I'm having such a hard time with it. I can't remember how much I started out on last time.   That's reassuring to hear. Like I say, last time I had no issues with it, it's just the nature of the side effects I've had this time that concern me. I'm in the middle of taking driving lessons but have cancelled this week to be on the safe side (dizzy fit behind the wheel doesn't sound like it'd be fun) and I'm thinking maybe I might throw in a run or bit more exercise into my day to help cope with the restlessness and hopefully avoid it mounting to another panic attack.  If you don't mind my asking, how long have you been using it and what dosage?   Sorry to hear you've been having a tough time lately, I'd totes love to send a card, just PM your address :)   Hi there, I'd love to send a card if you PM me the address :)   That's great, I bet she's so grateful to have your support :) I'll maybe mention it [the capsule thing] to my GP at my follow up on the 14th   Thanks! That thread looks really helpful :D Glad your SO had good experiences with it. That's really weird about the capsule, I'd never heard of them causing problems.   A million times this   I'd just like to point out that it is actually made very clear throughout FPH that they are not trying to motivate fat people into losing weight. They are simply a space where people go to discuss their dislike of overweight people.   I too have trouble believing that this is a real teacher. I am pretty much convinced that a lot of online hate speech is just 'venting' or whatever. At least I hope so.    You know you shouldn't, silly. That sounds like bliss, glad you could find your own niche in the week for pure 'you' time :)   Aww well that's a lovely response :-) you have a smashing day now   To be fair though, it's a decent enough point. As someone who loves reading this page but who feels like a complete outsider to the LGBT+ community I kind of wish more of these fun stereotypes applied to me so I could actually feel comfortable with my queerness and not like some complete outlier freak :3   Hey I know this one, it's on a really good street for second hand book stores and quite close to where I lived last year :3   I'm glad this worried someone else too :p   Oh my goodness this made me smile so much :3 You adorable thing, you   To be fair I think it's important to remember that she wasn't doing it as a scientific study.

I'm also in Scotland so maybe my stuff won't be the most exotic to you but aw well :p   Christ, he just keeps playing throughout it as well...   Hey I'd be super happy to send you something :) Not from anywhere exotic I'm afraid, just Scotland :p PM your address   I'd love to send her a card from Scotland :) PM me your address and I'll see what I can do   If you order prints/posters from him he also adds little bits of cut up felt and string and rubber bands. He's a special kind of chap and we must all treasure him :3   I dunno, I mean it sounds made up. But then she added that bit about how you can't make this stuff up. So...   I feel like lately all my bi-girl celebrity crushes are finally coming true, IT'S HAPPENING YOU GUYS :D   Hey my name is Catherine and my mum very nearly named me Ruth...but I digress.  Man this is so sad. I mean psychics are literally profiting off the suffering of vulnerable people by lying to them, it's pretty heartbreaking...   He hasn't even seen  the new film! Plus, judging from his description of it as being quintessentially 'American' he hasn't seen the original film either. Oh dear.  Edit: a letter   If you ask for whisky with something (i.e. as a mixer) I usually find you tend to get something fairly everyday such as a blend like Famous Grouse or whatever, or something like JD (so ofc regular bars serve non-Scottish whisky) which is pretty fair enough. If you want a specific whisky you usually ask for it by name e.g. "a single of Highland Park" or whatevs. I feel like in most places in Scotland with a reasonable selection of whisky, whether or not it was all from Scotland, specifying a "Scottish whisky" would sound kind of redundant, maybe I'd say it if I were asking for a recommendation or something from the very large category of Scottish whiskies. I dunno. I'm waffling.  Disclaimer: am English but have spent most of my drinking years up north slowly drinking away my dreams to the brutal sounding of bagpipes...   I've only ever heard Americans refer to (Scottish) whisky as 'Scotch'. Here in Scotland I usually see it just called 'whisky'.   I'm sorry, we are you talking?   This is so nice, OP. I will definitely be stealing this idea for a project of my own some time :p   I like how he casually insults and shames all guys who don't conform to a certain set of masculine traits... And for the record, there is no 'wrong' way to be a man, and despite what some toxic elements of Reddit might tell you, all women aren't exclusively attracted to hulking 'douchebags'**.

The ultimate "son I am disappoint", there's no way she doesn't know   Came to the comments to make sure someone gave proper credit. Now I want to rewatch Spaced so badly...   It depends what you're using it for. You'd use it behind the leg or on the shoulder in different situations, e.g. to encourage movement in a particular direction, or a transition etc.   /r/noisygifs    Ahaha, love it. What could possibly go wrong! :p   Aye, there's a lot of wounded peeps out there. Best you can do is just be patient with everyone you meet I guess. Though I am encouraged by the fact that for many this kind of thinking/feeling does seem to just be a phase. It's the lifers who are perpetually bitter or angry or scared that I feel most badly for :(   I mean...I'm not advocating unnecessary squeezing but as a frequent browser there I think this post would still be welcome, with probably a bit of advice against the perils of trigger-happy squeezing and how sebaceous filaments =/= black heads in the comments  Edit: why is this even something we need to debate? Does it really matter? You're not meant to pop blisters but people post them on /r/popping all the time   True but they're not fussy over there; pimples, tonsil stones, ingrown hairs... anything being extracted in a satisfying way is kosher   I want to give them all hugs (or maybe not physical hugs...figurative ones maybe safer...) and tell them it's all ok. Maybe let them rant it all out of their systems or something. These guys are hurting and that's ok. Choosing to follow a path of bitterness and hate in response to that,however, is not...  Edit: I spoke a little early: most of these are just the complaints of man children but hey, my general point still stands for a few of them   Seriously, that is just so incredibly heroic. I almost teared up a little reading about it.  And what the hell do I have to show for my life so far? :-\   Christ these people are broken :-/ I just wonder what sort of life they must have had to reach this level of paranoia and detachment from reality. I truly think there should be some effort to offer 'deprogramming' for trpers. Like for people who leave cults...

 Its not easy. I've realized I have to stop living in the past and build the future. Or we will never recover. It takes time and effort. I've been clean a year and I've been struggling with keeping myself busy. At the same time I have a father battling addiction at home. Which is tough on me mentally. I go to work stay positive and see good friends time to time. I've done some fucked up stuff too and I'm still reeling the pain. I live a normal life today and I am okay. I get in my head sometimes but I reach out for help and eventually I feel okay again. "Nothing changes, if nothing changes" With all your power you have keep trying to fight your fears and do whats right for your life. I would suggest getting a job as it would keep you busy. Staying in touch with your sponsor and building a sober network. Congrats on reaching out this is the right step! : )   I aced that test whole test too that you posted the link of. I was diagnosed almost 8 years ago for depression, anxiety, adhd. Glad your making positive changes. I still have trouble getting out. I heard working out 30 minutes nonstop a day can really help us rewire our brains but who has the motivation lol. The medication I've been on is useless. Good luck my friend. Wish you the best.   How do you test high for depression ?  just curous   Go to a meeting. Ask for help. You will get help. Start from there.   How do you feel around strangers ? What are you thinking usually.   Hi there, this is usually how it went with me in the beginning of recovery. When you are in a rehab or sober house it is much easier because you have a support system and others going through a similar situation. Would you be able to get checked into a sober house ?   I thought the same thing at first. When I was getting high and drunk all the time I had girls, lots of friends and I was outgoing. The reality was they were not my friends. The girls were fake. I was living a life that I was not happy with. Now I have my family, few friends keep to myself and life is good.    I never considered myself a alcoholic either but my father is so I rather not. If I start drinking, eventually I will fall to drugs someway along the way, I've seen alot of friends try to drink and go back to drugs. I do have a very few friends who were addicted to drugs and managed to just drink here and there. There lives were better and happier. Its a mind fuck.   Hahahaha takes energy man!   Thats great!!! I am by means not perfect today. I still struggle and I am stubborn sometimes about getting help. But as addicts I've  learned we have to reach out to others to maintain our sobriety. I'm glad you mentioned it here on the forum its better than sitting in your head and just holding in everything. Good luck brotha!   Its all in our heads man. Last time I relapsed it was because I went to see my bestfriend who was still a heroin addict. I wasn't craving at all. I thought I was doing good in recovery but I was winging it. This time around I still struggled but when I confront my fears and talk about how I feel and reach out to others I feel at ease and peace with my mind. Its like we choose either to recover or go back. If a old friend hits you up who still uses and wants to hangout there is no use, unless you want to go back to that life. If you drive pass a trigger area you have to think to yourself wow I came so far and I am clean and sober today and life is good. Positive thoughts. The past is the past. Thats the mentality I want to believe. When you believe you achieve. Just my thoughts. Congrats on your recovery you are doing great! This is no walk in the park!   I quit drinking when I turned 21. (I'm 24 now) Father is an alcoholic drinks alot. I don't think I ever hit rock bottom but everyone experiences it differently. I was just to a point where I was miserable and tired of chasing my addiction in circles and killing my family while I did it. If your willing to stop get to a meeting and speak whats on your mind. It took me 3 detoxes, rehab, 3 out patient programs to finally know I had to quit. Or it was death. Better sooner my friend.  	12
 Also, don't give up on the meds, try some more stuff and stay on something that you feel doesn't hurt at least or helps maybe a little bit. As long as you don't have bad side effects or the cost of it ruins you (no clue about US health care) it really can't hurt.   Do it :) I didn't really go "fuck everything" either, I still made sure I found a job in the city I had my eyes on first, looked for a temporary apartment there and so on, but having the mindest of "fuck this I am out of here" helped a lot for me to find the energy to actually do this.   I turned 31 a short while ago.  I moved to our capital, which is about 700km from where my parents live and about the same distance from where I used to live.   I don't know, I had a lot of reasons to be depressed, or at least I percieved them as such. In hindsight I was just really hard on myself a lot of the time. I wrote in reply to teh_d0ct0r below a little bit about what helped me or not. I can't really talk about the whole "everything is going great but I am still depressed" thing, because it really wasn't like that for me.   I think it was a combination of both, the lack of energy I felt from being depressed as well as the incredible social anxiety of meeting somebdoy who knows me who might ask me about what the fuck I am doing and why I have been hiding for weeks ... Some days I was not able to get out of bed and I missed some appointments and then I was like "oh my god, what if I go buy food now and meet somebody I have just stood up". Then I would just stay home and not eat anything, then obsess all night over what the fuck just happened and how I should have just called those appointments I had missed and explained and what I should have said to them ... so I couldn't sleep because of that, making me even more tired and depressed the next day ...   No I am no longer on meds and had not been on meds for a couple of months at the point I felt like things were really starting to get better. Meds never really did anything for me unfortunately. Please don't interpret this as me telling anybody to get off meds or not try meds, I know a _lot_ of people where they have worked and helped a lot. I tried a lot of stuff in the med department and only really gave up on them after 5 years of never feeling any real effect. And I still can't really judge how much worse it would have been if I had not been on meds at that time. So stick with the meds, try different medications, unless the side effects are really debilitating.  Therapy I think would have helped me alot if I had made the effort to find a therapist that fit me. Unfortunately thats really hard here, waiting times are very long, its often hard to reach somebody and my lack of energy and gigantic fear of talking to people and asking for help pretty much made it impossible to find a good therapist. The 6 weeks of intensive therapy while I was in the hospital the second time did help a bit I think to gain some more insights into the problem but a hospital is a really isolated environment and things you do there often don't translate well to real life. My second try with therapy outside was really useless, the therapist didnt't work for me at all. I would have needed somebody more like a life coach, giving me concrete tasks and exercises, something like that I think. I didn't have the energy to look for it though during the bad times.  Personal Reflection was a terrible idea :-D It always devolved more into obsessing over what I did wrong and how I should do things while never managing to actually do it.  I think what somewhat enabled me to "snap out of it" really was more like life changes ... Not just okay lets do some things different, I had somewhat of a "fuck everything" moment where I decided to no longer try to adapt myself to what I thought was "expected" of me but to just change everything in my life that made me upset.  For example I was completely obsessed with everybody in my friend circle marrying, getting kids, being in long-term relationships while I was getting close to thirty and still had never even been in any long-term relationship. So I said fuck that, I will move to a place where not everybody is following the plan, where people can still be weird and irresponsible in their 30s. So I did that, and I feel so much happier ...   I was pretty stupid and did it once on my own cold turkey, I really can't recommend that unless you want to enjoy a week of debilitating vertigo and nausea. Second time I went off it I listend to what my doctor told me and it was no problem, maybe a day of light nausea the day after the doses got reduced.  	7
 She won't ever let Charles be King for the good of the realm!   I absolutely abhor people who cheat on their spouses but I just can't bring myself to hate Arnold. Also the fact that he admitted to his fault in a relatively recent AMA made me admire him more.   My thoughts too! I know he's paid to look good but goddamn only few people can look so sexy around the age 50.   Yeah, I get so sad when I see my 90s heroes grow old... I'm just glad he's still taking care of himself and looks as good as he does now.   This was my thought exactly. I love her current portrait and skins a lot and I don't even play Fiora. The clothes look much brighter and it doesn't really seem to suit her all that much :(   He looks awesome and I can't wait to try him out, but I'll miss the old one that seemed to be more lighthearted.    Reminds me of [David Kawena's Kocoum](https://www.facebook.com/david.kawena/photos/a.207734582589507.58487.171173612912271/300433536652944/?type=3 permPage=1) 3 *slightly NSFW   The conversation they should have with the other dogs in the animal heaven must be pretty awkward. "So hey, haha, no hard feelings, right guys?"   It's very weird isn't it? I feel more comfortable talking about my depression to people I don't know that well rather than my close friends and family. It's almost like they can't believe I'm depressed. My mom always tried to have me quit taking meds but she saw how much it helped me function after I forgot to pick up a prescription for the week and broke down completely.  Since you've just opened up to them, they must be getting used to the fact now. Give them some time, and perhaps they'll come around and see how much this is affecting you and that you need them by your side.  In the mean time you can always talk to us! :)   I pulled myself up from feeling like that all the time, but there was one friend that really made me feel inferior. She was pretty, kind, all around "people person". She also comes from a well-off family so she would casually buy designer goods that she clearly did not pay for. I felt bad whenever I felt jealous because she was a genuinely nice person, and it's not her fault that her parents are liberal with their money.  Anyways we went from being best friends to just acquaintances and then I stopped talking to her all together because she reminded me of all things that I couldn't have. What I had could be acquired through effort; what she had was just innate. I couldn't work towards that.  I actually admitted to this via email and explained to her how I felt, how sorry I was that I just stopped talking to her even though she was always very nice. She appreciated it and revealed to me that she was jealous of my academic success (what little there was anyway) and her parents would always compare her to me. That exactly didn't make me feel better but at least let me see she wasn't living the perfect life I thought she had.  I'm still envious of people who are beautiful and sociable but I try to remind myself not all of us can be like that. It's difficult to stick to this, but I try.   Hmm, from what I've experienced and heard from my physician the clinically depressed can't really function well the entire day. You know one of those bad days you get? That goes on to become a week, month, year, etc.  You are still young and I'm glad to hear apart from acute episodes of feeling low you can go about your day most of the time. Keep it up! I wouldn't say you are clinically depressed just yet. But do consult a doctor if the episodes last longer or become more frequent.  Also I should mention that it's very natural to feel that way during that phase of your life. Talk to your friends, or us (we'll always be here!) whenever you're feeling low. You don't have to talk about how you feel, what happened, if you don't want to. Sometimes it's nice to just talk, y'know?  Anyways these are my two cents. Hope this provided some insight.   I'm so sorry your parents didn't respond well. I feel most of the times that is the case :( I guess it's hard for especially parents to just accept that their children are having this type of difficulty, because they might think there were at fault for their children's depression (which might be true in some cases).  I hope she eventually comes to see that just acknowledging that you are going through this can provide some solace.    I'm always divided about that. Is it "I see wiener" or "Icy wiener"? I simply must know!   Also the drink. Was it called popo? *drool a la Homer*   I would have the whole set Mia has. It looks awesome.   Wammy wam wam wozzle!   "FIRMLY GRASP IT"   And I love how he sometimes puts together a pretty complex and eloquent sentence and proceeds to do something stupid immediately.   Yum! I think they'll look even better with more lighting.   "Come on, Garcia, slap ass!"   Kudos. I've felt similar pressure when I was your age. Am a girl so no one was hazing me for not banging a random dude, but I felt like I needed it for social validation. Silly, I know, but I was young.  I'm so glad my first time wasn't some mistake because when it happened with the right guy I had no regrets and it was wonderful. I'm sure this is the same for guys as well. You want the type of first time that makes you smile when you look back on it, not cringe or facepalm haha.  Good on you for sticking to your principle.   Could you tell me more about your fish? No one I know keeps a pet fish so I have no idea what it's like. Probably the only thing I know about taking care of a fish is that it requires a lot more water than people think. (Like, pet shops advertise that gold fish can be kept in a wine glass but they actually need a big ass aquarium.) Care to tell me about it?   Eloquently put. I guess it goes both ways; I can't understand why they feel so persecuted (oh the irony) for their belief, why they think they're being attacked. I spent my adolescence in a catholic high school and we accepted pretty much all kinds of sexual orientation. People would openly come out and no one, including the pastor, would try to change it. I wish I could let them see it's not a compromise that would break down their whole belief system.   I got giddy just reading your post. I really miss that kind of feeling. Congratulations!    I agree. People could use this sub for venting about this whole situation too.   Good job, and savour it! I don't think I was that good around level 18. Keep it going!   Someone should have put a leash on THAT guy. He must be going through eternal puberty.  But you did the right thing not fighting him, I think. Someone that obtuse wouldn't try to understand regardless of whether sense is taught to him by words or force.   lol I'm not sure why he's playing hooky, but I've actually seen him inside Belethor sweeping the floor. He kept telling me he was too busy to talk to me :(   Welcome, new Dovahkiin! Since you're new to the game I also assume you're also new to the parodies [like](https://youtu.be/ZPllpzxmM5k) [these](https://youtu.be/mv3ScKLD1Vc?list=PLLoWhJJEjzXl0jfiQjuVuJkVe0gGpYstU). Enjoy.   I've tried it so many times with kettles, but the merchants move around right after I put it over their head and the kettle falls off :( I must be doing something wrong.   It's amazing how just three words "stop right there" can make me read the entire sentence in the Imperial Guard voice.   Yep, this is why I chose my hireling solely based on whether I liked their voice or not. I ended up hiring Marcurio and marrying him.   I learned about this only after I chose to kill him. He was a traitor in my eyes so I don't exactly regret it, but it looks like he would've been pretty handy in some quests!   Glad to know I'm not the only one. Another disappointing moment would be cracking into a master lock chest and finding scrolls that are too expensive to be sold to any of the merchants.   lol beautiful. I love how Bender's expression is like "you about done?"   I remember this street! I remember they had a transgender theme going on when I visited the place for the weekend trip.  Do they celebrate the Independence Day for the US? I'd like to think this is something special between us Canadians and Brits :3   That is absolutely incredible. So well drawn!  I know Natalie Dormer is a bit old to be Margaery but I think she's been spot-on for the role this whole series. I've loved her since the Tudors! She's one of the actresses that are hot enough to make me question my heterosexuality.   Sure is, he gave her a good tumble.   Mr. Peppy wouldn't hurt anybody! HE'S VEGETARIAN ;-;   I'm not saying you should hate him. Just a hypothesis on why some may dislike him. Personally I think he's a great guy, just not a big fan of his recent vids.   "FREE HAT FREE HAT"   Nah I can see where you're coming from. There are some games that are fun to watch other people play, mainly horror games. Probably because I'm too much of a wuss to play it myself xD  Other games like Hearthstone, I don't really get the appeal of watching LPs. Northernlion's Binding of Isaac / Spelunky videos are exceptions though. His soothing voice is charming.   Ditto. This is also why I can't be too harsh on Pewdiepie. I don't like his videos but he's done some good work with his popularity.   I think it's his fans (some of them anyway) that fueled antipathy. Going to other people's videos and saying pewds did this first, or "like this comment if pewds brought you here" kind of thing. I'm sure fans of other youtubers do this too, but Pewdiepie has the most subscribers so they're bound to stand out.   I respect other peoples' preference for LPers (I don't enjoy Pewdiepie's videos, for instance) but for me what sets apart Markiplier from other "screaming" youtubers is that he makes commentary while yelling. Sure, he gets super dramatic at times to the point where it gets annoying but he does provide some perspective on the gameplay.   "Fo-er my suppa, I er, uh, want a party plattaa"   Is this your girl/boy? So beautiful 3 I love the heart-ish shape on the chest!   "Hey, I know who you are!"   I'm assuming "cure disease" potions work for all maladies but yeah, the lack of toilet paper is definitely disconcerting. Also the lack of wi-fi.  I guess I'll just try to have fun slaughtering dragons and giants... :/   BB was the first TV show to make me really hate the protagonist in the end because of his relentless justification. such a good series.   Lanaaaaaaaaaaa   "Omg please chase me down with your dogs"  Yeah he's gonna bitch slap me with a restraining order.   I imagined these popping up as the Sims achievement haha   Well that's not a nice thing to say to someone who seems happy with his/her decision.   For me usually  Athenes - dealing with high ap nuker (LB, Syndra, etc.)  Morello - dealing with ap tanks (namely Swain) + when you need extra CDR but rather get mpen boots.   I should stop investing so much in kitty beds and sofas... This is pretty much all cats need.  Also she would make a great submission to /r/photoshopbattles.   I... like Meth! *hehehehe* I... like Meth! *hehehehe*   You just doomed that guy! RIP his social life. /s  Thanks for being a cool dude to the newbie. I remember when I started out I was really nervous about playing with other people because I lacked confidence.   Something tells me you are also a fine archer.   LotR + TES? Yes please. Well done.   This made me smile. I'm not OP, but thank you.   I should despise Roose Bolton to the death but because it was portrayed by [Michael McElhatton](http://pre10.deviantart.net/402d/th/pre/i/2015/099/9/0/michael_mcelhatton__got_premiere__by_valeria122-d8p40xc.jpg) I found it a teensy bit difficult. He looks like a very well-aged Daniel Craig. (I love both of them.) He might not fit GRRM's description of Roose Bolton's appearance in the books to the last detail, but his voice is perfect.   I've found that a lot of League fan artists are fond of Draven! You really captured his persona well. Zed is a bit more psycho than I would like him to be but that's one of the reasons that make this illustration so great. Hope to see more of you!   I love how the typeface matches that in the game! Really gives it an authentic feel.   If Younger Robert, then for sure!   lol my nerdiness peaked and I checked Infosphere. According to [the transcript](http://theinfosphere.org/Transcript:The_Honking), it was indeed in singular. I'll leave my persistence here now :p   Op, you may have to get your oven checked. One is toasted only on one side and the other is burnt!   Me too. Does he say Eagle Eye"s"? To my recollection he just said eagle eye.   Also looks incredibly wise. I would like to get some life advice from this dog.   To be fair, I love South Park and agree with a lot of its messages. Even in that episode the actual conclusion wasn't so TRP. :/   Irish me up anytime cap'n.   Delish! Diamond ProX is another fine looking young man but not an exemplary sportsman unfortunately. :(   Seems shopped, but I agree he looks dapper as fuck in vests.   "How come we're not ascending? ... Oh, right, the sins..."   3 I melt. I hope they are adopted together!    Incoming belly rubrubs followed by swift retaliation :p RIP white clothes. Mine on the other hand sheds white fur like crazy which complements my black clothes quite well...    All men pay for sex.  I start reading this sentence and those following it in Butters's voice in the Bottom Bitch episode. "He has to listen to her motherfucking problems because she kisses him!"   I doubt OP in the thread would see this, but I've dated guys who were shorter than me and in those cases there were always a turning point for me. At first I was just good friends with them and then I suddenly started seeing them as bf material. One was a romantic poet sort of guy, and the other protected me from a stalker. That kind of turning points.  I hope girls eventually give this a guy a chance. You never know how things will turn out.   lol yeah. And I love how he just said "wat" after the Darq copypasta. Pure definition of dumbfounded.   No. everywhere else in the world those are known as Middle Eastern countries you guys are calling them Asian to be politically correct and ultra sensitive.  I didn't realize calling them Asian would be deemed an act of political correctness.  Also it took me too long to look up and see that this was a TRP thread. I shouldn't have tried to understand.   My Reddit level is way too low. I recognized only two or so.   He reminds me of Pewdiepie. In a good way!   This is a great rule to live by. Thank you!    Too bad a person's talent is not a measure of his/her character. I like Mel Gibson's movies too.   LOL I was caught up on that too. I wish my school offered that kind of class when I was younger. Seems like a sweet course.   He also reminds me of Jack Gleeson, who was pretty much hazed by every person he came in contact with in public. I guess in his case it just showed how terrific he was at acting the part of Joffrey but I can see that tearing him down until he became sick and tired of being recognized everywhere. It's funny how some people want to act for glamour and others just want to act and be left alone otherwise.    You're not alone. It may not be a fitting installment of a series loved and revered by many, but the movie itself was okay. Of course there's always a chance that I may have fangirl'd too much over the presence of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson.   I love her mom (dad?) is like "not this again". xD She's adorable.   Better yet, have them draft a contract for future uses. "Every other Saturday shall be a Family Saturday and Party B shall comply with whatever Party A deems appropriate"!   Same here. I think we are the lucky few. Did they put you to sleep by any chance? I was asleep the whole time and just felt general numbness when I woke up. A couple of Tyrenols later I was 4 wisdom teeth and pain free.  My friends who had local anesthesia on the other hand weren't so lucky :(   Drama within drama, a [student](https://np.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/39vqnk/dentists_of_reddit_are_you_happy/cs76eeb) of the discipline challenges the currence practice.   Oh yeah, I guess you could look at it that way too. With so many FPH lurkers around I'm prone to assume pics like this were posted with sinister intention...   Uggh I see. Thank you. I got my wisdom teeth pulled out and I couldn't be happier with the result. Sure it was expensive, but I'd had to go through months of pain beforehand and felt so free when they were out. I can't imagine why anyone would be this so stupid and childish over something like this.    What is "TRP lingo" that the other commenter was talking about? I tried browsing through TRP once and I just couldn't finish reading one thread...   I'm glad FPHers are getting some of the wittiest insults I've seen, but I resent the fact that this photo was posted to /r/funny. :( At first I thought the title might have been totally unrelated (maybe because of her expression) but noooo it had to be about her having a heavy bf. Yeah that's REALLY funny. /s   GoT reference.   Nothing.   It's unrelated to the drama itself but wow Chris Pratt married Anna Faris? That's awesome! I don't know why exactly but I really like her. They should make a really fun couple to hang out with.   that looks amazing. I love cheesecake that use Oreo crumbs for the crust part and this has a whole Oreo on top! Your brother is very lucky.   I don't think he makes for a better Daario (I wanted him to be more exotic) but this guy is gorgeous as hell.   Aww that is just adorable... I am a cat person but I'm so envious of people who live with dogs whenever I see something like this.   I love how you reply with a disapproving face every single time. I like you.   I'm going to start doing this... only with a real bell!   Aww. Did the original one from the show have bubbles as well? I only remember the pipe...  	104
 Coming off of them was hell because you quit cold turkey. I did this a few times with SSRIs - I don't know why. My depressed brain convinced myself to quit each time. And each time I felt more depressed.   Have you discussed these worries with your psychiatrist? They should be able to talk you through the details. Also, I have found that a little bit of medication gave me the motivation to help myself. It gave me a little boost.  Just be smart about your meds. Take it according to the prescription and notify your doctor if you want to adjust dosages or come off of it - and do it, slowly.   Also, I find it's good to have a buddy to take the role of encouraging you with your meds. I always got to this point where I said the meds aren't working, this is stupid, I'm done taking these. So I enlisted the help of a friend to remind me to take them and to tell me it's good for me. Now I've been on them for about 8 months and my life is so much better.   Please discuss these concerns you have with the psychiatrist. I do not believe you are in a rut because of the meds you previously took. It is probably due to the stress you have been under, and that's okay. The medication will help you be able to help yourself.   Good luck! Stick with it.    I just started an internship this summer, which has been pretty huge for me. A year and a half ago I was pretty much bedridden. I would panic walking down the street.   Anyway, I got on an SSRI, got back into school, and somehow found my way into a really great internship program. I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt.   Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous.   So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided.   I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do.   I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie.   I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start.   So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys!    What are you doing currently?   Depression is such a mystery to me sometimes. There are days where I feel amazing, and then days where I feel so horrible I don't know what to do with myself. I have to remind myself that I have progressed.   I wouldn't consider it a battle against yourself. Your depression is certainly a part of your life but it doesn't define you. It's a battle against your depression - which can feel like losing an uphill battle.   What I think I'm going to start doing is making a jar where each day I write something positive about myself and about my life. Something small, like, I enjoyed the beautiful weather today. Depression makes us pick out the negative in our lives so that we forget the positive things. Then, when I'm feeling depressed, I'll read through these and try to remember how I felt when I wrote them down. I'm hoping that will help me get through bad times.    Haha right?! Now when I fuck it up I'm like screw it, it's an egg scramble.   Sure! I'm taking 50mg of sertraline which is a fairly low dose. I started out at 25mg, they increased me to 50mg and I started seeing improvements. I started on medication and decided to stick with it because I wanted to pass my semester. I had previously dropped out of school and I really wanted to finish my degree. I experience a lot of classroom anxiety so I would avoid going to class. On the sertraline, boom, anxiety in the classroom gone. It took me about 3 months to get to that point - so give your medication time to work.  I had no weight gain on the medication at all. In fact, it has probably helped my eating habits because I used to binge eat when I was very depressed. I have since stopped doing that.   The side effects I do experience are issues acheiving orgasm. Possible TMI but last time I attempted an orgasm it took me 45 minutes! I still experience sexual satisfaction with my partner but I have just accepted that it will be more difficult for me now. I also experienced mild nausea when I first started taking the pills but that went away within a week.   My advice - stick with it. SSRIs need a few months to kick in. But they gave me that little boost. I still struggle with depression - it isn't a magic cure all - but it seriously helped me. Go with what your doctor recommends. Good luck!   I used to do this when I lived in Chicago. I was going on the train with my friend one time, and she's like, "What the fuck are you doing? Let people off first." It was a huge realization. I don't know why the fuck I tried to shove my way in before.    Yes, it's a way to help depression without medication, or alongside it. You basically retrain your way of thinking by recognizing irrational thoughts. [Here](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336) is a link to it!   I couldn't make an omelette. It sent me into a horrible depression that lasted nearly the entire day. At the end of the day I was laughing about it! I still can't make a fucking omelette.   It's such a great feeling when you start helping yourself! We're all proud of you!   I do sigh a little every time I see the advice of "volunteer." It's so common when people are depressed. The idea is that if you have people who rely on you, you will build self-esteem and confidence. What happened to me, is I volunteered to teach English as a second language. I had to go into someone's home and help them with English. It was a really stressful situation. I had a lot of anxiety and I ended up quitting it because it made me feel guilty all the time!  It's not bad advice, but it's not the depression cure all people want it to be.    It is a scary road! Take small steps. Hopefully you'll see a lot of these ideas aren't actually scary, and can make you feel better!   Why do you think you will ruin someone else's happiness?   I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault).  It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure.  Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this?  In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy.   BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. Not you. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset.   If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time. You can't change your family and how they react to you, but you can change how YOU react to what they say. You don't need to feel guilty for your depression because you did not choose to have it.   I am on an SSRI and I have found that incredibly helpful. You can see a primary care physician and they will usually prescribe you an SSRI. If you're open to medication I would look into it!   Good luck!   I'm glad you liked it!    Well, do you want to go out and do things? I guess it would be helpful to figure out why you don't want to. My reasons for not doing things is because I assumed something negative would happen or I wouldn't enjoy myself. I really just had to lower my expectations or try to find something positive about the experience. I really don't like going out to restaurants with other people - it makes me feel very anxious and typically I feel like I can't eat anything. But I try to focus on when I *did* enjoy going out. What did I like about it? I liked talking with others and figuring out who they are. I liked talking about movies and books. Sometimes I just have to pretend.   A lot of the time, even after going out, I have to force myself to think of something positive. I think a lot of my problem is 1, anticipatory anxiety of the event, which leads to 2, experiencing anxiety during the event, which leads to 3, viewing the event as negative and confirming that I just should not go out and I will never enjoy it.   Accepting you may not like to go outside and it might not be fun, I think, makes it easier. When I was younger I used to have the persona of the negative, angry one of the group. I would be sarcastic and make jokes. I think this was a self-defense mechanism I was using because I was anxious. By joking around and being sarcastic, and being negative about being out, made it much easier to enjoy myself.   As far as tactics, it really depends on what it is. I find that sitting and meditating for 10-20 minutes has helped my overall anxiety and ability to adapt to certain situations. I have created a sort of imaginary place of relaxation in my head. No one else can get there, and it's very green, sunny, but shaded with trees, and I imagine myself floating down a small river by canoe. I always imagine this scenario in any case where I am stressed out. I think bringing back this image over and over again strengthens it's relaxation response in my head. So, it might be worth a try.   Another thing would be to forgive yourself if you don't want to go out. You don't HAVE to. I remember I told my therapist I was worried because I didn't have many friends. He said, why do you need friends? Well, I would feel normal if I had a lot of friends. We worked on it and I realized, I don't have a lot of friends because I simply don't want a lot of friends. I'm fine with my family and my SO and my pets. I wasn't trying to get more friends because I wanted it, it was because I felt like maybe I would more mentally normal if I did.   Another thing would be simply repetition to get your mind used to going out. What kinds of things did you used to enjoy? Shopping? Going to restaurants? Going for a walk? Do those things a few times a week. Don't have any expectations. Allow yourself to hate it if you want. I find that the more I do something, the more and more I am comfortable with it. I might not love it. But I don't experience anxiety after a while.   I hope that makes sense!   Well you have a bunch of options too if you didn't learn much in college. You could learn a trade, apply for a different type of job - a lot of places only require a bachelor's degree and you can pretty easily get into another career, you could go for a totally different degree, get a master's, or join the military! Just know that with the military, you're stuck there for 4 years. I know my ex loved the brotherhood aspect. He really missed it when he got out. He had ADD so it was a good environment for him.   That's pretty awkward about your mom saying what happened to her "happy boy." She sounds a bit self-centered. Maybe she's trying to guilt you into feeling better by telling you those things. Maybe she blames herself a bit too for how you feel, and is acting out because of that.   What does your dad say? Do you have another relative you can talk to? I know when I was going through my divorce I could NOT talk to my mom at all about it. She had zero sympathy for me and was really mean, so I started talking to my aunt. She was a lot better to talk to and she let me vent without judging me. My ex cheated on me and my mom would find a way to tell me it was MY fault because I didn't choose the right guy to marry. Wat.   I would skip trying to get your mom to understand unless you can convince her to stop guilting you because she makes you feel WORSE. I would just tell her you know, you don't HAVE to be social all the time. You don't HAVE to be happy just for her sake. Honestly her behavior kind of sets off a lot of red flags for me! She sounds like a lot to deal with even if she is well-meaning.    Dunno why you were downvoted, that's great advice.    For breakfast, I eat 2-3 eggs, scrambled, which cooks up in less than 3 minutes. I put this over whole-wheat toast. Lately I've been heating up some canned diced tomatoes - the italian style - and putting that over the eggs.   If you really don't have time in the morning, hard boil some eggs ahead of time and eat 2-3 in the morning with some salt.   Sometimes I'll eat some avocado and salsa too.    When my stomach acts up I eat a lot of soup. Chicken with veggies in chicken broth does the trick. You could throw some rice in there too, or egg noodles.    I can't imagine this not being filling.   Yay! I'm glad!   You guys are cute. Firstly - stop thinking he saved your life. Give yourself some credit girl. You two have helped each other, but it's what you do in your own brain that helps you feel better.   I think you just have a lot of issues with self-esteem. That's something that you have to learn - how to learn to be okay on your own. Let's say he did leave you for someone prettier - why would that upset you so much? If he was the kind of person to leave you for a prettier girl, is he the kind of guy you want?   People can add happiness to your life, but people come and go. You can only truly rely on you. You say he is your number 1 in your life...well, YOU should be your number one. Focusing on yourself, bettering yourself, trying to make yourself happy - that is a very attractive trait to have. And if he does leave you, or your relationship ends for some reason, don't sweat it. You're 18. When I was 18, I thought I had found my soul mate. I married my high school sweetheart. By the time I turned 23 I was divorced. I don't regret it, because it made me learn a few things about life. Just relax, have fun with him, and if you go to college, and things change, don't worry about it.   If you feel bad for venting, try venting to someone else. I felt a little bit like this with my current partner. It just went away with time really - and the time that I do spend with my partner I want to be a positive experience. I rant a little bit but I don't let it take up our whole time together, you know?  Good luck! You're young. Work on improving your self-esteem and doing YOU for YOU rather than someone else.    Oof. I feel you on the "didn't want to be dragged down with me," story. I had an ex-husband who dealt with my depression by cheating on me and telling me he was going to "help" my mental problems by leaving me. Now that I think about it, my first boyfriend broke up with me after I confided in him that I was very depressed - all the way back in middle school. That sucked!  As far as the army goes, obviously your parents care about you and infantry can be dangerous. Having been married to someone in the military, I would definitely suggest looking into a job that will prepare you more when you get out - like intel. Your parents may not like it, but it's your life. Talk to people in the army and figure out if it would be right for you.   Why are you worried telling your parents about "the truth"? Do you think they won't believe you? I think opening up about how you feel would do you a world of good. Make an appointment with a therapist. You can just go one time if you wanted. Tell your cat, or your dog. I do this sometimes - I probably would seem crazy to someone else, but I will tell my cat my problems if I don't want to tell someone else.   Out of all of the people I have told about my depression, maybe 5% of them reacted in a way I would deem negative. Most people understand or want to help. Sure, my ex-husband was kind of a bastard, but he doesn't define everyone. My parents took a while to get on board, and I still don't think my dad fully understands, and my mom keeps telling me my anxiety will go away if I do a cleanse because a nurse told her that once, but at least they know. And they care. Maybe they give me misguided advice sometimes, but it's something.    I totally feel you. What I started doing was going on Khan Academy and doing the really easy math problems. It keeps my brain going and makes me feel good about myself. Or, I'll go on Code Academy and do some of the easy stuff like HTML/CSS and Javascript. It's nice, easy, and relaxing.  I used to bog myself down with "I should" thoughts, like, "I should have a degree by now," or "I should be more into politics," or "I should watch all of these boring documentaries so I can tell people about them and they will think I'm smart." It sucks because it makes me feel guilty about what I am doing. But I would say, open your eyes a bit more to the people around you. What do they do? When I was in a deep depressive period everyone around me seemed successful. Everyone had PhDs from Harvard and were curing cancer. Once my depression got better I realized that my brain was just foggy - some people are really successful, but the majority are like us - they have no idea what they are doing. A ton of my friends don't have college degrees. Or they have a kid they can't afford. Or they had to declare bankruptcy. Or they got laid off. Or they have an amazing degree and have an amazing job but they hate it. So opening your eyes to the reality of people's lives around you is a good exercise. And stop looking at people's Facebook pictures and getting depressed - people show you what they want you to see and nothing else (I still do this, guilty pleasure).   What depression is, is an exercise in feeling good about yourself independent of others.  You say society makes you feel like you are being lazy. You say you have potential, which you do. But who do you have this potential for? Is it for society, or for yourself? Depression forced me to learn how to do things that I was good at for me rather than for others. I got into baking recently. I do it because I love kneading bread. I cook bread in a cast iron dutch oven so that when I open the oven and peak in to see the bread it looks magical and crispy and wonderful. I don't even want to eat the bread - once it's out of the oven I'm over it. My freezer is filled with uneaten bread. I don't know what to do with it. My SO tells me I'm nuts. But I don't bake bread for other people. I don't do it to show off my baking skills. No one is really going to see my bread. I don't need to prove to anyone that I'm good at it. For all I know I could be horrible at it. I don't care. If I started baking bread for family members or to prove I can make wonderful tasting bread, I would start to despise it almost immediately. I would get extremely anxious about it. If I baked a loaf that didn't turn out right, I would probably have a mental breakdown and cry for a few hours. But when I bake bread for me...if I open up the oven and it looks wonky, I'll say to myself, "Hm. Well that's interesting." And move on with my life.   Tell your depression to fuck off. It's okay if you don't leave the house all day. It's okay if you sleep a lot. Forgive yourself. Once you lose some of that guilt I think your true potential will shine through. Good luck!   Oooh I love Adriene!   How much is the basmati rice you buy? I love basmati rice but at my grocery store it's really expensive.    Wow that sounds excellent! I'm gonna try this.    How do you get them for free?   I think there will probably be times when I don't want to shave my legs, so I think I'll invest in some decent pantyhose for that occasion. Thanks!   Wow thanks for all the great info. I'll look into Silkies and Shapings. Thanks!   LOL omg. Okay...so I'm not gonna wear them. My mom was the one who told me to wear them in the first place! She's crazy.   These are such beautiful pieces of clothing, but why are they so expensive :( I need to dress business professional for work and I'm super broke from buying clothes. Ugh.   I was also equally clueless but my parents were very helpful. What you can do is, there should be a number on your insurance card, or a website you can visit. From there, you can tell them you need to find a general practitioner in your area, tell them you want a female, and they should be able to provide you with a list of doctors within a certain area that are in your network.   I did this when looking for a psychologist - the guy on the phone actually emailed me a list of people I could see which was incredibly helpful. However, it depends on your insurance.   Alternatively, you could just call up a doctor, or a hospital, tell them you want to find a female doctor/make an appointment, and the receptionist should be able to help you find someone. However, then you need to make sure they accept your insurance.   Check your insurance card! Let us know how it goes :) This is such a common question. I was just telling my parents the other day they should teach us this crap in school!!!  EDIT: Once you've been given a list of people in your network, just call them and tell them you are a new patient. They should tell you if they are or aren't accepting new patients - some doctors aren't. Sometimes they will list that information online too...it's a long process but hopefully when you find a good doctor you can stick with them for a while!   I love how much Beyonce is on this list haha!   So I start a new job where I need to dress business professional. I've never really dressed for a business environment so this is my first foray into heels and pantyhose.   Problem: so I wore pantyhose to my interview and thank god I waited to go to the bathroom until after the interview because after I tried to pull them up I ripped them. I thought, well, I was just too rough, next pair I get I'll be gentle and it will be fine. NOPE. I wore these pantyhose for like maybe three hours, and they have holes already by my knees and heels. What the fuck? These things are the most fragile things and it looks SO horrible to have a hole in your pantyhose.   So what am I supposed to do? Am I just buying shit pantyhose? How much are they supposed to cost? I spent 7 dollars on each pair. It's so fucking aggravating. The holes I got in my pantyhose today weren't even from anything...I was sitting for like 90% of that time. I just can't afford to go through all these fucking pantyhose!   My mom tells me I should wear tights, but that just reminds me of being a little kid, you know? I want nice, sheer pantyhose - can I get that in tights?   Anyway, thanks for the help ladies!  EDIT: Do I even need to wear pantyhose? My mom was convinced I need to wear them, but now she says her friends who work in an office don't wear them - she said, and I quote, "They're old school." Thanks mom. So can I get away with wearing a business skirt and jacket combo without the pantyhose? Thanks!!   That's great! I wouldn't be able to sit through my classes without it. I'm a returning adult student and I have done better this semester than ever before. I'm also starting a new job and I'm so glad I have the Zoloft to help me. It's really made me realize that the only thing holding me back was my anxiety. It's a great feeling.   I'm on 50mg of Zoloft, and its great. I had no side effects except for nausea, which has since gone away. I also take it at night which helped the nausea in the beginning. I had no sexual side effects, which I had with Paxil. I find that the Zoloft really helps quiet my mind. I had bad anxiety in public and it helped quiet the anxious thoughts so I can just focus.   Think positively and give it a chance. It's not going to work immediately, it took me about a month to see a significant change.  Good luck! And if it doesn't work out, once you hit 18 you can try something else.     No, it happens at home as well, but its worse when I'm out with others.   As long as I can remember I have had issues with eating and anxiety. When I was a kid I would hate going to restaurants because I would feel sick, not eat very much, and would go to the restroom multiple times to try to calm down. I also remember my first bad panic attack was right after I had eaten dinner.  I have been to a few doctors and a gastroenterologist. I was put on an acid reducer and they told me I just had acid reflux. I started on an SSRI and thought it would help my stomach problems, but it hasn't. I get really nervous going out to dinner because I know I'm going to either experience a panic attack or severe anxiety. I feel extremely hot and sometimes feel like I have to go the bathroom.   I started thinking maybe I had some food allergy or intolerance, and so my doctor put me on a liquid diet for 3 days. I felt better and then started an elimination diet, but as soon as I started eating food again my symptoms came back. They say when you do the elimination diet you're supposed to feel better and better, but I never felt better. I tested different foods and nothing seemed to cause problems specifically - just eating alone made me feel bad.   So what's the deal? I haven't been able to figure this out and it sucks. I hate feeling so anxious from food. I don't know if it's a physical reaction like a food intolerance or just a mental response. I've also been tested for celiac and the test was negative - I cut out gluten for 2 weeks on my elimination diet. So I'm at a loss. I've had this problem as long as I can remember.    Haha thanks! I love burritos.   I was considering seeing a derm - not sure about finances but I think my insurance should cover most of it. Are there any side effects to the Clindamycin?   I have heard of this study before. What's weird is that I was on a ketogenic diet (20g of carbs or less a day) for three months to lose weight. I didn't notice any change in my acne. I wonder if I would need to continue the low-carb diet for long? Or maybe some other food is at play here...   Hm...well I did include them one by one, and they do help - for a while. But like I said, every few weeks I'll have bad skin. Is it possible the products could cause this? I assumed products that clog my skin would consistently clog my skin.  What products would you recommend I cut? I didn't have my AHA toner for a few days and my skin was just awful, so I don't want to cut that. But I could experiment going with the snail bee essence, because I'm not sure it really does much.   Hi everyone! Here is my routine:  **AM:**  * Rinse face with water * Silk Naturals Super Defense Serum * Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence * Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion * Cerave PM * Biore Watery Essence Sunscreen  **PM:**  * Double cleanse with sunflower oil and Cerave Foaming Cleanser * Sometimes cleanse again with Neem Oil * Silk Naturals AHA (wait 20 minutes) * Stridex in the red box (wait 20 minutes) * Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence * Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion * Cerave PM  I occasionally use sheet masks and do a mint julep mask once or twice a week. If I have acne flare ups I will use a benzoyl peroxide cream (5% or 10%).   So my skin seems to be affected by some factors I haven't figured out yet. I have followed this routine for over six months. It has really helped my skin texture. However, I will have great skin for a while, and then I will have 5-6 active pimples or closed comedones will randomly appear. These will last a week or two, and then my face will recover.   So, what am I missing? My diet is fairly consistent (I don't eat great, but I'm on a college budget), and I drink water. Nothing seems to change from one week to the next. My flareups don't coincide with my periods either, and I'm on birth control (which hasn't really helped my acne in any way, but hasn't made it worse). So what factors am I not considering? What else can I add to my routine? Should I look into possible food triggers?   My mother was telling me that she thinks it's because I drink a lot (I drink probably 3-4 nights out of the week, but never to excess), and I also eat a lot of carbs. Could this be a factor? I am a healthy weight despite my crap diet haha.   Anyone have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it!!!   If you don't want to spend money on a test, you can do an elimination diet at home. [This](https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/sites/default/files//webfm-uploads/documents/outreach/im/handout_elimination_diet_patient.pdf) is the document my doctor gave me.  As you can see, you essentially eliminate all possible allergens or intolerances from your diet. No alcohol, no caffeine, no corn, no wheat, no dairy, etc etc. You are extremely limited in what you can eat. After you practice this diet for 2 weeks, your symptoms should disappear. Then, you can add in certain foods that are common triggers. I.e. dairy.  It's very comprehensive. And, except for buying food, it's free! You just get to experiment with your body. And, hopefully you can pinpoint what foods trigger skin problems.  Good luck! You can PM me for more information, especially on what foods you should eat.   Oh okay, I'll try the oil - I don't ever spray with oil. And I'll try doing the bulk ferment in the fridge. How long is too long in the fridge? If I go longer than 48 hours is that bad?   Okay cool. Next time I bake I will try this!   How do you cover the dough to prevent it from drying out? Or should I just not leave it out overnight to prevent that? Thanks!   Wow okay, weird. I know some recipes say to bulk ferment in the fridge, but I figured this recipe would be easier. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks!   I made this basic sourdough loaf with this recipe that I got [here](https://www.culturesforhealth.com/basic-sourdough-bread-recipe). I mixed it up at night (around 9PM), kneaded it until window pane, and then set it up in a proofing basket above my fridge which is a good 70-75 degrees. I covered it in plastic wrap and went to bed.  When I woke up this morning, the dough had expanded over the proofing basket. It had this weird crust on it even though the plastic wrap was on it. Inside the crust the dough look strange - like my sourdough starter does. It looked like the gluten development had broken down overnight.   Did I use too much sourdough starter? My starter has been particularly active lately. I ended up punching down the dough and reshaping the loaves. The bread was alright, but the crumb was very dense - probably from the second reshaping I assume.  So where did I go wrong? I was really confused that my dough had the hard crust on it - I assumed the plastic wrap was very air tight.   Thanks for the help!   I'm an atheist.   I've dealt with depression for about 8 years now. I have been on and off different SSRIs. Currently I take 50mg of Sertraline, and have been on it for about 6 months. I have improved, and for some reason because I have improved my psychiatrist has stopped increasing my dosage. Is this normal?   I don't see a therapist currently. I saw many therapists in the past but I really don't enjoy it, don't like spending the money, and never found it to be very helpful.   I have made a few life changes within the past year - I got out of a bad relationship, changed career paths, have become very successful in school, and have made a few friends and become more social.   But I do all of these things and still feel very, very depressed. I'm getting scared that I will be like this forever. I have developed a lot of fears over the years - planes, illness, death, driving with other people, restaurants, large crowds, needles. The list of the things I'm afraid of keeps getting bigger. I don't know what to do. I'm stressed all the time and I don't know how to relax - typically I only really relax if I'm drinking a lot.   What other things can I do to get better? Will I always be depressed?    Wow, you look great. How did you get past your depression without medication? I have been on an anti-depressant for about half a year now and have noticed some improvements, but I still struggle with a lot of the physical symptoms of depression and anxiety. I have really bad days still. How did you motivate yourself to go to the gym?    Awesome! My family owns a business that employs a lot of mechanical engineering interns. I'm taking a mechanical engineering course as a gen ed req and it's pretty interesting. I actually really like 3D modeling too!   What kind of engineering?   I switched out of English to Comp Sci. Everyone is like, oh, you must have needed more of a challenge. No. English was so terrifying for me. I did well, but it was stressful, and my god the papers. Comp Sci is hard but at least I enjoy doing it.    Depression is serious, please get help. Your school probably has great resources for mental health. At my school I got into counseling and got prescribed an SSRI. I'm doing so much better and I have my school to thank!  A part of working through depression is being okay with failure or admitting you need help. Is there a classmate you could ask to help you?   Let me know if you need help with anything! I don't know much about electronics but I'm pretty well versed in what depression can do to someone. PM me if you want!!   What subject? I'm studying computer science so I feel the same way sometimes.   I totally know how she feels, I always think mechanics will think I'm stupid or take advantage of me. I don't know anything about cars!   Awesome!! Thanks for the info.   Wow, they're beautiful!    I use about 10oz starter to 4oz water and 4oz flour. So I need to reduce the amount of starter or increase flour and water to hit your percentages?   Hmm I don't really know what that gak feels like, but I may need my starter to be thicker. Thanks for the info!   Thanks, I'll try that. I wonder why it would be affecting it now, when before the starter was doing well.   I measure by weight, 4oz water to 4oz flour. What should the consistency of the starter be?   I've had a starter for about a month now. About two weeks ago I put it in the fridge and only fed it about four times, so twice a week.  Before I had it on the counter and it was doubling between feeds and was nice and bubbly.  So I want to do some baking so I put it out on the counter, and now I'm feeding it twice a day with AP flour and water from the tap. Its bubbling and has a great smell, but its not rising. The temperature in my kitchen varies, but for the last two days its been generally 75 degrees because I was cooking a lot.  What other things could I be doing wrong? Should I keep feeding it twice a day or once a day? I started giving it some rye flour because I heard that helps.  Thank you!!!   Flair.   I don't know why people are even trying to argue this. It is weird as shit to eat the skin of an onion, literally no one does that.   Because they don't give a shit and short hair is less maintenance.   Tetris is always fun!   I like this idea! I'm going to try it next time I'm anxious!   You have a few options. Are you doing anything currently to help reduce it?   I like Amlactin lotion or the new Gold Bonds Rough and Bumpy Lotion. You need to keep up a constant routine to keep it at bay. I use exfoliating gloves on my KP and then use a moisturizer like Amlactin. Keeping the area shaved, exfoliated, and moisturized will help reduce its appearance.   You can also do a sub search for more information.   I've been hearing about how different products treat acne at different levels of the skin. How accurate is this? So I'm using an AHA now and I'm getting a few whiteheads popping up, and I read that those are pimples that were just below the surface, but if I want to treat all of the underlying acne I need to add a retinoid. So...will I still get acne even using an AHA and BHA? It grosses me out thinking about acne lying underneath the surface of my skin.    I really think it depends on your skin. I think a lot of the time when people argue against lots of products, it's because if they did use a bunch of products one of them was probably causing breakouts/irritation. More products = more chances of your skin responding poorly, especially if you have sensitive skin.  My routine is pretty long because I have lots of things I want to fix. Layering products has helped not only with my acne and skin texture, but my skin is so hydrated and I never have issues with dryness or oilyness like I did before when I did nothing for my skin.   Skin is very personal. I use lots of different products and it works good for me because I have slowly added them in - it's taken maybe half a year to get to this point? Some people want a short, quick routine, and that's fine!    I would try switching toothpastes, the SLS in regular toothpaste can cause some people to breakout.    I don't really feel like it's excessive. If you love makeup and you've been collecting makeup for a while, it makes sense to have that much. I like these kinds of videos.    That's so great. I'm glad you're mentioning therapy. I gained about 40lbs post divorce and I was eating and drinking to cope. I went to therapy, started on medication, changed some things about my life, and I am in such a better place and I lost the weight!   Even mild depression benefits from therapy and medication.    That's scary!! Good job on being such an inspiration!   It sounds good, if a bit pricy. You can look products up on cosDNA for potential irritants or acne issues.  I've heard Nivea creme is great, not sure about availability though. If you are purchasing online you could get Cerave as well, I find it very affordable.   To repair your barrier, check out [this](http://blog.skincare-addiction.com/barrier/) link on the subreddit blog.   I would caution against using an AHA if you want to repair your barrier. As the article I linked suggests, use a gentle cleanser, moisturize, and wear sunscreen everyday.   For product recommendations, I use Cerave PM which is excellent. It has niacinamide in it which will help with PIH. I have also used the Cerave moisturizer that comes in the tub and I quite like that as well. I have started using the Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion (you can find it at Walgreens in the US) in addition to the Cerave PM and it's quite moisturizing.   You can find more product recs for moisturizer in the sidebar, I personally love Cerave but people sensitive to fatty alcohols should avoid it. I also used to put a thin layer of Vaseline over my moisturizer at night - this seals in moisture and helped keep me hydrated during the harsh winter months.    It is hilarious to me that the classification of ponchos causes offense. Controversy on /r/knitting lol!   What is it then? Looks like a poncho to me.   How did you get into lifting weights? I'm a woman who wants to start but I'm very intimidated by the gym for anything other than an elliptical.   Okay, I'll work up slowly instead of switching to everyday right away. I'm thinking every other day should be OK.   Thank you!!! I only ask because I was using Alpha Hydrox as my AHA and it broke me out. I initially thought I was just purging but it was causing acne in weird places :(   Here's my routine:  **AM**  * Rinse Face * Silk Naturals Super Serum  * Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence * Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion * Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion * Cerave PM OR Cerave in the tub (I have both) * Neutrogena Dry Touch SPF 30  **PM**  * OCM with mineral oil  * Cleanse with Cerave Foaming * Pat face with Thayer's Witch Hazel  * Stridex pads in the red box - wait 20 minutes * Silk Naturals 8% AHA - wait 20 minutes * Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence * Hado Labo Replenishing Lotion * Mizon All-In-One Snail Repair Lotion * Cerave PM * If skin needs it, light layer of vaseline  I introduced everything one product at a time and patch tested everything. I'm going to be replacing my sunscreen once it's out with something that has a higher SPF and that isn't so greasy.   Questions:  1.) How often should I be using the 8% AHA? I have a small sample bottle that I have been using sparingly about 3 times a week. I've ordered the full bottle and once I get it, should I use it every day? I currently use the Stridex everyday with no issues and no dryness.   2.) How is my order? Do I need to wait at all after applying the Super Serum? My motivation for this product is to reduce the appearance of acne scarring and improve my skin's appearance - has anyone had any success with this serum?  3.) Whenever I apply literally anything on my neck I get acne. It's really annoying. Is it okay to just leave this area alone and only apply sunscreen? Products that are fine on my face do not work well on my neck - so I assume it's too sensitive.   4.) I got this patch of acne on my butt region. I applied Stridex immediately after I noticed it, and the acne went away pretty much overnight. Now I am left with red bumpiness that isn't going away. What's the deal? I apply Alpha Hydrox lotion to my body, so if I put it on my butt will it help at all? I shower everyday and exfoliate the area.   5.) I woke up today with a pimple by my eyebrow, and I was really excited because it's been a small bump forever and I believe the AHA caused the pimple to surface. So my question is, how long do people normally purge with an AHA?   I know that's a ton of questions, but I'd really appreciate some insight! I think I'm really close to having a perfect routine for my skin.    I have one of these masks on right now haha! My skin doesn't mind it. And I like the smell!   So I started using the silk naturals AHA toner every other day, in addition to my Stridex pads every day. I've been breaking out, which I assume is purging. How long should this go on before I stop breaking out? I'm wondering how long I should continue to use the product. I am not breaking out horribly, maybe 3-4 small whiteheads you can barely see.   I'm using up the sample bottle of it and I'm wondering if I should invest in the large bottle. My skin texture has definitely improved but like I said I have a few whiteheads in areas where I normally get acne. Thanks!   I'm not sure about the zinc oxide and the propylene glycol. Or sulfur actually! They have mostly similar ingredients - like the bentonite. I would just experiment. You can look up ingredients on cosDNA to see about any irritants.    Do you have any info on ingredients in the Walgreens brand masque? I looked it up and could not find anything. There is probably a difference - check ingredient lists.    That is...disgusting.  	90
 I liked it :)   I've played that mission dozens of times and I just learned that today   Fair enough. Thanks.   Thank you for the long reply. You're very kind :) it assuaged several of my concerns   I'm sitting here at college orientation, and we're scheduling tomorrow. I'm very nervous, mainly because it's my future I'm beginning to decide on (I know I always have the option to change it). Being an actuary has always appealed to me, but I've got so many concerns, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on them. Will I have time for a family? A social life? Will this take over my life?  Edit: does anyone have any actual advice?   Thanks for the reply, this really helps. Appreciate it.    I have enough money to unlock any base-game gun (no dlc), but I absolutely cannot find a set of skills that works for me to survive on death wish. My dodge build is pitiful, and my heavy build barely works on very hard. Can anyone help?   Yeah, definitely take them to the humane society   Max ammo, nuke, fire sale   This is awesome :)   Congrats!    The account name is John, so that pretty much confirms that this is potato salad trying to make first contact with us   I've never really played basketball in my life, but I really want to start. So if you get an answer, I'd like to know too!   145! Thank op       Not sure this is the right subreddit bud   Run upstairs to see if I can pee and get back down before it hits zero.   You're awesome for sticking with helping him   Lol poor op   I know the fire station on Fremont and weaver rd has a park next to it with like twelve different calisthenics things   Personally I love it, I play it endlessly. But I can see how it's not for everyone. I'd try to play it at a friends or something first, but if I had to chose again I'd absolutely get it.   Just curious, what reference is that?   I personally love it. And I've just started playing the second map, and while I love it too, I'd say the first one is better.    Thanks!   First, has anyone else noticed that right when you spawn in, a warbird lifts off of the roof of value voltage, almost like they dropped you off. Is there an explanation for that? And second, has anyone figured out how to unlock the ending cutscene?   I'm on the moto x right now, I absolutely love it   I don't feel like sh ruined zombies, I love playing their version too.   Yup!   I just drove home from working there, funny seeing it on here now. I can't get away from Braums :(   Please please please do this again, it's awesome!   Ozy   I really appreciate you asking, I actually just made a therapy appointment with my old therapist who I really liked. Im hoping things go okay. Thank you so much though.    Not fucking well, not fucking well      That was really, really nice of you :) thanks for making my day   I'd love one if there are any left!   Thanks      I'm not the new York NY and I know babe this is a lot of the new York NY and   Great summary, thank you very much.    Hey, I work there! :)     	42
 Long story short, we did prescription drugs in her house. She confessed to her mother and now we can't hangout. What should I do? Should I apologize to her mother?   It makes you feel numbish... We just wanted to feel numb. It sounds stupid but, if you knew our emotional states, it would make sense to you.   One of us took 100, I took 150, my friend took 150. We all feel sick. I take 100 a day normally, and my friend that took 150 normally takes 75. Are we going to be okay?   [Remorse]: If you feel bad   I hate my mother. I hate the way she walks, talks, etc. I hate the way she constantly picks on me when I have friends around. I hate the fact that she always talks about me and my sister as if I'm, less than. "Oh, well, at least I've got another one." I hate the way the house has NO pictures of me. I hate the way she makes me run around like a slave for her. I hate the fact that she left for 11 fucking years and expected to just have a fine relationship with me afterwards, and I hate my mother.    the girl just kept yelling "everyone hates you!" the entire time... I just... I feel so alone. My depression keeps getting worse.   I feel like a fucking failure.   Ex-boyfriend and current best friend. He has depression just as bad as mine and tried to kill himself. When he came back, he put us on a "break". Everything got so overwhelming without him and I tried to take my own life (not just because of him, I have a lot going on without him even around) then, he tried because he thought I was dead... He told everyone "If she kills herself, I'll kill myself, cause I don't wanna live in a world without her". It's all my fault, basically.   I already *had* the best time of my life, and now he's gone, it's said and done. I tried to kill myself (and failed, obviously) just to escape the inevitable downward spiral. Now, I'm just a girl with "psychotic depression" and an extremely pessimistic attitude. The pils? Make me feel like a zombie. I'm empty inside and I just want to die.   I'm 13. I have to say, being in there *sucked*. I learned a little, and gained a lot of fear of ever having to return. I was admitted after trying to slit my wrists due to severe depression and stress after my bestfriend/boyfriend tried to kill himself, only to come back and put us on a "break", my mom hating me, grades dropping, etc. I was officially diagnosed with psychotic depression. The doctors gave me abilify, zoloft, and trazodone for sleep.   My question is, where do I go from here? I've kind of decided that bestfriend/boyfriend is a trigger for me, but I don't know what to do about it, since we're so close. I also just want to make changes, become a *new* and improved me.  	9
 After you finish the last episode the netflix poster changes from Matt in the original black costume, to Matt in the red suit. Pretty cool.    He was busy running lines for his role as Victor Petrov in House of Cards season 4.    I get how my comment could be seen as referring to her ass, but I didn't intend to draw attention to that.I honestly just thought it was interesting that the editors chose to include that shot in the trailer. Black Widow has something of a rotating arsenal, and hasn't been given a staple, sort of character defining weapon, the same way other MCU characters have. I saw the inclusion a shot of these guns as interesting considering this contrast. I think she is definitely sexualized within the MCU, but that really isn't what I was trying to point out. If anything, its indicative of a larger issue of our perception of the character, and perhaps more broadly women in popular films like those in the MCU, that you, and maybe other redditors, would assume I was attempting to make an objectifying observation.    if you look closely at 1:06 you cans see the rectangles on ultrons hand brighten just before he fires his laser    black widow's got some pretty sweet guns at 0:52   Hi everyone,  I am currently working in my application to go on exchange next year, and was wondering if anyone had some tips as to what I should discuss in statement of purpose.  thanks   I think you are being unfair and unreasonably presumptuous. I do attend class, so I know the Prof didnt mention this during lecture, and I didnt expect to hand in this essay late, I just happen to work 30 hours a week on top of taking a full course load. My question really doesnt have a great deal to do with the prof, so much as it does the hours and staffing at Jackman Humanties. I simply want to know if my paper will be stamped as one day late, if the due date is friday, and it is submitted on a saturday. I am worried that it wont be stamped until monday, at which point it will be seen as 3 days late, despite being submitted just one day after the original due date.   thanks, but it says on this courses syllabus to drop the ssay off at jackman haumanites. what im really curious about is: if its due on a friday, and i drop it on a saturday, will it be marked as 3 days late, or just one day late?   hi, the late penalty for a class im taking is the standard 2 percent a day, i know this incudes the weekend, i was wondering how i would go about submitting the paper on the weekend? the syllabus indicates late essays are to be submitted at jackman humanities, if i submit a paper on saturday, will it be marked as if it were handed in on monday? does someone check the dropbox on the weekend?  thanks   Neutral Milk Hotel's early finish is an absolute tragedy.   Yeah, hopefully they're able to adapt the story-line without sacrificing too much of the original ideas. I think Black Panther is a solid choice, as him being foreign and new to the world of the Avengers will position him as unbiased and neutral, and through his eyes the audience will be able to impartially view either side of the civil war. His recent introduction into modern society is a great stand in for Spidey's pure intentions, and  corresponds well with the growing moral ambiguity in the MCU, especially considering the collapse of Shield, and Tony's role in the creation of Ultron.    It looks like Black Panther, aka Chadwick Boseman is essentially going to take the role of Spidey in Cap 3.    has anyone else played Spyro: Year of the Dragon? this reminds me of the games starting area.    maybe fillion would work better as allan scott?    a funnel for butt chugging.   I have a prof who insists that students caught using the internet or checking their phones during lectures will be removed (not from the couse, just from the lecture on that given day) he also has said that he will deny entry to students who are late. does he have the right to do this? are actions like this supported by any university policy?  	16
 The only reason this happens is because I work 7-4 and instant oatmeal exists.  My work provides hot water and disposable coffee cups.  They also have a microwave and I have morningstar veggie sausages that I grab on the way out the door.  It also gives me an excuse to stall work for about 15 minutes while I prep and eat breakfast.   It does at the one near me   I just wish they had a no-cilantro version of rice and I would eat there so much more often :(   Didn't the same thing happen with Fame?   Awesome! Thank you so much for your help.  Can't wait to get started tonight!   Do you think the startbodyweight routine would be better than /r/bodyweightfitness?  I'm pretty sure I'll have trouble with the L-sits   LOL Yeah I was planning on skipping the handstand progression altogether to start out.  One thing I liked about this program vs other bodyweight programs is that it had stuff like assisted squats whereas i've seen other bodyweight programs throw you into bulgarian splits and I'm like "yeah i wouldn't be getting up off the toilet after those"   Liz Lemon is my spirit animal.   I had this exact routine about 6 years ago while I was on vacation from school.  The only thing that helped me was fasting as notoriousrdc said and then getting into a routine and sticking to it.  Also, **your bed is only for sleep and sex**.  Otherwise it will take you forever to actually fall asleep once you are ready to go to sleep because you've been in bed all day watching Netflix and your brain is like "so what, we've been doing this all day..."     Yeah I've already asked around in their Moron Monday thread and they suggested modifying.  Their beginner routine already says to skip certain parts of the routine until you have mastered others.  I'm even going more basic, like doing fewer sets to start out so I don't hurt myself.   Anyone here do the /r/bodyweightfitness beginners program?  Thoughts?  I'm obese (5'5, 235lbs), eating 1500 calories, tons of protein and vegetables, and I want to get strong.  Home workouts work best for me and I've seen people recommend it.  I've also looked into SC at home, but I think I like the bodyweight fitness program better.  I just wanted some opinions.   Got it.  Thanks for your help!     Yup, my dad died very unexpectedly and we had to have a very modest memorial service and cremation because he was unemployed after losing his business in 2006 and my mom didn't get shit because she's an educator.  I also had tons of health issues when I was in high school (including a surgery) and the insurance fought so much of it because it's so shitty.   I feel like I can complete half the things with challenge but the other half takes significant difficulty (which would probably lead to the horrible DOMS).  I'm more than willing to work up to it, though.  See how it goes the first day.  Honestly, it's mostly the lower body.  If my legs don't work I can't function.  I've never had similar DOMS in my upper body.   True.  We would just make traffic worse and have to pay exorbitant property taxes anyways   Well up until 10 days ago it was binge and purge.  But now people know so I guess....nothing really.     Went to Austin for girls' weekend with my two best friends and had a blast.  Walked a ton, it was hot as balls, swam in Barton Springs, took tons of pictures. Looking at the pictures I had some pretty big realizations about my health, though.  My appetite is pretty much gone and any cravings I get are pretty much squashed by looking at those pictures. Plus I have a cruise in December to look forward to and a son who I never want to ask me "Why are you so fat??"  Also, I want to move to Austin.   Same goes for an electric kettle. Check out Alton brown's kettle eggs   I am an obese , full-time-working new mom (as of 9 months ago).  The training guide seems very straightforward.  I have my diet under control thanks to MFP and am eating 1550 calories/day. I don't have any equipment whatsoever.  As I progress, I will be adding to the equipment so I can get in the workouts.  I guess my question is more general fitness-related.  Recently, whenever I've tried any new workout I usually end up so sore two days later that I can't get up off the toilet or out of my chair at work without serious grandma-ing.  It hurts to walk and do everything. The DOMS are so intense that I literally cannot pick up my child to change his diaper.  I'll admit, this usually leads to me thinking "shit, I can't deal with this, I have to be able to function" and am then on the lookout for another routine.  Should I take it easy and maybe not do all the strength sets the first week?     Last week was the first week where this wasn't true.  I work in an office and I had no excuse to not take in a packet of instant oatmeal and some frozen yakisoba noodles and frozen vegetables from costco.  So much cheaper, so fewer calories.  But before this week it's probably been almost every morning for the last 3 years (or at least 3 times per week).  Oh the money I could have saved.  I need to apologize to my husband.   Don't be that dick who cuts off a tractor-trailer with only 2 car lengths of room.  You're risking more than just your own life.     As a wife, I don't see the fucking point either.  Nobody ever goes into our room, we have separate blankets because we're both blanket hogs which makes it doubly complicated.  The rest of the house looks decent, and with a 9 month old son I consider that a fucking accomplishment.   I can't even drink soda anymore.  I'm on a medication that makes anything carbonated taste flat to me (it acts as an inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase, which is necessary for the CO2 (fizz) tasting system).  I was not happy when I discovered this (Diet Coke addict), but I know it's a good thing for my body.      Booyah    I had the same reaction to the heartbeat as you.  Wasn't emotional or anything.  "That's pretty cool!"  I also had the same fears as you regarding not loving my child.    You may not immediately connect with your baby.  It happens, and it's no big deal.  Motherhood may suck for a while, since the first couple of months your baby eats, poops, sleeps, and cries.  How much he/she does of each depends on your baby.  If you put effort into it and make sure you take care of yourself mentally and take care of the needs of your baby you will get there.  You will probably connect with your child.    I had a small group of 3 friends that I constantly texted with before I was married and then we kept in touch until before I was pregnant and now that my son is 9 months.... we're doing a girls weekend this weekend.  We are still the same.  They love my son, they love seeing pictures and seeing him in person and hearing about him.  We still talk and do all the normal things.  I may not have been able to see them as much as I was able to before, but that's ok.  Things change.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.  However, social development is important for your child and that means interacting with other children.  That may mean chatting with their mothers/fathers/guardians and being polite and listening to their conversations while your child learns to play with other children.  I'm being 100% honest with you here in saying that one aspect of being a mother is giving up some selfishness.   There's always the possibility if his wife gained a lot more weight over a certain period of time and other things were affected (like libido) that depression could have a lot to do with it.  A very active person suddenly get depressed, doesn't want to cook for herself, doesn't want to get up and do anything as much, and the weight is very easy to put on in that case.  I would say if his wife gained the weight recently and she's open to seeing a doctor that she go see a GP, get a full hormone and lipid panel and the doctor may ask how she's feeling emotionally and may refer her to a mental health specialist.  That's at least how it went with me.   True.  I used to be one of those people.  My husband still is one of those people sometimes.  I just don't get it anymore.  There are better things I could be wasting my brain power on than who I could get in front of to get home .05 seconds quicker.   As someone in Houston who owns a Prius C, YES.  It's like really? Your balls aren't going to shrink because you let a Prius get in front of you, ya twat waffle.  The number of times people speed up so they can get in front of me in a lane on a freeway (no matter how little room there is in front of me) is mind-boggling.   Something similar happened with my husband.  He had a stuffed animal growing up, Pup-Pup, that he took everywhere.  They had to replace it a few times, but they kept a copy of Pup-Pup at his grandma's house that wasn't used much but stuck around.  Fast forward years later and we find out we're pregnant with a boy.  At the baby shower we open a gift from his grandma and it's the copy of Pup-Pup that my husband had at his grandma's.  It's now in my 9 month old son's toybox.  I hope Pup-Pup ends up as loved as the right-hand Peter Rabbit was   See if it continues to happen or if the 4am wakings start tapering off.  We thought this happened around 4 months but my son started sleeping through the night.  It was awesome.    If she *did* happen to cry it out at 4am, it's ok.  It's happened to all of us and you're not a bad mom.  A bad mom wouldn't feel guilty :)   Keep an eye out for groupons in your area.  I got enough sessions for my underarms for $200, when the original price was like $5k.  It's a ridiculous markup.  Another route to go would be electrolysis, which is TRUE permanent hair removal (laser is not permanent, it will eventually grow back), which can run $80 for an hour session and can take up to like maybe 5 sessions per area   Maybe they can just do the rest of us a favor and stay there permanently   Guys say to be obvious with them and then you do shit like that.  I guess we have to say things like "Hey, I want to have sex with you."   Isn't a Cali King technically not as wide as a King, but it's longer?    At my company, we accrue sick leave at a certain rate per month, adding up to a certain amount of days per year.  If we don't use them, they roll over to the next year.  They do max out at a certain number of days total (like you don't accrue any more after your sick leave reaches 80 days), because my company offers short term and long term disability insurance (free of charge for employees). So if you're needing to be out for that long, why would you want to use all your sick days when you take 2 weeks, then activate your disability?   Yeah my husband works from home and my MIL was a housewife and finds fulfillment in that so she comes over and cares for our 9 month old son. We definitely lucked out.  It's great that you have something similar. Anything helps.    It's worth it to grit your teeth and grow it out for that first time. It doesn't seem to itch as much when it grows after a wax vs after shaving   Wtf just get a Brazilian! Save yourself the time and pain.    This is perfect for me! I'm going out of town this weekend with some girl friends so I will definitely be utilizing this :)   God yes this.  We were so lucky that I got pregnant a few months after I started a decently paying job and our situation is such that we don't have to pay for child care.  I know not everyone is advantageous enough to be in the same position, but make sure you have finances planned out as best as you can beforehand and agreed upon and you are sticking to it before you bring another human into the world.      I can't find this stuff ANYWHERE.  I want to try the lemon cake flavor so bad   I don't want to see any more Alyssa's Secret, I want to see her go away for 6 weeks for All Stars 2 and then a wedding and a honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas!   I'm having a really hard time getting my footing in this working out thing.  I have a 9 month old and work full time from 7am-4pm.  I don't want to miss much time with him so I'm considering doing blogilates' beginner program for 4 weeks since I'm so fucking out of shape, it's been like 18 months since I've been "in shape".  Then maybe transitioning to Strong Curves.  I'm also fucking exhausted.  I admitted to my therapist last week that I have an eating disorder (BN) that has developed over the last 3 months or so, so I'm in therapy and on a medication for that which of course makes me feel even more tired.  But I can do 25-30 minutes a day to start out...    I grabbed this for my house last week and my husband comes out of the bathroom the next day and asks why I hate him. Didn't even realize what I had done.    My husband stopped getting spanked when he threatened to hit them back.  He was big for an 8 year old.   I pay monthly for the bottled water delivery because I'm so picky and it's the only thing that doesn't taste funny to me.     House cleaning service.  A month after my son was born I ended up getting it for myself, she comes once a month and does a fantastic job.  But if someone would've gotten it for me for once before or after the baby was born it would've made a huge difference (she runs ~$80 per visit).    Also, for baby, a rock and play is the best thing ever.  It is like a baby hammock.  We just retired ours at 9 months old because my son has to start sleeping in his crib now (ugh, sleep training) but it was seriously a lifesaver so many times.   ROCK AND PLAY.  Best thing ever.   All of them.  To be fair, the relationships were either high school relationships or my husband.     I consider myself a Christian, my husband likes the ideas of Jesus Christ but isn't anymore convinced that the Christian God is real.  We go to church once or twice a month.  We are very progressive in our beliefs, I actually lean more towards universalism nowadays.  I want to raise him in the community of the church without the shame that I was raised with as a Southern Baptist that was always being told that sex is dirty and evil.    I much prefer the way the Lutheran church handles it.  We had him baptized at 6 months, and when he goes through Confirmation classes around 13 years old or so he can decide for himself if he feels that he wants to continue with his spiritual journey in Christianity or if he wants to move on.  I don't want to pressure him into believing something blindly like I was pressured as a child.   We have a 9 month old son but this is basically what we plan on doing.  Adding chores and taking things he values away, as well as time outs.  My husband and I were both spanked but we feel it was unnecessary, even though we turned out somewhat normal.   Before I had a son I definitely did all the time.  Especially to our cat Evelyn.  There's a song by Josh Ritter called Evil Eye, so we started calling Evelyn "Evil Eye" because she used to howl at night and the song fit her so well:  He’ll laugh and say that he can’t sleep  And he don’t know the reason why  Maybe it’s the evil eye  Oh, that awful, evil eye  Remember how he used to hold you close  Now in the middle of the night  Oh, the evil eye  Oh, that awful, evil eye  Someone must really have it in for him  The way they’re sticking him with pins [claws]  Oh, ooh  Now we sing to our son, and replace any word possible with Rhys.   You would be correct. Definitely a cut.    Thank you so much!  I'll stick to that then :)   I am 235lbs at 5'5.  Obese.  I love weight lifting and have seen results from it in the past, but recently had a kid (ok, 9 mos ago) and am ready to get back to it.    The book suggests I eat 11 x 235 = 2585 calories to lose weight.  I plan on doing a 3 lift week and 3 days of walking, is this still too much to eat?  Also it says to eat 1g of protein for every pound of body weight, not lean body mass.  So I have to eat 235g of protein a day?  The IIFYM calculator says to eat 1880 calories for moderate weight loss with 3 days/week of working out.  I'm just a little confused.  I figure I'll try 1880 this week and if I'm just extremely ravenous I may up it, I guess.   We just installed our SimpliSafe.  It's nice to not have to deal with salespeople.  And that alarm is fucking LOUD.   I know it's been over 2 months since this was posted but I weigh 235 and am obviously overweight. Does that mean I have to eat 235g of protein? Or is it lean body mass? I've heard too much protein can fuck up your kidneys.    I think when Rhys was 3 months I let him have an overnight at my in laws. For the last 3 months he's been going over there once a week. Once I knew they could care for him if needed I was more ok with it. My MIL definitely understood and kinda proved to me she could do everything, including taking a first aid and child/infant CPR class.    7th grade English class. We are now 28, married, with a 9 month old son.    I liked lady in the water...   I am the same way. Then one time I was at my SO's for the weekend and clogged the toilet but the plunger wasn't working. He had to reach a hand into shit water to plunger everything and cracked up afterwards. It's not horrible. He didn't stop loving me. We are married now. Nbd.    If I could, I would eat that cream that they squeeze inside cannoli's with a spoon, and I think that's made with ricotta.  MMmmmm   Which muffins are 100 calories for 4 servings?   Where did you get those tins from?   I'm sort of in the same camp as those people.  I have great hair and lips and my boobs are ok, but I don't really like anything else.  I loathe looking in the mirror because of my weight and have hirsutism from PCOS that makes me look like I have a constant 5 o'clock shadow on certain parts of my face (despite plucking/waxing/lasering).     I don't *like* being called ma'am because I still feel 18, but honestly I don't give a shit as long as it's not insulting in any way.  I've noticed to get my attention some people whose second language is English will say "lady" when trying to get my attention.  Honestly I don't give a crap.   It's been a while since I've posted baby pics on here!

[Here's one with me](http://i.imgur.com/eb0shul.jpg)   I just have one word of advice (from my husband): if you don't connect with the baby immediately, don't worry. Babies are basically pooping potatoes for the first few months. But once they start interacting with you, it's awesome.    Wouldn't it go flat by the time you were done with it (assuming you had no stealing roommate)?   I'm with you on that.  Papa Johns is the best in our area.  Also, there's not a Domino's or Pizza Hut close enough to deliver here, but Papa Johns still shines above them all.  I try to steal my husband's crust to dip in that garlic butter sauce   They're making a second one...   Well other than all the awesome things Texas has to offer, seeing the hissy fits on Facebook from the older conservatives is pretty hilarious right now.    My son went to sleep early so I went to mcdonalds in the lightning storm currently happening for mcdoubles and mini bundts. Just finished them off with my husband while watching American Dad.    There is nothing like having someone understand your thyroid problems. I started a new job in April and my coworker who I share an office with also had half of her thyroid removed and totally gets how, even with medication, I'm always tired.  It's awesome.    Younger babies you just use the Jesus. And if you ever have kids you'll realize they are so much more sturdy than you think. We found this out after my husband dropped our son at 10 days old from about 5 feet accidentally. No harm done.    Oh yeah, there are some companies that recommend sending the necklaces in every few months to replenish whatever bullshit magic wears off to help the teething   I haven't been through potty training our son yet but this is from personal experience.  My #1 tip is if he's not ready and having lots of accidents, don't force him to stay in big boy underwear.  I was forced into panties at 3 years old and was terrified of having an accident, so I held in my poop (also called encopresis).  This led to painful trips to the bathroom and it was a vicious cycle that wasn't fixed until I had sheer willpower at the age of 12.  Now my mom says she should have listened to her friends and put me back in pull-ups.  They had literally tried everything, including rewards, punishments, etc... and nothing worked.  I know this isn't typical, I'm just passing on the information from my mom.     Guess I'm not a Real American^TM then.    I mean when will say, Texas, start issuing marriage certificates to gay couples?   When does this take effect?     I would've so had a crush on you in high school.  As a straight girl it wouldn't have been the first or last time either.    Cooking is an art but baking is a science. If you want to improvise a cookie recipe, be sure you know the science of baking beforehand because it's really easy to fuck it up   You and I have parallel professions. Business Solutions Analyst, 75k, Mathematics degree.    Business Analyst, $75k, Texas   The song from Singin' in the Rain?   Omfg basset hounds are the tits and basset puppies are adorable running sacks of skin.    Toss that shit under the broiler for some cinnamon toast!   I fucking love Peli Peli (shout out to the Huguenot) and this just makes it even more amazing.    According to my doctor (on mobile so can't bring up studies myself) ALL types of hormonal birth controls have been shown to have zero effect on weight.  Yes, the hormones could cause your appetite to increase and if you eat more calories than you need you'll gain weight.  However the hormones in the pill aren't directly causing you to gain weight.  You are still eating more than maintenance.   I will either skip breakfast (yay IF) or have bulletproof coffee to get my morning dose of fats in.  Everything else looks ok, I'd add some more fat in because too much protein can keep you out of ketosis   Downside: many of us are fat.   Seconded!  Good quality food or else you'll be spending $1100 on an emergency vet bill due to urinary crystals.  We used to feed Meow Mix, now we use Blue Buffalo and he hasn't been sick since.   I bought one.... I am going on 3 vacations this year after YEARS of no vacation and dammit, I'm going to use the shit out of that selfie stick.   My son is now 8 months old, and I started seeing positive things from my husband when my son started smiling, so probably around 2-3 months.     He became fucking amazing.  He helps out so much now, and seeing him get excited when our son discovers how to do something new is probably the best thing in the world.  We may be having a little less sex now but I feel that we are connecting more emotionally than before.  I put the less sex on me as I am still really struggling with feeling sexy and losing the baby weight.    I was terrified he would check out because he didn't want kids to begin with but he wanted to marry me more than he wanted to remain child free.  We compromised on one, we probably won't have any more.  The first couple of months were a struggle because newborns are basically pooping, crying potatoes.  But we fought through those months together and now we have the most amazing, intelligent, curious boy and we both adore him and adore each other so much.     Is it ever too late to start signing?  My LO is 8 months and I'm regretting not signing yet, and it seems others his age are already picking it up.   RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers   About the allergenic foods: research is starting to show that it's actually OK to introduce these foods earlier than 1 year, some say as early as 4-6 months.    http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/the_kids/2015/03/peanuts_for_infants_to_prevent_food_allergies_give_infants_all_the_food.html     If I don't have any housework and the baby is away and I have 24 hours to myself: sleep as much as possible is #1 priority.  Other than that, get my nails done, go shopping, sew, binge watch something on Netflix, eat a disgustingly bad for you meal, sleep some more.   They sell them here in Texas.  Many varieties at World Market, and one or two at Target.   Oh god and now there are online Facebook pyramid scheme parties.  I wear fake nails, I don't want your fucking Jamberrys.  Nor do I want your Scentsy, organizers, or anything else you are selling.     Same! I get them because I will bite them down and never stop picking at them. Plus it makes my hands look pretty   Where the fuck do you ladies meet these horrible people that say stuff like this to you?     LOVE IT. currently on my first period after having it.  Cramps beforehand sucked but were manageable. Love not having to worry about a pill very much (I'm still on a low dose BC pill for hormone imbalances due to PCOS).     Dang, I didn't know that. Glad I got mine after having a kid   I have an Honest Co. subscription and I love it.  If you find the Honest Co fit your baby best, I'd go with them.  The only thing is that we use Huggies overnights now because he's sleeping through the night and he leaks.  I don't want to wake him up at 3am to change him.  Otherwise they're awesome.  We always get compliments on the cute designs, too.  OH ALSO, the wipes are THICK and have ridges, which I LOVE.  I like quite a bit of padding between my fingers and poop.   Yes, you're correct, it's always there.  I should probably note I have no background in nutrition, but have done plenty of research on keto and pre-diabetes for my own sake.  So if something is wrong that I say, please feel free to correct me more :)   It helps manage cravings by reducing the amount of insulin that is secreted because there is no blood glucose.  Increasing blood glucose (whether by gluconeogensis or just eating carbohydrates) triggers insulin secretion.  If blood sugar is increased because of cortisol, insulin secretion increases, which leads to a little fluid retention.  If I'm wrong, please tell me why I'm wrong.     So if a person doing low-carb had an increase in cortisol from a stressful event, they could potentially be knocked out of ketosis from the rise in blood sugar from gluconeogenises, which may result in some weight gain from fluid retention that usually happens when, for example, someone doing keto has a cheat day (holy run-on sentence).  But nothing like the 50+ lbs that this guy has gained.   What does the role of cortisol play in all of this?  I've recently started a (doctor suggested) ketogenic lifestyle and have been listening to podcasts for motivation.  There is one big proponent of low carb (Jimmy Moore) who has recently packed on the pounds and claims it's all to do with not getting enough sleep and being stressed about his book deadlines.  He's also a big proponent of "calories don't matter when you're doing low-carb", whereas I think it's bullshit, that you still need to count calories even while doing low carb.  Do his excuses carry any weight?   That's fucking ridiculous. My son was in the NICU for 2 days and I was so thankful I had time to recuperate afterwards. Then he was in there another day for light therapy the first day I was home and I took the nurses' advice to get some rest before the fun began.   Honestly my mental health couldn't have taken being off my medication along with the hard work breastfeeding is. Thankfully every medical professional and all my mom friends said that the mom's mental well being is so much more important to the baby than what it's being fed. I will continue to tell others who are pregnant the exact same thing.    1. To be able to take selfies with my friends when we're together and not dread the outcome  2. To be able to raise my son to be active and healthy without coming across as a hypocrite  3. Mental health benefits.  No more self-loathing, no more bingeing (sometimes coupled with purging)  4. To be able to shop for clothes that will usually look good on me (as a thinner person) than things that will rarely look good on me (mostly shapeless things)  5. To finally be able to say I'm a normal weight as an adult.  The closest I've been was 5 months after my dad unexpectedly passed away.  I was so heavily medicated and in grief that I didn't have an appetite.  I could drink a large coke from McD's and have a double cheeseburger and be fine for the day.  6. The reactions from people who haven't seen me in a long time.  Especially people who have been exceptionally mean to me for no reason.  Mainly one of my ex-friends whose last words to me were "go get more fat, bitch" (after I asked her to buy a $99 bridesmaids dress for my wedding).  Unfortunately I did get "more fat" (i think she said that because she thought it sounded more intelligent, even though "fatter" is correct), but now I'm getting less fat   There are such bullies in the new mom boards online. You'd think I was feeding my son coca cola by the way they've reacted to me giving him formula.    I woke up one day and decided I wasn't going to smoke synthetic weed anymore.  It came after realizing just how bad it was for me and realizing why I shouldn't like doing something that gives me constant panic attacks.   False.  It works on nipples.   Oh LOL! Not exactly sure... Maybe 1/4". If you call the wax place beforehand they should be able to tell you. I'd say if you shave give it a couple weeks to grow out a bit.    For someone who may not be very knowledgeable of all things theology, what would be a good resource (book, website, article, etc...) to read to learn about E Orthodoxy (that is, in 'layman's terms')?   A few weeks.  To be fair we had been really good friends for like 7 years, fooled around off and on since we dated in 9th grade, then when we got back together junior year of college the feelings had already developed.  On the other side of the coin, one of my best friends has been dating a guy for 3+ years and he will not say it.   It could take 15-30 minutes to get your first one done.  After that, each time you get one would probably be about 10 minutes.   For the love of God, get it re done at least every 6 weeks. Otherwise it'll grow back long again and hurt just as much. I go every 4 weeks and it hurts so much less when I go more often than when I let the forest grow back.    I always feel like that and I'm almost 8 months out :(   I'm fat but shrinking (down 30 lbs and beatig a sugar addiction) and I have an 8 month old son. He mostly doesn't eat anything that wasn't killed for its meat or picked from a plant. He occasionally gets rice crackers (maybe once a week) and eats things like liver and bone broth. I'm going to work very hard to teach him how to eat and encourage him to exercise and I've realized that I am absolutely his role model for these things. If I sit around eating mcdonalds all the time but tell him he can only have vegetables and meat he is going to resent me. I'll be damned if he has to go through the same shit I did when his health is under my control   An ex friend of mine who ended the friendship over having to buy a $99 bridesmaids dress is broke and can't keep a job. She is crazy, always trying to get people to buy her shitty art (looks like anime) and considers herself a model because she poses at art classes (not an art school) at a local museum. She also has local photographers photograph her for free and they get to keep the prints.    * He shows his physical attraction to me multiple times a day, even though i'm not big on physical affection.  Still makes me feel beautiful and loved.  * His stupid jokes crack me up  * He's such a wonderful dad  * He's so easy to talk to, though this may come from being friends with him since 7th grade  * He's *so* smart  * How protective he is of me and our son  	124
 Brilliant, thanks!      I'm playing through this game for the first time, and I find I have a lot of potions that I have no real intention of using, but that could earn me some cash, but I can't find anyone to buy them off me. Is there anyone I can sell them to? I'm just about to go to Dorm's Deep, if that makes any difference (in terms of NPCs available at this point).  Thanks!   Sophie Howard.   They are, it's Sophie Howard.   I think Geena Davis says it when the girl is leaving his house.   Edit: just seen someone posted the link. Apologies!   It's an actual line in the film as well isn't it?   When I worked as a volunteer in forestry, my boss told me that when trees fall down towards people, their instinct is to turn and almost outrun the tree falling straight at them, rather than just run to the side. I was always very dubious when he told me this, but clearly the man knew he was talking about!   Couldn't agree more with this. She is such a good performer, as well as having an incredible body, it makes her videos absolutely amazing. I think it just shows that a cracking body isn't always enough. I personally find Lucie Wilde's videos an absolute bore for example, despite her jaw dropping tits, because she really doesn't seem into it at all.         I'm pretty sure the second one is Kerry Louise. Had a quick look on Google images for her brazzers scenes and there aren't many where the guy is wearing a white shirt. It seems to be a scene with Danny D. I can't check because my IP is porn blocked!! :(   I do whine a lot on Facebook about disgusting, unexpectedly hot weather. However, I like to feel I'm redressing the balance after the constant complaining about unexpected, dismal weather from all my friends, when I absolutely love it!   Haha sorry! I wanted to make sure the title didn't give away the surprise :D      BBC Sport reporting that Ashley has won a court injunction to stop details of the retail deal being revealed at tomorrow's EGM. Sorry, on my mobile so can't provide a link.   I think they were as well, but I think she also had a bit more meat on her bones in general as well. She seems to have slimmed down since then, but lost some weight off her tits as well as a result.   And it doesn't look like it travelled around the globe 7 times either.   Several barographs recorded the wave seven times over the course of five days: four times with the wave travelling away from the volcano to its antipodal point, and three times travelling back to the volcano. **Hence, the wave rounded the globe three and a half times.**  In saying that, I know absolutely fuck all about this stuff, so it could still technically be right!   This is why I prefer pics of busty women with bras on, rather than topless. I would do literally anything to bury my face in that cleavage!!   Makes for very nervous viewing though!! :(   Rangers are bossing it so far.   Fucking hell, what a figure!   Holy shit, who is this?   To be honest, when Rangers beat Hibs I thought they'd be going up, but it's going to be a massive ask now.   Holy shit, those tits are perfect!   Bea Flora   [Katie Morgan - American Daydreams](http://www.absoluporn.com/en/video2-1849420-american%20daydreams%20katie%20morgan.html)  Sorry for the rubbish site, doesn't appear to be on xvideos anymore.   This is why I love tits that aren't so big they slide down to the sides when a girl is on her back. The tits on this girl are absolutely perfect for sucking on when she's on her back, because you wouldn't need to use your hands to get them in the right place! Cracking body!   EDIT: Spelling   A friend of mine once referred to me as 'alarmingly white'.   They could have just said something like "winning numerous trophies".   What a load of mawkish, sentimental bollocks. I've loved football since I was old enough to kick a ball, and I can't fucking stand Steven Gerrard. Respect? Absolutely. Love? Not a fucking chance.   His sanctimonious attitude towards diving is the main reason I can't stand him. He has the brass neck to have a go at players who dive, going so far as to mention his distaste for it in his fucking book, yet it's something he's clearly been guilty of himself. He needs to look a bit closer to home before making these kinds of comments. And before anyone says it, I know he didn't dive as much as Ronaldo or Drogba at their worst but they don't come out and act all high and mighty about it.    In my game, my ambition is to write the Zong of the Zee, for which you need 77 of each of the objects listed in my title, and it can be pretty tedious trying to collect them all. But I've stumbled on a great way to collect them.   If you go through the Isle of Cats storyline, you might end up with a SAY notice in the port that says "Walk through the rose garden". (I say might, because I don't know if it happens every time or is a chance thing).  Each time you choose this, you receive either 10 MoDS, or 10 ToT. If you then head to the shop Wind Come Calling in Irem, you can exchange 2 ToT for one Zee Story, rather than relying on Jillyfleurs, and giving news to light ships. I did this, and got my all my zee stories in no time at all :)   Thanks! My ambition is to write the Zong of the Zee, so I needed to find some good ways to get secrets because I'd already discovered everything on the map!   Apologies for the poor quality of the video and audio but it's literally the only clip I've managed to find of it.  Full film is [here.](http://www.xvideos.com/video1188090/roommates)      Apologies if this is common knowledge, but I've discovered a pretty good way of getting secrets that you can carry out in the Iron Republic. If you arrive there and your Terror is 70 or higher, one of the options available after a SAY notice is to "Listen". This gives you a minimum of 70 fragments every time. Then you can just sit in port and keep doing this every time you get a new SAY. I was lucky in my map because Pigmote Isle was near the IR, so I could just go there and reduce my terror by attending a banquet in my honour. But it meant I was getting a secret every 5 days, which equated to about 6 minutes!  Anyway, hope that's of some use!    Thanks for your replies, I've actually figured out how to get the shop to open, even if you've missed the 1-4 day window.  The shops in the IR open on a rotational basis, depending on how many days you've been there, but it also involves a bit of chance. This is how to get the House of Pleasures:  1. Take note of your days spent in IR. 2. When you arrive at IR, if your days spent is less than 15, send your sailors ashore, which increases your days spent by between 2 and 4. Be wary though, this increases terror quite a bit. 3. Continue to do this until your days spent is over 15, when it says The Explusus (I think it's called) is now open. (You'll need to sit in the dock until a Something Awaits You appears each time. Bring plenty of supplies!).  THIS IS WHERE CHANCE COMES INTO IT. SAVE AT THIS POINT IF YOU AREN'T DOING THE INVICTUS PLAYTHROUGH.  Now, instead of sending your sailors ashore, open the shop. This resets the day counter. However, it sometimes resets the days to 5, which means you miss out on House of Pleasures and have to do the cycle again, and sometimes it resets it to 1, which will open House of Pleasures for you. Keep reloading till you get it! :)   I need to get into the House of Pleasures in the Iron Republic to trade my Searing Enigmas for a Dread Surmise, but I can never get it to appear. I know it involves moving the days on, but every time I try, it skips from the last shop straight through to the second shop and the House of Pleasures never appears. If anyone could help me out with this I'd be extremely grateful.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxUm-2x-2dM   When I was in Paris a couple of months ago I went to the Eiffel Tower, but didn't go right up to it at first, choosing to sit on a bench a bit away from it, to get the full view. While I was sitting there, 5 different groups of these scammers came up to me in the space of about 30 minutes. Thankfully I knew about it, and just roundly ignored them.   Totally agree. I love the bimbo look on the whole, it's why I'm on this sub, but I do make an exception in this case. Before the work she had done I thought she was one of the absolute hottest women in the business, but I can't even watch her stuff now, I think she looks absolutely ridiculous, especially her big fish lips!   Literally some of the best natural tits I've ever seen. And on such a slim frame. That bit right at the end where she stretches is incredible.   Yeah I got that a couple of times! Just sold the treasure though, don't have any interest in pimping my house anymore than I need to for my ambition to be fulfilled!   I've just managed to get to the point in the Isle of Cats where I can start buying Red Honey for 600, to then sell it on the brass embassy in London for 999. The way I do it is to buy some red honey, then just sit in port for 10 days or so, buying another cargo of honey each day. Then, when I return to London, I bribe the dock officials 500 echos, which is only a small percentage of the profit I then make.  But is this something I can do indefinitely, or does something happen when suspicion gets too high?  Thanks!   Thanks!   Name?   Yeah, I suppose not, I guess I'm still used to the high 50,000s from when I still lived at home during O'Neill's time.   Yeah I was wondering if attendance might go up a bit next year, as I've heard we're playing much more attractive stuff than under Lennon or Strachan.   Yeah I guess playing the likes of Dundee (no offence Dundonians!) isn't exactly a huge draw with prices being what they are :(   Thank you :)   Thanks!   I just had a quick look at a table of [Celtic's average attendances](http://www.fitbastats.com/celtic/club_records_league_attendance.php) over the years, as every time I watch highlights from a game at Celtic Park there's always loads of empty seats.  It says that the average attendance for this year is 43,951, which would be the lowest since 1996. Living in England, I'm not really privvy to the ins and outs of Scottish football as much anymore, and was wondering what the reasons are for the low attendances?  Obviously, having no Rangers has had an effect, and these are still difficult times for people financially, but is there anything else to it? Are fans not happy with the way the team's playing?   I just arrived at Port Cecil in my game, and before getting supplies etc. I moved on one of the storylines. The trouble is, the reward was 7 of an item that I don't want, and I had exactly 7 cargo space left in my hold. I thought I would be able to go to the shop and buy fuel, then dump the unwanted cargo, but the BUY option is greyed out. I have 0 fuel left, and if I can't fix this my game is fucked because it saved it after I did that. I really don't want to die and have to do all this shit again, it's the one part of the game that just isn't for me.  If there's no way to dump cargo, can I manipulate the save file or something to get rid of the unwanted items?   I worked as a waiter in a chain restaurant and that was always the part of the job I hated most. I'd much rather have just let people get on with it, and made sure I was around if they did have a problem, but I'd we didn't do it we'd get in shit for it because it was an expected part of service.    As others have said, partly because it's the second child, but according to the Evening Standard a few days ago, William and Kate employed new PR people this time to deliberately keep it all low key. Part of ensuring it remained that way was guaranteeing access to certain news companies at the hospital etc, and anyone else being asked to move on. So they didn't have the throngs of people camped outside this time.   Haha :D I have one of those in my window at school, the kids love it :D   Thank you :)   Thanks! I've asked this on Facebook as well, and the first suggestion I got was Lavender, so I'll definitely be getting my paws on some of that. And it'll smell nice too :)  Oh, and I live in London.   First of all, if this post doesn't really belong in this sub, please feel free to remove, mods. I put it here because I need plants that can grow in UK climates.  My housemates and I have decided to rip out the horrible weeds in our back garden, and attempt to grow some plants (preferably shrubs or large plants) that will attract pollinating insects. The problem is, we know the square root of fuck all when it comes to gardening, and have no idea what plants to look for. Can anyone suggest any that we could plant? To be honest, it does need to be a plant that would require almost no maintenance besides maybe cutting it back occasionally. We all work silly hours, so actually looking after said plants won't be too high on our priority lists!   I took [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/ZsyL66K.jpg) of a great white while I was cage diving in South Australia. Horrible damage on the gills, but no idea what from.   Oh dear! Sincerest apologies fellow Brits, I felt I'd somehow been extremely fortunate to miss the news, but it seems that not knowing was actually quite commonplace!   Last year, I distinctly remember muttering "oh for fucks sake" to myself, when I read that Kate was pregnant again, given the ridiculous, fawning media circus that surrounded the last birth.  But on the way home tonight, I was reading the Evening Standard, where the front page article was about how Wills and Kate have used a new PR team this time, and are keeping things much more under wraps.  Well, I'm pleased to say it's clearly worked, because I had absolutely no idea that, not only was the baby expected soon, but that it's actually overdue now!   So a big thank you to the PR team from me!!   Ah nice! Given that my English team is Everton, that's great news :D   Can you get tickets to Palace games fairly easily? I always just assume Premiership clubs sell out every week. I'd love to go and see them, the atmosphere sounds amazing.   I had no idea Boruc was playing for Bournemouth these days! Loved him when he was plying his trade for us! I want Bournemouth to go up even more now :D   I think this is [Maya Milano](http://www.scoreland.com/big-boob-models/Maya-Milano/7581/?nats=MTAwNC4yLjIuMi41NDUuMC4wLjAuMA) but could be wrong.   [Maya Milano](http://www.scoreland.com/big-boob-models/Maya-Milano/7581/?nats=MTAwNC4yLjIuMi41NDUuMC4wLjAuMA) I think. Not 100% sure.    A situation made infinitely worse if I'm on my way back from the weekly shop with 3 fully laden bags in each hand. Although I think the pained smile and mouthed 'thank you' are sufficient to hide the fact that I feel my arms are about to be torn from their sockets, as I lollop across the road.   I used to share that equal sense of relief and insult, until people actually started sitting beside me. Now it's just 100% relief.      I was just thinking the exact same thing. I would have thought wearing of shinpads would be compulsory.   Are there any other angles? I've watched it a few times and still can't really see what sanchez did because of my shitty mobile screen :(   Don't have the source I'm afraid :(   Fuck me, that's hot! Reminds me of one of my favourite things which is to have my hand on a girl's leg, and then get her to cross her legs so my hand is being pressed between her thighs. Bit TMI perhaps, but I advise all blokes out there to try it with their gf's, it feels amazing :)   Love a bit of HP on my beans.   This was brilliantly written mate, nice one :)   [She still models](http://www.marksandspencer.com/l/women/twiggy-for-mands-collection/twiggy-for-mands-collection) for a British clothes company called Marks and Spencer. Although not quite in the same way as she did in her prime!   I saw the picture posted by OP years ago in Camden and for years I thought it was [Carey Mulligan](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/45/21/19/4521195696bc8208716dbd3a3e31cae0.jpg).    2 successful trades with /u/s5ean.  First ISO he linked me to didn't work, but when I messaged him about it, he was very quick to send me an alternative link, which worked perfectly. Thanks!   Ah thanks, it could be that :)   This is no laughing matter.   I go past this every day on the train! One of my all time favourite buildings :)   From the Wiki page:   Air traffic controller Gilles Logelin noticed the flames before the Concorde was airborne, however with only 2 km (1.2 mi) of runway remaining and travelling at a speed of 328 km/h (204 mph), its only option was to take off. The Concorde would have needed at least 3 km (1.9 mi) of runway to abort safely.   [Link to Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_4590) Sorry, should have included this in my original post.   Is that the Aquaterra place? If so, I second this recommendation. Good value for money, and no requirement for a yearly contract or anything like that.   [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbPh2llw0-M) is horrible quality, but still worth a watch.   I got sunburn earlier! Glorious weather down London way!      Ah I see! Can't help but think it would make sense to do both at the same time though :)   He looks a little too happy for someone who's had his boules removed!   What is this from? It looks like Bioshock Infinite, but set in France.   These road signs are directly across from each other on the same street. Seems strange that they haven't been changed (well, the wrong one at least).      [Short piece on YouTube about the crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFgFw4T1OUU).  It includes footage from a car driving past, showing the Concorde in flight.      Wibble.    Thanks mate :)   Do you have a link to Zamora's goal?   Ipswich Town manager Mick Mccarthy summed it up quite nicely when he said the Championship was 'bonkers'.    I've only just started playing Skylines, and one of the things I've started adding through Workshop is the high rise office blocks, because I want to create a CBD type area like La Defense or something. I go to the relevant Workshop page and click subscribe, and when I go into the content manager menu of Skylines, all the office blocks are there and set to 'on'. But when I actually zone offices in-game, it's the same 2 or 3 that keep appearing over and over, despite subscribing to more than 20. A couple of them turned out to be unique buildings, which I hadn't realised, but it still falls way short of what I was hoping to see.  Am I missing anything? Is there some kind of script extender I need, like you do for some Skyrim mods?  Thanks! (Just going to bed, will reply tomorrow, thanks!)   God this is absolutely hilarious! I wonder how much improv there was in the show and how much was actually scripted. It sounds like the guy who plays Kev is just saying the first things that come into his head!   I won't link to the Mail Online article, but I just had a quick look, and the whole thing appears to have massively backfired, judging by the comments section. Everyone, including the readers of the DM itself, are pretty unanimous that this is beyond the pale.   Not sure if the guy's dick is big enough to count for this sub, so if not, please feel free to remove it mods!  Taken from /r/quiver      Jesus, that ass! And those thighs. Hot as all fuck.   Oh yeah, where the hell did I get the 2 from?  While we might not agree on the quality of the film I certainly agree this is Alba at her finest, Sin City included!   This is from a film she did years ago, called Idle Hands 2. Absolute rubbish, but she does have some good scenes in it!  [Extra](http://gfycat.com/PerfumedIdealIndiancow)  [Extra 2](http://gfycat.com/WickedAnyIrishsetter)  [Extra 3](http://gfycat.com/VacantSickHamadryad)      Is he a candidate for SPL player of the year do you think?   [This is a link to a vid of hers from Blacked, not sure if that's the right one or not.](http://www.xvideos.com/video10726555/blacked_august_ames_gets_an_interracial_creampie)  Have to say though, she used to be one of my favourites because of her natural stunning looks, but she's clearly had a shitload of work done on her face, and it looks awful IMO, especially her stupidly inflated lips. :(     There's no nudity in this, but given the nature of the clip, I've marked it as NSFW anyway, just to be on the safe side!      I genuinely had no idea you could see this amount of detail using home telescopes - I thought that was the sole domain of the huge ones you get out in the deserts!  I'm really can't get across how flabbergasted I am that you can actually make out the bands on Jupiter's surface using just a home telescope! How much of that is due to Jupiter being massive, and how much is due to the telescope's power? Can you see the rings on Saturn through one of these?   I know nothing about telescopes, so please excuse my noob question, but is a 1300m telescope one that you just set up in your back garden or whatever? If so, I had no idea you could see Jupiter this big from one of those, and that has absolutely blown my mind.   Might be an English thing! I'm a primary school teacher and we teach them as inverted commas :)   And yeah, I fantasise about the reactions more than the actual death itself!   Yeah that first part is me absolutely! Imagining myself killed but in a heroic way, where I've saved an orphanage or something!   Thanks for the link! :)   For me it happens later in the day, when I get really tired. And yes it does suck, and it doesn't even happen that often for me. Sorry to hear that it's something you go through a lot :(   Yeah sounds very similar to mine!   That's the thing though - for me it's not suicide I think of, it's being involved in some kind of accident that I have no control over. That's why I wasn't sure if this was a depressive symptom or not.   Thanks for this, good to hear what a psychiatrist's view is. Nope, I've never once thought about actually going ahead and doing anything, mainly because the thoughts I have are of me being killed or injured by something external, not by something I've done to myself. This is what leads me to think that it's more about affirmation and validation, rather than depressive thoughts.  Thanks again!   Yeah it's not very nice is it? :(   It might not be though, that's why I'm asking! This might be a fairly common thing for people to do! Still go to the doctor's but I'd wait and see what they say! :)   Apologizing for not reading it all properly :) Good luck in your search!   Oh sorry, I thought this was after that post! Yeah, get someone else to hold the camera next time :D   The most glaring thing for me is to find a profile picture that has just you in it. Even though you mention below your pictures which one you are, your main picture should always be just you. This is especially necessary if people are doing the quickmatch thing - the pictures there don't have captions underneath, and not many people are going to sit and try to figure out which girl you are in the pictures!   I remember nearly having a fucking aneurysm when I heard this for the first time, I was laughing so hard.   It's not that they're bad, but the tube stations at Clapham Common and Clapham South absolutely terrify me because of how narrow the platforms are :-/   COOL BEANS!!!   What a brilliant comment, thanks mate! Are the US really that far behind with the use of technology? I find that really surprising!  Like I said, the reason I find the book so fascinating is because of how it had to be carried out with no DNA or computers. If Sutcliffe has started killing now, he'd have been caught after the first victim probably!   I also find it amazing that it was on a hunch that they caught him as well. If I remember rightly, when Sutcliffe was arrested from in the car, he asked to go for a piss, which the police let him do, at which point he dropped the murder weapon he'd been using behind a small wall. It was only later in the station that one of the policemen thought to go back to the scene (I think he might have heard a slight clink noise but I can't remember that much) and when they went back they found the screwdriver that Sutcliffe had been using.   The clip in question:  https://youtu.be/QXROcBwRf2E?t=20s   But what a way to go :D   Nothing off the top of my head, sorry!   Haha! You're very welcome! :)   I realise it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I love stuff like this, so thought I'd post it!  Here are more gifs of the same scene:  [Gif 1](http://gfycat.com/TautNaiveGermanshorthairedpointer)  [Gif 2](http://gfycat.com/PeriodicEvilBrahmancow)  [Gif 3](http://gfycat.com/NervousUnfinishedGarpike)  [This is the full scene from YouTube](https://youtu.be/-fb2yV5A3lk?t=1h40m9s)      To be fair, Ramsey should have scored before the Markovic fuck up.   They might have done yeah. There was certainly a book about it and this picture was the front cover.    Fair enough! Certainly hope so!   Oh big game definitely, but United still have to play the likes of City, Chelsea and Arsenal. This could just be me being my pessimistic self of course and United end up winning most of the games!    I've seen a lot of people claim that if Liverpool lose they can kiss 4th place goodbye. But Liverpool have got a much easier run in after this, I can still see them get it even if they lose today. And this coming from someone who would love nothing more than see Liverpool implode and somehow manage to get themselves relegated! Is this really a must win game for them?   My housemate regularly sleeps until 2 or 3pm on a Saturday, and this is without going out the night before! Never seen anything like it.      Ah, thanks for the info :)   [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_Dagsa)      If anyone is interested in true crime, I highly recommend the book about the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper called Wicked Beyond Belief. It's absolutely massive, but it's the best book I've ever read. It's incredible the amount of work and man hours that went into the investigation, because it was all before computers and DNA. Unfortunately, it also shows you how West Yorkshire police made lots of mistakes during their investigation, and just weren't ready to cope with an investigation of that magnitude.      [Death of Tina Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Tina_Watson)      Just incase anyone is interested, Voltaire is buried in Le Pantheon in Paris. I was there a couple of months ago and took [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/Gdtt0Rf.jpg) of it. Looks much more impressive in the flesh, as it were.  Although I've since discovered he might not actually be in the tomb, as his body may have been lost. No idea whether or not that's the case.    Do they regret jumping just as they leap?  According to [this article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers), a number of survivors said they regretted their decision either mid way through the fall, or even at the moment they jumped.   Little bit of trivia regarding this. The German metal group Rammstein named themselves after the place where the accident happened. From Wikipedia:  *The band was named after the Ramstein air show disaster. At first, the band had denied this and said that their name was inspired by the giant doorstop type devices found on old gates, called Rammsteine. The extra "m" in the band's name makes it translate literally as "ramming stone".*    Unfortunately this a shop job. The woman in the picture is Maria Zarring, and the original nude pics are [here](http://m.xhamster.com/photos/gallery/1957362/maria_mia_zarring_2_with_her_rare_nude_pictures.html?page=11).  She's still fucking incredible though!    I work as a primary school teacher, and this is spot on. At my school we set for literacy and maths, but not for the afternoon subjects like History, Geography, French etc. This effectively means I need to create 3 lesson plans for those lessons, to make sure all pupils can access the lesson, and I don't even have anyone who would be considered to have severe special needs to the point where they need further support. My colleagues have this though, so they're having to do what I am, plus take the SEN children into account.   I agree that this is the main reason teachers are quitting in droves. How people with kids manage, I'll never know. At the moment I work almost every waking hour (literally), and I still don't get everything done. Granted, part of this is down to time management on my part, but the workload is ridiculous.   I do now! I didn't at the time!   Oooooh I've been had good and proper well played OP! In my defence, it's April 2nd where i am - my April fools radar was down! :p  Edit: no it's not April 2nd here what the fuck am I talking about. I seriously need to get some sleep!   I thought the same! I thought it was a "yeah we're watching it for the plot" *nudge nudge wink wink* kind of thing.  Hopefully someone will start a sub where the content is like the stuff here.   Hahaha :D Is there anything I can do by way of thanks? I'm afraid I have no gold to give, but do you have a rep system or something?   IT WORKED!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!! I formatted the USB drive, then put the All In One file on it, and it unzipped properly this time :) Thanks so much :)   I've formatted the USB drive I'm using to see if that helps.   I tried it again and got the same message. I also downloaded a slightly earlier version, from a different site, and got the same message with that one as well.  I really appreciate all the help so far, thanks for your time!   OK, when I try to unzip it on my PC, I get the message "Please insert the last disk of the Multi-Volume set and click OK to continue."

I recently purchased Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, because I wanted to play games like Far Cry 4 and use things like Lightroom much more efficiently. I installed the OS with no problems, but now I'm having an absolute nightmare with drivers, especially the internet ones (I'm writing this on a laptop I borrowed.)  The infuriating thing is that I know the model and make of PC, but when I go to the official site (or any driver site for that matter) and download the drivers I think I need, they don't work. I get a message saying "The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64 bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher." I've been making sure to download the 64 bit versions, so I have no idea where this is coming from.  I've tried going into device manager and looking up the driver details for the ethernet controller, but there are none.   If anyone could help, I'd be so grateful!  My PC is a Hewlett Packard model: H8-1010cs  If it makes any difference, the guy i bought it from bought it in the Czech Republic (I got it second hand).  I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. (6.1, Build 7600)  BIOS: Ver: CHG_7 9.rom vCHG7.09  Directx 11  8 gb ram  Intel i7-2600 3.4ghz  Thanks for any help you may be able to give!   Thank you :)   Does anyone know who this is please?   100% behind this. I think goals should just be described as they are, such as, "30 yard curling shot" or something along those lines. I've lost count of the amount of times I've watch a gif based on the title and end up utterly disappointed, thinking "that was not remotely a screamer/stunner/incredible goal".   Apologies for going on a tangent slightly, but this reminds me of my French friend, who didn't quite grasp the idea of censoring, and would write things like:  "m*****rfucker"   Forgot about him as well!!  Right, think it's about time I just stopped talking.   All very good players, but I wouldn't put any of them ahead of Hazard. I would imagine the closest for POTY would be Harry Kane, with the season he's having.  EDIT: Forgot about Sanchez! He'd have a good shout for POTY as well.   Best player in the league, surely?   http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1636283/images/o-PHIL-JONES-FACES-facebook.jpg   It's because you said 'offsides'. In football, you just say 'offside', without the s.  And he got the ball when he was past the last defender, but offside counts from when the ball is passed, at which point Mata was still onside, albeit by the smallest of margins.   Skrtel (towards the top of the screen) looked like he was keeping Mata onside, but only just.    Brilliant stream, thank you!   To be fair, it does make me sound like a dick. I could have just said sorry. But I was in a funny wee mood yesterday.   Was there a deflection on that? I thought it looked that way, especially in the second replay.   Fuckin great hit! Love the slight swerve on it at the end, taking it just out of the reach of the keeper.   My humblest apologies, good sir!!  	185
 Really love her stomach piercings, they flow so naturally :D Wonder how badly those dermals hurt though....   Nick Tahous baby, that's where it's at.    In-ground pool.   I don't wanna clean that shit just so I can float in it for two hours every summer, then have to hire someone to fill it in when I eventually, most likely attempt to move and sell the house.   Holy shit man. There are some things that people shouldn't ever have to see, sorry you ever had to see that.    Not gonna lie, thought you bailed on us (not that I blamed you, there was some serious reddit-mobage going on). All I gotta say is thanks, for both the perseverance and the foresight to preview the tapes instead of showing live like most wanted, and for coming back to explain as much as you could anyway, even though i'm sure it's probably something you'd rather hand off to the cops and bleach from your brain.    Take care of yourself. This is the sort of shit that makes people crazy. And as far as all the downvoting goes, don't let it get to you. People sometimes tend to mix up "Imaginary sorting system" with "Cocaine laced with gold".    Thanks again OP, you did good :)   I'm so sorry to hear about your situation, hopefully it's gotten better since. You should try drawing again though,  even unfinished ones have a kind of charm to them :)  I haven't heard of deltoras quest though, is that a tv show?    Guitar is definitely...interesting.  But it's one of those things where everyone starts on equal terms, talent doesn't have nearly as much importance as practice and perseverance. It makes it much more satisfying :)    Haha the irony being I'm actually dyslexic xp thanks for taking the time to check them out, I'm glad you enjoyed them!   	7
 thank you for your kind words   Could you please help me out with some clams?      She was walking on water but I was 1/2 second late to screenshot that   and hail Hot Pants      You're amazing! Thank you so much for all your help :)!!   You are amazing! thank you so much!   Thank you so much for your help!   Thank you so much maccahkka, great and fast service.  You're very generous :)   I need a hug.   This is fantastic! Thank you for making my morning.         Its actually in Canada.  	15
 Thank you for sharing. I know from experience that making that step to seek help is REALLY hard but it's amazing that you managed to help so many others too.  You are a great positive force to have on r/depression. :) thanks again   I'm here if you need a friendly ear :)   Naww thanks that's really sweet! I am also a bit of a nut and love random love from the internet :P   Thanks! That's not really my opinion though :P  The stories are coming well - finished the first draft of my first book and I'm editing it atm. It's going well! :) Thanks for taking an interest!   I think we've all had moments where we get to our darkest place and sometimes it's hard to get to a less dark place. I'm doing this because I think that it's important to gain techniques that can calm you down or help IN THE MOMENT.  Whether it's relaxation techniques or physical things, I think it would be a good idea to list some things that help you IN THE MOMENT to get over a bad bout of depression or anxiety. This does  NOT include self-harm, lashing out, violence or mean actions. I'm talking about positive things to feel better and sharing them with others to encourage them to get similar things and bonding over de-stressing techniques. :D  Mine are: Phoning my SO, Watching Star Wars, Cuddling a teddy, Having a cathartic cry.  What are your things?   The thing I'm probably the best at (cringe at the implied arrogance) is that I'm kind. Or that's what my girlfriend say. She says I'm always kind and very thoughtful. People also say that I'm articulate - which makes me glow inside because I want more than anything to be a novelist.  p.s. this is a great idea! Getting us to try to feel positive!  	6
 I have this picture as gelaskin on my old phone.   Because of the membrane stabilizing properties.   Yes because, for example; Propranolol is more lipophilic and because of this, it has local anesthetic and sedative effects more than hydrophilic ones.   Sad but that is the truth, people who are his supporters worshiping him. And they just don't want to think about what others telling to them. They see him as a saint literally.  But there is another problem in country that government dealing with and I think it's the bigger problem for the country, Gulen Movement. They're fighting with each other for their own benefits now. And this fight's loser is always gonna be the citizens. Oh man, this sucks, it maybe looks funny from outside but it just looks like hell from here.   	4
 My DM uses fudge dice for both 1s and 20s. It can turn crit fails into crit successes or vice versa. It can also result in our fighter getting hit with our attacks ALL THE TIME. The dice really hate him.   i have to go play diana right now      If I don't use a word for a while, when I try to Swype it again, it doesn't show up and I have to add it again. It's not deleting all of my words, just old ones that I haven't used in a while. Is there a maximum number of words you can add, and I've reached it already? If not, how can I prevent this from happening?   It depends on my weapon set up   Oh, pausing. I don't really pause unless I need to pay attention to something else?   Hot keys mostly, some mouse (mostly to select crew)   I don't have that mod and have never played anything with it. I don't know how I got so many beacons explored.   Thank you for all of your advice!! I will try drones and teleporting, two things I do usually ignore because the couple of times I have had it, it hasn't gone well, but it could be bad luck or I'm just using them wrong. I very rarely am able to buy cloaking when I see it, but I will try to save for it in the future. I don't normally have that much unspent scrap. I should have spent it on my systems.  I will take all of this into consideration. Thank you.   I don't really have anything other than these few images...  [A small album of my last attempt at the flagship.](http://imgur.com/a/uQV1i)   I will check it out and report back. Thank you.   I am pretty sure I don't use any mods, but I have played from my account on my friend's computer before? Also I may have installed a mod and forgotten. :|  What does the infinite space mod do?   In my last game, I got to the second round, but got demolished easily :( When everything goes wrong at once, I kind of panic...      Thank you!! I was curious because we have some little brown house spiders that get in and my friend said it was probably that, but it was much too big. We put a cup over it and moved it outside.       I open my eyes. I'm laying on my back and staring at a white ceiling. As I sit up, I realize that it's not a ceiling. Or maybe it is. I can't tell. Everything is the same shade of off-white. I can't tell the sky from the ground or see any kind of horizon or source of light. It's disorienting, and it takes me a moment to rise to my feet.  The last thing I remember is a screech of tires and a sudden, sharp pain, followed by cold darkness. I must have died. I'm surprisingly okay with it.  "Is this heaven?" I ask.  A voice from behind me startles me. "There is no heaven."  Turning around, I realize that I'm not alone. There are seven people, all varying ages and colors and genders, sitting around an eight-sided table, and the empty spot has a name plate with my name on it. I blink rapidly a few times, but nothing changes. "What is this, then?"  An old man shrugs. "Death," he says. His voice is that of a man who smoked two packs a day for fifty years. "Take a seat already so we can get started."  Still uncertain about exactly what's going on, I approach the table and sit in the chair with my name on it. "Start what?"  "The poker game, duh." This answer is from a little girl, no older than eight. "It's Tedd's deal."  Tedd, a young adult with dark hair and an expression of disdain, starts to pass out the cards. I'm silent as everyone is dealt five cards, but I'm still bursting with questions.  "Poker?" I ask finally. "Is there anything else to do?" I've never been good at poker. Too expressive. My mom always knew when I had a good hand because I couldn't keep the grin off my face.  "Nope," the old man says. He lays down two cards. "This is it. Poker."  I stare at my hand. It's not a good one. "What happens if we run out of chips?"  The others at the table laugh quietly. There is no answer.  I fold.   I was really hoping that wasn't the case :( Needing to know something about LSD and going to the LSD subreddit is pretty obvious, but what if I want to know the best way to poison a king that's not immediately obvious because they have a poison taste-tester that would be available to a maid in the castle in the 17th century? Or if I wanted an approximate recovery timeline for a bullet wound where I know all the specific details and can get estimates of most things through Google, but can't find anything about how long it would take for it to scar over and what kind of scar would it leave if it was treated in different ways?  I guess it doesn't need to be specifically for writers. Maybe something like /r/AskReddit, but for questions like those above?   I used to belong to a community on LiveJournal where people who were writing stories could go and ask questions, usually fairly specific, and get answers from people who know about the subject. The questions were about things like what would be a good way to do a thing, how specific parts of jobs work, effects of drugs (usually accompanied by "would a person on [drug] experience [side effect]?"), etc.  Some things are hard to google.   Ohh, thank you for the info!!   Thank you! :)   I know it's possible, but I can't find a satisfactory answer about how it works.  I have a level 34 mechromancer. I want to try TVHM but I've been playing DLC with a friend on normal mode.  If I switch to TVHM, will it save my progress in normal from the moment I switched modes, and vice versa?   Sorry if this seems like a dumb question, but I only recently bought my own copy of BL2 and didn't even know TVHM existed since I beat the have with my friend when it first came out and then never really went back until now.   My friend and I were playing the dlc for the first time, him as a level 34 gunzerker and me as a level 32 mechromancer. We went into the orc village in the forest and fought a level 35 orc that turned into a level 37 orc. My friend kept getting crippled, but every time he hit me, I'd immediately regain all of my shields and health. It continued when we moved to another area. Nothing else was different, except the pixies seemed to ignore me, whether they were attacking us or helping us. I reset the game and it went away, but it was very weird.  Has anyone else experienced this? I couldn't find anything on Google, but I'm not really the best at googling stuff.      Actually thought this was in /r/thelastofus because I opened the picture before I read the title.    If they are resorting to swallowing a ton of pills as a cry for attention, they need the attention. Attempting suicide, even if they aren't "completely serious", is always a serious issue.   I found them just fine!!   I would love an add but my safari is crappy and I don't know what I have to offer besides Pokerus and starter pokemon.    Sorry for slow response!! Adding you now :)   thank you for the ditto!! :)   sure thing :)   OH that is so weird, you are blackie, it said you were a passerby even though I had you added?? i'm sorry i kept declining!!   no problem!! do you want the pokerus on any particular pokemon? i can't guarantee i have it but i can offer at least. i would make a list of pokemon i have but i don't know which ones are popular/sought out beyond ditto/eevee safaris :( all i know is that i have all gen 1 and gen 6 starters.   I guess it wasn't updating for me that you were online. Sorry I spammed you with messages. Thanks for the Dedenne :)   Fairy type, with Swirlix, Dedenne, and Floette!  	35
 My meta is a little goofy we have like 3 swarm players, no fat hans, 1 super dash, 1 decimator + soontir, 1 panic attack list and a guy who could bring anything.  I have 4 lists I am thinking about bringing.  Brobots with HLC, VI, AvS and Inertial Dampeners  Bug Zapper 7x Z-95 with Feedback Arrays  BBBB with Accuracy Correctors  or Thug Lyfe 4x Y with Unhinged Astro, Ion Cannon Turret, and the title; 2 with Seismic charges    I am equally comfortable flying all of them. Thoughts?    Too lazy to link them all. * Death for my Birthday - Say Anything * Hurt - as sung by Johnny Cash * Mad World - Gary Jules * Adam's Song - Blink 182   This seems like a great question to pose to a medical professional. The Internet isn't always a reliable source of medical advice.   I am currently prescribed cymbalta and Wellbutrin. I have been taking them for 4 years now. It is very important not to miss doses of cymbalta. The withdrawl symptoms hit like a truck, for me its feel like I am drunk minus the euphoria with occasional brain zaps. I set my pill keeper on top of my cell phone every night to remind me to take them. I think the benefits outweigh the added responsibility of remembering my medication. I hope this was helpful. Good luck!   I have been on that specific combination, cymbalta/Wellbutrin for going on 4 years. I have been doing fairly well on it. Other than crushing my libido, It hasn't had any negative side effects.   If you live in the US, look into getting healthcare through the government. I was freaking out about not being able to afford my prescriptions after turning 26, the age you can no longer be on your families plan, only to find I qualified for free healthcare. talk to the therapist you choose about medication options. They can point you in the right direction. There are really no "best" medications you will probably have to try a few different combinations until you figure out what works for you. Make sure and be patient with your medications they won't fix anything instantly but, can certainly help over time! Good luck! Edit: spelling   My powered cube!

 I haven't really ever gotten far enough to experience pain I think. Like I've never been in more than a half or quarter of a finger   I've had a therapist since middle school, who I see on a weekly basis. I first got her to work through self harm and depression. And lately we've been working through anxiety. I've known her for so long, would it be strange to try and work through this with her? The mental aspect I mean    Maybe I do. I'll look into one, but what I'm really asking is what could be the reason for how i am? Why do I react the way I do before anything is even close to inside of me?    I have no recollection of any trauma in the past. I don't have a gyno as I'm still a teenager    I'm young, so I don't have a gyno yet. And my mother still stays in the room with me during appointments. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just some ideas     I think I have vaginismus. I've never been able to insert a tampon, and have never been penetrated, through sex or masturbation. What's different is that I have a mental reaction to thinking about penetration. When trying to insert a tampon, I get nauseous and sweaty before I can get even a quarter of an inch in. The idea of fingers or toys make me dizzy and sick. The idea of a penis penetrating me doesn't scare me, but I'm almost positive it wouldn't be a pleasurable experience. I've had a girlfriend for two years, and on a few occasions we have tried to use fingers. Sometimes if I'm distracted during sex, she can get a tiny bit of her finger in, but once I realize what's happening I immediately start crying and shaking. I simply cannot control my emotional/mental reaction. So I guess my question is what's happening to me?    I've been reading this subreddit, and I think I have vaginismus. I've never been able to insert a tampon, and have never been penetrated, through sex or masturbation. What's different is that I have a mental reaction to thinking about penetration as well. When trying to insert a tampon, I get nauseous and sweaty before I can get even a quarter of an inch in. The idea of fingers or toys make me dizzy and sick. The idea of a penis penetrating me doesn't scare me, but I'm almost positive it wouldn't be a pleasurable experience. I've had a girlfriend for two years, and on a few occasions we have tried to use fingers. Sometimes if I'm distracted during sex, she can get a tiny bit of her finger in, but once I realize what's happening I immediately start crying and shaking. I simply cannot control my emotional/mental reaction. So I guess my question is what's happening to me?    Oh my god! I'm from bay city!    Me too! What city?    Thanks!   I'm hoping this way works out for me!   Question: me and my friend both got tickets for Of Monsters and Men. But he ended up with GA tickets and I have GAB1 tickets. What do we do to end up in the same place? We don't want to enjoy the concert separately    I got  samples of Brier Path, Zazz, Cozy Sweater, Imp, and Twice is Nice as well as a PB in Zazz (smaller size was sold out, so I hope it was worth buying the full size).   I'm new to perfumes, so I'm hoping these scents will be great!    /u/trollabot train_subject6494   /u/trollabot train_subject6494   I totally will once I become more familiar! It's funny how different perfumes can be for people. I've been wearing Vice all day and I'm falling in love with it more and more. It's unlike anything I've ever worn. I still have to pass judgement on the others though!    This totally happened to me at the Psychiatry of Death exhibit in LA. I didn't even realize until months later    Maybe I'll try that!    I was going to get a sample of cozy sweater but ran out of money! Cozy Rose sounds amazing! Maybe I'll try it one day    Absolutely! I've been wearing Vice for about two hours and I think I'm going to marry it. I sniffed out of the bottle and really thought I wouldn't like it, but I'm finding that I really like it the longer I wear it. The coffee and chocolate smells delicious!    Yeah I totally made that mistake    I cold sniffed rose city and fell in love! I think I'll wear it tomorrow! I'm wearing Vice right now, and I thought I wouldn't like it but I'm finding the longer I wear it the more I'm liking it. the chocolate and coffee smell is so delicious!    Yes! I smelled all of them, I immediately fell in love with Rose city, but was meh about the rest and REALLY didn't like vice. BUT I just put vice on an hour ago a FELL IN LOVE. so I'm thinking my cold sniff first impression may not be valid compared to wearing them!!!    I bought samples of Vice, Satyr, Lavender Sugar, and Rose City, they threw in Ruth for free! I'm brand new to perfume so I'm very excited to try these out!       The real question is could anyone say anything bad about Panic at the Disco   Nothing, they're amazing    A less patchy version on KVD'S Vampira    Swatching lipsticks is my go to anxiety reliever! When life gets too much I compare lipsticks in my collection until I calm down. It's nice go know I'm not the only one who does this!    But whose to say it isn't worth it to keep him in her life? A pedophile is not always a criminal (and in this case he is not) nor does he have any intentions on becoming one (that we know of). Yes, he needs help, but she doesn't have to get out of the relationship. Just because he has these thoughts doesn't make him any less of a human being. Like any other person, he has feelings. Just because he considers himself a pedophile, doesn't mean we can dehumanize him.    You better be joking,    There is no problem with having a strong opinion about something, but you have an extreme bias towards this topic, and I don't think it's fair to want everyone else to condemn pedophilia the way you do. They're real people, and plenty of pedophiles do not want to act on their feelings. Should we condemn them instead of giving them help just because there's something wrong? In prison, many activities are in place to rehabilitate criminals. The same applies here. Shunning pedophiles will not help prevent child abuse, but doing research and finding ways to treat and even cure them can.    You really think something like this could be so simple?

 That's light skinned to you? I'm the same color and both my parents are black.   There's the commuter lot, which is free and the Orange will take him into campus.   Can confirm.   Good to see some changes happening. I wasn't impressed when I went in and the doctor googled my symptoms...I could have done that.   I think if you look on the Iowa State DOR webpage they might have a link to a Youtube series where they give a virtual tours of the dorms.  I lived in Maricopa (near Walton) last year and absolutely loved it. The apartment was clean, well furnished, and fairly close to the Cyride Red Bus line. I had my own private bathroom and my bed was lofted, not sure if yours will be. Good area overall to live in.   Edit: Someone mentioned Walton being far away, it is quite far by bus but if you have a car not bad. Away from the chaos of campus but Welch is still within decent distance so you can hit bars and such.   Are you fucking serious? I'm Black, with a Master's degree and I work for a company developing immunotherapies for people with cancer. Are you really telling me I need to be abducted because I'm such a drag on society? Along with my engineer father, lawyer sister, and everyone else in my family? Your logic doesn't add up.     Curry   As another 24 year old, get off my lawn you scallywag!   As an broke-ass Iowan, I agree.   That song started playing in my head as soon as I read your comment.   I know there are natural hair subs but r/blackladies is much more active :) Right now I'm about 6 months into my transition from relaxed to natural hair. I also work out about 3x a week. My question: is it easier to maintain natural hair and work out, because you're not sweating it out? Or did you find relaxed hair easier to care for?  Also any tips for weaning of a relaxer are welcome! I don't have much of a support network at home :/   Endometriosis can implant within the vagina?    No, I haven't. I spend a decent amount of time in this sort of conversations on Reddit. I'll be sure to ELI5 next time.    I'm well aware that it's not intrinsic to any people and occurs across many demographics. I was acknowledging that fact that I've encountered a couple people with that mentality in my life, the last being over 4th of July weekend. Overall people are overwhelmingly supportive, they believe in my more than I do. I'm not sure what your point is.    I was acknowledging there are some people who act that way, not all by any means. And I'm a woman from a middle class family.    What are talking about? I meant there have been campuses considering removing male and female designated bathrooms and making them coed- so both can use. I didn't mention players transitioning...  Edit: And women can play college football.   Hey im all of these except disabled (hopefully it stays that way). Yay for statistical unicorns.    I volunteer to be one of said scantily clad lesbians.    Do you know what "job specialty" you want to go in? Sorry if that's not the right terminology. When I was thinking about the Navy I really wanted to be a Medical Corpsmen.   Nothing. Quick someone recommend something on Netflix to binge on. Already seen Dexter, Breaking Bad, OITNB   My weed supply is low and my dealer moved away :(   [Spy Kids 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287717/)  [Spy Kids 3-D](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338459/)   Yeah I've met people like that, their mentality is fucked up and poisonous. Same people who scoff at me for being in graduate school "you're gonna study your life away." Nope making a better one for myself. I'm extremely lucky my family is nothing like that.   Excellent response. Echoed my thoughts exactly.   Way too focused on how she looks. I thought objectification was something women wanted to overcome.   Where do genderqueer and agender people fit into this little schema?   I never had an opinion on the trans movement until it became commonplace for trans people to try and make me call myself cis. If you don't want someone to tell you what to label yourself, respect other people's desires as well.   Agreed. It's insane such a small percentage of the population has people thinking about coed bathrooms on campus and such. The idea of trying to change my tampon while a football player is shitting 10 feet away is unsettling.    Thanks for recognizing this. Hope that wasn't sarcasm.   I think people still talk about slavery as a relevant issue because the effects of it are still visible today. From slavery came share cropping, then Jim Crow and segregation, from these ghettos developed and red lining. Gentrification is currently a problem as well as racial profiling and sentencing discrepancies. All of these are the results of slavery. My family members were alive for all of these but slavery.  I don't hold white people responsible for the things of the past, a few people caused problems for many. Also, just because I wasn't a slave doesn't mean I can't feel pain when my grandmother talks to me about segregated schools or getting hit with firehoses. All of that stemmed from slavery. I'm not arguing with your position, just providing alternative perspective.   I think some people see the Trans-Atlantic slave trade as unique because it was one of the few where slaves were made slaves because of their skin color and assumed inferiority alone. Other forms of slavery were due to war, debt, tribal issues etc. It also went on for an extremely long time.   Black person here. IMO removing the flag isn't going to change anything. People are going to hold hate and discrimination in their hearts regardless of what fucking flag is allowed. Shitty response to the Charleston shooting.   How did you figure out you had it?   Hello, me :(   So do you produce more cum than the average man?   Loves cats and puppies, hates black people.    What does the R stand for?    Any chance there's a video of that Williams match?    Ok I see what you were saying. Thanks for the clarification.    I think I understand what you're saying. You're fine with your body and the biological label "woman". But you also don't feel you have a so called "female brain" or identity. I'm the same way.    This doesn't erase her experience of being raped. That's like saying other people have it worse so you don't get to feel bad.    This argument doesn't really work. Skin and eye color are partially dependent on the number of people with those traits reproducing. Percentage of Cis and Trans people are consistent no matter what the population.    So should we create another label for straight people who are sexually active but don't want kids or are infertile?    Does that hurt?   The cops on my campus have this method of sticking an arm pressure cuff between the door and the frame, inflating, and then sticking something inside to pull the locks. Saved my ass during finals. Maybe you should invest in something similar.   You ever get so high, you experience time warp? Like time seems like it has stopped. *4 hours gone by?, nope only 20 minutes.*   I need a new beer to try. No IPAs.   Run into an old friend and replay the conversation over and over, cringing at the things you said.   *God I'm so awkward, she knows what a loser I am.*   Is there a um, subreddit featuring this?   Question from an Iowan. How terrible are the winters in Denver? For example in Iowa, we'll probably get 40 inches annually with temps around 25, which isn't terrible. At worst, January and February we'll get a week or 2 of temps around -17 with wind chill. How does Denver compare?    You're cute :) Lobster face aside.   Dammit. Upvote for catching that.   I was confused by OP. Nevermind.   No, I know exactly what I posted. It's well known that blacks are more likely to be poor so therefore more likely to take out government assistance. So, what? You haven't posted anything that proves you as a white person are being taxed more than any other American citizen for welfare regardless of who's taking it out. SOLID FUCKING GOLD!  Also, I didn't see your point about any of the things you posted having to do with nonexistence of white privilege. Sentencing discrepancies between races, wage gap, loan applications, profiling, I could go on for days. And if affirmative action was done away with Asians would dominate white college acceptance, especially STEM fields.    So for the past year or so, I've been battling with my service provider to fix this error: DNS_Probe_Finished_Bad_Config.  Whenever this error occurs I can't used internet for about 15 minutes, it happens multiple times per day. Since Pavlov Media's customer support is bullshit, thought maybe someone one here had advice on how to fix? I don't even know what it means really. Thanks!  I have an HP Envy computer, bought in 2014. Works on other networks, so I'm sure it's not the laptop nor the router (Belkin).    Do you have any statistics to back up your feelings?  [Affirmative action](http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/)  [Welfare myths](http://www.forwardprogressives.com/6-myths-welfare-recipients-debunked/)   Titillating.    Jus' sayin.   Maybe it means keep your eyelids open? Like if your eyes are closed they're "unpeeled".   Octothorp, you peasants.   For all intensive purposes, I don't agree with you...   I'm beginning to become concerned by this thread. I'm a woman and I sit with my legs wide open because it's simply more comfortable than squeezing them together. Maybe I'm man shaped :(   It probably just looks bad. I'm a girl and my mom told me take my hand out of my pants as a kid all the time. Said it looks inappropriate. I like the warmth.   Netflix talking to you. Simple as that   That's great. I'm in the biomedical industry so it's a little difficult to get a ton of relevant experience prior to graduation.    Amazon Prime video has Hey Arnold episodes.   They have alot of these available to watch on Amazon Prime video. I binged on Hey Arnold! and Rugrats the other day. No shame.   Your description is starting to turn me on man, stop it.   3-5 years of experience for an entry level position. GTFOH.   Especially not in dry socks.   Yasss   Now get in the van.   What if someone had this plus claustrophobia? Where the fuck would you go.   I need to know the science behind this. Why is it so cringey? Just imagining it right now is awful.   I mentioned this elsewhere in this thread but I feel the same way about rubbing certain fabrics together. Especially velvet. Did it as a kid (between my teeth) and it's the worst sensation ever.     Same with the thought of grinding fabrics like velvet between my teeth. Did it as a kid and it's the worst sensation ever.   So black people should wear suits to Walmart and to get their oil changed?   Shower arguments happen more for me than real life arguments.   On Reddit, oftentimes   I've got the acid and plastic barrels ready.   May I ask how old you are?   What was it? I missed it.   Your username sounds hispanic lol   Did they enjoy the singing?   Black comes in all shades bro, there's nothing wrong with claiming biracial or mixed either if that's what you prefer. My younger cousin is Black and Vietnamese and that's what he does, he's even lighter than you lol.    I honestly think you're quite cute, full lips are attractive on either gender. I wouldn't have noticed the asymmetry, if you hadn't pointed it out. It's not obvious imo. If you don't think a shorter hair will help, how about shaping or styling it? Your hair texture is decent. Looking at style pics online could help and ask opinions from friends.   For me, it makes me feel unsafe. Speaking as a survivor of sexual assault.   Most chicks wear yoga pants because they're comfy and work with most outfits.  Source:female   I'd suggest a haircut. And it's weird I've never heard "effeminate" and "African features" in the same sentence before. If you want to appear more masculine, try different clothes and lifting weights. You might want to talk with someone about your race issues as well.   If I'm trying to understand how someone came to certain conclusion, I ask for the specific article they read. Force of habit really. In my field of work if you make a claim, you provide a reference as well. Otherwise it's hard to be taken seriously.    You were looking especially hot on Friday man.   My little buddy.   Ha mom compliments. "You're not fat, you're soft."   I actually heard this from an Asian girl once. But she was from Oakland and I'm from the Midwest so it's not shocking Iowans are a little more easygoing.   I feel your pain. I've gotten, "You're really pretty for a black girl!" I'm floored people have no idea this type of stuff hurts.   I honestly don't understand your viewpoint. I'm Black and grew up surrounded by lots of other black people and have yet to become a criminal, just got my master's degree in fact. How many black people do you know on a personal level?   You got a source on that "higher testosterone" claim and it's link to violence in black males?  And I think you should learn the difference between culture and environment. I grew up on rap music and surrounded by other (middle class) black people but still manged to get a master's degree and on my way to medical school.    That's gentrification not self-segregation   Not really. Modern slavery is mostly based on profit and debt. Only allowed because of government corruption or ignorance, not "culture". Transatlantic slavery developed into being based on skin color. From a college website if you care to read:   "Racial slavery played an intrinsic and indispensable part in New World settlement. The institution was no abnormality, no aberration, no marginal feature; rather, its development is the grim and irrepressible theme governing the development of the Western Hemisphere. The truly distinctive features of North American (and to varying degrees, New World) slavery were its racial bedrock and its thoroughly commercial character. Nevertheless, however it happened, slavery became indelibly linked with people of African descent in the Western Hemisphere. The dishonor, humiliation, and bestialization that were universally associated with chattel slavery merged with blackness in the New World. The racial factor became one of the most distinctive features of slavery in the New World (12).  New World slavery's other most distinctive aspect was its highly commercial character. While it is true that plantations -- that is, large agricultural enterprises, managed for profit, producing a crop for export, with a hierarchically stratified labor organization -- existed outside the New World, they reached their apogee there. The economies of scale, the expansion in unit size, the almost exclusive use of black slaves, a highly regimented and commodified labor force, and a system of close management all raised profit levels significantly."    **Historical or Modern slavery causes:**  * Bonded labour or debt bondage from  familial poverty or owed payments * Serfdom * Child slavery * Marital and sexual slavery * Immigrants  * People captured during wartime  Source: http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/courses/teachers_corner/49355.html  http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml   Even if a person wasn't a slave themselves, being a descendant of that legacy still has an effect. For example, my mom and aunt grew up in Jim Crow and segregated schools. My aunt got her arm broken for attempting to go to a white school in the south. I didn't but it still hurts to know people you cared about suffered through that. Empathy isn't limited in that way.   AFAIK slavery in the US was quite different than what previously occurred and what is happening currently. The trans-Atlantic slave trade and segregation was maintained because of beliefs about white superiority, which had never happened before.  I know this thread is old, but felt the need to point that out.   You can be any major and go to medical school as long as you complete the prerequisites.    Iowa, unfortunately. Moving soon hopefully.   Eugene, Oregon?  How's Asheville? I heard it's lesbian-utopia.   Feeling the thrill of being immune to a guy's attempt to seduce or flirt with you. *You have no power here!*   How are UTIs and bad hygiene a lesbian thing?   It's called Good Hair...  	107
 Swim. Dance.    At a dinner party at  house overlooking the bay in Goa. Just taking a break from conversations about cats, suicide, and primary healthcare.      Yeah, that's true. But it didn't look like a plane. And as I described above, seemed to move along the celestial sphere.  Thanks for your responses!   Unlikely. The rate of "ascension" was similar to the rate of "descent" of the setting moon. Plus seemed to be moving from E to W across the skies parallel to the celestial equator. I used my Google Skymap for confirming this. Disappeared soon after the sun rose. No noise. No jet trails.      Just listening to the station! Sounds really good! Thanks!   Not sure what this question means. But because I'm a huge fan of *The Civil Wars* and their song *The One That Got Away* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxCbfJtM2kU), I'm going to attempt to answer it.  My first boyfriend. I think that is my best relationship to date. It was a long-distance one and he got stolen away by someone who was very much like me who was closer to him. This happened so quickly, I was stunned and went into a downward spiral. Took me a year to get back.   Sorry for cutting in - if you get the time please check my responses below.  I'm in Mumbai, India. I have a similar problem getting my psychotropic meds for depression/anxiety. I have to go get them every month and it's quite traumatic because of the sheer anxiety of the pharmacists judging me. If I understand correctly, in the US, pharmacies get prescriptions directly from shrinks (at least that's what my friend in NYC told me), and you just have to walk up there and get your meds. Here, I have to get a physical prescription, go on the same date, and then stand for about 20 minutes to eventually get my meds. Plus, sometimes, they say "not in stock," which means I'll have to call them and/or visit them multiple times. I wish things were easier/better.   I take clonazepam 0.25 mg, haloperidol 0.25 mg, bupropion 150 mg (SR), and amitryptiline 5 mg. Yes, there are controlled substances. But I do have a valid prescription each time I got there. My shrink asked me to make my own prescription pad and prescribe myself!   Yes, here (in Mumbai, India) they need a copy of the prescription for records, plus your address and the doctor's address. I have to go to a large pharmacy to get it and there only one guys knows me. In fact, the last time, I had to write my registration number on the prescription because they would not give me another brand of the same generic medication because they think that if the doctor has prescribed one brand only that should be given. I thought it was ridiculous. I showed them my doctor's registration and then they had to give me. Still traumatic!   The anxiety of going to a chemist and then being judged for possible substance abuse - it's the worst. Plus, in India, they almost always have one thing or the other "not in stock." I wish there was mail-to-order facilities here.   A doctor here.   About antibiotics - I think you forget to mention that the most important reason for multidrug-resistant batcteria is rampant antibiotic use. This measure helps curb that.   Ellen DeGeneres   I have the same problem with my psychotropics meds for the treatment of depression/anxiety.   Thanks, will check it out.   Sounds very cool. Will check it out. Thanks.  	17
 Yes you're right ... I'm reluctantly accepting that I'll never be a care free anxiety-less person but trying to live and make the best out of it is challenge to say the least. Thanks for your insight   They do not say "Foreman" OP.   "BOIL WATER". What am I, a chemist?      Meant to write: sounds like your making smart choices. I recently got mine done  financed them and just finished paying them off. Best. Decision. I. Ever. Made. Just saying! :)   Well       I wish they both had a costume!   *Ruthless* adaptable pragmatism   I think this would have been more clever if they had the book versions of popular movies out now in the box.    Plank❤️  	11
 We can agree to disagree.    10/10    A little about me:   • I'm Maddison   • 19, Scottish  • Pansexual   • Post rock music, reading and games are my true loves 😍   Pm me a little bit about yourself and leave your kik :) Also, please be able to keep a conversation, I'm tired of having one sided conversations that last like 5 minutes ._.   That makes sense. I've felt like that sometimes too actually, especially the bit about constantly adjusting the hood! but for the most part it does help keep my anxiety rather low.   I'm sure I'm not the only one... hopefully anyway.   I'm prone to headaches, so I'll keep that in mind; thanks!    I do think we should just try and get hooper back, we know how he plays and we know he's got chemistry with quite a few of the other bhoys. For some reason though; Ronny is set on getting this guy :/   Wurly. Definitely wurly.   Everything about this is adorable :3   Awesome!   I do love all their albums. But if I had to choose a favourite; it would be either be.. Severed ties or Let the ocean take me :)    It is indeed :) They're one of my favourite bands.    Block, and be more careful of who you talk to.    I'm 19/F (obvious, perhaps) 😅 live in the UK. I'm interested in talking to some girls who are like myself, so I figured this sub reddit would be kinda perfect for that! :)   If anyone is, feel free to pm me/ask for my kik, whatever 😊   It's the longest in quite a while and I feel proud of myself, for once.   To anyone else in recovery/trying to recover. You *can* do it    http://imgur.com/xvC2hKl   First time in a while I've felt bad for laughing at anything on this sub - congrats OP  	17
 But you're alright to stare at a naked Newman, or do you find them pleasing to the eye?    Holy Shit, you're pathetic. Can you hurry up and have a heart-attack, you wheezing bag of offal?   Such apathy   I reckon.  And here I was with my rape-gloves ready and my trenchcoat well-oiled. All for nothing.      Give the Repopulation a shot. It's in Alpha but it's pretty fun from what I've played.   But why?   Wait, it doesn't support AMD?  How am I able to render, then? Or is the quality severely reduced?     Awesome article!   Yeah, I'm strangely attracted to men who are fucking cool, that I have a good time with. It's crazy I know! But there's just something about laughing and smiling and sharing some fun moments that turns me on.  All of my keks.   I guess a lot of it comes down to the belief that many of  these guys have that women care less about looks, and that all you need is a good personality to get a relationship.  Which is fallacious, of course, because women are as shallow as men and the good-looking girl these guys are expecting to woo through personality alone won't come but neither will the bad-looking girl.    Life is bleak.     Beauty is subjective to a point. It's been well-documented that all cultures believe facial symmetry=beauty.  You have no idea what my personality is. You're arguing at me through the perception that I fit into the 'niceguy' category; I don't because I don't blame women for my problems as I don't blame myself. It just is the way it is.  You can tell who's a FA type right off the bat and usually you nope out before they get clingy/obsessive or downright nasty.  That's what you tell yourself, then? It's more likely that you mark those you deem unattractive as FA/trp/neckbeards/niceguys and then make excuses for the character flaws of better looking men.  You're arguing from the assumption that you and other people in relationships have 'good' personalities, which is utter bullshit. The fact of the matter is that people make concessions for the flaws they find in attractive people over the flaws they find in unattractive people.  Don't fool yourself. No one gives a shit about your 'personality'; they like you because you fit into a range of attractiveness determined by society. You really think you'd be such a 'good' person if you looked as I do?    Hadn't checked her profile.  It's funny that the sorts of people that berate and bemoan our existence are weak, seething sacks of vileness. It's kind of insulting that she's even trying to give advice on 'personality' when she clearly has a terrible one and has still had relationships.   Lel.   So you're agreeing with me, then? That women treat me the way they do because of how I look?   I don't lash out at women, anyway. I 'lash out' at malicious hypocrites like yourself that damn ugly men for feeling down about their lack of success with women, and force feed them these lies about personality.   You're shallow, I'm shallow, everybody's shallow. Personality means little compared to physicality.   Get over it and be thankful that you weren't born ugly. I'd be thankful if I hadn't been born at all.   Although I can't give examples of everyday racists in relationships, besides the casual racism of one of my friends, Mel Gibson, John Mayer, Donald Stirling ( now *he* is a good argument against the myth of personalitymoney/looks) are all notable racists who have been in many relationships, I'd assume.  This sub is for making fun of pitiful "nice guys' that think being the bare minimum for a human being entitles them to sex / reciprocated affection, and who are actually not very nice at all.  [Top post, clear emphasis on the guy's face and the irony in his words](http://i.imgur.com/dIMJAuR.jpg)  [Top post, huge emphasis on the guy's face, more so than what he's actually saying](http://i.imgur.com/BHZD6Ep.jpg)  You honestly think that if these guys had been attractive, they'd still get the same attention from your sub?     You're a self pitying racist twat from the looks of your profile  No, shithead, I was criticizing some dickhead who had called a black woman a monkey because she'd attacked a white woman. Did you even read my comments on that matter? Besides, what does it matter whether I'm racist or not? Many racists are in relationships.  You're a fool if you think ugly guys can 'overcome' their ugliness by having a stunning personality. Would you date an ugly man? Look at the sub that you're in. The entire purpose of this cystic place is to make fun of unattractive people, with the excuse that it's their 'personalities' that is the problem.  I suggest you take a look at yourself and be thankful that you received validation to uphold such delusion.   I could have any attitude I wanted and I'd still be single.   The world isn't just, stop trying to convince yourself that it is.   When someone gets rejected constantly despite following 'advice' from such 'enlightened' individuals as yourself, it's near impossible to maintain any kind of positive attitude.   I dress nicely.  I am not fat.  I shave and shower regularly.  None of this will change my face, friend. If you truly believe that 'being attractive is easy', then you are either wilfully ignorant or maliciously cynical.  Most wealthy people inherit their wealth, are they go-getters?   The Long Dark and Subnautica are pretty well done, though...   Don't bother arguing with him, man.  The guy's using the same tactics my twelve-year old brother used to.   Yeah, nice trolling, beb.  You got me good.   Alright, mate.  I know your game, and I know I won't win an argument against someone with either the logical reasoning of a cucumber or wilful trolling.  Good luck to you, buddy.   Whatever,man.   You know full well why you're being upvoted, and why you used that term in relation to a topic unnecessarily turned into something about race.   The title says, 'black women...white lady', it's been framed in the topic of race, therefore obviously changing the connotation of your comment.   'People are monkeys', you didn't say-- you said 'Monkeys are going to be monkeys' with a clear underlying tone of who in the video you deemed to be the monkey. Or are you saying you weren't defending the girl who'd been attacked, and calling her a monkey instead for no reason? The people upvoting you know this as well, but believe that because you aren't yelling, " I hate blacks," you're not being overtly racist and they can silently confirm their own latent racist beliefs.    You're the racist that assumes a monkey has to be black,   This isn't high school, you invalid. Twisting your connotations won't work on people with an inkling of common sense. Keep your poorly-hidden racism to yourself.   You're pathetic.   Why is this cunthole getting upvoted?   Fuck you, you're the monkey; a monkey so afraid of other people solely on the basis of them having a different skin colour.   So, looks, money, status, etc? You support the O.O.P's point,then?   So, wait... you disagree that confidence attracts women?   [M'lady :^)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_bqDa8IVfto/VP8RWii9S3I/AAAAAAAAAHk/f3a--zE_nkU/s1600/Cartoon21.jpg)   Wh...where do we get this magical 100 MB/s? I'm stuck at 4.5 at $100 a month.      :l    PUSSY MUSE OVER EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS OF IDENTITY, REALITY AND MEANING   Yeah, the pickup line was me being facetious and I guess that didn't work.  I agree with you that the dog pick is strange but I've go literally no other photos besides shitty selfies taken on my laptop.   The Guardians of Ga'Hoole.  Sure, it's a kid's book but one of my favourite series as a kid.  For something more adult, I recommend The Dark Tower by Stephen King.   It's all just ego-inflating,man.   A lot of the submissions here are of people who the OP deems unworthy of their attention, so they boost their egos by posting it as a token of how much better they are than this particular individual.  Disclaimer: Most posts however are actually legitimately creepy posts and can provide a decent example of what not to do for those of us that have trouble discerning what is and isn't 'creepy'.   Shit, you live a pretty hard life,eh?   *Such hardships, such oppression*   Looks like *someone* needs their rotors oiled!   Yeah, I should probably take my profile pic more seriously. I just have no photos of myself at all. :/   They generally just chill or go into hiding. Their bite is pretty painful,though.   Don't worry,op!   Huntsmen are bros!

I dunno,man.   In a way it's commendable that you've soldiered on so long because I know that if I hit 25 and I'm still the way I am, it's the rope for me. I just can't fathom living this sort of life for 33 years.   Jesus Christ.  You made 33 years without offing yourself? How do you manage?

Face reality; these poor cunts have the cards stacked against them from the get-go, and I doubt that showering and buying new clothes would fix the years of social ostracising that led them to adopt this weirdness.  Sometimes the cost and relatively poor outcomes of entering the dating world is far more detrimental than just living in a fantasy world like these guys do.    Yep, under the sheet.  He's pretty clean,though.   Sorry to disappoint but I sent her a text and she hasn't replied for the entire day. I think it's gg, unfortunately.    After a few messages or so. I've been told you have to be quick, I guess I might have been too quick? She said sometime next week might be good, though.   Ha, yeah.   Probably not my best opener.   Bulldog raspy crickets and centipedes.  I would burn the world if it meant I could get rid of those demons.   I recently started with online dating and after setting up my profile, began to send off a bombardment of messages.  A couple of girls replied, one negatively ( I asked her if she liked A Serbian Film because she was Serbian) and one relatively positively. It turned out that the girl who responded favourably was into a lot of the things I liked as well.   I figured it wouldn't hurt asking for her number, not expecting anything, and she agreed. We moved to text and I asked whether she wanted to hang out sometime in the week, to which she replied that she was busy but would let me know if she was free.  I'm not really used to interacting with women like this, so I'm wondering if it's a bad sign that she said she'd let me know instead of just straight up saying yes or no. I also don't know whether I should wait or whether I should contact her again to see what she says.  What do you guys think?  Edit: Texted her and she didn't reply. GG, I guess.  	53
 I have the same feelings ,I don't see myself dating a cis person anymore because I got so much shit from them that it's hard for me to believe they really understand I'm a guy and aren't just saying what they think I want to hear to have their way.   Doesn't help that I'm a FtM attracted mostly to guys and the worst thing would be them seeing me "as a girl with a weird fad" ( two of my exes did,I only knew after ending the relationship.)  Then,if you and the cis person really match,it might not be the best to pass on the opportunity of a great relationship ! It's a case by case thing,I guess.    Here is mine :  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0hJc6tVQDjx  I've been working on it for a while now so this became a pretty natural voice to me but I don't think I sound like a guy at all,more like a "low voice for a girl",ugh.  Any advice appreciated ! :)   I made one one day. 10 pages long and never have worded things so well in my life. But basically it's me explaining my reasons for such an act,that I noone is responsible but myself with a large spoon of " don't fuck up what you have and don't spit on it you could have ended up like me". And a bit of a love letter.    Well,I'm attracted by people who are somewhat in the middle of the gender spectrum, usually.   I identify as male but I like to present either gender or a mix of the two,just because clothing and make-up is way too fun to limit myself.     This is exactly what I do,but with clothing. Gives me a reason to live for another 5 to 10 business days depending on the website,ha !   It happened to me a few times,was hanging out with friends and felt like I didn't belong here,their happiness made me sadder than I usually am, so I left.    Thank you for your help !   I think I'm going to tell friend 2 that I don't see how I could be friends with someone who uses my identity as laughing stock,I might come back on my decision if he offers me a sincere apology but I don't think he will. :/   I get questions often actually,and I really don't mind them when people ask me in a respectful way ! I've found it easier for people to understand after explaining the hows and whys of the matter. But this friend really asks in a "let's see what he/she ( depends if he decided to respect my pronoms that day ) has to answer so I can see if it's bullshit for attention/eventually get a good laugh out of it and provide my peeps with some good gossip"      	7
 Same here. I can relate to that. I used to listen to music and would just be able to escape for a while.  I tried the other day and I really struggled with listening to music. I would turn off the music a few minutes after. Pm me if you feel like you ever want to talk to someone.   Am experiencing the same with ear ringing. It's irritating. :(   I won't do it. I've been wondering about it but now I feel a bit better with others saying no and there are options.  Thank you guys.   I forgot to take my anti depressant medicine and I'm already in bed. I usually take it every evening.  Should I take it now anyway?? (2am EST here)   I've been thinking about shaving my eyebrows off so I can grow them back and shape my eyebrows better... Has anyone have done this before? Does it help? Should I leave my eyebrows alone?   I'm his wife, hi :) Message me as well.  UPDATE: Tickets are sold. Apologies.   Thanks for sharing. Needed to read this.   Thanks, I'll check it out!   Thanks!   Do you melt the coconut oil first before putting it on your face to be able to wipe the makeup off?   I might have missed it when I was searching on reddit's search bar but because I ran out of makeup remover wipes, I was wondering what would be the best way to remove makeup? Olive oil, coconut oil, something that may be safe for me to remove makeup at home?? I have no means of transportation to buy more makeup remover wipes.

 Data of my boyfriend:  * Age: 22 * male * 1.80m * About 75 kg? thin but muscular. * Race: white, European * BPD was diagnosed 4 years ago. He has been on/off suicidal for I think about 9 years now. * Switzerland * No physical illnesses. He self-harms from time to time. * No medication currently. He used to be on benzos (Temesta, in combination with the ADs and alone on the closed ward/ crisis intervention), a variety of antidepressants and some neuroleptics. He stopped taking medication 4 years ago. He says that it did not help. To my knowledge he never had any dependency issues.  ___________________________________________________   My boyfriend has got borderline personality disorder. He does manage relatively well on the outside. But inside of the relationship... it is hard to describe the wicked tangles of guilt and sometimes abuse that such a relationship *can* mean. I've been with him for 5 years.  **Anything I ever tried is to make him happy**. This was my goal and the intention behind everything I did and said in this relationship.    He says that I destroyed everything he liked by not "liking it enough myself". And lying about it. Well yes I tried to like his hobby and the disgusting sexual things because I was scared that he would kill himself if I don't. But doing anything with him is difficult. He gets angry at the smallest things...    His hobby is something creative and when I don't have an idea how to make it look better he would get angry at me for not trying hard enough and not liking it enough. Because if it would really be my hobby I would have an idea. And always want to do it even if I had a long day or should do other work.   He can not differentiate. That you can like something at a certain time and under certain circumstances and not under different ones. That it is possible that he is important to me and at the same time I choose to study or work over doing something with him sometimes because I have to.  I am in medschool. On track to be able to choose any speciality I want. Yes I study a lot and I know this takes a toll on a relationship. He makes me feel guilty whenever I study. Or when I go home.   The other thing is sex. I am asexual. I had no idea when the relationship started, other wise I would have *never* started it. I tried hard to like sexual things. Then I tried just to endure it. Not all asexuals are this way but for me it is like I imagine having sex with the wrong gender is for hetero or homosexual people (I don't really know how to describe it for bisexuals...).    This is a situation that would put ever relationship on the line. Even if both parties are mentally healthy. I understand and I allowed my boyfriend to have sex outside of the relationship and he can find a new girlfriend and end things at any time. I hope he does.     Anyway this is getting way to long. Last evening he was depressed again. I tried to be emotionally detached so that I could present a loving girlfriend and let all the insults and very hurtful things he said go over my head. We talked for about two hours... about all the things that do not work. I always tried to propose ideas on how to ensure that he would not feel like I just "played with him" anymore and how he would never feel that I am "ignoring him if he needs me". I kept that constructive sweet girlfriend persona. Screaming inside at some things he said. But I kept it together.    And it almost worked... I proposed to try one week where I'd spent all the time possible at his place (his claim of me not having enough time for him), in which we would do a new project with his hobby (knowing that I'd have to *enjoy* it in any second he wants) and generally where I'd try to keep this persona up (of course I did not say that).    And he agreed. With one extra demand: He wanted to do what he sexually wants. (Which is some dominant humiliating play).   And I just lost it. All the calm, collected... I just cried at the though of having to do this again and again. And yes I blew it with this. He did not want the sex anymore seeing me crying. And went back to being totally depressed and telling me how sadistic it is of me to not allow him to kill himself.    Fuck this shit.   ____________________________________________________________  Now I am trying to see this in perspective. My goal in life is to help people. **I will be a doctor no matter what he does and says**.    We work together which creates some difficulties because he randomly allows me to work or not (saying that he has no obligation to allow his coworker to be at his place and block his computer, it was a lot different when we started the job) and I need his PC and software. I will only work with him until fall 2016 though.  **Of course I tried and am still trying to get him into therapy again. He has been in and outpatient on and off for years.**  Anytime I ask for advice people tell me that I should kill him.   Meaning to just leave him in his mess... and I honestly thought about that. But I think killing someone just to have it easier myself is wrong. Especially when my purpose is to help others (and I love medicine by the way). And just because it would be socially acceptable to end a relationship knowing that the other person would see this as a permission to kill himself.... I think it is the same as stopping CPR on a patient who still has a chance. Yes it is exhausting but my well-being can't be more important than another persons life.   ___________________________________________________  Now I am trying to decide what to do next. I basically have two **options**:   **1. I do the sexual stuff**, don't start to cry and start a new cycle of semi-happy bf until it will be at this point again because I slipped and missed a clue on what he actually wants or do something he sees as lying or anything really.. I once brought out a mosquito in a glass and put the glass to close to the door... He scolded me for it and then got angry because I looked sad while he was saying that I am stupid... And everything was back to the beginning....   **2. I don't do what he wants**. He would see this as me not loving him anymore... and maybe as permission to suicide. Whenever I say that I am scared that he would kill himself if I left he says that this is a challenge to him to kill himself asap while we are still together.  The **3. option** would be call the police and try to get him into a closed psych ward. No use of that. He would play sane and be out in a few weeks, definitely not trusting me anymore and ready to kill himself because he just had weeks to plan it. _____________________________________________  **Tl;dr: Oh jeez summarizing that. Boyfriend suicidal and has borderline, wants stuff I can't give him.**    **Do I have other options?**    **Do you have any advice?**  ^(maybe ^other ^than ^kill ^him...)   **Can you help me put this into perspective?**  I am trying to somehow keep a positive outlook of my life. I mean this will be over at one point. I may have killed a person with my lack of sexuality but I will be a doctor. And at one point I will live again and maybe be ok.    I don't know if I'll be able to reply to answers...   Thanks to everyone having read all of this.   	1
 I'm at college, linguistics major. I'm also working part-time in a medical laboratory :)   Another question from me - I wanted to watch the Fate/Stay Night series a while ago, but to be honest, I'm hella confused which is the correct order to watch them, which series are alternatives or remakes... can anyone break it down for me?   Oh man. I just watched the first ep, and what can I say, I love you I guess. JUST what I love right there. Can't wait to watch more, thanks a LOT! :)   So, I'm still searching for a new anime to watch.  My favourite anime are Jigoku Shoujo, Shigofumi and Shinigami no Ballad, so you could say my preferences in anime are quite clear, lol. Does anyone now of another anime going in this direction? (Supernatural, dealing with afterlife and how people see it, drama-esque).   Would be glad if someone knew anything!    It affects your starting stats. Also, the lords in the game will appreciate you more if you choose to go for the "Noble" background, which makes it easier to get land etc. (the same applies when you choose to play a male character instead of a female)   I have similar experiences. I have often HUGE problems falling asleep and lying around waiting until my body decides it's ok now to fall asleep is just super annoying and exhausting for me. I'll mostly procrastinate at the PC too - "let's just check reddit" "let's just answer this mail", "let's just play quick round of civ V" - and then i realize i have about 2-3 hours left until i need to get up for work.    /r/shurima    Studies don't show everything. The people I've experienced - NONE of them would show up in a study because no one got violent to a degree that would be seen as significant enough to be noticed. They didn't go and shoot up their school (which might be correlated to me being not from the US and therefore VERY limited availability of weapons) - they got in trouble for arguments and brawls, for skipping school, broke up with their SO's which claimed they became emotionally blunted, they isolated from friends. Nothing of these points influenced these studies from what I get of the articles - and ofc not everyone who plays shooters gets CRIMINAL. I never stated that. And that's why I said those studies do not say that much - because they leave out the huge aspect of those people who change, but do not end up commiting actual crimes.    I like Consort better than Janitor, but i think that is personal taste to a certain degree.  The point is, that with the ranked role list it is pretty easy to claim things anyway, since there is an any and all town roles are random - from my experience, it's pretty rare in ranked that someone gets caught out because his role does not fit with the list and the graveyard. In classic Janitor would be pretty good indeed, but there he himself ain't on the list. Additionally, not only Medium, but also spy can screw Janitor over, since he will know too when you tell your maf mates what the cleaned person was, and might call you out if you claim that exact role. Forgot to mention that in original post.    The Birthday Massacre - Leaving tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDTp4GiiZdY    I have had a good friend in school, who changed A LOT in personality when he picked up these kind of games at the age of ~ 14. He isolated himself from others, started hating around, joined a "shooting club" (i dont know the englsih word for this) and started talking about killing people frequently, etc. My boyfriend's brother had the exact same development, along with some other people I know who were not that extreme, but still showed a change in personality. I refuse to believe that this all is a huge coincidence.     There are also "proofs" that vaccination causes autism. If you search long enough, you will find a way to present your point "scientifically" - but that does not change my personal experience that people become more violent, less empathic when they play these games.    I actually DO think that playing ego-shooters increases your willingness to use violence and causes emotional blunting.   edit: gettin' downvoted on an unpopular opinion thread, i did it reddit! ppl playing shooters are mad as fuck.    you havent played TES daggerfall have you?    First of all, Disguiser. It's fairly common to write your name in your will, which immediately will get you lynched. Even if that does not kill you, the usage of this role is very limited - ofc it can be great if you manage to disguise as a confirmed town etc., but thats very rare and most of the time you're basically a waste of a maf spot.  Janitor: Can be good, but is also very situational since in like 80% of cases you get a townie anyway, and if there's a medium still ingame, it counters out a janitor fully. Better than Disguiser, still a little underwhelming i think.  Framer: As some others mentioned, only useful if it is unclear if there's a Framer in game or not. In that case, a pretty good role I think   Sheriff: Just inferior to the investigator, since you can not find GF, untransformed WW or Witch and are likely to be called out Exe if you claim to be Sheriff (because tbh, thats like the most common Exe strategy ever)  Survivor: Not underwhelming in power, but I think this is a really boring role concept. write "im surv dont kill" in chat day 1, vest up night 1, afk and win. I think this role could be a lot more interesting if it got a rework or something similiar.   witch: until you have found a killing role/ mafia to team up with, you are most likely already dead. even teaming up does not save you from getting killed randomly at night, and you have no chance of winning anymore if you are dead. meh.    on r/relationships there was a guy who had his gf's father staying in his house and heard strange noises at night, leading him to believe his gf was sleeping with her father.  he said he would check the room next time - and never was seen again.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2bem8p/i_26m_think_my_girl_friend_21f_is_sleeping_with/   I hope I'm not too late...?    But if he was completly incapable of communicating, why did he admit to it? Why didn't he stick with it? I'll tell you why - because not everything people do is part of a well-thought, dirty plan. I don't believe he actively thought "Eh, i need to SABOTAGE THIS DIET". He was just unsure what to do, and decided for the wrong way. I heard that happens to most people sometimes, and I also heard most people are not in therapy.    He offered to cook dinner. Answer: No thanks, I'll make my own. He brought donuts: Answer: No thanks, I'm not hungry.  Where exactly did you disprove my point?  	19
    Who made those shoes? If you were born into an impoverished family in a war torn nation being exploited for cheap labor and resources, you probably would know them.   I can't believe some of the pig faced comments posted here so far. This is as much of a tragedy as is the behavior this man was protesting. I would like to see some of the more hateful commenters perform a fraction of good this man accomplished in his life. No matter how you spin it, the fact that people are setting themselves on fire to protest injustice should tell us that we need to wake up and start living together before we all die alone.   May be, but his legend lives on. My neighbor is one of dozens of his grandchildren, and she has three kids of her own and even a brand new grandchild of her own. This man will truly never be forgotten in more ways than just his phenomenal blues.   This sounds like depression and a some kind of detachment disorder.  They will put you on Prozac. That didn't work for me. If you can afford to I would highly advise seeing a psychologist.  I might suggest some thrill seeking. I am an adrenaline junkie and get kicks from doing potentially dangerous things in a big way, and its caused me a lot of grief. Instead I had at one point immersed myself in playing enemy territory and got my fix from long killing sprees. Maybe you can find something similar that makes you feel alive.  Deep sea fishing Snow skiing Building stuff with power tools Auto mechanics Bicycling across town Road trips to nowhere Make bullets and shoot at a gun range  This list can go on. These are guy things I do to keep myself sane. Well, I used to but can't anymore for a couple of reasons, so what I am saying is that if I were you I'd get out there and live a little while you can, learn to love life, or one day you might be left with nothing but a bible to read.   My buddy's recliner needs to be replaced badly and I don't have a penny to my name or I would buy one for him off Craigslist. He is a parapalegic ball of laughs and strength in my life and I want to help him so I thought I would ask here about resources for getting him set up. He lives in a tiny apartment with an 80 year old man who we both love like a grandfather. They have a very limited and fixed income, and my buddy doesn't even have a bed to lay in. He lives in his recliner and needs a replacement that he can get some rest in so he don't have to sleep on the floor with bugs.  Any suggestions are really appreciated. This guy has shown me more hospitality than I can repay today and I just want to help him in what way I can by getting him a new chair.  I have a beat up convertible to carry the chair in, but suggestions on how to move it in a safe/legal manner are also appreciated.  Thank you Corpus Christi   With the US taxpayer getting frequently scammed by crooked contractors, often to the tune of billions at a time, seeing this makes me wonder at what point China will really be spending more in terms of actual productivity.   Ah, CCPD at its best.  I grew up there and have been arrested for no fucking reason so many times that I got so sick of being treated like I criminal that I didnt care when I actually became one.     It seems logical that runaway melting of the polar ice caps at the end ot the last ice age could explain this. The timing coincides with the latest pre-history of civilization as we know it, and we do know the coastlines looked very different wih all that water being stored in collossal ice massifs. Whats more is that it follows to understand how populatiin centers are mainly located on coastlines.  Ive always considered a foregone conclusion that many ancient cities around the world have been submerged under a hundred fert of water only to be discovered long after our climate has its way with this planet.   In locating these sites one ciuld take a look at the pattrrn of building our cities near the mouhs of rivers bordering thr ocean. It would make sense to look at  such areas that at one time were promontory, scenic, or oherwise provided some level of ptacticality to build out a city.  I recently learned the Aborigines have a vey dependable method by which informatikn is passed from one generatikn to the next, and thier stories are very speciific about sea levels rising dramaticalky enough to submerge two riverc basins under several feet of water.   The fact that we deal in probablities goes against the notion of an infinity. Its hard for me to imagine somewhere out there all things are happening at all points in time, yet I am stuck at home with a headache trying to figure out how that's even possible.   Another possibility is that proof is all around us that the universe is infinite, but we are simply unable to grapple with the enormity of the observation because we are monkeys.  Whats another way to substantiate an infinite universe constrained by probability? Sounds impossible (haha).   What happens at the center of this torus? Is it possible to make gravity work in reverse this way? Could that happen at the barycenter/horizon of merging black holes?   Help me understand something: how can we exist in an infinite universe when some unimaginable organization of energy, matter, and space time has not, for example, made contact with us? In such an infinitesimal universe, by its very nature there would have to be an instantiation somewhere out there that would obviate the nature of an infinite universe to us - and any other entity capable of observing anything at all.  That is to say, the universe *must* be finite because our *observations* are finite. Nothing from some otherwise theoretical part of the universe has wandered towards me, or you, or the moon, to tell us any different. Just as our existence in some hypothetically infinite universe may include our sunsets and emotions, there *must* be something out there observable by us to reinforce any theory of an infinite universe, but there is not - as evidenced by the simple fact that I am here asking you this question.  Does this make sense? I am saying there isn't another you out there *anywhere* because if there were one more, there's infinite more, and with this infinitesmal organizations thing at least one of them should be knocking at your door *right now*.  If infinite combinations of matter and energy are out there then why hasnt one of them ended the universe as we know it? The answer is because the universe must be finite - or - there are a finite number of way matter, energy, and spacetime can interact.  Either way the implication here is that one day we will truly be able to understand all this crap well enough to fly through space and time like intergalactic tourists without a care. The concept of infinity doesn't sir well with me.   You've hit the nail on the head. As someone coming from an IT background, the ways businesses systems work, and computers in general for that matter, are exactly as described. Defects are reported, studied, and fixed until that tendril of protocol or code is so highly tuned that they solidify into dependable construct.  In the industry we call this "Best Practice", and I can tell you from 20 years of experience developing such things that what I see in law enforcement is the exact opposite of a functional system. IT people are paid to literally solve hellaciously complex problems, and it pains me to see such an obvious need for an overhaul, especially when so much unnecessary suffering is taking place.  The situation being discussed here is what we call a "Mode of Failure", identifiable by a distinct set of circumstances with a highly predictable outcome. Unless something fundamental is changed, this is bound to repeat until the system crashes. Its that simple and this rule applies to every practical application of scientific theory out there.   You're looking at it.   So is everything else tied to transport.   Dear North Korea,  In response to your most recent threat of imminent war with my country, the United States of America:  We would like to see you try. Everyone here owns guns, local law enforcement wants to kick your ass so bad they are picking fights with everyone, our state police hunt down fugitives and corrupt politicians, our federal agencies know everything about you, and it would only take a single digit percentage of our military to turn your country into the world's biggest parking lot.  Your country has roughly the same population as the State of Texas, and I bet 10 of the toughest people in Texas could take out every single member of your most elite combatants. 5 of our brightest IT guys could turn your lights off forever, and just 1 of our teachers could turn your entire population against you.  Be afraid, and stay that way. You have a good reason: your biggest and best are inferior scum in the eyes of the rest of the world.  Sincerely,  A tenth generation US citizen who's ancestors have fought and won every major war his country had endured.    haha.. this makes me feel good. i sense these guys arent out there filling ticket quotas. we'll see.   Then a patent troll ruins everything.   Anyone else laughing thier ass off at this?   All the fish are gonna die. What a bummer. At least I got pictures.    Border Security is just like any other "bi-partisan" issue out there. Agencies request "ass" amount of dollars to follow through with thier proposals. The govt grants them only half of that.  Do the math and you get our current situation.   TIL these two fields are mutually exclusive.   Polar bears! I knew it.  Now that obligatory, dim-witted sarcasmism is out of the way, what more will it take for people to realize what is happening? I hate to admit that I hope the weather gets a lot worse a lot sooner so the last straw gives us a head start in fighting it all. This research obviously has financial support. Why not just divert that funding into directly combatting the scandalous bribery enabling oil cartels to do business? Instead of drilling more uselesd core samples why not line the pockets of congressmen?   Cognitive dissonance must be one hell of a drug. This is a very interesting discovery.   For the record, it has occurred to this insignificant commenter that oil spilling into aquifers is a good way to make money by selling bottled water. My uneducated ass wouldn't be surprised to see Koch Bros. brand of bottled water being sold over the Olgallalla in the accident prone future of this pipeline.   I wonder how many "intoxicated" first offenders he put in Williamson county jail for three years.   You were just given waterfront property. For free. By your father.   You want to sell it?!  Unless you have a backup plan for life in general I would suggest you keep that property and give it to your children some day. There will be water in that ground for a long time after the rest of Texas dries up.     To all of you joking about this: It could happen to you or someone you love before you even wake up in the morning. You are more likely to get killed by a cop than you are to win a good chunk of any lottery.   Now let me ask you a question: How many lottery tickets did you buy last year?   Most people in this country live paycheck to paycheck, and the majority of those who do not are on public assistance. Requisite expenditure of limited or non-existent income on privately cntrolled interests is in no way a solution. Only a single payer system will work. Unfortunately the current healthcare regime is built upon such a deeply entrenched economic construct that upending it too quickly would be on par with taking down big banks. Too big to fail, so now we have this bastardized middle ground tilled by the right and effectively shat upon by the left.  And we here hold a proverbial, flaming bag with still no wsy, for many of us, to treat the burns.   He probably hasn't taken that middle school history class yet.   I looked up redneck on the Internet and couldn't find anything about their collective stance on police brutality.   Can you provide us with their contact info so we can call the redneck HQ and gather a consensus? I demand accountability from this group of which you speak for their obviously biased stereotyping. The belief of infallibility in an otherwise notoriously corruptible profession is reprehensible, and we *must*, as *true Americans*, confront said ethnic group to set the record straight!  Gosh. You really have worried now. If it weren't for these *rednecks* everywhere we might have, as a country, taken a much different turn long ago. Maybe we should make them wear a red bandanna around their necks so we know who the *real* enemy is..   I see a waste of good dungeon space. Why not just squish all of them into the same iron maiden at the same time? It will save on dungeon maintenance fees, and we can write it off like we bought 16 iron maidens and paid as many torturers to agitate them. The bonus is they'll die much faster so we can also save on the sewage we would otherwise feed them for however long they might survive in the individual masks.  If you want to beat these people all you have to do is think like them. The rest will come naturally.   People who work high up at Comcast must have the same mentality of North Korean politicians. They have to know Satan reserves a spot for them to bend over and take it for eternity if there is a hell at all, yet they continue to meet and exceed our expectations of evil incarnate. Even then, everyone literally just sits and watches it happen, mouths agape, bugged eyeballs drying, as this company redefines what it means to abuse people.  Make them pay for ads, I say. Charge people to get kicked in the groin. They'll love it, guaranteed to beg for more.   If I were Comcast I would personally stick my arm into the first TWC ex-customer's butt hole and squeeze their wallet, just because it isn't illegal.  It would be in the contract, okay?   You know, the whole corporate personhood thing. Just once. Just because. Hey, if people didn't like my service they could always go somewhere else, right?   Your bills don't add up to anywhere near six figures.  You are paying entirely too much for your car. Buy used, pay in full, purchase liability, problem solved. With what you make you could spend ONE pay check on a nice ride. I bought a Mustang Cobra on Craigslist that's in amazing, rebuilt condition, for $5k. I have a terrible driving record and my liability insurance is only $65 a month.  You are probably paying too much for rent. Move into affordable housing, another problem solved. I found a 2br/2bath apartment within walking distance of work, had 2 roomies, and my share of the bills was $350. We spent a hell of a lot more on food. Nevertheless....  With what you make you could fix your credit outright in three years. Pay off your debts, and be honest about your spending. You don't need cable TV, an XBox or PSN subscription, or other expensive habits if you are going to act like you're hurting.  If you have such amazing experience with software architecture at the age of 23 (lol...)... write yourself a fucking app for your brand new iPhone that tracks your spending for you. I've done my share of software architecture, and believe me, if you can't track $100k of *your own money* then you probably shouldn't be designing things that crunch numbers.  That said, congrats on ditching the church. You'll only grow more wise. Being trapped by zealots is definitely going to take a while to recover from.  Welcome..to the *real*.   its more like a sign of an auto maker who doesn't make complete junk that is designed to break so they can sell more junk parts.   You bet your ass coyotes will kill cattle, especially calves. Source: I grew up on a ranch in west Texas.  The worst parr is that coyotes just eat the soft parts and leave the rest of the carcass to rot. I cant believe youd require a 'citation' for this. Go watch Animal Planet, maybe search the web for 'food chain' or even 'scavenger'. 'Troll' might help you as well.   Someone please fucking tell me why this is not the scariest shit imaginable.   I think this person is trying to portray a very warped perspective on voting vs. not voting.   It has to be PR. Nobody with access to that kind of wealth can be stupid enough to believe that the SA is worth donating that kind of money to.   Psst, you.. you *are* **Reddit**.   Fucked? Really? Can you elaborate?  I was planning a trip to the valley. I don't want to be so fucked for not knowing Spanish. I was under the impression that I could go the rest of my life speaking English in the US and not have to worry about getting fucked.  Do tell.   I bet you think DiGiorno is delivery, too.  The Salvation Army is a **for profit** company.  Why anyone would give these assholes an ounce of gold is beyond me. The poor will never see it. The SA just sells overpriced junk, which they get **for free**, to poor people.  Their clothes might be the only good thing going for them.   No, what this should put an end to is people who think they know everything, but as you've demonstrated, it has not.  Linux is just a tool. A great tool at that. It's stable, secure, and runs on billions of CPUs.  Proprietary operating systems suck because this caliber of hole goes unpatchable for a long time after being reported to the vendor.  The open source community is hammering out a fix right now. You can thank them for it. They are doing it for free, for you, since you don't know how.  Nothing personal. If you don't like it then call up your OEM and demand something more costly that may or may not work either, but probably has a piss poor track record by contrast.  Have a good one.   Texas is not the only place where corruption exists.  Look at the front page of this website. People everywhere are protesting against police brutality across the country.  If you hate Texas so much, then just leave. Your attitude sucks, and you are a coward for it.   Because it's Friday night, evidently.   Are you kidding? Have you ever sat in a Walmart parking lot with a 12 pack and a portable grill on Black Friday? In *Houston*?   It's almost as good as watching UFC. The police scanner is just noise that adds to the frenzy.   not what retailers expected.   I think you mean:  not what stockholders were told.  Overall I think people are buying more useless junk than ever - they just don't have to spend all their money on it one day anymore.   The best deal I ever got on Black Friday was at Home Depot. I bought some 5 cu. ft. storage containers to put all my other junk in. I think I paid about $2 each for like 10 of them.  That's 50 cubic feet of shit.  I even labeled what kind of junk it was before I stacked it on the curb, ie "Random Junk", "Miscellaneous Junk", "Broken Junk", "Her Junk", "Cheap Junk", "Incomplete Junk", "Useless Junk", etc.  Now I spend Black Friday in the parking lot at Walmart with a 12 pack and a portable grill, listening to a police scanner and wearing obnoxious jerseys, so I can watch everyone spend their hard earned money on the exact same junk I threw away years ago.   Put your mother-in-law through an orthodontic college. It might be more than a year, but you'll have free dental care for life for the whole family, which will save tens of thousands of dollars because we all know you need more dental work than you let on.  Bonus for getting her to pay for it.  Might as well. She's not doing anything else anyway.  *I don't recommend this if you have an uneasy relationship with your mother-in-law.   You won't have a lick of sense until you are 40.  -Landlord   Ill say its a reach, but you can bet your ass NK has some gear and the experts to run it. One does not need big iron or even to start young to pull off something like this. One needs only determination and patience.  Of course, being a genius would probably help some, and I dont doubt that there are more than a few highly capable within the ranks of that goverment.   Why bother asking Shell for money they wont pay? If I were Nigeria I would sell my oil on my own. What a concept.   Usually the glaciers from the mountains in west Texas dont reach Corpus until around mid-January, but this year an ice flow is expected down the Guadalupe river that might bring colder air temps into the area.  I dont know what to tell you. If you ever get Internet access where you are at you might check the forecast. Its snowing here right now with 45 mph winds and temperatures are expected to dip into the single digits this week. Id go ahead and reserve a condo in Port A just in case the Gulf of Mexico ice sheet doesnt advance until the glaciers get here.   As a proud citizen of a free country, I think I speak for many when I say:  **THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT CAN WALK BACKWARDS INTO A BAG OF DICKS**   Blame the victim, why don't you?       I was just trying to help.  Much wasn't offered about the situation other than the fact that someone wanted a handout, so I had to work with what I was given.  Speaking of which, this time of year there is a lot of dead brush piling up. Does it hurt to ask people if they need something done with their yard or around the house?   Someone should introduce a bill to require actual competence to hold public office.   When I was your age I was making piles of brush 10 feet tall in my neighborhood for money. If you have access to a lawn mower I'm sure people will be glad to pay you to mow their yards.  Good luck!  	59
 What restaurant? I live in phoenix.   What is my ship doing on trees oh   /hug  This sounds like a dangerous position. I think I know where you're coming from, if you want someone to talk to feel free to PM me. Just know you're never alone :)  Edit: I've had problems with medication, but I think you should talk to a doctor or therapist. I have no place to judge, but the sleeping pills sound harmful to you. Speaking from experience, you should try developing more healthy habits and getting in touch with people you have a more solid relationship with.    The thing about being diagnosed is that it solidified my problem and made it into something that needed to be TREATED, rather than just feeling sad and thinking that doing something fun or taking some time for myself could help. In a way, (at least for me) it was easier to deal with when there was no concrete solution, somehow. I don't know if anyone else experienced this   Thanks for the reading material :) I'm glad I started treatment relatively early. I guess for a while I've thought of it as 'crazy' because of the stereotype the media puts on people with depression. Besides, at 16 it's hard not to feel crazy. Especially since being 'crazy' and having all sorts of issues somehow makes you cool and sexy... That annoys me to no end  	5

But yeah he looked like he fell out of an 80's GIJoe cartoon.   solid work   you shush    no.   Sounds about right   I'm 24, point?   Was this a song?   Just following directions.   TIL: Spain is irrelevant    I had a martial arts instructor, for a Korean martial arts discipline, who was Cherokee, German, and had a flat top and a moustache. total badass.

Awesome, the town I grew up in skaters were fucked cus scating was illegal in all public places, and the local cop (also a little-person, which shouldn't make it funnier but lets face it, it does) spent his whole day chasing skaters to "teach them respect" in his words  	14
 I think I get what you're saying, but I was a dumbass and used it for bad instead of good :(. I kind of used the same technique to say "fuck it, the delusion of isolation isn't that bad!" I basically have convinced myself that happiness and sadness are just equal chemical reactions that are processed by our brains. If you reject the notion of happiness or sadness and accept being, it doesn't really matter if you're in solitude or with people.  Most of the time it works, but sometimes I really miss people. But then when I'm with people, I miss the solitude. Never can make 'em happy, eh?   The trivial details have been my identity for so long, I don't know what to do without them. Not taking life so seriously is what pushed me over the line and said "fuck it. time for isolation."   Now for a WTF:   Surprisingly, the one thing I really want to do is join the Peace Corps and live somewhere in the Indian Ocean. Live without much money and help people. I think part of my problem is with the corporate/individualistic world here.   Hilariously, for someone preaching isolationism, I think it'd be very therapeutic for me to be part of a community-based culture. Somewhere that life goes much slower, but is much more loving and less materialism. Somewhere I can't quit, because the 2 years of duty.    I'd love to talk to you sometime! Getting close to bed time for me and I'd like to reply to most of the thoughtful comments before I head off to my lovely land of dreams, so this might be short.   I agree totally, I wasted a ton of time in school. I'd love to be able to lecture on history - it'd probably be my dream job. But, I don't want to spend another 6-8 years in the schooling system.   College was very effortless for me. I have a damn near photographic memory when it comes to historic dates, history, details etc.,. But.. as I alluded to, my short-term as I call it "functional" memory is shot. I wont remember when assignments are due, what day of the week it is, people's names, where things go, what time I have to go places, etc., The brain is strange to say the least.  I actually went for something I have absolutely no interest in doing. I completely hate the financial system and that's why I went for finance haha.. To learn the tricks the wealthy use to control humanity. It's worked nicely :)   	2
 Shutup Davey Dave!!      He looks like Ted Bundy   This happens so often   I have been feeling like this a lot recently and it is freaking me out! It also sometimes makes me feel like I don't actually have depression for some reason   That's the same with me too :/    why?    SHIT how old were you??    	8
 Una foden?    it is for 10 minutes. but the feeling of thighs rubbing, completely losing what used to be a good waistline, and horrifically fat arms is not worth it, yet i still do it. i used to be 140lbs (am 5ft 7 ) and thought i was fat.    feels like no one / the world can't get you there.   have you tried any self-help books? i particularly find listening to them in audiobook form can be even better as it requires next to zero effort   You're not alone in thinking that way, although i know it feels like youre the only person in the world   I don't have personal experience with this situation but I imagine it will always hurt until you come to terms with the circumstances. I know that it's a stereotypical question but have you tried grievance or support groups?   Ask her if your suspicions are unfounded. Potentially she has an infatuation with someone else or perhaps she genuinely is just not interested in a boyfriend at the moment. Perhaps she's gay. What age are you both?   Can't help all that much OP as I'm not far off your situation. I would recommend seeing your GP and perhaps you show him this post. I also recommend audiobook or getting a book called the Chimp Paradox by Dr Steve Peters.   	8
 so what do you do when you find out your bf cheated on you last summer and so you break up with him and he doesn't give a single fuck and finds a new girlfriend 2 days later and you have no friends how do you not killyourself? we live in the same house and i'm stuck here for the foreseeable future and i can hear him laughing and flirting with her on skype while i'm laying on my bedroom floor crying and feeling like shit AND feeling pathetic for it bc he doesn't give a single fuck. i'm sorry for the rant i just hate myself so much right now   My boyfriend kissed his "family" friend last summer. He never told me. His mom said something vague about something between them, so I asked my boyfriend, and he said he just thought about it and had a very "caught" look on his face. I didn't believe him so I turned to facebook, messaged said girl, and asked her what really happened. She said that while she was staying the night at their house, they stayed up late watching a movie, and instead of going upstairs my boyfriend got into her bed with her and kissed her. She said after that she told him to leave, because she felt sorry for me. I never would've thought that anything would ever go on between them, ever. I've been around her plenty of times, and I never noticed anything between them previous to this.  After about a week of thinking things through and talking with my boyfriend, I decided that I still wanted to be with him. He said that he was just horny and lonely, since at the time of the incident I had been away for two months. Then, last night, I asked him if he wants to go to bed with me (we live in his parents house and have separate bedrooms but usually sleep together), but he said that he had to stay up late to work on a paper. About 20 minutes later I go back into his room to borrow his charger, and I saw him go through about 10 photos of a pretty Korean girl on facebook. I asked him calmly what he was doing and he looked "caught" again and said that she was just a girl from school and that there were other people from his class in the photos too. The problem is, I know he has a thing for asian girls. He always has since I've known him (since he was 11 years old), and I've seen him looking at them plenty of times, whether it be at school, on facebook, or even when I came across a file of porn he had saved titled "Asian Girls". He is white and I'm only a quarter filipino, so I look white for the most part. After a week break/when we were talking through stuff, he admitted, on three occasions that I knew about but had never got a straight answer from him, that he liked three different girls (all asian) in the past, while we were together. All three girls were in relationships at the time. I think if he had the chance, something would have definitely happened... Anyway, I looked him in the eyes after he replied, and asked him to please be honest with me. He told me that she was a friend of a friend that he just noticed her in a profile picture, and decided to look through her profile bc he thought she was pretty. It just made me feel like shit. I'm glad he was honest, but I can't help it. I'll never look like all the girls he's always looking at/is interested in. It's taken a serious toll on my self-esteem.   I don't know what to do at this point. It seems like this behavior will never end. However, I know he's young and so am I, and we've never been in a real relationship with anyone besides each other. I've never had a desire to be with anyone else while we we've been together. I've asked him multiple times why he wants to be in a relationship with me when it's obvious he wants to experience other people, but his response is always, "I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't know. I love you". I think he just has a problem with being lonely, and he likes the affection that I'm always giving him. I think it's hard for him to not have that, and maybe he's scared that he won't find/it will be a while before he does. If he finds someone while he's with me, then it would be easier for him. He'd just leave me and wouldn't have to have any lonely "in-between" time. He's going to Japan for a month and I don't trust him at all. I just don't know what to believe from him anymore. I always have to drag the truth out of him, and even then, I still can't tell if he's truly being honest with me.   I can't imagine being without him. It kills me to think about it. But I'm wondering now if it's because leaving him would be a huge change for me. I live in Washington with him and his parents, and breaking up would probably mean going back to California to live with my family, which I don't really want to do. I talked to his mom about it and she said that I could still live here, but I think it would be too uncomfortable. Even though I told him to please leave me alone right now, he's been coming into my room and telling me he loves me and stuff, when I asked him not to come in without permission. We've been together so long, and he's all I know... I don't really have any other friends. This is probably one of the toughest decisions I've had to make thus far in my life, and I am so lost as to what to do.     tl;dr: My boyfriend kissed another girl last summer, never told me about it. He's also constantly interested in other (asian) girls while he's been with me, and I'm not sure if this behavior will ever end. We've never been in a relationship with anyone besides each other, so I think he just wants to experience other people, but has never admitted to it. I can't imagine being with anyone else. Thinking about leaving kills me. I don't know what to do.    I recently found out that my boyfriend kissed his long time "family" friend last summer while I was away. He said that he was just horny and lonely since I was gone for so long (2 months), and that it would never have happened otherwise. It's a long story but I asked him about it and he said nothing happened, then I asked the girl he kissed and she said that he got into bed with her, kissed her, and then she stopped him and told him to leave. After about a week of really thinking about it and talking and working on it, I decided I still wanted to make the relationship work. And then tonight, I ask if he will go to bed with me, but he said he couldn't bc he was working on a paper for school and would be up late. I check on him 20 mins later to say goodnight, and he's going through a pretty korean girl's profile pictures on facebook, and while I was standing there for not even a minute, he went through about ten of them. I ask him calmly why he was looking at her photos, and he says she's just a girl from school and there's other friend's of his in the photos. Then I ask him to look at me in the eyes and tell me the truth. He says that she was just a friend of a friend on facebook and he thought she was pretty so he decided to look through her photos. I explain to him how terrible it makes me feel, and he replies with, "Why is to so wrong?".   He's always had an obsession with asian girls since I've known him. I'm mostly white and about a quarter filipino, but for the most part I look white. It just makes me feel so insecure and I think if he had the chance to be with an asian girl, he would. He as liked other girls in the past, on three occasions that he has admitted to while we were together, but all three girls were in relationships. I just feel like if a girl let him and he had the chance, he would be all over her and wouldn't give it a second thought. I've asked him multiple times why he wants to be with me when he's obviously interested in other girls, and he always replies with, "Because I love you". I've never been with anyone else besides him, and I've honestly never "liked" anyone but him. I've found guys attractive in the past, but I've never had any desire to be with anyone else.   He's leaving to go to Japan in a few weeks to stay with his friend for a month, and I honestly do not trust him. I feel like he will always lie about what happens with him and other girls, unless he actually starts a real relationship with someone else, then he'll just leave me. Thinking about leaving him kills me. I love him so much but I hate his actions and how he makes me feel. Should we take a break? Should he experience what it's like to "see other people"? Would it make him realize what he really wants? Should I do the same, since I don't understand how he feels? Should I break up with him since this behavior may never really end?  TDLR; My boyfriend kissed another girl, is constantly interested in other girls. We've never been in a relationship with anyone else besides each other. Is he acting this way because he needs to experience other people since he's so young? Would I benefit from it as well? I have no desire to, but I have no idea what to do at this point. I've never imagined myself being with anyone but him.   No... I haven't lifted weights since it started hurting. I've tried to do push ups a few times since then but it hurts too much. I don't think that it would deter the healing process a whole lot.   I've tried only a handful of times, and it's been 6 months since it started hurting. So I've given it plenty of rest.    I am a 20 year old healthy and fit female, with no history of any medical conditions that could possibly be related to my wrist pain. In November 2014, I was at the gym, using the weight machines. I usually stuck to the lightest weights, as I had only recently started weight lifting. One day at the gym, my boyfriend pressed me to increase the weights, and I had to push myself, but it didn't feel like a crazy amount or anything. The next day, my right wrist was hurting. Not in a sore way, but in a slightly injured way. Something that I figured would pass in a few days or so. But it didn't. My wrist only hurts when I hyperextend it (inward and outward). I used to do planks and push ups and other exercises that involve supporting my weight with wrists every day, but I can't do so anymore without being in pretty bad pain. I've tried to push through it, but I can't do more than a few push ups without it being too painful, and then the next day my wrist pain doubles from the exertion.   I've been to my PCP, but she could not figure out what was wrong. The pain is coming from the back (dorsal) center of my wrist, right where my wrist meets my hand. If I press my thumb on the area hard, it hurts. It's not that the pain is unbearable or anything, but I used to LOVE exercising (yoga in particular, which involves using your wrists a lot), and it's just frustrating that I'm unable to do it anymore.    Yeah, I was thinking that might be the med I was on, but of course it's not an amphetamine. I wasn't sure of it's effects, but since everyone is recommending it, I think I'll give it a try. Is it weird to bring that particular med up to a psychiatrist? I know that adderall would be, but I don't know about wellbutrin  	7

 Wow that last race for Guude! So many red shells, both from Chad and for himself too. Chad sounded annoyed at the end and I can see why :P   London, I am inside you!   Really liked Nebris' video, who actually showed us all around the area. I'm excited for what builds we can expect because the area sure asks for some great ones!   Make a few golems farm mana beans for you - essentia distillation - air shards and phials in crucible   Computer.   Minecraft, Terraria, Cook Serve Delicious. Sometimes some online Cards against Humanity with friends :)   Minecraft community as a whole is very big and friendly. I myself am admin of a gaming community that mainly plays minecraft but with the occasional other game on the side and they're my best friends.   Oh, awesome. Do you play vanilla or modded? I'm admin in a modded community, 21+ and very active. I really enjoy my time there and can recommend it :) let me know when you're interested!   Video games, though mainly minecraft. Barely anyone around me plays video games and the few who do, don't like minecraft at all. I could talk about it for days.   Games, oddly enough.   I believe there is also a use in minechem for carrots that eventually leads to power generation.   Glad to see this again. :)   Would be nice to have everyone back. Only time can tell.   Maybe the Sky High scenario. They can set a meetup timer and after that you take a small amount of damage while you are under y=100.    People can therefore create miniteams of any size   ... There is one player that is a wildcard, and will join whatever team they find (S20)  what?   VintageBeef was slain by VintageBeef.   I can only imagine all teams being in the same fortress grinding wither skeletons. The UHC will end quickly because no one will get the skulls but just kill the other teams.   I think you accidentally a word.   Hide achievements again.   Great montage!   Coe is in there too.   I don't see Chad in Golden apples per season? Can't help you out with a number though, just spotted it.   Can only agree with season 16 for MC!   I really want to know what would've happened if they would hide achievements during UHCs. Maybe they should start doing that again from now on.   Not sure why you got downvoted, I agree here. Anderz had no clue, Nebris knew Pak had the Notch apple. They had a plan, a strategy. Anderz decided to just fill Nebris with arrows, not knowing about the insane regeneration and resistance. Nebris was able to lure Pakratt out of his comfort zone, eat the apple, run away to let the regeneration run off and then attack.   I think that's what happened. In the very end you see he takes out his sword while he isn't in reach of Nebris yet, making it a bit easier for Nebris to just spam a few extra arrows into Pakratt.   You had some good shots in the Barkas fight! GG!   Vechs had some amazing longshots in the bowfight vs Arkas and Baj! I caught myself whispering "wow" out loud (it's 4AM here atm)   Quality over quantity indeed.   My bad, should read better. I thought you made a typo saying 15   16   It's in episode 1   He threw out his pickaxe while escaping Nebris and Vechs in episode 3 though. Despite the tension at that moment, it sure made me giggle.   Haha I missed Anderz death completely. I got sucked into the battle between Chad and BTC. Only realised our viking died when he left the skype call with Chad.   I can imagine that's not the first thing he thinks of. He's out in the open at night at 1.5 hearts. He should just grab those diamond swords and any anvil/enchanting table he's missing, and gear up again. Check for gold, apples etc but that's it.   True, he's on a roll this season. Hope he manages to heal up in some way.   Beef MVP.   No problem! :) Glad I could help.   Pyro has 1 golden apple. Don't know if he has eaten any, only seen his 6th episode.   I would be SO sad if that's the case.   Uhh, doesn't this have to be in the announcement bar by now?   Yeah! I mean just a minute before that, he switches the dirt on his hotbar to the cobblestone. That is what probably saved him!   Hope you watched VintageBeef's ep3!   Right, three productive days later we have done quite a lot. My friend has completely automated Galgadorian Metal and the enhanced and enhanced infused variants. We can now request them in the AE from scratch. Pretty impressive. I've mainly been working on a couple mining drones and while I've been close, I can't get them to perfectly do what I want (main problems now are charging (they're far out), coming home when finished etc) but I do have drone couples (one mines, one picks up) that scratch the surface of an area for meteor blocks using a Fortune III Efficiency IV diamond hammer and send the drops to our base. All I need to do is to redefine an area every now and then. If people are interested, I'm willing to share the programs how they are right now. Also slowly started working on Galacticraft stuff, but it's all very grindy and resource-intensive.   This! I really enjoyed watching all the vlogs from the Mindcrackers too throughout the week, looked like they had an amazing week together.    Ako the Builder :)   And yet again, Chad got picked twice!   "YWEYWWYAYASSS!" is honestly enough for S11 I think.   I hope Aurey kicks ass!   Actually nothing that's very interesting, but [this](https://i.imgur.com/kvWUyJ5.png) is our ~~base~~ mess on Blast Off at the moment. We've reached the point where we can make Galgadorian metal so we finally have a couple Ender IO machines. Botania Alfheim portal is up, autocrafting of 64k ME drives is a fact but that's it mainly. Cleaned up last night, replaced our clay floor with grass, automated wood and charcoal farm with Steve's carts, automated sugar cane farm using Pneumaticraft drones.. We have a wither skeleton farm a couple thousand blocks out and a mob farm up in the air (so not shown here), base on the left is another player's base. For us, it's now time to finally build and prepare for the hard work!   MC fun comes purely from playing multiplayer for me. I don't mind if it's vanilla, modded, a minigame, an adventure map, a UHC, etc. As long as I can play with friends, it's all good. Either goof around or have a big end goal to work to together.   Happy birthday!   Something tells me Arkas and Baj will last quite a while in this season, considering they're far away from everyone else and might find other teams when most battles are already fought.   Happy Birthday! :)   I'm pretty hyped for that.   No resource pack, April Fool's joke by Mojang last year.   Guude sounds a bit like Nebris with that voice near the end of the vlog.   I remember him doing that a couple seasons ago as well. "You can't hear.. oh wow creeper!"   Trying to get home from my parents turns out to be quite challenging tonight. Gotta love the Dutch railway company and railway system...   Mijn huisgenoot las dit hardop voor laatst en ik vroeg haar ook al of het De Speld was. :P   I really enjoy watching them. Looks like they're having an amazingly fun time in London this week :)   While I can see the mindcrackers start a similar scenario like Cornerstone, with everyone living in a spot and working together in small teams, I don't see mindcrack ever do any roleplaying.   I like seeing all the pictures and vlogs from the guys but Pyro's vlog is definitely my favorite.    Blast Off is a HQM pack that has the environmine mod in it. Though the mobs can be quite tough, just like in crash landing. I can highly recommend it, having great fun with playing it myself!   Hope to see you around again soon! :)   I'm not sure about Doc either because he ran into a team that early during the first episode. That's two people who were closeby who he can't team up with.   No, that's /u/TweetPoster. This is /u/TweetsInCommentsBot :)   Luckily, thunderstorms always come along with rain, so the fire would be put out quite quickly.   It's why I always watch Anderz' perspective as one of the first. Love his caving style.   Chad has a bow as well I believe.   Yeah, will just update the mod next time we patch. Given the player her wormwood for now. Thanks for your help :)   Doesn't necessarily have to be clear. If OP makes backups, roll back to an update right before this happened. You can keep a lot of your inventory that way.   Alright thanks. I'm one of the admins so I know where to go from here. At the moment it sounds easiest to just give the player a bit of wormwood than pushing a pack update with one config change so no one can farm wheat with right click anymore. :P   Would this be server side or client side?   I loved S19s intro. Never skipped it like I do with the others.   Same with Baj and Arkas, to be honest. I'm laughing so hard.   Woof?   Vechs really is a little puppy with all his toilet breaks. Also, when will Nebris learn you can mine lapis with a stone pickaxe? :(  edit: Anderz' episode is one series of mini heart attacks :( why do you do this to me?!   Ohhh! :O I'll shut up :P   I'm Dutch, 173cm and I feel small.   He's not tall, he's just Dutch :)   It's a great song, can't wait for more of his new album. I can recommend his other music too!   I found a good "pick me up" song in "Next Storm" by Frank Turner. It made me go outside today.   I've found that playlist a couple days ago :) It's good but nothing is better than Frank Turner himself!   Thanks for the answers and no problem! The witchery brewing is one of the few things in modded minecraft that I actually want to learn more about :)   That could go straight into a mod like the Twilight Forest mod!   I've been struggling with depression for a few months now and it's only going from bad to worse, up to a point where I don't go outside anymore unless I really have to. Listening to "Next Storm" today actually made me go outside again. I realised it's not good to stay inside this much. Just a quick thank you to Frank Turner from me. Can't wait to hear more from the upcoming album.   21, same, hi.   That explains a lot. Been watching my trees not pollinate for over a week now! I will try this as soon as I get home!    Bees can pollinate vanilla trees without analyzing the tree first.  That is a thing? Is this why my bees don't pollinate my trees right now?   I have the same issue when breeding trees and using the grafter, also on a server with NEIaddons and Forestry 3.5.7. Maybe try reporting an issue [here](https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC/issues)? English is not my first language so explaining it is a bit hard for me.   I shall keep an eye out! ;)   We have the minestones mod included in our custom modpack and it's a fun game!   Just a normal watering can works fine too. Doesn't have to be reinforced immediately.   Do you have the right soil for the dandelion? If so, sounds like you've got some terrible bad luck going.   Hello, I have a few questions about this spreadsheet.  1. In the list of the (optional) general modifiers, it says I need a glowstone nugget. Doesn't that have to be a golden nugget? 2. What are the "block effect" and "entity effect" that you mean for the nether brick and brick (normal brick or stone brick?) modifier? 3. In the effect modifiers, for power, is it a glowstone block or glowstone dust?   Have a look at www.indeedcommunity.com   Thank you so much! Ran into Frank's music a few months ago and I'm still growing into it. I am trying to find as many songs as possible :)   Do you have a link?   But why wouldn't you make yourself a bigger starter hole underground if it gets this tight and messy?   Lottery?   Make that the cat wise.   Same here. I hope you feel better soon.   Generated May 22nd, it's in the post.   I hope it turns out to be that way but I have my doubts. This internship is in Amsterdam and I live in the east of the Netherlands which means I will have to move as well. It's a new start and I hope it turns out to be a good thing.   Same for me, but it's mostly clothes. I don't have a desk and I try to make the bed every morning. Maybe you can start by making your bed every morning. You can also put a laundry basket in your room for your clothes. If all this goes well, add something extra next week, like keeping either a desk or a part of your floor empty. I have started doing this a week ago, and my room is getting cleaner slowly but surely. Just build it up, step by step.   Don't even need Botania for renewable redstone dust. It's renewable in Vanilla minecraft with a witch grinder.   We use EiraIRC, and for the skype group we use skype2irc.   Yes, IRC. I'm admin on a server where we have 3 servers connected (used to be 5) and it works great. You can even link a skype group to it, and dynmap.   Your mental health is very important.   That I had been lying to them for quite a while. Nothing worse than admitting the truth after months of lying.   Caring. Friends come to me because I care and I always help out (unless they have their magnet off) but it gets abused sometimes and I tend to forget my own problems.  	112
 When I was younger suicide was honestly always a thought in the back of my mind. I thought it was normal because nobody really talked about it. IT literally never even crossed my mind that that was a big deal. I only acted on it a couple of times by self harming and taking some pills, but I always stopped myself before it went too far. My mom struggled with depression her whole life as well, but she always told me that she never had suicidal thoughts in her entire life. It was a weird realization that suicidal thoughts weren't a part of other people's everyday bad moods like they were for mine. I don't know that I'll ever act on them because I do still have hope for my future, but when I think about my past those suicidal thoughts are worse.  Anyway, you're definitely not alone, but it also isn't normal to feel that way. You should reach out and try to get help. Talk it out with a professional--your friends probably want to help, and you should recognize that, but don't let them be your only resource for help because being a teenager in general is a shitshow, regardless of whether suicidal thoughts are present, and they probably won't have anything super helpful to say. Don't be ashamed that this is the way you are, but my personal opinion is that it's not something you should be blase about. Suicidal thoughts are things that you should express to people you trust and feel you can confide in, but when it comes down to it you are the only person who can deal with them. Other people can support you, but it's up to you to make a difference for yourself. I wish you luck, and if you want to talk about what you're experiencing please feel free to reach out. Also /r/depression is a great place to vent to other people who are living with these feelings, like you.   That shit pisses me off though, because then they act like it's your fault for dating an asshole. They think that because they said they were an asshole in the beginning of the relationship--"I'm a shit boyfriend, I'm an asshole, don't bother with me"--they're not responsible for their actions and put on this whole "I told you so" attitude when things end. I hate people who can't take responsibility for themselves.            My only problems with Temple are the lack of police presence (they've increased the presence but honestly it seems like the guards hardly give a shit about looking out for people), and the fact that a lot of people at Temple don't seem to give a shit. For example, group projects at Temple are the bane of my existence (I transferred schools twice so I know from experience that at some other schools people actually care about how they do in school). Literally every group project I had this past year involved people just not responding to emails, texts, etc., about meeting and working together. But those issues are really only super bad in intro level classes, because by the time you get to actual classes, people have started to care about doing well. And they stop showing up to class in pajamas and playing on their phones the whole time.    Apparently "bae" means "poop" in Danish. So if you imagine everyone calling their significant others "poop" it's kinda bearable/funny    I do like the Kurt Cobain look, but I have to admit, seeing him as old-timey Kit Walker made me swooooon.    Was that poncho from Limited Too? Because I am almost certain I had the same one.   "All my friends will understand" is what it sounded like to me. It seems like he was just saying an inside joke onstage.    I actually recently found this [website](http://www.ewg.org/) that has a lot of educational material and guides for consumers where they rate household products based on whether they're safe to use or not. It's an amazing resource.   I used to work in sales, and I became a completely different person when I had to work. It was exhausting. I told myself I'd never do a job like that again when I quit.   Love to both of you guys. My mom just passed away about three weeks ago. She was way too young and had been battling it for 18 years. I'm 21, so my whole life as long as I can remember, nothing was ever normal. Cancer really, really sucks. I wish the public was more educated about the carcinogens they unknowingly put into and onto their bodies every day. It's scary. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.   I like the part at the beginning where the guy filming burps. That really set up the rest of it quite beautifully   I also worked in a health grocery store (and judging by the way you talk about certain things/how you describe the store as being set up I'm just going out on a limb in assuming we worked at the same one) and one woman came in once complaining about our store's gluten free selection. Now, I'm gluten free for health reasons (I have Celiac disease), so I definitely understand that and wanted to help her out in any way I could. But it turns out she wasn't just having trouble finding gluten free food, she was OUTRAGED that we offered anything with gluten in it. She said our store was hypocritical for calling ourselves a health food store when we still offered many items with gluten in them. I was just like, we can't change our entire store just for people who don't eat gluten. We would lose SO much business! She told me that I was helping people poison themselves... Okay.   Absolutely. Learn the phrase "senza glutine" and most people will be willing to help accommodate your needs! Apparently there are a lot of cases of CD in Italy so there are lots of GF-friendly restaurants if you ask around!   Mama Eat was amazing! I recommend the pizza--I don't think I'll ever have a gluten free pizza quite as good as theirs!   Harry Potter and Snape, Secret BFFLs   My friend. Read the first rule.   Like I said, stylistic choice. It's just my opinion...   I think this is more of a stylistic choice, it doesn't necessarily make it shitty (to me, at least).    And for using the word "tray-zee poo."   If your blood work comes back looking like you might have CD, they're probably going to give you an endoscopy to take a biopsy of your intestines. In that case, they will want you to continue eating gluten until then so they can see what your intestines look like on your current, normal, gluteny diet. I guess you'd have to wait until the blood work comes back to know what your doctor's suggested next steps are but unless your doctor instructs you to do otherwise, you should probably just continue with your normal diet. It almost definitely wouldn't make an immediate difference if you did go gluten free for a day anyway.   But in the meantime, keep a food journal! I'm sure it would help you figure out what symptoms follow what types of food you eat.   I hope you find out what the issue is soon! Good luck!   Miss for young women, ma'am for older women (I know that line is blurred--I've pissed some people off by calling them ma'am and I've made others' days by calling them miss). Never, ever call a woman "lady." Maybe it's just me, but it feels disrespectful and derogatory coming out of people's mouths today--like, "Hey, lady!!" Sounds like you're trying to yell at a woman for something.   Anyway, as lots of people in this thread have already said, just "excuse me" would do just fine. But it seems like it really depends where you're from, too.    I personally found it laugh-out-loud funny, plus it's a super easy read. Most people could finish it in a day or two if they wanted to. I'd say it's worth it!   OH SHI DER GAR SAR. SAR CAREFUL. SAR CAREFUL. SAR CAREFUL. CAREFUL SARAH.    Ha, I dyed my mom's hair blue before she lost it, too. She had this gorgeous, super long silver hair that she took really good care of, so when she found out she was going to lose it she decided to just say "fuck it" and do what I was doing with my hair, too. She was so scared at first but she absolutely loved it!   This is mind boggling to me. On this note, though, one of my childhood friends had never had a hamburger until she came to my house when she was like 10. I still don't understand how that's even possible.  	28
 What type of conversations do you have with people? Like, what do you and a given caller typically talk about? How personal does it get?   I agree with the OP. I feel like, for a lot of people, being in a relationship could be a cure for their mental/emotional ills. It's something we all want (we're hardwired that way by nature), but I think non-FAs lose sight of how valuable relationships are because they don't struggle to find one.    People who are in relationships will blame their partners, or their relationship for being shit.  Not always. I've always been a FA, but the last relationship I was in actually made me happy even though it was horrendously unhealthy.   Forever alone: Protects more than a condom ever could.   What kind of meetup, exactly?  You should also try going to clubs/bars/parties/etc. That might not be comfortable for you (I'm the same way), but it could be the lesser of two evils.    as he was choking her  You crazy kids with your erotic asphyxiation.   Figure I'd chime in on why people are downvoting you. It's probably because that line isn't one that's specific to any character Johnny Cage faces. He says that to everyone in the game, but this thread is about quotes that can only happen during specific matchups.   Cut her a break. She's a blonde.    Johnny Cage vs. Jax (possibly not unique) "That's enough, big guy"  I think that one is probably unique, since it wouldn't work against female characters, and I don't believe that the quotes change based on the gender of the opponent (they're either generic or apply to the opponent only).    and Jax ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Jacqui also has a thing for Johnny Cage apparently (based on intro dialogue).  Somebody likes older men.   Then what is it? I don't mind being corrected-- that's how I learn.   [I added a section on the MKX Quotes page of TV Tropes for "unique mid-fight one-liners."](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/MortalKombatX)  Thought you guys might be interested in seeing this, and possibly adding to it or posting quotes in this thread that others can add to the TV Tropes page.   This quote seems to contradict the idea that people can change the world. That's kind of a downer.   Congrats, bro. How'd you two meet?   Why did this comment got downvoted as much as it did? Did I offend anyone? I apologize if I did-- that wasn't my intent.   They didn't do anything about it?  Dick move.   Sorry to hear that. Hope things are better now.  I assume they didn't know you weren't eating? But wouldn't your vital signs tell them that you were malnourished?  I can't imagine they just let you not eat.    I think they should have been nicer to a minor who was taken away from home forcefully and all alone.  Fair enough.   I didn't eat anything for 15 days.  How the hell...?    Every other time I went to a hospital the nurses were nice and helpful but in the psych ward they were hostile.  Well, that's understandable at the very least though, right? They might deal with people who are literally insane on a semi-regular basis.  And if you didn't eat their food, what did you eat?   You've tried dating sites, Reddit... what else?   It's funny, because my go-to pickup line is to TELL a woman (jokingly) that she's out of my league, and that that's the reason I'm talking to her.  Makes em laugh every time.    So when a doctor or nurse ask you "do you have depression or thoughts of suicide?", now why would anyone admit to that?  I was the one who told my doctor that I might be depressed. It was because I wanted help. That's a good reason to admit to it, I think.   I could be "happy" like a "normal" person if my situation improves but the odds are going against my favor.  But until your situation does improve, you have to consider yourself depressed IMO. Even if it's just your situation that causes it, as long as you're still in that situation, you're depressed.   What's that like? I've only been to a psych ward once, and seeing what it's like (like how the bathroom doors open both ways and can't be locked, or seeing people literally tied down to their beds) seriously caught me off guard.  I was just there because I drank a little too much.    The doctor gets a nurse to be your girlfriend?  That'd be amazing.  He just calls her into the room and leaves you both alone.  "So... you come here often?"   "Being short is always an unattractive trait" isn't the same as "Everyone who's short is unattractive and undateable."  Everybody has something about them that's unattractive. You can have an unattractive quality (like lack of height) and still be attractive. But when you dismiss someone as "too unattractive to date" based on the fact that they're only *three or four inches shorter than the average*, you're a dumbass or you're the pickiest person on Earth.   Amen   You sure she wasn't replying to her friend saying something along the lines of "He's cute/hot"?  I imagine seeing a man do something masculine like boxing would be a turn-on.   I don't think it's about how a woman feels about her own height. I think it's about tall people being intimidating, which implies that they're better protectors, which women look for in men (and some are desperate for it).  It's an animal instinct (being tall does not inherently make you any more capable of defending another person), but so are many of our rules for attractiveness.   My best friend is 5'8, and he constantly tells me how jealous he is of my height, and how important it is to women. He even hooked me up with this one girl who apparently raved (to him) about how tall I am (it lasted like two dates-- wasn't into her).  Despite that, no one has actually said to ME that they're attracted to my height. I feel confused.    Height is such a huge factor for women it's insane.  Sure doesn't feel like it. 6'3 Forever-Aloner here.    I'm 5'6 and I don't feel like a tiny guy. I'll make it work.  Perseverance and self-confidence. That's attractive.   Right, that's my point. They exist, and this one in particular is hot, so yeah, there are hot women who don't care about guys being tall.  Heck, I see a few women say that as long as a guy is taller than she is, it's fine.  Me being 6'3 is clearly not giving me some instantaneous advantage.   Actually, no. I asked his girlfriend and she said I'm more handsome than he is.  Also, I think 5'10 is average for adult males in America.   Probably the fact that you have to work a lot harder than other people to get what everybody wants.  "No, dude! Just think of it like you're dating on Hard mode!"  ... *no*. Fuck that analogy. You can change the difficulty with the touch of a button in a video game, not life.    Hell I'm short at 5'2 so why should I care whether a guy is tall/short?  Well, in all fairness, "tall" is relative. "Tall" to you could be 5'10, whereas some women, as seen in the OP's screencap, will not go for under 6'0 under any circumstances.   It *is* shallow. It's one thing to say that being short is unattractive, but to say you'd never be anything other than friends with a short guy is outrageous.  I bet if [insert famous short person] showed up at the door, these bitches would throw their panties at him.   Me: 6'3. Best friend: 5'8.  Me: Forever alone. Best friend: Has been with the girl of his dreams for like six years.  So... there's hope, shorter guys?   Indoorsy man seeks the company of indoorsy woman  More specifically, tall (6'3) African-American male with a slim build and a great (if not sometimes dry) sense of humor would love to meet someone to spend time with. We can cuddle on the couch (who's a big fan of physical affection? This guy) and watch a movie, play video games, watch TV, or even just talk. I'm definitely open to the idea of starting a serious relationship, and if you'd like to know what I look like, I can gladly PM you a pic.  I have my own place in Yeadon and can host or come to you.  Let's have some fun. :)   Reminds of that one American Dad episode with a random gag at the beginning where Stan and Francine rush to answer the door when the bell rings.  * Francine: You opened it last time! Cup check! [backhands Stan in the nads] * Stan: OW! ... punk! [falls]   I work at the University of Pennsylvania, so I'm off during the summer, which gives me a lot of free time. I live in Delaware County (Darby/Yeadon area) right outside of Southwest Philadelphia. I can host or come to you.  Whatever your preference, I'm sure we can make it work. We can be movie buddies, gaming buddies, or even friends with benefits if that's your speed. I also wouldn't mind meeting someone with whom I can start a relationship (if you'd like to know what I look like, I'll gladly PM you a pic).  I will say that I'm definitely an inside person, so my personal preference is someone who doesn't mind staying in and spending time with someone.  If interested, please form a neat, single-file line. One at a time; no cuts. :-)    If you had a girlfriend, would you be able to overcome your social anxiety to visit her and go places with her?  And would you be able to handle kids if she wanted them?  I've done both in the past (dated a single mom). I think I could handle it.    But it is better to be happy than alive  I don't believe the two are mutually exclusive.    I also agree that in the vast majority of cases, it would take some tremendous luck to find someone who would be willing to accept and support you. However is it impossible to find such a person? Not quite.  I wouldn't know where to begin looking, though. I'm not a social person at all.    The whole concept of getting over anxiety feels like a paradox in itself: it's like saying jumping into a fire will cure a burn. I can imagine my counselor correcting me and saying it's more like jumping into a fire wearing a flame-resistant suit (the flame-resistant suit being the skills they taught me), but it still seems counter-intuitive because why the hell would I want to jump into a fire in the first place?  Very poignant.   Although I won't deny that it works, since I have gotten comfortable doing things that have become routine.  Things that you struggled to get done before?   What are you willing to compromise, and what is worth walking through razor wire for?  Honestly... as sad as it is, nothing, except maybe a girlfriend. I'd at least consider it, but only if I thought there was at least a somewhat decent chance of success.  I was thinking about going to a bar tonight to try my luck, but I keep having doubts. If little things upset me, it'll *really* suck if (when) I get rejected.    My only idea is to maybe interact with some animals. If you feel up to it, maybe getting a cat  I actually do have a cat. I've had her for about a year, and I absolutely love her. She loves me too-- I have the scars to prove it.  Petting and holding that little furball does make me feel better sometimes, but it doesn't do a lot for my emotional state overall.   If I could condense all the conversations I've had with people trying to help me get over my depression/anxiety (and/or trying to motivate me), it'd go something like this:  * Me: I'm really depressed, and I have terrible anxiety. * Them: You should talk to your doctor or go see a therapist/psychiatrist * Me: I tried that many times. It never worked very well, and in some cases it made my situation worse. * Them: You should keep trying, though. * Me: I would, but my mental health has gotten so bad recently that I can barely do anything without feeling as if I'm going to have a nervous breakdown/panic attack. I'm emotionally sensitive to almost everything. * Them: But you have to be willing to take that risk. * Me: No, it's not worth it. Talking about my problems hasn't helped for the last four years I've been trying it and prescription medication has been a colossal failure. I'm not going to go out of my way to possibly compromise my mental state to try something that repeatedly fails. * Them: There's nothing you can think of that can put you in a state of mind where you could maybe handle taking that risk? * Me: Maybe if I had a girlfriend or something. Before I moved out, my dad always told me I was visibly much happier when I was with someone. * Them: You can't think of *anything* else? Nothing else makes you happy enough that it can mitigate your emotional vulnerability? * Me: Not really. * Them: So go find a girlfriend. * Me: But I need psychological stability and/or emotional willpower to get a girlfriend. And I need a girlfriend to get psychological stability and/or emotional willpower. I'm trapped in a Catch 22.  And then at that point, we just go in circles. People always tell me I'm too negative, that I worry too much, that I make excuses to not do things (namely the "I won't risk a panic attack" excuse), and that I have too many "Yeah, but" responses to their suggestions.  When I tell them that maybe they're wrong, that I'm not making excuses, and that maybe it really isn't worth it for me to actually try what they suggest, they call bullshit and imply (or sometimes outright say) that I'm being or acting weak and that I could easily do it if I just did it.  Basically, if someone could convince me that I'm wrong, and that I *could* just do it if I wanted to, that'd be cool. Or if someone could give me advice other than "just do it," that would be fine, too.  Also, one more thing, just so you don't think I'm being completely baseless-- I went to get a haircut this morning, and the barber I go to is a cool dude. I called his cell to see if he had opened yet, and he sort of curtly asked "Who's this?" That alone had a strong (negative) emotional effect on me, as if I thought my world was going to come crashing down around me because he used a bit of a tone with me before he even knew it was me on the phone. I still have that "Tears welling up" feeling from when that happened (which I experience often), but I haven't actually cried (although it feels like I should be, I guess).  That's pretty much what I deal with regularly. Any small, seemingly meaningless occurrence can take a profound toll on my emotional state.  I like to compare it to hemophilia, where a small cut can cause a person to bleed profusely because their blood doesn't clot (I think that's how it works). And the thing is, whenever I do anything other than just sit in my room doing nothing, I feel like I'm walking through razor wire (and that's no exaggeration, I promise).   He should really get some money out if he's going to use the ATM anyway.  Those "check balance" fees sometimes cost... an arm and a leg...  I'll... I'll see myself out.   Maybe I should have said "a formal date"? Going out to eat, going to the movies... that's what I meant.   Why are you afraid you will lose contact with her?   You're welcome, and good luck :)   Hold on to those calming thoughts.  And if you need someone to talk to, you can PM me if you'd like.   If you're confident that he loves you (and make sure you mean the word "love"), I think you should have no fears about him leaving you because of your problems.  To me, if you love someone, you don't leave them over something like this. You help them get through it, which would make your relationship stronger. I can almost guarantee that true love (at least as I see it) is strong enough to conquer your problems.    It's bad enough I end up crying to him weekly about something  No, that's not bad. That's what a partner does-- support you when you can't support yourself. You two are a team. Your problems are his and vice versa.  I think you should have a long, in-depth talk with him about how you're feeling.   My strategy with tasks that are intimidating is to break them down into smaller, non-intimidating tasks.  If you have to write a 12-page paper, focus on each page as if it was its *own* paper. Doing that 12 times might seem like a lot, but if you take breaks and don't overexert yourself, I think it can work.    I have no friends that I can talk to on a deeper level  What about your boyfriend?    I shower.  FRAUD!  :-P   *[crying]*  ... how come he don't want me, man?   John Cena is the mother who constantly showers the child with positivity, tells them that they can be whatever they want when they grow up, and lets them believe in fairy tales for as long as they want.  Kevin Owens, meanwhile, is the asshole father with the "grim realist" attitude who doesn't want his kid to walk around thinking the whole world is sunshine and gumdrops. Life sucks and then you die. Period.  And, like a good asshole father, he doesn't even spend a lot of time trying to properly explain these things to the child. He just mocks the mother in an attempt to make her feel bad about herself and give in to his viewpoints.   So the lesson here is that unless you're practicing literally 24 hours a day, you're not practicing enough.   When my son took his first steps, I tripped him!      Cuddling over a good movie/television show would be great for me right now.  PM me if interested. Will send a pic.  Thanks. :-)    what Bryan did for Connor literally kept him alive a lot longer.  I don't wanna be that guy, and I see the downvotes coming already, but come on. You have no way of knowing this.       An advantage of +10 means that you will recover and be able to act 10 frames before the opponent is out of block stun.  Okay, but if that's the case, then what's Hit Advantage?   I've watched videos and perused threads, but I still don't really get it. One thing in particular that confuses me is Block Advantage.  If I understand correctly, a -10 Block Advantage would mean that it takes 10 frames for you to be able to do anything if the attack in question is blocked. If that's the case, what does a Block Advantage of, for example, +10 mean?  And how can certain moves that don't actually attack the opponent (such as Erron Black's "Stand Off" stance or Jason's various power-up moves) have any block advantage at all, positive or negative? They can't be blocked. Same with throws, as they can't be blocked, either.      And I bet it's not a coincidence that it involved Shawn Michaels.      I feel like another good defensive tip is to constantly move, especially if you have a character who's better from a distance (Erron Black, my main, is a good example). Use back dashes, jumps, environment-assisted jumps, tech rolls, delayed wakeups, and any special moves that give you space. Just standing there and blocking, even if you're good at blocking by itself, can still get you punished by mix-ups, cross-ups, etc.  A moving target is always harder to hit than a stationary one. Of course, don't jump around like a cracked-addicted frog, because you can't block in the air. Also, learn how your opponent reacts to jumping and how they attempt to punish it, and adjust accordingly.   I really don't have any specific requirements for the voice work-- I will say that I'd prefer an American or British accent, but I'll be grateful towards any and all who are kind enough to volunteer.  Here's a sample of the script for anyone who wants to give it a shot:  *While not of good vs evil, make no mistake... this IS a war...*  *East vs West... offense... vs defense...*  *This is a war of superhuman proportions...*  *Are you ready?*  Thanks in advance.   Elaborate for those who aren't familiar?    They gave you Klonopin? I'd suggest staying off it until you really need it.  Sadly, nothing else has worked. Or at least it felt that way until recently. I'd kill to go back to how I felt a few months ago, back when I thought that whatever I was taking "wasn't working."   I envy you.   I always try to think of life as a plate of your favorite food. Think about this the next time you treat yourself to a meal you love, and think about life the way you think of the meal.  When you sit down to eat something you love, you don't think about how you're going to feel when the food is gone. By the time you finish eating, the fact that there's no more food isn't a problem, because you've had your fill. You don't want or need any more, so an empty plate doesn't bother you.  I like to think that life is the same way. That by the time we die, for those lucky enough to make it to be 60, 70, or even older, that life has given us all we want and we'll no longer fear the idea of dying. That we'll feel fulfilled and that this idea will make it easier to accept the inevitability of death.  [Lately, I'm not feeling that way](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/336by3/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_with_my_life_right_now/), and it's really bothering me. All I can think about is dying and what it'll be like to fall into eternal oblivion. It's to the point that I have anxiety about going to sleep, because I'm afraid I won't wake up and that scares the Hell out of me.  What do you guys think about this...?   My primary care physician and his RN are complete fuck-ups. I'm taking Klonopin that they prescribed for depression. Being that it's a controlled substance, I was told that I can only call in the refill, at the most, a couple of days before I actually need it. This leaves a very small margin error on the part of the physician.  My doctor chooses to handle this margin error by doing the following-- telling me that I need to either come in for an appointment or see a psychologist to continue getting refills on Klonopin, and not discussing any type of strategy involving titrating the drug due to complications that are occurring right now with my having to get a new insurance plan and having to switch (or, as I'd put it, "be liberated from") my current doctor.  I was due for a refill three weeks ago and STILL haven't gotten it, because my psychologist can't be reached through phone at all.  So now, here's the situation. I'm barely making minimum wage, doing a job I hate but can't leave, and I feel like killing myself at almost all times because of this, AND because of the fact that I was forced to stop taking Klonopin cold turkey for almost a month. News flash: That leads to ugly side effects, like suicidal ideation.  I'm trapped. I can't quit this job because of how long it took for me to get any position. At the same time, I'm not sure I can keep it because I'm probably going to have a mental breakdown sooner rather than later.  Any advice would be much appreciated.      When I see that it's getting dark and look at the clock and realize it's late, I feel anxious. When I get in bed, I feel more anxious. When I actually try to go to sleep, I get extremely anxious.  Any advice?   Me Brock Lesnar! Here come da pain!  God build me strong! ... forget to give me brain.   Much appreciated.   I sent him a message, but I'm curious, why did you link to his page?   [SLRep](http://www.reddit.com/r/GCXRep/comments/2m1ltx/urayap19_gcx_rep_profile/)  Nobody wanted to do it when I offered $5, then $10, so I decided to offer a base pay of $15, which is definitely negotiable.  Here's what I need done:  -Download [this Dolph Ziggler CAW](http://i.imgur.com/XEqt0r4.png) (just make sure it's one with black trunks and blue/white design, white wrist tape, no elbow pads, and black boots/knee pads). If you're on Xbox One, this exact CAW should be easy to find if you search for "Ziggler" and sort by "Most downloaded."  -Use this CAW in My Career until you get to the feud with Brock Lesnar, which should start with [this cutscene](https://youtu.be/cWVgCOxZjgU?t=31s). When that happens, record that initial cutscene where Lesnar's music interrupts you after your match and upload it or send it to me in at least 720p quality.  -One final note: I know that it would probably be difficult to start recording the cutscene before Lesnar's music even hits, so just try to start capturing the video once you hear his music during that first cutscene. I need at least that first cutscene to start no later than when Lesnar is on the stage. **Also, make sure you have captions/subtitles turned OFF.** This is important.  That's pretty much it. Anyone who wants this job, PM me.  Also, I know this probably seems like a weird task, but it's for a video.  Thanks, guys.   This thread is also a good example of my being right about the abuse of downvoting.    Its rude to put your elbows on the table, just like its bad to misuse downvotes. But its not a rule  Fair enough. You got me there.    People can vote how they want to.        Is it abusing the voting system to write in Spider Man for president? Maybe. Does it matter? No  That's completely different. People CAN'T "vote how they want." When you sign up for a Reddit account, you agree to only downvote under such-and-such conditions.  There's no such law against voting for Spider-Man in a presidential election.   That's understandable. I just think something should be done about the abuse of the downvote system by the users.   It's for a video.   People clearly downvote things that don't violate any of Reddit's "Downvote this post/thread if..." rules. It's an abhorrently abused feature, and I think it should be done away with. It's not fair to people who post things that are perfectly within the bounds of Reddiquette and rules, but a group of people (for lack of better terminology) have a stick up their collective ass and decide to downvote out of spite.   Long story.   I know the following (if I'm incorrect, please let me know):  * Flying Swallow technique * All throw moves * Blood Rain combo (Eclipse Scythe)  I ask about the invincibility because that can be used to mitigate the enemy's attacks when you're being overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies or certain attacks that aren't completely blockable (like incendiary shurikens-- I FUCKING HATE INCENDIARY SHURIKENS... lol).  Thanks, guys.   Quick heads-up: I prefer to play 12-minute quarters in NBA 2K15, with Simulation sliders on Hall-of-Fame difficulty. I can be talked out of it if it's really a big deal to you, but that's definitely my preference.  Gamertag: Ray AP9  Hit me up!    Trust me, moving around helps!  That's sort of the problem. I can't *help* but move around. I'm constantly fidgeting, pacing back and forth across the room, getting up from my computer chair, sitting back down, getting back up, rinse repeat. On top of that, I have an absolutely terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I'm not having fun, as you can imagine.    Depends on what triggers your anxiety and how it manifests itself.  My anxiety is constant. I'm restless, can't sit still, can't concentrate, etc.   I've been told to try breathing exercises (don't really work for me), masturbation (meh), exercise (doesn't work for me), etc.  Anyone have any suggestions? Maybe something that's worked for you or someone you know?  Thanks.      What would they do for me? Give me electroshock therapy? I'm already on prescription medications and seeing a therapist once a week, so I don't see what a mental hospital could do for me right now except overcharge me for my visit.

I'm so depressed, for a reason I'm 99% sure is the main cause, that I feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown at all times.  I sort of feel that way normally, but right now it's exponentially worse. It doesn't interfere with living my life at other times, but now I can't function at all. I don't know if it would be justified for me to call an emergency line, though. I've been this way for days and it doesn't feel like it's going to remit or get better any time soon.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i3-mxXbxQQ   TIL.  -"The More You Know" rainbow-  Seriously though, learning stuff is always better than being misinformed.   The look on Punk's face after he looks up from his cell phone is what makes this so great.   "The Rock thanks you for that."   I still don't understand that. Was Brock high or something? _   "You have become... THE NEW YORK YANKEES!"   Memorable and unique lines (i.e., they weren't repeated and aren't catchphrases) that were part of a great promo.   I swear I've looked ten times and can't find the option to change it anywhere.   He's also brawled against John Cena and was clearly the better of the two. Not even Biker Undertaker could say that against the younger, less experienced Cena.   With Lesnar returning and bringing his MMA training with him, has Undertaker lost his unofficial title as the best WWE striker of all time?      *One of the game-day rules for the Bears and Ravens -- and I would imagine any mentally tough team -- is that there are no long sleeves allowed under your jersey. That reinforces a mentally tough state of mind and it also is used as an intimidator to the opposing team, like a gorilla pounding on his chest in jungle saying "look at me I don't need sleeves in the cold."*  Article written by [Brendon Ayanbadejo](http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/4777/brendon-ayanbadejo), former member of both the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens.       I think that makes sense.  Unless it's Shawn Michaels _   His spot wasn't stolen. Rowan was never officially in the Royal Rumble, nor was Axel.   There's no evidence in kayfabe of Stardust and Eden dating, so we can't assume it's true.  We can only go by what we see on WWE programming.   Small foreign objects can be hidden almost anywhere on any wrestler's attire. Plus, it's not like the vest can conceal the fact that he's carrying, say, a sledgehammer or something.  And as of now, Roman Reigns has shown no indication of using his vest to hide foreign objects, so there's no reason to take action yet.   It generally doesn't hurt to land on another wrestler's abdomen because it's one of the softest areas of the body-- there's mostly just fat and muscle there as opponent to bone or tendon.  It definitely hurts to land on another wrestler's knees, or even sometimes his elbow/forearm.  Also, ask RVD.   It takes tremendous concentration and focus to summon a lightning bolt, which would leave Undertaker open to an attack from his opponent.  Either that, or it's in his contract. A "No supernatural powers" clause that applies even in matches with a no-disqualification stipulation. Same goes for Kane.   Not sure if making joke about name of the move or not...   Chillin.   Perhaps Rollins was reprimanded behind closed doors. Had he actually gone through with it, I'm almost positive that (in kayfabe), he would have been SEVERELY punished.   Because there's no set schedule for WWE (like how the entire season of games in the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL are created ahead of time), so if a wrestler is discovered to have cheated, they can simply give a rematch to his opponent, strip him of the title, or take some other action.  Plus, it implores referees to pay more attention and make sure they see everything, instead of being "bailed out" by instant replay.   http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/2yjq7h/lets_play_a_game_you_name_an_occurrence_that/  I did this for fun and thought it went over well. Other people even got involved with the explanations, which I thought was very cool. For those who don't want to/can't click the link above, here's the basic idea:  *Example:*  *Q- Triple H covers the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he uses it. This is to protect the other wrestler, as he's known to use a real sledgehammer, and striking someone full force with a metal hammer would be incredibly dangerous. But why would he do this in kayfabe?*  *A- Triple H covers the head of the sledgehammer when he hits other wrestlers with it so that he can control it better. Using one hand to guide the hammer itself ensures that he makes full contact, and it would still hurt anyway with his hand covering it.*  Go ahead. Ask me anything at all and I'll do my best to explain it in a logical fashion, as if pro wrestling was a non-scripted, competitive sport.  Also, other people explaining aren't just welcomed-- they're allowed.         I never thought that any of these could be the underlying cause (although in hindsight, it seems obvious, since so many gamers are prone to rage-outs; don't believe me, just search YouTube :P). I'm definitely gonna check those articles out.    I mean there is no point doing it if you are **an already trained individual** looking to increase CV performance.  Ah. Which I'm not.  I gotcha. Much thanks for the advice.    I'd get a pull up bar and a dip bar and use them to help your strength.  Why's that? I figured nobody would recommend any strength training since cardio training and strength training are different (as far as I knew).  Just a question for the purpose of learning.   I appreciate this advice, but I don't want to (no disrespect) just run away to a community that will coddle me when I feel bad for losing. I want to get rid of that feeling. It's just a video game. I know this. Anyone reading this knows this.  My brain does not know this.   First of all:  _Hi! Welcome to Fittit!

Heh.   But it's apparently not real to the serial downvoters in this thread   :-(   Wow. Very impressive.  TIL.   So am I, apparently.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnUgAaea4M   I never said it was any different than any of those things. The reason I didn't make a thread about those occurrences is because they didn't happen two days ago.   It looked like he was trying to be serious, bringing up constitutional rights and such. That's the only reason I gave it any more thought than "lol cena"    I know in WWE people fight over the stupidest shit all the time     There are people whose job it is to deliver repercussions if they see fit. We don't need Cena to be a patriotic vigilante.   I might get a lot of hate for this, but the first person that came to mind is Randy Orton. He's come a LONG way, especially as a talker, and his in-ring acumen (mostly his psychology) has always been underrated in my opinion, and was on point since his Evolution days.   I know in WWE people fight over the stupidest shit all the time (not to say that what Cena fought Rusev over was stupid, but that far less logical things have started major brawls)-- the only reason I bring up the legal ramifications is because Cena pretty much told Rusev "The first amendment says you can say what you want (with the obvious exceptions, clear and present danger, etc). But I'm gonna kick your ass if you exercise that right and say bad stuff about America."  Am I missing something?   WWE 2K15      I just want to rent one game and I don't think an entire rental subscription is worth it. I've already had a free trial with GameFly, which is why I said that's not an option.  Thanks.   I just want to rent one game and I don't think an entire rental subscription is worth it. I've already had a free trial with GameFly, which is why I said that's not an option.  Thanks.   Made an edit to the OP   Let's just get this inevitable answer out of the way-- "Because he never defends it, lololololololol."  Seriously, though. It's really weird.  **EDIT:** For the record (not sure if people realize this), they only edit out the word "defending." That's what I'm talking about.    Is that just their sadistic heelery?  Exactly right. It shows how vicious the wrestler is. Also, if we assume this theory is true, we can also assume that wrestlers who break limbs are fined behind closed doors (although some punishments in this regard are aired during the shows).   When he says things, *you fucking believe it.* Which is hilariously counterintuitive, since hi character is that of a compulsive liar.  When he said, and I quote, "If anybody has it in their heads to pull a Montreal Screwjob for the title at WrestleMania, my client assures any single person involved in a Montreal scenario will NOT. LEAVE. THAT. STADIUM. **_ALIVE!!!!!!_**"  I was legitimately scared for the safety of anyone who would potentially try that.     A- Because, for lack of better terminology, wrestlers care about winning more on PPVs than on weekly shows, with certain exceptions that will support this theory.  During Kane's "Mask vs Title" match against Triple H, he showed the level of durability that he had during his first match with Undertaker at WrestleMania, which was far more than he was known for at the time of the match on Raw.  All of Evolution interfered. Triple H used a sledgehammer. Kane took a serious beatdown, but refused to lose (in JR's words, "AIN'T NOTHIN GONNA BEAT KANE TONIGHT!"). The reason is because he *had* a reason to fight that much harder-- he did NOT want to unmask.  Regarding your example, it's one thing to lose on Raw or SmackDown, but on a PPV, usually when a title is on the line (as well as during a match with likely a bigger purse for the winner), you HAVE to win.  Basically, wrestlers fight harder to stay in a match (to kick out, withstand a submission longer, etc.) when they know that winning is more imperative.  Example: Angle traps you in the Anklelock during a standard singles match on Raw. Is it worth it to risk a broken ankle and possibly end your career for a match of such little magnitude? Probably not.  Is it worth it in a PPV match for the world championship? FUCK YES.   A- Climbing a ladder with multiple opponents who will all try to stop you if they can isn't a simple proposition. They have to make sure that no one is around to grab their leg or hit them with a ladder or a chair, so they take their time and glance around with each step they take up the ladder.  That's why wrestlers climb the ladder faster when they win, because the fact that the other wrestlers aren't in position to stop them gives them more confidence to climb faster, and those two factors result in reaching the title more quickly.   A- http://youtu.be/BP3LUVGZHB8?t=54s  Usually, the referee spends the time during the setup of the move, and the first three or four forearm clubs, imploring Sheamus to get his opponent off the ropes, THEN starts counting.  It's up to the referee to decide whether or not to start counting immediately or to give the wrestler a chance to relinquish the hold, and then count. Much like a referee won't start counting immediately after a wrestler leaves the ring or is thrown out of it.   Hey, that's my job. :-P  But that's a good answer. I don't think anything needs to be added.   A- Heh. I know this is just a joke, but I refuse to break kayfabe, so I'll answer seriously. Simply put, "Parts Unknown" is just a euphemism for "We have no fuckin clue where this guy came from."   A- My theory on the Undertaker:  Mark Calaway:Undertaker = Johnny Blaze:Ghost Rider  So, essentially, you could say "Why would a demonic bounty hunter have a job as a motorcycle stunt rider?" It's because (back to Calaway/Undertaker) one side of the entity is human, and the other is supernatural.  To further my theory on The Undertaker, I believe the official story is that, as children, Kane and Undertaker actually lived in a funeral parlor with Paul Bearer and a woman who may have been the mother of Kane or Undertaker. Kane was playing with fire, and accidentally burned it down, killing (so we thought) himself, and Paul Bearer's wife.  Mark Calaway should have died in that fire, but instead, he struck a deal with Satan and sold his soul to remain on Earth, in exchange for becoming "The Collector of Souls," The Undertaker. He's lived a double life for at least two decades.  That's why he wasn't nearly as successful, for example, in WCW as "Mean Mark Callous." He was just wrestling as *himself*. Then, to put it bluntly, he realized that he could use his Satanic powers as a professional wrestler, and the rest is history. This also explains why Biker Taker is less powerful and resilient than Deadman Undertaker-- because he broke away from his demonic alter ego and, again, simply wrestled as himself, without any aid from his supernatural alter ego.  Bray Wyatt? [Bray Wyatt IS Husky Harris.](https://twitter.com/WWEBrayWyatt/status/291735362601107458) He's been possessed by a demonic force, which is quite possibly the devil himself, an incarnation of Satan, or maybe the Anti-Christ.  "I hear you like to call yourself the devil’s favorite demon. But you sir ARE NO DEMON! And the devil? No, man*. You ought to be careful of who you say these things in front of because you never know who might be listening."  "Pride has always been my favorite sin. It was pride that cast me down into this rotten world to walk amongst you." Sounds like the story of Satan being exiled from Heaven.  Aaaaaaaaand... [Bray Wyatt actually *speaking in tongues*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdAzGCw25x4 feature=youtu.be t=1m31s)  I asterisked "man" because Bray Wyatt has this cadence where he constantly uses the word as filler during his monologues. That's sort of an uncontrollable twitch he has, which comes out at times because Husky Harris' mind is still inside the body of Bray Wyatt.  The Bible also states that the Anti-Christ will bear bodily markings, which many have speculated to mean that he will be heavily tattooed. What's one (but not the only one) major difference between Bray Wyatt and Husky Harris? [Wyatt](http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/bray-wyatt-1781313.jpg) has FAR more tattoos than [Harris](http://www.allwrestlingsuperstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/husky-harris-pictures-09.jpg) did.  As well, in the Bible, it is said that long hair on a man is a sin. Nuff said.  ANYWAY... the point is that Husky Harris is a wrestler. Bray Wyatt is a demon. They co-exist in the same body, just like Mark Calaway and The Undertaker, using their human alter-egos, who are just normal men who wrestle professionally, to blend in with us.  As far as Breeze and Fandango, it's like Lesnar. Brock was on pace to be one of the most dominant, successful WWE wrestlers of all time (and still is, after his return), but left what was a good thing to pursue other ventures. Fandango uses "the art of dance" to improve as a wrestler (much like John Morrison used Parkour), and if Tyler Breeze is cocky enough to actually take selfies during matches, he probably thinks he can do anything he wants as a profession, including wrestling.  Phew. That's a mouthful. But worth it.   A- Because, as the wrestler playing "defense" in that situation, you're in more danger than the wrestler attempting to climb out. By chasing someone who's climbing the cage, you could easily fall off or be knocked back down into the ring, which is a looooong drop. Even if a "tug of war" ensues, the wrestler climbing usually has the advantage regarding who's more likely to get hurt.  The only reason they don't have more success when attempting to climb out is because they do so while their opponent is still able to stop them in plenty of time, but this is (mostly) intentional. It's like pinning in a normal match-- every pin isn't an attempt to win. It's to make your opponent use energy to kick out.  Just like every attempt to climb out of the cage isn't necessarily an attempt to actually win. You just want your opponent to chase you and possibly put himself in position to take a nasty fall.   Didn't see this before I typed up my response. This is essentially what I said, only longer _  -thumbs up-   Well, that'd be the non-kayfabe reason, although honestly, you could argue this as a kayfabe reason as well. Barring a move (such as a chair shot to the head) because it's too dangerous would make sense in and out of kayfabe.   A- They do scout. "At one point, I *know* Cena will hit me with two shoulder tackles in a row, but I *won't* be like everyone else and throw a wild punch after he does so."  But it doesn't work like that. By that point in the match, you've taken some punishment from an inhumanly strong street brawler, so thinking straight isn't a given. Cena hits you twice with his shoulder, and then he does nothing. What do you do? You attempt to mount your own offense (since you believe Cena is a sitting duck) as a counter. How do you do that most commonly? You throw a punch.  Cena baits his opponents into that punch by making them think they have an opening when he hesitates after the second shoulder block. That's why only the smartest wrestlers, such as CM Punk, have been able to counter this sequence.   A- I would disagree that Lesnar and Angle do so. Shawn Michaels and Kane have been in the Anklelock for more than two minutes before submitting, and Lesnar has applied the Kimura for nearly that long, which would be unheard of in other combat sports, such as MMA.  Why? Because, even though it's never said, unlike mixed martial artists, professional wrestlers will be fined and punished severely for breaking a limb, so they apply submissions with less force. The reason? Wrestlers perform multiple times a week-- MMA competitors do not perform nearly that often, so shattering an arm or leg does not nearly impact their roster the way it impacts a pro wrestling roster.   A- It's a surprise to us. It's not a surprise to the audio technicians. Whoever's returning has to pass through the backstage area, past the Gorilla Position, and up the stairs through the curtain, so it's not like they're completely incognito until the moment they come out.   A- Vince, as we all know, is an crazy old man who runs his professional sports organization FAR different than anyone else's. Have you ever SEEN a cameraman in a backstage locker room segment? They aren't cameramen-- they're cameras mounted on the walls. As for how the cameras move? Remote control from the production truck.  This one was the hardest so far, so it's a bit of a stretch. _  **EDIT:** Also, this is to imply that most backstage segments DO have cameramen. But when wrestlers want to have a discussion or such that they don't want seen/heard, they tell the cameraman to GTFO, but the wall-mounted cameras are still rolling. At that point, what the wall-mounted cameras record may or may not be shown on the show, and that's really their only hope to keep X wrestler from seeing/hearing what they're doing.  Essentially, Vince has a rule that all backstage goings-on will be recorded, and he'll decide what to air and what not to air. There may have been some nasty conspiring that's gone on in the past that we've never seen.   A- Some wrestlers do hold on to the ropes to stop their momentum when their opponent expects them to rebound and run back at them. As for why they don't just stop running before even reaching the ropes/turnbuckle-- it's probably extremely difficult to do so while being thrown by a human being the size of an apartment complex. Human feet don't have brake pads; if they tried to suddenly stop during an Irish Whip, they might very well just fall flat on their face, or at least stumble uncontrollably.   A- Ambrose (and other examples) liked the name of the move, but discovered a totally different move that they liked better. In Ambrose's case, it's made even more logical, since (if I recall correctly), his finisher was changed after he returned from "injury," implying that it was something he thought about while he was out.   A- As has been seen, it's somewhat easy to get one's hands up to mitigate the force of a chair shot to the head. A chair shot to the back is completely unblockable.   For example:  Q- Triple H covers the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he uses it. This is to protect the other wrestler, as he's known to use a real sledgehammer, and striking someone full force with a metal hammer would be incredibly dangerous. But why would he do this in kayfabe?  A- Triple H covers the head of the sledgehammer when he hits other wrestlers with it so that he can control it better. Using one hand to guide the hammer itself ensures that he makes full contact, and it would still hurt anyway with his hand covering it.  Let's see how well this goes.   I suffer from anxiety and depression (am taking medication-- doesn't seem to be helping much), so it's really a little difficult to do anything that one would consider an enjoyable hobby (since both conditions can cultivate a significantly pessimistic attitude towards everything), but I try to push through it.  My favorite game to play online is Madden. When I win, I feel like amazing. I feel like I accomplished something great and that all my time practicing was worth it.  When I lose, putting a hole in my television feels imminent. I rarely feel as if I was outplayed (which may sound arrogant, but statistically, at least 90% of my games are played within a 1-2 point range-- I never get blown out), and if I do feel like I got outplayed, I hate myself for making such-and-such mistake that cost me the game.  It gets to the point where I have to take days off from playing the game because I know the positivity of winning isn't worth the risk of what losing entails. I don't want it to be that way.  Any advice?  Thanks.   For example, if I want a 1080p flatscreen TV, other Redditors can post links to websites that they know have good deals, or somewhere they know is having a sale on this product.  Thanks.   But did they feel disrespected if they were referred to as "Chad Johnson" or "Michael" respectively?   And give Mean Gene mad props. He acted like nothing had happened at all and finished out the segment while Booker facepalmed at himself.  	171

 Thank you for this. I think this is what I needed to hear.   One of the reasons juicing hasn't worked for you in the past is because it's not a balanced diet and not sustainable. You have to ease into weight loss and it sounds like you just stopped everything and started juicing. That is a shock to your body. Creating a healthy balanced diet is the only proven way to lose weight in the long term. Also, it helps to have one cheat food. For me it's dark chocolate and I give myself an ounce a day. It significantly cuts down the cravings.  Good luck with everything.     This sounded too much like Structural Geology...   I would really like to hear Bryke's reasoning behind this ship!    Annnnddd now I'm crying.. :'(   Korra can give and take away bending now, so why couldn't she make more airbenders?       ethnocentrism?          He was Martin, the baseball player. Ruthie was in love with him. His father was in the military and he lived with the Camdens for a while. He was on the show for a a few years.   7th Heaven?   He went to my high school!    The one you say looks like a fish, looks to me like an orthocone.    Annnnd there go my ovaries...    I quit swimming my freshman year of HS (it's been 5 years), but recently I've been wanting to get back in shape. I was a decent swimmer when I was competitive, so it hasn't taken too long for me to get back to where I was. I got in the pool 4 weeks ago, and I've been swimming 4 times/week and today I swam 2200 yards (in sets), and timed a 30sec 50 (without a start). Feels good man!    I go to Dickinson also! Went to the Bay last semester. I wish we could have seen this house. That looks like a really cool adventure!    It's the onion. While usable rocks are an exhaustible resource, and we can be smarter about management, some of the comments are kinda dumb. Pet rocks aren't the issue.    Damn fuck. That is incredibly sad. I read the title and my heart sank; I'm so sorry for you...I wish you luck in your recovery.    Hot damn...   Onyx. Boss name.    I bet he gets all the ladies.   You haven't been to r/Ladyboners before, have you?   It could work in a man-cave, but nowhere else.   	24
 I sorry to hear that, it sounds like things are pretty bad for you right now. It is very difficult to know how to properly help you through Reddit, as well as me not being a counsellor. I would however suggest that you should try and talk to someone such as the Samaritans or other charity that is available where you live. Things are obviously pretty serious for you and talking to someone who is a good listener may be a start to getting back on the road to recovery. Could you afford to pay to see a counsellor? They may be able to help provide support.   Have you tried searching Google for "cofounder dating". You may find someone useful there, I managed to arrange a meeting with a sales guy for next week for my idea through a site I found:   http://founderdating.com/ - Seems to be for the US market https://www.cofounderslab.com/ - Seems to be more for the UK market.   Be aware that melatonin will affect your sleeps phase-response curve. Taking too much melatonin at night, greater than the 25 micrograms that they typical adult male produces from the pineal gland means that it is still in your bloodstream the next morning. For some people this means that the body thinks it is still night time long after the sun has risen the next day. That means you won't go to sleep the next night at the expected time as you are phase shifted. The diagram on this page explains it a little:  http://tinyurl.com/oldao5l  I found a lot of things didn't work for me. I eventually stopped eating dairy products and within a week I was doing much better. However that could be due having a better ability to breathe through my nose but I also expect that there was more going on - I just haven't had time to look into it yet. I also started taking 50mg of Trazadone and now sleep through at least 6 hours a night and frequently 7.   I'll assume that you are an expert on the usual sleep hygiene stuff. I think most people on this board are!  Good luck.   Great and clear reply, thank you and taken on board!    No.    For some bizzare reason you are assuming that the total worth of your venture happens to be exactly 500% his fees projected onto a non-sepcific period of time.  Could you expand on how you make this calculation please and maybe on why my way of thinking about it is wrong? I'm a techie rather than a financier and so I don't really follow you.    That's a good idea, I like that one, thanks.   I don't quite follow where you say;  "advisor with less time demand (and no consulting fee) and earning say 1%"  Do you mean that he should not be paid his consulting fee and given a 1% share of the business for his work?  Thanks for the 'No-one's irreplaceable' comment. I have been thinking the same thing today. I'm slightly gutted though as he did seem to be such a perfect match.   Yep, that was my thought when heard he only had a half day a week. I didn't want to colour my post though. Thanks for your opinion.    I would have thought that a couple hours of many different peoples time would create a product that didn't gel very well. A lot of people may contribute but when you don't use their work because it doesn't fit or wasn't very professional then they would get annoyed and refuse to help any further. It also takes time to understand the project and get a hang of the requirements. I am not sure that a couple of hours would be enough - I would expect 3-5 days would be the minimum that would be of use. Once you start getting to that sort of time requirement then most people probably want to be paid for the expertise, especially if they are good at what they do.   I am a computer programmer and I have been developing an online business platform to serve a professional market for about a year. There is still another 9 months to go before it will be fully launched.    I am considering taking on a business partner who is a member of the professional community that the site will serve. He seems to be the go-to guy in the industry for the product I am developing. As an example he wrote the ethical guidelines for the industries main professional body and has been considering the problem that I am solving over the last decade or more. He would help with system design and act as a gateway into his industry. If the business could raise further financing he would run the clinical trials for the product that could launch it into a much higher league. I therefore see him as a fortunate contact to have and he would make an excellent business partner.    He would have half a day a week to work on the business. He wants 10% and also wants to be paid half his usual consultancy fee. He also mentioned that he could squeeze a profit from the cost of running the clinical trials which would come in at about £50k.   I have been fundraising recently and it looks like I can pay him the money he wants but I won’t at this stage be getting anything myself.   I have been thinking the following:   • I will be doing at least 10 half days a week – probably 12;  • He will be doing 1 half day a week.   He would therefore be due 9% of the business. However he wants to mitigate his risk by getting paid half his consultancy fee. To me that means he is now due 4.5% of the business. However I have done a year’s work already and so his share should come down to about 3-4%. He wants 10% and has agreed to vestment in principal.   He has also stated that when the money I have raised runs out he would only do a few weeks or months more work on the business without pay. He would then look to doing something else with his time.   As the business won’t be launched for about 9 months and it can only pay him for about 12 months, it looks like he may decide to leave about 6 months after launch.   If I take him on as a contractor then I am not sure that I have enough financing at this stage to get enough out of him.    Would you sign such a partnership agreement with someone who had a great complimentary skill set?   	10
 I think it may actually be sadder to have recognized whose body that is.. Like I did, I mean.   Well, I how you are eventually fruitful. Still a very cute piece!   Yes!!!!! A bowl for us gayz   Yep, I was wrong. Just zoomed in and saw the horizontal watermark. Never mind. :-)   I’ve had the Organics you’re talking about (in RAW Cone form). They are solid white, it’s pretty strange. As far as I have noticed, RAW Classics, the brownish ones, aren’t labelled organic anywhere on the package.   A bag of weed.  P.S. Why are you crying?   Bad Girls by M.I.A. probably   A recent letter from her website:    Years ago I began the process of trying to remove myself from an abusive relationship that started when I was a teenager. Over the course of that relationship I was systematically cut off from anyone and everyone that I could truly be close to. I was talked down to, yelled at, locked into rooms and criticized daily about my abilities, my weight, my looks, my intelligence and almost every move I made. When I couldn’t take it anymore and I wanted to end the relationship I was threatened, then I was told I was loved, and the cycle would begin again.    I want young women and young men to understand that this kind of treatment of others can happen where it might be least expected. Even in environments that thrive on creativity and open-mindedness, that advocate artistic and counter-culture ideals. Sometimes people will use these things to camouflage themselves so that their abuse might go unnoticed. So that you wouldn’t think to consider it could be happening right in front of you.    The clarity I’ve gained since getting out of that situation has opened up my life in a way that I didn’t imagine was possible. Although some of the pain and anger still lingers, my life finally feels as though it has value and meaning. I speak out now hoping that I can encourage other young women and young men to affirm their value within their relationships or get out. Abuse isn’t always obvious and it doesn’t have to involve black eyes, blood and broken bones. Emotional and psychological abuse can be just as damaging, and it is extremely difficult to remove yourself from.    Those that have known me throughout my career might be surprised that someone who publicly gave the impression of being fearless and seemed as though they didn’t take shit from anyone could find themselves being severely mistreated and manipulated by someone they were close to. This person nearly stripped me of myself.  And for years I felt as though they were waiting for my life to end.    Stillbirth was written by myself and Jupiter Keyes in our basement. There is no label involved. It will be available through iTunes, Spotify, etc. beginning July 18. All proceeds for digital purchases of this song will benefit organizations (like the nonprofit RAINN) that help survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence and incest. You can donate directly to them at https://donate.rainn.org or via the link on my website at http://www.alice-glass.com/    There is a sister song to Stillbirth that I hope to release soon, she is a lullaby and she can’t wait to meet you      JESUS CHRIST IN HEAVEN **THank youuuuuu**   They want us (and our dollars) all trapped in this cesspool of sin/tourism I'm sure. Also: public transit in AVL is the farthest from the pits (having previously lived in Louisville, KY and having gotten around in D.C., NYC, L.A., and some of Western Europe. I'd say ART mostly has its shit together.   Slow news day, I guess   The "**Right now**" part of "Right now, I live in the cloud" is just a bit ominous to me..      Same here on SP2..... but you have to think of non-proprietary device users.   That ^ is the after photo. [This is the before photo.](http://i.imgur.com/r7eq8tu.jpg)   Got it in a little head shop in downtown Asheville, NC ;-)  Edit:  This one's a TasteBuds (a brand I'd never heard of), all of the Grav Labs was sold out online 💔   Indeed.   I don’t know where I am on “the scale,” but I just smoked a column of pure cannabis ― a very stoney hybrid called Oracle ― and it was actually wonderful. But now I wanna clean it :”-(     	20
 I personally would've preferred Ron Perlman (probable typo) as deathstroke instead of Will Smith as deadshot   Dude walking towards it at the end: "good job petrov, here's your payment"  Gives seagull a fry, keeps the camera   Thanks a bunch dude   Its hard when no one understands your illness and think that you're only weak, i usually just keep my feelings to myself and wait for it to pass.  I usually am all over the spectrum of joy, depression and anger, just need someone to talk to that understands this feelings of dread and hopelessness, of feeling alone and falling into a dark hole.   I play videogames for hours, it calms me down and soothes my mind.  Used to drink but that just made it worse, whatever you do don't turn to alcohol, the first times you feel good but eventually it drags you to a deeper hole.  I'm not the right person to say it at the moment since I'm going through a very rough spot in life, but try and hang in there. Cry if you must, write your feelings out and burn the paper, please, just try and hang in there   This goes on /r/aww (hope I got the link right, still pretty new in here)   Leave food and water for it, that's pretty much all you can do.  Try with an animal control center, maybe a vet clinic?    The benefits of working outdoors dude   http://i.imgur.com/YCVE8U4.jpg   Totalmente de acuerdo, justamente de eso estaba pensando hoy.  Hay que salir un poco del colectivo de ser chingon para ver nuestra cultura desde afuera y darnos cuenta de tantos y tantos errores que hay en nuestra cultura.  Que fácil es echarle la culpa al gobierno de nuestros problemas y nosotros seguir igual   Diablo 3, I was disappointed at first to be we honest but I've been playing more and more and am happy and enjoying it a lot! Old school Diablo fan here   That's how I hit on girls when I'm drunk...  Ahhhh just kidding fellows, I do it sober too  	12
 A 4 month manic? Wow. Mine hardly last three weeks let alone four months. I understand with the whole fatigue thing. Lately I either dont sleep at all or I sleep 17 hours (done that twice now since this episode started).   May I ask how I've helped?   Hello friends, gamers, fellow Spartans! A few summers ago I had just gotten my Roxio game cap and decided to play my favorite game(s) and use it to stream. Well. Its now a few summers later and I have a new computer that will support my streaming in a better quality and wont crash every 15 seconds. With that being said, I am planning on marathoning ALL the Halo games thus far (Xbox 360 versions no MCC, sorry) in marathon on Heroic next week. If you want to join me on this adventure, message me on here with what game you want to help on, or message me on XBL @ Troop4921 with what game you wish to help on. Obviously, each game (only exception Halo 2) will have 4 slots including myself, so space is limited. I will leave a roster below including the names of who will be joining me during the games, and a general idea of when they are. I will play them in chronological order of storyline, so that way those who don't know the lore will get an okay idea. The stream will be shown on my channel, [here](twitch.tv/train_subject896) and anyone else who plays is more than welcome to host it on their channel as well.    Halo Wars 1.Troop4921 2.  Halo Reach: 1.Troop4921 2. 3. 4.  Halo CE: 1.Troop4921 2. 3. 4.  Halo 3: ODST (Im taking preference) 1.Troop4921 2. 3. 4.  Halo 2 1.Troop4921  Halo 3 1.Troop4921 2. 3. 4.  Halo 4 1.Troop4921 2. 3. 4.   Im not at all disappointed. Im not much of a screenwriter but Bethesda definitely hit the ball into the right park with this one. I still think my idea is better though ;D   I buy LE's of games like nobodies business. Even for games I don't particularly like. Black Ops 2 Care package being my biggest mistake. However, I dont buy them for the game, I buy it for all the cool content that I can mess with and physically see. So that being said, some of my ideas for a LE Fallout 4 would be similar to [this](https://m.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/306chv/fallout_anthology_mininukedropping_in_september/) with the game in a steelbook case that looks war torn and has a BoS/Protagonist symbol on one side and an Enclave/Antagonist on the other. Comes with DLC obviously, but maybe only things that will barely affect the gameplay. Also, maybe could include a little bobble head holding a bottle cap for all the "caps" you spent to get a hold on him.   Any thoughts???   I'd be more than happy to play with you! Are you going to host the world? And if so, are you going to start a new world from scratch (I presume so because you said you lost the game files)?    Here is what I did: Find your bulb and clear out a space about 20 long to each side and maybe 6 tall. At the end of each side, close off a small enough room to house a teleporter and campfire. On the wall that faces inwards towards the bulb, leave a space for you to shoot through with megashark. Pop the bulb and immediately run to one of the teleporters and shoot at her until she gets close. Then, with your preferred means of triggering, use the teleporter and shoot at her from the other side.   Hell yeah man I'd always be up for a collab! Couple quick questions for my sake though: What software do you use to record your gameplay? Could I post my own recordings on my channel as well as cycling the episodes? How would my audio get to your videos?  My youtube channel should be accessible through youtube.com/channel/troop4921 Go check me out man!   So after seeing all the images from the puzzle and it being completed, I got really excited seeing Locke with three other Spartans. Now, its never set in stone whether these are SII's or SIV's, cause lets be real here, they sure arent SIII's. So my thoughts on if they are the second gen, is that it may be Grey team. Looking at [this](http://i.imgur.com/3zmdc9q.jpg) image from left to right we get an unnamed male, unnamed female, Locke, and another unnamed male. So in my little headcanon, ONI redirected Grey Team, merciless hidden assassins they are, to the mission to kill a long time friend cause if anyone can kill a Spartan, its another spartan. It very well could be them to going left to right it could be Mike/Jai, Adrianna, Locke, and Mike/Jai. Any thougths?   The only reason Grey Team is really listed MIA is cause their under ONI's wing doing missions out in the BFE of space. So it's not that their necessarily MIA but rather lowkey away from the rest of the world.    So from left to right is it Linda, John, Kelly, and Fred? I really doubt Fred honestly after reading Glasslands and (sadly only part of) Thursday War with the way he acts towards Mendez. But alas, I would love to see the full blue team in person especially with someone (Kelly presumably) wearing the Spartan III armor.      Hello my fellow Spartans! So I will be the first to admit that my new years resolution of losing weight definitely didn't last. However, I finally decided to change this when I realized that my cosplay wont look good if I'm as big as I am right now. So for anybody else out there who is still trying to get down on their weight or needs a nerdy motivator for it all, this is the post!  So far, I have found one solid workout [here](http://darebee.com/workouts/master-chief-workout.html) and I tried it. It killed my legs. BUT it felt good. So I'm asking all of you now, if you know of any or have created any workouts centered around Halo, post them here.  Also for extra credit points; if you know the exact workout the Spartan-II's went through when they were younger and could post that would be the coolest. I faintly remember reading about it somewhere. Fall of Reach or one of the books I know for sure.      So put yourself in my place, I just scored a 30 on my ACT and feel 2 kewl 4 scewl. So I've been slacking off. A lot. Especially in the class I'm currently in. Personal Finance. The only class I have felt like I need to learn. Yet, everyday I come in and the teacher isn't here so I log in to my computer, open up Chrome, and without thinking twice, open up this subreddit. Oops. I now have a 48% in this class with a standard 3.0 GPA. This may be bad.  tldr; I slack off in class by coming on here.   Deposited a level 38, female, Petilil, no IGN message, is La!:)   Calm down there Miley Cyrus.   Just like the title asks; is it possible to max a skill with just quests and natural progression as opposed to grinding and farming? Im sure its possible, though much slower, but are there any guides to do it? Furthermore, on a skill that is already 60, is it possible to max it in 12 hours or less?   Sadly, still only combat 68 lol. Man, Ive got some levels to catch up on.   Everyone is recommending World Wakes but... uh.. I cant. lol. Too low of a level. Most my attack skills are mid 50's and World Wakes needs like 70+ doesnt it? Even if it doesnt, theres a lot for me to do before anyways.    I jumped on once in between and got a run down of that thing. After adding a few more hours onto my gameplay, I'm honestly kinda liking the abilities thing. However, I do miss my blood splatter to show damage lol.    No joke. I joined Runescape back in early 2008 and was a dedicated player and member. And then they came out with the graphic overhaul and the village tasks and all this crap in 2010 and I lost interest and didnt touch my account until about three weeks ago. I started playing around and fell back in love but so much has changed and I dont like it. So can someone give me a quick summary (if at all possible) what's been added and taken out since 2010? Im a member again so P2P is also a deal for me.   May I x-post onto /r/ODST?         aw:L So we can't nominate things from other halo subreddits?   I think there should be a category for game nights or people that helped start those!   TIL that a 9 year old knows more about minecraft than I do.   Hey guys, whats up it is train_subject896(mod of /r/ODST) here and I am hoping to help anyone and everyone that needs an achievement, get it. I am 10 achievements away from 100%ing ODST and I would like to extend the welcome to anyone that wants to join! My gamertag is Troop4921 and I am only missing Vidmaster's Deja Vu and Classic, along with Firefight's Last Exit, Chasm Ten, Windward, Rally Point, Lost Platoon, and Crater. I am also missing Audiophile and Naughty, Naugthy. If you are also missing any of these, comment down below or shoot me a message on XBL!!! I will be on almost all weekend long trying to get some achievements of my own! Hope you all can join me on the battlefield.

I will be doing a teaser for it soon! Keep out an open eye!   I feel like the Doctor is a bit overdone honestly. But if I did this, I would totally be 6!:)   uhh. can I put a not on [this](https://s-media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/originals/ae/07/a3/ae07a3ddcdc253fabd57a100ba1a3ad7.jpg)    Hey guys! I just recently rebranded my channel and have been really thinking about what I want to do next with it. So, since I decided on FONV, I came here to ask;  What should be the theme of my Let's Play?  Right now, a big inspiration for me is Many A True Nerd who is doing a You Only Live Once Let's Play which I would like to adapt off of. Please let me know what you think I should do!  If you want to see what I've done before, my youtube is now under the same name as my reddit username.         I can help tomorrow from about 3-5!:) GT:Troop4921      Hey guys! I know I have been **SUPER** inactive as of late but all will be made up with over time. However, I am proposing a few gameplay timings within the next couple of days so bear with me. On Friday(10/17), from 2:30 CST to 4, I will be able to play online with anyone. On Saturday(10/18), I can play most all day until around 4 PM. On Sunday (10/19), I propose an all day entire community play together and achievement hunt! So, list what times you can play and your gamertag and we can all play together! Sorry it took so long to get one going again but hey, I'm trying!   I was 7 when the first Xbox game I owned was that beautiful game of Halo 2.  I'm 17 now and don't have and Xbox One for the game otherwise I would camp out for this fucker.   Hi! I've been having this error pop up for a week straight now. I am trying to get 7 Days to Die, my card is still active and has enough money on it, and I have perfect connection, I've tried on both the desktop app and website and both return me this error. HELP!:(   [Speech 25/50 50%] Do you have a snapchat?;)   I totally meant 60s. My bad. I'm thinking like, Buddy Holly, Big Bopper, Ritchie Valens, people like that. Sorry.    Imagine it though. There you are, in your chair, watching the newest Fallout gamer video when you get the advertisement. All it is in the first five seconds is the Bethesda intro. Immediately piques your interest so you watch on. Next thing you see is out a windshield, not of a car but a plane, and your camera pans back behind the pilot who is frantically yelling "Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!" as you hear a 40's rock song slowly fade in. The camera fades to dark and shows one person, a ghoul now, walking away from the wreckage with a few small mushroom clouds in the background. It fades again and a black screen comes on with the Vault Boy and "Reserve your spot today!" with the release date under it.  **PLEASE BETHESDA PLEASE**   1: You can kill Yes Man (does he just find a new body or stay dead? Didn't play much longer after I killed him) 2:Having Cannibal as a perk is very entertaining in the Ultra Luxe 3: Recruiting the First Recon against Driver Nephi is useless if you're a sniper yourself.   Challenge accepted.   Yeah, I have GRA and Courier's Stash though so I start with stuff more powerful than all that. So I fixed it then sold it.      It just slowed me down a TON last time I got it and just ew. I wish I could do it without rainmeter but nah    I WANT BUT I HATE HATE **HATE** RAINMETER   Yeah! So you know how there is the pond with the little cave next to it? There is one on the opposite side (I want to say North side?) of it. Or for better reference its [the top pool of water](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Quarry_Junction?file=QuarryJunctionlocalreal.jpg)   If you look really close, he looks like the silence from Doctor Who.   I may have set the bar fairly high for you /u/ManyATrueNerd   God, I could never do FO1/2. You'd see me get a five minute playthrough. I want to record my playthrough of this but I've got a few too many over powered mods on my side. Namely, the DMR I can steal at the beginning and [Perk At Every Level](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34707/?). I saw the thing that was front page last week about his FO3 Kill Everything playthrough so I started following and watched all of that and his Kill Everything FONV and gosh I love his channel. Hope mine gets as famous.   No lie, MATN is exactly where I got the inspiration for this playthrough. I actually changed a bit on mine though and allowed healing but the conditions are **1)** I can't heal in battle **2)**Has to be food/drink I have made myself **3)** Headcanon that my character has a fear of needles which prevents use of Med-X, Psycho, and Stims. Even with these, still difficult as all get out. I think I'm around lvl 8 now and coming up on Novac so it's going to be fun.   I actually came around to the Quarry from Yangtze Memorial to get the Fat man and mini-nuke. THEN went to the front and got one of the normal deathclaws out of the way and used Ratslayer to snipe off as many as I could until it was just the mother and Alpha and the rest is present. It was definitely a challenge.      Get a Cowboy Rifle before level 10 if at all possible. Don't worry about looking for unique things until postgame. Good Natured is always a good perk to choose cause you will only specialize in one or maybe two attack stats as opposed to the universal Medicine, Repair, Speech, and Barter.   I suggest following [this](http://youtu.be/N8XLN1N0vtM) playthrough and trying to match it   It looks like the guy in front has a pistol not from in game.   I recently started replaying FO3 and came up to Oasis. Just before this, however, I had been reading up on lore and came across the actual story of Harold *hint hint link [link](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Harold)* and it was heartwrenching for me listening to him talk and explain his story. He had been living like this for some time and before this he never once did anything about it. So when I went under, having both ointments and a chance to help Harold live on, and I shot him, I sat and roleplay(and really) cried in a corner for 10 minutes.  	64
 Same with my mom. Also anything on adult swim, I couldn't even watch futurama.  Now she lets my younger brothers watch family guy and all those shows. I think she just stopped giving a damn.    Thank you, I really appreciate that :-)    Thank you! And I plan on it haha. There is most definitely a time and a place for that type of thing,and plus there are some things that are best saved for when you're of age.    Yup. That crowd was insane. I actually crowdsurfed to get out, I was getting way too hot and lightheaded in there and there was no chance of walking out.    I didn't realize the implication, I really was not trying to say that. I removed that comparison.   True, my bad. That wasn't a very accurate comparison.I was just trying to think of concert related risks, I didn't realize the implication there.    I don't see how being aware of the risks of something mean you're asking for them to happen.    Please tell me where I said crowd surfing meant getting groped and undressed. I stated that that was a RISK of crowdsurfing.    No, because that isn't what I basically just said. I said that every girl who crowdsurfs knows that there is a risk of that happening. If you go skydiving knowing there is a chance your parachute may fail are you basically asking to die?    I think you guys should remember I was being carried through the crowd up by a sea of pumped up drunk people at a Slipknot concert. Every girl who crowdsurfs knows there is a chance of getting groped, that risk comes with the experience. Not to mention the bikini string could have very well been pulled accidentally. My perspective on this was a fun, memorable concert experience that left me with a better understanding of myself.   **edit: my mosh pit comparison implied the opposite of my point, I'm sorry. I do not think that you are asking to get groped if you're a girl and you crowdsurf. **   I know it was wrong, if it had happened to a friend I wouldn't be okay with it. I'm just saying that I'm not up in arms over it.    You're not oldschool, it's really not okay to remove the top of any woman of any age without their consent.   	12
 Men have nipples.   If I ever get my anxiety under control without meds, sure.   Knew what that was right away.   I've been on Tri-Previfem for about 3 years now, and it was my understanding that it's supposed to stop ovulation. However, I still get all those ovulation symptoms: change in cervical fluid, change in cervical position and firmness, cramping on one side, etc. Just like I did before starting BC.  I haven't gotten pregnant so it must be working, but I really think I'm ovulating as well.   ...blood is sterile?  Let's hope this person doesn't work in healthcare.   Excellent example of why I refuse to call myself a feminist.  I want nothing to do with you whack jobs.   Tatiana was the prettiest of Nicholas II's daughters.   ...that was the point.   I've never understood the desire to insult people, but to do it nicely.  If you're against hurting someone's feelings, don't insult them at all. Cutting "ableist" language out doesn't make it any better.   These are the same people who want subreddits they see as dangerous to be banned.   As a woman I feel I have no business questioning men who skipped out on the draft, but I tend to make an exception for Republicans since they seem to be more willing to start wars.   I can see why.   And which medical school did you go to?   It certainly can be a hereditary mental illness as well.   Alimony should be extremely temporary. Enough for the spouse who didn't work as much to take classes, learn skills, etc. so they can support themselves.  Getting a check from your ex for the rest of your single life? No.   We've had sexual problems in the past. I'm HL, she's LL. Before, we've had problems in having consistent, regular sex more than once every 2-3 weeks. Recently, we've made progress and had sex twice a week a few weeks ago. But that was several weeks ago.  I'm really LL, but me and my HL boyfriend are exactly the opposite. We have sex several times a week, and I agree to it just so I don't have to deal with him pestering me about it. Having sex for 1/2 hour (he lasts forever) is preferable to listening to him say, "Hey, touch my dick" for an hour. We've only gone a month without sex once, and that was after I had a painful medical procedure and was unable.  I also didn't dare try to put it off on his birthday. I just gave in without any resistance. He'd never hurt me, but his anger and the pestering would have been multiplied by 5, I'm sure. Easier to just give in.  It isn't him. He's good at sex. I'm just on anti-anxiety meds and would rather do math homework than have sex some days.  I don't really have any advice for you, I just noticed that my experience is quite different from most other peoples' on here. I give in while other women (and some men) just refuse to have the sex.   Yes.   My boyfriend's foreplay is saying, "Hey, touch my dick."  This sounds better.   One of my "friends" did this exact thing on Facebook.   Baby in Latin is infantem. Fetus is Latin for offspring.  But we're talking medical definitions.   You can't force them, but you can tell them they aren't adhering to their own policy. If they aren't adhering to it, they should remove it.   If it's inside the mother, it's a fetus. That's the definition of the word.   Smoke and barely brush her teeth.   Drink a lot of soda. Both doctor and dentist said to cut it out.   20 weeks? That's 5 months. The fetus can almost survive on its own at that point.  I'm okay with this, assuming the woman's life or health isn't at risk.   Well...he's right.  Apologies should only be given if the person means it. Otherwise there's no value in an apology.  Trump's an idiot and he should go away.   I swear, I thought Kodiak bears were extinct...   https://www.reddit.com/r/CoonTown/comments/3dm4h8/i_have_no_where_else_to_vent/  I was talking about this.   Sadly, I think they should declare her dead. I bet she didn't survive a week after her abduction.    Same here. I am 26 and refuse to ride them since then. It was *at least* 17 years ago.    Because a private website should be forced to host that kind of shit.  Reddit has a "free speech" policy. They aren't being forced to host anything.   I believe he posted a photo of himself with his username. He was black.   My dad needed that sign when he forced me on a roller coaster.   I was probably an annoying shit as a child too.    Like, dozens upon dozens of generations before you had kids so you could exist  They didn't have kids so further generations could exist. They had kids because they needed extra hands on the farm, because there was no reliable birth control, because it was expected of them, and maybe even a few times because they wanted kids.  But I seriously doubt anyone was thinking, "Gotta continue the line for thousands of years..."   Then after that you have a toddler waking you up.   But then your boyfriend wakes you up by humping you.  That's how I woke up today.   Do you have the same standards for men?   I understand why men have this fear and it's valid, but I've always resented men who look down on women for sleeping with them on a first date, for admitting to having many sexual partners before them, etc yet they don't see anything wrong with doing these things themselves.  It's fine to be concerned about the paternity of hypothetical children, but don't be a hypocrite.    Periods, and good bras being expensive.   Pretty often. It's amazing I don't get dehydrated.    I don't know why other women have an issue with this.   This vagina owner agrees!   I agree with the top part, but not the bottom.  If the genders were switched, men would take advantage of it too.   Australia.   When your water breaks, you still have plenty of time before you deliver.  You're telling me this teacher couldn't get to the hospital in a couple hours?   I think the doctor was a popping lover too...   "It was a busy yet fun day and we're happy you could be a part of it!"  My place of employment had this: It was a busy, yet fun day, and we're happy you could be a part of it!  I didn't think that could be right.   Of course some restaurants have those machines, but they aren't more common in Europe/Australia than they are in the USA.   Sounds like a nice way to end up homeless.  Most people don't choose where they work. You apply and interview and hope to god one of them hires you.   Obvious that this guy is in politics as an attempt to make people pay attention to him.   So why does someone deserve to afford a treo bedroom house simply for showing up for a job.  Trio bedroom? Try one bedroom. They still don't make enough.  Minimum wage jobs are designed for people who are in school or live with their parents.  Minimum wage jobs aren't designed to do anything except perform a service for a business, just like other jobs.  People who d don't need to rent. If you make minimum wage a career wage look in the mirror instead of blame the evil rich people.  Maybe the average rich person isn't to blame, but the fact that America's economic mobility has been going stagnant for decades certainly is.   The average McDonalds worker in Australia makes over $24K a year. In the USA, the average McDonalds worker makes $9,600 a year.   If they're paid more they might be more inclined to give a shit about your pickles.   $15 is an attempt to get it to where it would be if min. wage had kept up with inflation.   Why aren't cashiers and fast food workers in Europe and Australia being replaced, then? Their minimum wage and/or collective bargaining means those companies pay them quite a bit more than here to do the same job, but companies aren't bringing robots in any faster than here.   And even if they did...so what? It was still their decision to make.   TIL people in countries with single payer are pointing guns at their healthcare providers.    The problem you highlight is a critical one that absolutely must be addressed. When we look at things purely based on profitability or cost effectiveness, we put people's wellbeing at risk. This is especially an issue in healthcare.  We can't have single payer income, doctors will be less rich!!!  Honestly, doctors in single payer countries do quite well. It's a non-issue.   First statement is reasonable, second one is quite out there.   They're paying for their own healthcare too. That's how taxes work.  That's like saying, "I have a smaller paycheck to pay for people I don't know to have access to the fire department."   Do these parents not bother to ever tells their kids about strangers? At 6-7 I knew to scream my head off if someone tried to take me away from my parents.   A seemingly unspoken rule in the chat is that whenever two rpers got together, their characters did too, so we role played all kinds of coupley cutesy stuff in the chat.  Not to take away from how terrible the story is, but that's adorable! Of course, it's only adorable if two kids are doing it, not one kid and one adult.  I had an online boyfriend starting from the age of 15. He was 18. I got lucky in that he really was who he said he was. It's been over 10 years now and we're still Facebook buddies.     Eating in a restaurant alone is apparently weird.  ...it is?   I don't believe there's anything in the Muslim religion banning women from driving.  Saudi Arabia is the only country that did. All other Muslim countries allow women to drive.   So if I don't have kids I'll have money by the time I'm in my 30s?   ...you promise?   A tortoise isn't a mammal.   Can't it be both?   Instead, spend the money on sterilization.   I'm voting for him, but I give him a 0% chance of winning.   So what if we're in a car, and we crash. The accident is your fault. Should I be able to force you to let me use your body to support mine, since it's your fault I'm in this condition?  The situations and conditions don't matter. In all circumstances, you own your own body and no one else is allowed to use it without your permission. If you insist otherwise, you're saying a fetus has rights no one else does.   A little less than half the women in this country are pro-life.   Late term abortions are illegal in most states except for cases that endanger the woman's life, so it's time to let that go. The vast majority of abortions occur long before the fetus has any real nervous system to feel anything. Late term abortions are also expensive and hard on the woman's body, so women aren't getting them for fun.  the number of jews killed by hitler doesn't even approach this historically.  Because a forming fetus without a nervous system is the same as 6 million Jews. lol okay.  oh it's the shipping cost. ok then  If they were selling the parts for money, they'd be getting a lot more than $30-$100 a specimen. In fact, PP wouldn't be in such need for money all the time.   I was watching porn once and found myself more impressed by the bathroom they were in than the sex.  I was 20.   Why do people have more than 1 kid if this is what it's like?   Can't feed 'em? Don't breed 'em!  ...enter contraception...   Absolutely 100% of that was stupid.   Goodbye.   I see that you changed your mind down below, so I'm not really talking about you anymore, but I wish people thought about this before they ran their mouths.  Planned Parenthood has funding problems. They depend on private donations because many states have laws that tax dollars can't fund them.  If they were able to sell fetus organs, they wouldn't be in such dire financial need.   It's okay because the only person who owns the woman's body is the woman. The fetus has no right to use it against her will.  Say that I am in a horrible accident and need your blood and organs to survive. Should I be able to force you to support my body with yours?   They have to give them away for free if they do give them away. That's the law.   However, the costs for shipping and handling items marked as fragile can be high. Not to mention the measures it takes to preserve the specimens and store them properly in transit. That takes money.   If you want to look at aborting fetuses as killing babies, that's your business, but PP isn't selling the organs. In the unedited video, the PP doctor says, “It has to do with space issues, are you sending someone there who is doing everything, or is their staff, what exactly are they going to do, is there shipping involved or are you coming to pick it up.”  She's likely outlining the costs for shipping and handling items marked as fragile. Not to mention the measures it takes to preserve the specimens and store them properly in transit. That takes money.    That's not what the comment was saying.  You must be from SRS.   Hell, even a condom isn't 100%. I got pregnant despite the use of a condom.   Honestly, I feel that trust in this issue is a bigger risk for men. Women can abort, but if a woman gets pregnant, a man's hands are tied if she chooses to keep it.  Of course, I know not all women have access to on request abortion in the USA, and that's an issue that needs a lot of work, but I've always felt privileged in this matter as the one with the uterus.    I haven't either.  I don't doubt sexism exists (against men and women) I just haven't felt that I've ever been treated badly or condescendingly because I'm a woman.   Nero's a cat. I named him after the cruel and terrible emperor. He lived up to it right away. My boyfriend says he's the worst behaved cat he's ever seen. He causes so much trouble, makes huge messes, and pretty much does whatever he pleases without regard to the consequences (ie, a spray bottle).   But he's so cute!  http://i.imgur.com/r6kLWOy.jpg   All sorts of ways. The most mild form is cutting the clitoral hood, the most severe is cutting off the clitoris and sewing up the vagina.  I don't know which form they practiced.   Yeah...pretty sure my boss requires all 3.   My boyfriend likes to say this is because all the dumb ones were killed off by natural selection over the years.  Then he likes to say say that our hypothetical child will only have an IQ of 108 (average of 113 and 103) and shake his head while glaring at me.  Yeah, we like dark humor.   Professional Jew? I giggled.   Ethiopian Jews also circumcised their females.   It's funny. Up until age 23, I had met two Jews that I knew of. All the way back in elementary school. Then when I was 23 I met my boyfriend. Then I met his family. Suddenly I went from having met two to 15+.  I was shocked to read that the Holocaust brought the world's population of Jews down 0.6%. That's crazy. I knew they killed a lot of people, but I had no idea it was *that* bad.   I believe they're counting ethnic Jews as well, which includes children that comes from a Jewish father. Biology doesn't care about religious belief.   Sounds like that second woman should be reported to the police. She seems to have lied in court.   I had to look that one up. I LOLed.   Wow...she's a lot smarter than I was at 6.   I've encountered this before on Reddit and online in general. "You're a woman? Then why would you subscribe to men's rights and why wouldn't you be a feminist?"  It's as if they can't believe that someone can support and fight for men's rights and women's rights at the same time. Egalitarians exist.   Yes. Why wouldn't he?   Didn't know just removing the tubes was a thing.  Can you still have periods?   In that case I agree.   Simply believing in god doesn't make someone mentally ill. My grandmother is a committed Christian and one of the best people I've ever met. I've never heard her use religion as a rationale for anything.   That's kind of gross, but I do think people overreact when it comes to this topic.  We've all seen messages on Facebook that say, "Take all photos of your children down! Pedophiles are stealing them and using them to masturbate!"  That's a pretty absurd moral panic. For one, how would you know this? Two, pedophiles don't need photos of your kids. They can do a Google search for "children" and have all the pictures they need. Three, if you're that terrified that a pedo might jerk off to photos of your kid, why take your kid out in public at all? Pedos might snap a photo without you knowing! Better keep them inside!   The vast majority of roles in the military aren't combat, so there is plenty for women to do.   Israel drafts women, as well as Norway.   Hopefully this will go somewhere. I've thought this was BS since I was 16.   Okay, SRS, let's explain this to your slow asses once again.  We do not make laws based on what we find icky. We base laws on what hurts someone. Drawing pictures of sexy children isn't illegal because it isn't hurting anyone. It's icky, but isn't hurting anyone. Taking a photo of a child meant to be sexy is hurting someone, so that's illegal. See how it works?     I did it too, then it said I had to sign into Facebook to get the result.  I told it to go fuck itself.   My IQ is above average? Really? Humanity, we're in some serious trouble.   $44? At Subway? Christ.   Same here. 50s housewife would be pretty good for me.   Low self esteem, really bad at STEM subjects, can't drive very well, and I'm emotional. Also, horrible sense of direction.    after eating the toast.  You're kidding right?   Getting rid of them is hard though.  We have traps and a cat, but they still love to hang around.   Poor mouse. Horrible way to die.   Why is dissent un-Democratic?   No one has *always* banned child pornography.   I have seen absolutely no one defending child porn here.   The Act on Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Protection of Children, which was around in 1999, stated child porn was illegal and those found guilty could face 5 years in prison.  http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main/?printID=ky=workre=02page=18vm=03id=100  So this is very confusing.   The OP mentioned in a post that it's just an office, and the boss said they could have whatever food they wanted.   Pneumonia, sepsis, appendicitis, and I'm sure my precancerous cervical cells would have turned into cancer very fast.   Fatpersonhate subscriber here! I've always admitted we're being assholes.  But I enjoy it so.   I knew my boyfriend trusted me when he left his phone unlocked around me.  I never touched it.   His name is actually John.   I will *never* work 80 hour weeks. Hell, I won't work 50 hour weeks. 40 is my limit. If all you do is work, what's the point to living?   Did you read OP's message in the forum? It's a public office, and the boss has said they're allowed to bring whatever food they want.  OP's coworkers are trying to make everyone follow their rules but they don't own the office.   Jews don't believe in Heaven or Hell, to my knowledge.   This is an office, not a religious institution. If they are that worried about other employees not keeping kosher, they can go work somewhere religiously affiliated.   His coworkers have no right to tell him what he can have at lunch. He has just as much right to eat whatever they want as they do.   I'd openly eat pork really loudly in front of him.   Damn it, mine never get that big and beautiful!   This should be something you can call the humane society for.   Farm animal are exempt from a lot of animal cruelty laws, sadly.    The vast majority of southern soldiers had no slaves  Common misconception. 1/3 of households had at least 1 slave, as shown in the 1860 census.    And Germany should proudly hang up a Nazi flag for every dead Nazi!   "Meanwhile, the National Park Service, administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, asks us 'Please Do Not Feed the Animals.' Their stated reason for the policy is because 'The animals will grow dependent on handouts and will not learn to take care of themselves,'" it said.  Not a good comparison. First, make sure the animals in the woods have very little food between them and the smaller ones are often left with nothing.  Then it becomes more accurate.   Even Umbridge was an interesting character.   Much like when men had to protect women and tell them what to think for their own good, right?  	135

 Such a great response, thanks! i relate to a lot of that. Actually I always imagined when I get my own house some day, I'll have a huge fish tank. Totally agree with you, fish are so relaxing. I'd love to get some now but I can't see my parents being happy about that since I live with them. I'm starting a big transformation on my bedroom and hopefully I'll have a little room when I'm done for something like that? :D  I'd hire you, if I had a pet shop.    I'll try, thanks so much x   That's exactly it!  	3
 SpaceX's announcement of their plan for Mars.   I have had experience with this for the past couple of years. I've gained a few thoughts from it. They usually might actually have something scheduled at the times you propose to hang out, but they are unwilling or too lazy to make time for you. They will probably not care enough unless several people are involved that they know and enjoy spending time with. You might want to start with that fact - plan a fun group hangout for something kind of big, like a beach trip or a movie premiere (some event or activity everyone would like to really do). Invite several people in the friend circle, and let them know that others will be coming along with you. In the hangout, though others will most likely be chatting with their own close pals, you will still have the opportunity to interact with them and strengthen some of their memories with and of you. Please let me know how this works. I truly empathize with you.   Edit: In addition, if they say no to events and activities that take more time than a walk (as you mentioned in a comment earlier), they're probably worried that it might cut into their downtime that they feel they need. In this case, you should plan an event a week or a couple into the future so that they will be able to expect it and arrange their schedule physically or even subconsciously around it. And, it's pretty bullshit of them to say they'll be busy at the exact time you propose half a month into the future. Best of luck to you.     Thanks for such a detailed response. My own definition of success is not really becoming wealthy, but rather making significant contributions to future technology (designing or inventing apparatus that impact the world positively in some small way). I was wondering, do many engineers have the opportunity to invent or create something new when working for a company? Do these opportunities commonly blossom into full-fledged, successful products?    Today I was discussing what I was planning to major in with my mom (mechanical engineering), and when my dad walked in, he became incredibly upset.  As an electrical engineer in the Silicon Valley, he's worked for company after company that shut down. He sat me down and told me several things about why becoming an engineer is not a good idea whatsoever. All of it was very disheartening, and I was hoping that you, engineers, could either confirm, clarify, or offer significant examples disproving what he has told me. :   * The salary you receive as an engineer does not allow you to have a significant amount of savings. (He explained this through an example of a $90,000 starting salary and a $70,000 overall living expense - I was kind of skeptical about this one, as I'm just a high school student).  * Anyone can code or learn engineering. (He gave me examples of successful engineers that majored in something unrelated to engineering that did well in their companies; he also taught himself a majority of what he knows now).  * Working on a project in a company or creating new technology is difficult because people are not going to want to take on extra work and risk their job if it fails.   * You will not go much farther above what you started as an entry level applicant unless you work towards management, which is difficult considering you are competing with over 50 qualified coworkers or candidates.  * You will not be recognized for your work or the extra hours you put in very easily.   * Most people you will work with will be apathetic.   * When you get a job at a company, you never know if that company is truly going to succeed or run out of business. It's simply luck if you are accepted  or pick a company to work for that actually succeeds.  * Technology moves so quickly that by the time you are 30 - 40 years old, your knowledge will be outdated and the risk of losing your job will be dangerously high.   * In the end, there is no meaning to your job because you won't have the opportunity to truly be involved in decisions or significant, successful development.  * (To me:) "The very successful engineers are those who already accomplished a great deal by 15 years of age and went on to found successful companies. You have intelligence, but it's very unlikely you have anything profound. You've not done anything, otherwise I would have suggested engineering as your career." (That's funny, because he always discouraged me from learning to code or even joining my robotics team. He never gave me the chance. But it's a fair point - how do I even know I'd be good at engineering?)   I understand that some of the stuff I'm sharing with you might be offending to some engineers that take pride in their work. I was very upset to have heard all of this. I'm sorry. I just want to know whether what he has said is the hard truth or partly exaggerated or independent to his experience and his companies' environments. I want to become an aerospace engineer, a part of furthering technology to feasible space travel and colonization. I'm okay with never becoming wealthy. I'm okay with never being able to set foot on another planet or geophysical body other than Earth. I just want to help humanity get off this planet, even if I won't see it in my lifetime. I realize that this endeavor might be naive, but its the only thing that kept me alive during a rough, dark year, and what I work incredibly hard for now. I appreciate all of your responses. Thank you.       If you take two digits from 0 - 9 and add them, and then add it to the number 9, and then add the digits of the resulting number, you will get the sum of the original two digits.  It's pretty fun to do it with a digital clock.   *Laugh track plays loudly*   Witnessing, and possibly being a part of, future technological advancements.   That's the one! I didn't think it was that amazing, but I enjoyed reading some of it. It had a bit of humor and the characters were very likable.    I've been meaning to read that! I've read The Fault In Our Stars, but it didn't particularly stand out to me - I think I really enjoyed Paper Towns more.  	9
 If they're gonna do more Felicity-centric episodes, please leave romance out of it. Face her off against another hacker or explain who her dad is. Don't shove this Olicity bullshit down our throats. You've made so many improvements, Diggle gets a costume, Oliver is becoming the fun loving not-so-dark Green Arrow (to silence the Batman critics), we've got Speedy, and Star City. Please don't ruin all the endless possibilities with more Olicity, keep their romance on the down-low, make it subtle. Last season they were episodes where over 50% of it was Olicity romance and/or Felicity being emotional   I think just having a green hood, is considered honouring Yao Fei, to Oliver.  So i'd say it's all good.   Nobody... I mean nobody... loves Olicity more than Marc Guggenheim.  andnbsp;  I have hope for her, I just don't want Marc calling all the shots anymore, Olicity was overused and abused last season.    I was hoping maybe she could turn Felicity into a stronger role... or at least less of what we saw in Season 3.      I'm currently still working on the first chapter, but I am posting it on fanfiction.net, which I think is the most populated fanfiction site, so it should get a lot of reviews and whatnot.   andnbsp;  My mom wants to get me into a writers workshop or something, I'm not to thrilled about it because I have poor social skills but I think I might just do it because I've never really pursued anything I've loved to a full extent before.   Wendy Miracle is now the co-show runner, I think...  But she said she really wants to work on the strong female roles and Diggle. I think the show has always done well with Diggle but I have hope that we can see a Season 1/2-ish Felicity or an even better Felicity this season, and Laurel will finally be as badass as Sara.    I thought Deathbolt was the first external meta-human sighting, or do they mean outside of the U.S.?   Yea cuz Jay Garrick is coming in Episode 2 I believe, to warn them.   Caitlin Snow leaving Team Flash, I can't control myself...   Frost is coming....  Cobalt is coming.....  Zoom is coming......  andnbsp;  Edit: Oh and Jay Garrick and Wally West too....of course.   Cisco please save us and create a bad ass costume for [Diggle with a shield](http://i.imgur.com/ZZxEPzm.jpg)   I can't take all this news ;~; Im so excited       My body is flopping around like a fish out of water. I'm so excited.   of course he's watching it for comic book action  he just told you.    This is a TV adaptation of a superhero comic book.   Candice has a better booty from different angles, but I have a huge crush on Willa Holland soo... I gotta give it to Willa.   I don't think that's Danielle Panabaker, unless that's not the Danielle you meant.   You mean [this??](https://youtu.be/xckcs2qCGQU?t=8h49m5s)    :') I'm new here, but I wish you the best. We're all on the journey and depression is just a roadblock.   Damn, and I just posted something that mentions that I've lost interest in my religion. Hopefully I don't get flooded with PM's cuz in my current state of emotion... i guess you could call it, I don't really need that in my life.   That would work.... if Ronnie Raymond was a villain. Maybe Barry can make a move on Ronnie and get Caitlin jealous. #Plotforce   It wasn't Olicity that ruined Arrow, it was Felicity in Season 3 that ruined Arrow.  But that page does bring up a good point, about how Olicity shippers spew out false statistics.   b-but.... Season 2 was the best season.   *"Please tell me you're not actually having this conversation right now."* ~ Felicity Smoak   nvm found it -.-"   How do you rewatch it if you missed?   Is AO3 like FFN where it resets the draft expiring timer if you go in and edit?   and look at his username too, that's so badass, but now it's wasted on a useless petition. :\   someone already posted this. :P  But it is Diggle.. so a repost wouldn't hurt.   I might just do that, post on all 3 sites. I'm no where close to finished, idek know how many chapters I want, I feel like I could go on forever, I'll stay on Wattpad for now then gradually move to the other sites.   This is not only a question for me, but if anyone has the same question, I think we should all help each other out with it.  andnbsp;  My fanfiction is about the tv series Arrow and The Flash (I guess Supergirl as well), where would be the best place to post this, I don't think Wattpad would be good because it's most popular fanfics are like One Direction stuff. I think you can keep updating your fanfic on FFnet and can release it in chapters. But I don't know if you can post pictures in your story like on AO3. I'm just really confused as to where to post it. I want to use AO3 but can I post my story chapter by chapter? and keep going back to edit it? Without it expiring?   andnbsp;  I know my question was all over the place -.-"   Nah, I think it was revenge for when he shocked Oliver on the island, when Slade was on the walkie talkie with Sara negotiating the Hendrick for Oliver deal.   Don't you fucking say it.. groddamnit!!      HOLY SHIT The sky is blue!   Here is a [clearer version of the preview](http://imgur.com/a/5VHEP)  	35
 I want to wear a pip-boy like the irredeemable nerd I am.  	1
 You will get the old back you, I promise that. Actually, you'll be an even stronger person.  Have you been diagnosed with depression?   This game has destroyed my life, it's like crack. I throw my phone down in frustration and then pick it straight back up and start playing again.    Not a single member of my fathers side of the family have died of anything but cancer for 40 years. My mothers side almost everyone has suffered with a stroke. Waiting game for which one I guess    His god damn dimples. They let him get away with murder at times.    What a silly comment to make, I've been there as well, it's peaceful in the shower. You got up even though it was the hardest thing you've ever had to do, baby steps?    I also say try not to understand all the time, I have 'clarity days' where I'm open and I will listen to people suggestions and good things that have happened.   When I'm down and beating myself up, there's nothing I want more than a 'yeah you are going through a really shit time' if they try and tell me how to feel better or good things that have happened I feel like they aren't listening and get frustrated and angry. Sometimes I just need someone to acknowledge that what I'm going through and what I'm saying is shit, but they are there regardless of the shitness.    I agree, just knowing someone is there but not expecting anything of me, makes me feel safe. I get scared of being on my own because I can be so dark but I struggle with basic interaction at times so there's nothing better than someone knowing you need them but not expecting anything of you other than your presence    I'm from the uk and I paid about £20 for 16 stencils. Which can be used again if you're careful, but I'm not   Ah! I just order mine from eBay, they were really cheap :)   That's true :) thank you. I hope they are okay though    I can't remember normal pooping it's been so long...heh heh   This user has been deleted :( that worries me so much.   This user has been deleted :( that worries me so much   I hear people talk about pooping or read or see a meme and my first thought is 'I wish I normal pooped just once'   The life of an IBS sufferer is shit, pun intended.    I bought mine from a local Asian shop because they sell big packs :)   Expensive?   	16
 To be fair, their account is 14 hours old.    How come the link changed though, or is it me?   Anyway. In case you did not understand my comment, I was talking about how people view the second world war. Generations 55 y.o to ~30 y.o look at it and think "We fucked up real good let's never forget". People younger look at it like the rest of the world does: "That was fucked up." They don't associate it with themselves personally, they see it as the past.   Kind of like North America feels about what happened to the Natives, how England/US feel about the triangular slave trade, how Japan feels about what they've done throughout their history. It's not that they don't give a shit. They don't care as much. It's not their responsibility. The past is the past.  It doesn't mean Germans don't protest about anything. It doesn't mean they stay home and sip ~~tea~~ beer with headphones on so they don't hear about the outside world. But compared to a country like the US, and like Canada, they are quite passive. Again, COMPARATIVELY, since it is what the other guy and me were doing. Man, Angela Merkel herself is passive, and that's one of the reasons why she is liked so much! - not my opinion, the opinions of native Germans who love/hate her both say she is passive.      Thanks! And actually no! It was a family friend. My mother went to New York to give birth, and this lady welcomed us while we lived there for a couple of months : )   I don't remember saying Germans don't give a fuck but okay.    I was given a pillow when I was born. Nineteen years later, I still have it. It must have been the most disgusting pillow when I was younger: drool, baby spit, vomit. My grandmother actually used to rip it apart apart to clean it inside out, then sows it back.   I think I'll keep it until the day I die. I literally cannot fall asleep without it.   You're talking about people who lived the war. I'm talking about the generations after. Like 55 and less. They never complain and when you hear them talk, they act as if the war was their fault. Before moving to Germany, I had a German language teacher who would do just that. She never complained despite having a not so great life, she believes in hard work, and she speaks of the war like she single handedly did it. Then, I moved to Germany and everyone her age is the same. So is the generation after. But 20 year olds and less don't behave the same. They don't care as much. To them, the past is the past. But to generations after the war, the past is a huge lesson and they shall never forget about it.  Maybe it's a matter of perspective. But then the Germans I met so far were all "Yeah we're like that."   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klzZG7hmlh0  Yas, African pop!    There's this syndrome or disorder called Pica, which is when a person has bad cravings for inedible/non-digestible things. Sometimes it's completely mental (the taste or texture is therapeutic), sometimes it can be a sign of a certain deficiency, or it can be a sign of another physical problem. In my case, it is most probably anemia. I have it and so does my mother who had intense cravings for dirt and clay. She eventually got over it and I'm waiting for my turn haha    Yeah I've noticed, and I agree it can be frustrating (but I'm North American as well so yeah I'm used to complaining).   But yeah. It's culture. America was a country built by people complaining and wanting more. Germany was ruined by people complaining and wanting more.   Germans know they have it good, and last time they complained about their situation, see what happened? Except for younger kids, you'll notice older Germans have a tendency to just. Not say anything. Because that's what they were taught to do after the war. Just shut up, be ashamed, and work hard towards greatness without bothering anyone else.   Exactly what I was thinking. You can't just go around and call Germany "uncivilized" (I think you mean to use another term because civilized means something else) when nearly the entire planet is worse.    Then damn. No one on this planet is! If you're going to complain about Germany being a bad country, I don't know where else you're gonna enjoy life.    I'm asexual, schizoid and I have social anxiety (just so you can see what kind of failure I'm heading towards), but I am sort of infatuated with this person. I haven't talked to them in probably a year, but they just reactivated their Facebook account and I kind of want to talk to them. Our last conversation was short lived: I sent something, they read it, and I never heard from them since (they deactivated their account few days later). Except, I don't know if it's going to be worth it. Should I risk panic attacks and disappointment or stay in my lane?    "not civilized" what??   I eat raw flour. It started off as a random thing I did (I baked a cake, and for it to look good, I sprinkled flour over it because I did not have powder sugar). Then, I actually tasted the thing. Been hooked ever since, and I cannot seem to stop.  I can easily eat 6 pounds a week. Though now, it's more like one pound every two weeks (which I am really happy with).   Bruh fried chicken is the bomb.com when it comes to emotional eating. You feel so full and so satisfied because of the crispy juicy yumminess you just devoured. Then your body gets ready to evacuate all of it and then you experience a second instance of pure blissfulness. Your body just empties itself completely, without too much effort from your part.   I don't know if fried chicken does the same to everyone.    I'm an au-pair in Germany, and I moved from Canada! :D  I've moved once before, from the West Indies to Canada (okay maybe once more from the US but I was 2 months old and it doesn't count I guess).   If you have money, you're fine. It's not so hard. Unless you're super susceptible to feeling homesick.   ** But an au-pair contract, usually, lasts 1 year. Meaning you've known for max. 8 months? Are you considering moving with someone you barely know in a totally foreign country? You have to consider the worst case scenario.     Same. I thought I was odd for the longest time, and thought maybe I had not reached sexual maturity, despite hitting 'official' puberty (I'm a girl) at age 9. At some point, I thought I was gay? Because while in high school, girls would go through their "Want to have sex with anything that smells like a man" phase, and I was sitting here, wondering what's for lunch. Though ironically, I went to an all-girl school and never felt sexually attracted to any classmates either. I was, however, platonically in love with so many people, and I started reading tons about it. Then, I learned there was a difference between romantic and platonic (I had never heard the word platonic before age 13), and I started differentiating the romantic attractions from the platonic ones. But it never clicked to me that it could be a sexual orientation, until I saw the word asexual.   I'm extremely thankful!    And by the way, I am not trying to give you a label. I don't care about it. If you're queer, high five! If you're asexual, doubld high five! If you're cis ajd straight, high five!   What bothers me is that you do not seem to want to understand what sexuality is. And in the world we live in, ignorance by choice is no excuse.    You have to keep repeating it because you think sexuality is a choice or something you choose. Which it isn't. Youre saying the same thing homophobes have been preaching for years. Those words are the reason why homosexuals and other queers are oppressed, even persecuted in some part of this world. Because people dont think it's something you are born as. If you can't accept it as truth, then you're putting yourself in whatever trouble you're having. No one can help you but yourself.  Have a good day.   I don't know you, but you said you were asexual. Now either you at or you are not. You act like it's a decision you took, or a consequence of how you were raised, when it's just your body that was born  this way or not.  Replace that with race. Say you were black, but you really want to be white. Wouldn't that be ridiculous? Everyone would tell you to embrace your blackness, no matter how white you feel. Same with sexual orientation. So if you're asexual, just accept it. Don't try to be something you are not. If you are not asexual, don't say you are or you were.   Plus this is Casual Conversation. Almost anything goes.   But you talk about sexual orientation like it's a religion. A person cannot be raised straight. They are gay in a mostly straight world. Like transgenders are trans in a cis world, and asexuals are who they are in a sexual world. You aren't raised into your sexual orientation. You are or you are not.  And people who are not straight all go through this "This isn't right. I should change" phase because we are a minority. It's worse for asexuals because very few know it's actually a thing. You shouldn't suppress your sexuality in no case at all. Whether it's because your family doesn't approve, your country, or yourself. That just brings unhappiness and misery for no reason.   He looks and sounds like a stereotypical slaveowner. This is creepy as hell and kind of insulting.    But you don't need to grow from being asexual. It's not a personality type. It's a sexual orientation. You are it from the moment you are born (okay, let's say from the moment you are supposed to be sexually mature), to the day you die. Asexuality doesn't mean you're a virging either, and it doesn't mean you hate sex. It just means you don't feel a need for it, and you don't look at someone and think "Hot damn! I'd tap that!"  Instead of changing yourself, learn how to enjoy how you are right now. Being asexual is not so bad. Maybe it gets lonely since so few people are like this, but thank goodness we live in the 21st century. If you want to meet someone who will be comfortable with your sexual orientation, you can! Internet is great!   Don't try to change your sexual orientation. It's part of who you are, and just embrace it.    I .... I do!   On a more serious (not so serious) note though. It's crazy how many other asexuals I've been meeting lately. I think in the last couple of years, I met between five and ten, which to me is quite a lot! I always felt quite secluded, but now not so much. Though I've been meeting these people on the internet so I guess in real life, it will be impossible to find someone asexual (plus you can't just be like "So ... you asexual or nah?"    I am not sure, actually. I used to live in a city where electricity is extremely cheap, so it did not affect us (aka, my mother never complained about her bills being too high, which says a lot). However I think it does consume quite a lot of electricity so it would be better to use it in moderation, instead of letting it run 24/7.   Looks like we have the same target. I've been planning an elaborate scheme to murder the sun as well.   Buy one of those AC things you can just put on your window, and voila! Or find a basement and squat it until September.    If you live in a big city where there is a great transportation system (preferably a metro system), you could do this. Take the metro, start on the first station of a specific line, and exit at each metro station and just walk around until you find 1) something to eat (no restaurant chains), 2) something to watch/explore (movie, museum, street performances, a old abandoned building, whatever), and 3) something odd (preferably cheap) to buy. Then, find your way back to that same metro station, and go back home. You follow the same metro line and every day, you go to the next station, until you've done them all. Obviously, some stations will lead you to a boring neighborhood, some stations may be situated in the same area as a couple of others, so you don't have to do one station a day. Plus there is obviously no restrictions in how much you can eat, or see, or buy.   I think it's a nice way to explore your city. It sounds weird, and it really depends on where you live. It would work wonders in NYC, for instance, or Paris, but not in a little village 300 km away from the biggest city in Wisconsin, or something (nothing against Wisconsin). And it's not for everyone. It's really for those who like urban exploring.   Good luck! : )  ** by metro, I also mean subway.    Thanks, son.   I am listening to an edited version of Intro by the xx. : )   I am thankful for your obsession with me. It's like I'm alive again.    Meh. No need for me to stay strong. It's a rather effortless thing. :)   I've never had so much attention in my life LET ME ENJOY MY MOMENT   I feel blessed.    Boy why are you so obsessed with me though?  Sad to see you think that my comments on tourism had anything to do with politics though.   Haven't yet, and never will! *asexual high five with myself *   Hey! I have felt the same way!  I have literally been in school since the age of 2 (yes, school. not daycare or preschool), and I decided to take a gap year from College last December, few weeks before my 19th birthday. Not only have I found something I really wanted to do for a year, I was also tired of that same meaningless routine. Also, since I'm not a summer person, I never felt really rejoiced to go back to school in the autumn after 2 or 3 months of utter misery. Now, almost six months later, I can't wait to go back to uni next year.   Sometimes, you just have to take a break. Take a break and reconsider what you want to do. I don't suddenly love school, but at least now I sort of have a reason to go through it. I have life goals, as opposed to going to college in order to please my parents.   Not saying school is for everyone, but I can understand it being quite overwhelming, and the best remedy for some is to take some good time off.    Hello! I am currently an au-pair in Germany. I'm an American from Canada, and I've been overseas for a little over four months now.  First things first. You should NOT become an au-pair if you just want to travel. This is a huge no-no. If childcare is not a priority, you will find your year very long. Also, if childcare is not something you like, the family and the children will notice it quickly, and they may not like that very much. As opposed to what you may think, you do not have that much time nor resources to travel. So unless you bring tons of cash with you, chances are you are not going to be leaving your country as often as you please. If traveling is all you want, then I recommend trying other things like backpacking, couch surfing (which is not really a great idea when you're a girl traveling alone) or a student exchange trip.  That aside. Personally I did not choose an agency, since I did not have the mean to pay for one. I used [Aupair World](http://aupair-world.net) and I believe it's just as good. You create your profile for free, and when you're ready, you can start looking for families. You can choose to have families that matches your profile to show, or you can search through all families. Some criteria they will ask you to fill are: location, city size (or village), time period, date, number of children, single parent or not, etc. While looking for families, there will be people with tons of pictures and informations on their profiles, some with very few. However, not everyone without a picture or not much information is being fraudulent. Sometimes, parents are just not comfortable putting pictures of their children online, and that's okay. Once you find a family you are interested in, or a family has contacted you, start asking 'preliminary questions'. Here's a list of possible things you may ask during that first contact.  ["Getting to know each other" from Aupair World](https://www.aupair-world.net/how_to/questions_host_family)  ["Which questions should I ask my host family?" from Aupair World](https://www.aupair-world.net/news/question_of_the_week/question_of_the_week_41)  ["Interviewing: What questions should Au Pairs ask Families?" from Aupair Mom](http://aupairmom.com/interviewing-what-questions-should-au-pairs-ask-families/2010/08/18/celiaharquail/)  ["3 Questions an Au Pair should ask YOU to make a good match." from Aupair Mom](http://aupairmom.com/3-questions-an-au-pair-should-ask-you-to-make-a-good-match/2009/10/22/celiaharquail/)  ["AU PAIR QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR FUTURE HOST FAMILY" from Speaking Denglish](http://www.speaking-denglish.com/ifbuttsarchive/au-pair-questions-ask-future-host-family/)  Then, if you're still interested, schedule a Skype interview or a phone call. Obviously a Skype interview is more reliable, since you see the people. During that Skype interview, you can go through more specific questions, some you can find in the links provided.   If you do not feel safe, you can always request a background check. I think many people will give you one since they understand that moving to a foreign country is a huge risk.   If you are coming to Europe, chances are you will have to take language courses, and normally the host family will have to pay for it (or a portion of it). And again, yo said you wanted to work in Europe. Well, being an au-pair is a job! It's not something you do on the side. You have to dedicate yourself to it. So it will be your job! However some au-pairs take jobs on the side, but then if you truly want to travel as well, not sure you'll have time for that. Also, some countries may not allow you to take a part-time job. It depends on the type of visa the country requires for Au-pairs. For instance Germany has an au-pair visa, and you are not allowed to do any other work with that visa.  All in all, reconsider the reasons why you want to be an au-pair. It is extremely fun, but childcare is the most important aspect of it. You will be working for a family, and not just left to do whatever, whenever. Also, your pay will be quite low. Of course, everything is paid for but you might want to think about budgeting, and not blowing your money on traveling all the time. Lastly, fix your schedule after you've find a match. Nothing says you will have the time required to accomplish everything you want. Being an au-pair is probably 30% traveling, 20% staying local, and 50% childcare.    I feel the same way! But not just about my appearance, but my name as well. It's hard to explain but like you said, when I see myself in pictures or in a mirror, I tend to think "I am that person." When I see my name, I think "(Name) is the name I have." rather than "My name is ..." I don't feel 'attached' to neither. I just bear those characteristics, if that makes any sense.   I know a girl who was asked if she could change anything about her appearance, what it would be. She said she was happy with how she looked, and she got insulted.   If you want to visit Quebec but you don't feel comfortable speaking French, go to Montreal! You can live there without speaking French, sometimes even without speaking English (you'll find your people, eventually). It is why the rest of Quebec sees Montreal as problematic because Quebec wants to be 100% French, then you have Montreal that's struggling to find its identity, still. But I think in a way, Montreal's identity is to not have just one. It's not English-Canadian, it's not French-Canadian either. It's a mix a both, with the perfect amount of foreign. And it's perfect (biased opinion, but seriously Montreal is perfect).   Oh wow, that sounds interesting actually. I don't know much about the dynamics between American states, but I didn't think Texas and Arizona would match.   Canada ... hmmm. I think from BC to Ontario, they would be together. Simply because provinces between BC and Ontario would be like "yeah sure whatever man." about it haha. Quebec would be on its own, but Montreal would be pissed because it would much rather be with Ontario. The Maritimes would probably stick together, then the Territories would be together as well ... but that's coming from someone who lived in Montreal haha. I think Montrealers, people from Vancouver and Toronto kinda think higher of their cities? And see the rest of Canada as empty and without any personality haha. So yeah. My opinion is wrong.    Mine is pretty uncommon, though sometime in 2009 I learned that it was more used in India as a last name. I don't mind it though. However, I don't know why but I don't feel attached to my name at all. I barely refer to myself as it, I don't encourage people to use it (it makes me extremely uncomfortable). So much so, that the last children I took care of never knew my name. If you want to catch my attention, do whatever it takes, but don't use my name. Please.    Nah Canada is way too massive to be alike from province to province. Look at Russia. It goes from [this](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/01/article-2211028-154A7685000005DC-688_634x475.jpg) to [this](https://photos.travelblog.org/Photos/85670/690348/f/6763602-Nenets-child-Nadym-Region-Siberia-0.jpg), and through thousands of other cultures. Same with Canada, though most of the country is westernized so the difference is not as shocking as Russia. But still. For instance, Alberta is like the Texas of Canada. If you were to go to Ontario, you'd be in the 'pretty much American' province (provided that you stay between Toronto and Windsor). Then Quebec is like the troubled province, because it has Montreal that is pretty much Toronto's little sibling, but the rest of the province is relatively traditional.   And don't worry. Hockey is literally everywhere in Canada. I guess that's the only thing the whole country has in common.    awn puh-lease :')   Nope, however I do have a bad case of "How do I school these ~~dense ass~~ kids!"   Yes, I am passionate about North Korea, but I don't care if someone doesn't want to go there or not. However, if you're gonna give bullshit reasons, I sure as hell will tell you those reasons are bullshit. I don't understand why people from the Western World are so self-righteous about what they consider right or wrong. Like shit. If you're going to another country, there are laws you may not be used to and may not agree with, but they're there and just fucking respect them. Like if you go to Saudi Arabia, don't be stupid and drive up to the Mecca without being Muslim. If you're in Iran, don't be dumb and walk in a Mosque with your shoes on. You will get in deep shit trouble if break those rules, and honestly you'll deserve it because you had the opportunity to know about those rules, and you chose not to respect them.   If you think dumb tourists being arrested and being treated like shit is enough reason not to go to a country, you're basically saying you can't help but be dumb, or you're better than those rules and shall not abide to them. Which is just stupid.    I didn't read it so I don't know, but slavery is slavery. No one had it better, no one has it worse. Slavery is never a choice, either. Either you were forced into it, or you had no choice but to go through it (that or death). It has always happened and it is still happening (and will probably always happen). I have no time for people comparing themselves at all.    Are you serious? Your examples are of people who literally broke Korean laws. Religion is illegal in North Korea. Who is dumb enough to bring a damn bible? Who is dumb enough to do anything religious in North Korea, when it is KNOWN to be illegal?  And you said it. VETERAN OF THE KOREAN WAR. He fought in the war that made North Korea miserable. You think they'll welcome him with opens arms?? Those people are idiots! They should know better! Like a journalist who goes to North Korea and gets arrested should know better.   If you examples are of people who, despite many sources out there that explicitly explains the rules and laws of North Korea, decided to go anyway knowing they will break a few of them, I don't understand you. Maybe you know you're that type of dumb. If yes, then good. Stay away.    Once upon a time, me back in summer of 2014, I was bored and I taught myself cyrillic, mostly thanks to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIKX9RYOX5w). Then for a semester, I had Russian lessons. I thought I wanted to learn Russian but turns out I only like how it looks and how it sounds. : )   English written in cyrillic!   Let's see if someone here can read cyrillic. ; )   Hey! I live in Germany, and have been nice early February. It's quite a great country, though obviously it varies from city to city, and from person to person.    Due to my natural hair texture, it will probably remain shoulder-lentgh. However, I've been loving long hair on men. Oh my! 😍😍   It's not a matter of disagreeing, it's a matter of being dramatic over nothing.   The regime will not do anything to you! We don't live in medieval times, not even North Korea. You're a foreigner. They can't just do anything they please with you, unless "you ask for it". Plus you will be in contact with normal Koreans because most are normal. There are probably more normal people there than wherever you live in now. The not normals are high ranking officials, and there's no way in hell you'd be given the opportunity to meet any of them.   When was the last time you heard about a tourist who did nothing wrong, but who got sent in prison by North Korea? Never happened, and never will. North Koreans are not stupid!    Hello, friend! Looks like we have one major thing in common!   I daydream too! And I absolutely would love to have them in a more concrete form. I used to write, but for some reason I was not satisfied. I am not quite a 'word' person. I like to see. My wish as a child was to be good at drawing so I could concretize those dreams, but I never really put the required effort into it. However the game series Sims helped me a lot when it came to turning those fantasies into reality. I have been playing these games since 2006, I believe, but I left all my Sims 3 game back home (I moved). Right now I'm in dire need of playing the game.  Do your alternative realities/lives somehow follow your everyday life? For instance, if you're unhappy 'in real life' does your alternate self or someone from your alternate realities feel the same way? Also, good to hear it doesn't affect your work!    Here's the problem when people look at North Korea. People think that every single North Koreans is like Kim Jong Un. Most of those you will meet are people just trying to get by. Work during the day, find a nice meal at home in the evening. Guides and escorts are the same. They are not dicks. Therefore, they are not trying to get you in trouble, since they will get in trouble as well. Unless they are actual dicks but there won't be more people trying to purposely get you in trouble in Korea than in your neighborhood.   Also, maybe you've been watching older videos, because since 2010, North Koreans have been really cool with Americans (law-wise. It's easier to get in). Plus of course they'll talk about how North Korea beat America, and how America sucks. That's their job! They have to say this, or they get fired (or worse!) They aren't trying to frame you. Worst case scenario, they absolutely do not give two shit about you (but many will actually be nice and eager to talk to you, since many are fascinated by the West).   Lastly, do not watch videos from journalists in disguise. Journalists have a tendency to make things sound horrible, when nothing out of the ordinary is happening. Watch people filming their vacations instead.    Nah it didn't suck. It is interesting and very informative. However, TIL (and most of Reddit, tbh) is very selective of what gets to the front page. I mean. The most random things get the most attention, while actual informative things barely make it (unless it's the news). If you go to the 'new' section of AskReddit, many very interesting topics get buried immediately because Reddit is full of kids who just want to 'lolz' for a few seconds, or find the most irrelevant details worth mentioning.   But oh well. Not your fault. We can talk about it here, though! :D   No. She was ugly. Hideous. A real monster. Had to cover her face with toilet paper to make sure I didn't puke in our mouths.    Oh wow I didn't know that. So interesting! Thanks a lot!    What?! Where do you live? Poor you! Let's patiently wait for September and that comforting chilly wind!    No. The thing is, no one but yourself will know if you've followed the brigading or not. What outsiders can know for a fact though, is that OP posted on another subreddit about a post she made on TIL. Obviously some people will upvote that post only because of this reason. Whether it applies to you personally or not doesn't really matter.    Me neither, but I think people who go on 'new' often would.  I understand what OP wanted, but eh. It wasn't going to work. So many TIL get posted every hour, so few reach the front page. Plus usually those that make it to the front page are things very few people actually know. While Black people fighting in wars is very well known ... just not mentioned enough.    No, because you wouldn't have voted after seeing this post asking to upvote the other one.   I totally understand, and it is something I hate about our culture. If you're sad because your phone died, you are allowed to be. If you're sad because they put pepperoni when you asked for sausages on your pizza, you are totally allowed to be devastated and to cry about it. Now if you're going to consciously give yourself problems in order to have your sadness validated, um, no. Don't.    I never said you had an awesome life, I said if you want to be anhedonic or 'invisible', then you are not by default. So you're already in a better place than those who feel this way on a daily basis.   Also, I am not making victims out of everyone, you want to victimize yourself for no damn reason. I was relatively okay with being in a terrible situation, accepting it more and more everyday, until you (amongst others) decided to make a game out of it.   Also, it is a negative thing when you go though it, without choosing to be so, on a daily basis. It can be positive for others, and it's okay! But you treating it like some type of fun activity to do when you're bored is insulting to those who cannot go through it.  And that other user saying is a game is just as infuriating as you are.   So you're telling me, in order to understand someone who is anorexic for instance, you'll starve for days? Then when you can't take it anymore, you'll sob over a burger and tell that friend "Omg! I didn't eat for two days! Omg I couldn't do it and I cried! I so missed Mc Donald's!!" Do you think that friend will be a friend any longer?   I am appalled. I hope you're young and that you mature up a little.    Makes sense! That last bit is actually quite fascinating, since the same happens with French! Canadian French is apparently closer to 'original' French, than French French is! Well, maybe not original. But the educated or the Royals spoke like modern-day French Canadians (accent-wise), apparently.    That's what I've noticed, too. It's like humans have a built-in martyr complex. Of course, happiness is subjective. However, people who know they're lucky and in a good place, who do not have to go through "uncalled for unhappiness and hardship" always want to try to be unfortunate. Lately, it's been crazy! People trying to be homeless for a day, people trying to be a racial minority for a day, people trying to 'have' mental disorders for a day ... and that last one pisses me off out of everything. If you call out someone for being insulting by trying to be, for instance, anorexic, you'll have countless of people who agree with you because it's so obviously insulting to those who are suffering from anorexia. But when it comes to psychological problems, everyone is like "Eh ... get over it??? They're just trying to feel for you and understand you???"    You are so wrong.  First of all, if you think trying to be like someone who is going through something negative is just "trying something new", you have no empathy. You are doing it for yourself.   Second, if you think calling someone a war refugee is insulting and outrageous, you are either just being ridiculous or you have no idea what the word war and/or refugee mean.  No. You do not need to go through what I am going through to know empathy. You do not need to starve in order to feel for a starving person. You do not need to purposely cut in order to feel for someone who self arms. You do not need to paint yourself black and walk in an all-white neighborhood to know what racism is. You have ears, or eyes, so you can understand what people who go through this EVERY DAY have to say about it. Also, it is NOT a choice for those people. So you choosing to go through it is insulting, because you can just stop whenever. While those people cannot stop.  If you need to live something in order to feel empathy, then you're no so empathic. Obviously you won't fully understand something until you go through it yourself, but empathy can be felt without being able to fully relate.   I was insulted because you wanted to feel what it's like to live my life 'for fun'. Which, I could tell you. Just ask me! You did it one night, didn't like it, and now you're back to your normal self, like nothing happened. I'm stuck in this miserable life until the day I die. Do you think it's cool to hear about someone who did it "for fun"?? When I didn't chose it? Really????    Same! But I think it's because the British English, being the original, is heavily influenced by French, and since we speak French, we naturally prefer that spelling because it makes more sense?    Oh lord. You've triggered the bitter old lady in me.  Why would you want to feel this way? I don't understand the fascination with going through something negative. I don't know if I'm the only one, but it pisses me off. Like people who want to make those social experiments by wearing a hijab for a day to see what it's like to feel racism, or those who purposely put themselves in a negative situation to feel what it's like to be depressed or whatever. What bothers me is when those people are in a good situation, and they put themselves in a bad situation they can just snap out of. Just for fun. And it's like ... ugh! I don't know. It's most probably envy. But man does it piss me off.   No need to actually experience something, people who go through it can tell you just fine. I can understand wanting to have a first hand experience, but then we're talking about difficulties of people. Could you imagine if someone came up with a "find out what it feels like to be a war refugee!" experiment? How outrageous and insulting it would be? It's the same with most people who feel anhedonic, people with depression, lonely people, asocial people, etc. Plus hey, we can't just snap out of it, so trust us. We know what it's like, and we have lots to tell you about.    Same! When I first started speaking English (I lived in Canada), I did not know different English had different spellings. What's worse with Canada though is that it uses both!    French being my first language, orthography is a little more strict. We have those 'special' characters, like the 'cédille' (  ¸ ), the 'tréma' ( ¨ ), the 'accents' like 'aigu' ( ´ ), the 'grave' ( ` ) and the 'circonflexe' ( ^ ).   When I turned 13, I started writing full words again, but I would always omit these characters because I was lazy haha. For instance, this sentence: La tronçonneuse a découpé le seul arbre à thé de l’île thaïlandaise (the saw cut the only tea tree of the thai island).   I would write it like: la tronconneuse a decoupe le seul arbre a the de lile thailandaise.  I would also omit apostrophes, and some of those words that end with -é, I would end them with -er because it's the same sound.   I think at the age of 15 and to this day, I tried my best to go as far as writing those characters, check my grammar, use my punctuation properly, etc.   I like writing well, though lately I've been into some abbreviations like ngl (not gonna lie), nbg (no big deal), irl (in real life). But I'm most probably going write "If I recall correctly" instead of IIRC, or "As soon as possible" instead of ASAP.   And my grammar sucks in all languages as speak. :(   Most words in English that have double letters. And ironically (since my first language is French), many borrowed words from French. Sometimes the spelling is different, sometimes not. So I have to guess.    I'm huge on astronomy, but I'm no scientist so bear with me.   There is a theory called panspermia, that basically says what you did (but in a a less hollywood-like fashion). Basically, life could have started on another planet, Mars being the best candidate since young Mars used to be like Earth as we know it. Basically, the first organisms that were 'alive' might have been from Mars, and then meteors, asteroids, etc. that have hit Mars, could have brought with them some of those organisms. That same theory also suggests that comets might have been what have brought water to Earth by hitting it (since they are made of ice), and maybe they had living organisms on them as well.  Panspermia doesn't only concern Earth and Mars, it concerns the entire Universe. But since Earth is the only planet we know has life, and Mars is the only planet nearby we know that could have carried life, the theory seems to fit our situation the best.   Panspermia is less fantastic, since we're talking about tiny organisms. Not life as we would imagine it to be. Also, we're talking about billions of years, so a movie about that would either be too long, or too edited. Can you imagine "100 million years later, those Martian organisms are swimming in what we'll later know as The Pacific Ocean'."   32 is terrible! Here today it was 24 and I was so unhappy about it. I waited until 6 pm to get outside haha. I am really looking forward to Tuesday. 16 degrees only!  One thing I love about the city I'm in is that it's dry. I used to live in a very humid place. 30 degrees usually meant feeling like it's 40+. Terrible.    Not a career, and not even considered a job for some ... but I'm an au-pair.   In exchange of free boarding in a foreign country, an au-pair take care of children. Usually young people (mostly girls) who wish to travel for cheap opt for that option. Also as an au-pair, you do get a salary but it's the absolute minimum since everything you need is provided. On average, a contract lasts a year, but some families only need someone for a few months. An au-pair may renew their contract with a family or find someone else in the same country. The only country that does not allow renewal of au-pair contracts/visa is Germany. You cannot stay there, as an au-pair, for more than a year (however, some au-pairs get a student visa instead, and are then considered 'roommates' to the host family, rather than working for them).   I love childcare. It is something I always wanted to do, and I've been doing it on and off (unfortunately, I also have social anxiety so getting a childcare job was impossible). My number reason to become an au-pair was for the childcare part. It felt much easier to get a job as one. Also, I desperately wanted to spend time away from my family. Third reason was to be in Germany, since I've been learning German in college.   If I could, I would honestly renew my contract with the family I'm with, until their child turns 6 and goes to school full time. Or if they decide to have more children, I'd stick around until the last one turns 6. Obviously I can't, unless I choose to get a student visa. It's not easy though. One, I'd need to get into school, which is not easy as a foreigner. Two, my german suck. Second problem is that it's obviously not my choice. Maybe they would want someone else next year anyway.    Actually most often than not, I see characters that get out of bad situations because they are skilled. And that annoys me. Of course, some may be skilled, but the random pizza delivery guy who lives with a blind cat cannot, in any way, know how to perfectly assemble a gun, aim and shoot a guy running faster than Usain Bolt.  To be fair, I don't watch much TV and the only shows I can remember are police or detective shows.    Years ago, I read an article about how it doesn't change color (I mean, you can be born with green eye and then by age 10, they're gray then by age 20, they're brown, but eyes should not change color every day). What changes is the amount of light that reflects off of it, that gets absorbed (etc.), angles, the size of your pupil, and also perception from one individual to the other.   That was many years ago because some kid in High School said their eyes changed depending on their mood. I'll need to update my researches though.    I recommend this, too! Though personally I hate the heat, summer, the sun, etc. so I don't walk anymore. I take the train though. Yesterday, I bought pizza and I just sat on the train until the very end. Then I went to the opposite terminus, and then back home again. I had a good meal, it was a great opportunity to people watch, I reached the airport as well (though it's not that busy of an airport, so I saw no takeoff or landings :( )  It's the best.    Never said you should, either.    Because they are good-hearted people.   They go through hell but still wake up every morning and respect their duties. Rebellions are relatively rare, and their sense of discipline and hard work is impeccable. Have you seen an Arirang Show? Do google/youtube it. It's incredible. It's all manmade! The West barely does half of this with all the technology we have. Imagine if they were given technology, what they would do.  They also have a remarkable sense of sharing. It's probably because of the situation they are in, and they have no choice but to be altruistic.   And lastly, they are the most sensible people you'll ever meet. Given their situation, I can understand how they end up being extremely empathic, but they really are.   Obviously, not every single Korean is like that. Someone who has it relatively good will probably not be empathic and altruistic. Which explains why the leaders suck so much. Also, I can understand how it is so easy for the leader of North Korea to keep his people 'in check', given they value hard work, obedience and discipline so much. Add fear to the mix and you're almost guaranteed to keep your dictatorship intact.    Yes. You can only go to North Korea to have a guided tour. I think you can stay in your hotel if you wish though? So I guess if you don't want a guide, stay in the hotel. But you'll be bored: Korean TV is mostly propaganda, some hotels have karaokes but that gets old pretty quickly, some hotels have internet, others don't, and hotels are mostly empty, and the staff may not want to chill with you since that's not their job, and they're being supervised. Plus you won't be allowed to go outside, so it'll be a waste of money.  However, nothing says you will be completely alone. Say you do stay in the hotel room most of the time, someone will check on you quite often. Making sure you're not making a bomb with USA written on it or something. Also, some visitors have said they've felt listened while in their room (which is very likely, since it happens to citizens in their homes).   The only place you can visit North Korea without a guide is the DMZ, on the South Korean part. The parts directly against the NK/SK border are obviously very heavily monitored and the rules are strict, but some areas are okay and very tourist-y. You can go on a tower and 'spy on' Koreans, you can look through googles. There's a movie theater, a tunnel North Korea dug in order to try to cross the border that you can go down on (it's a workout). And of course, souvenir shops! You're still being watched but you won't feel it. I went there though, and I didn't enjoy it. It's propaganda after propaganda. Everything the soldiers (our guides, but you don't have to follow them) said and whatever you could read was a sob story about how South Korea and the USA are trying *soooo* hard to respect NK and give them the best opportunities, and that NK is just being really mean and they're all very sad about it. But hey, at least you get to eat ice cream while you hear it all!   Edit: Not sure you can just spontaneously drive up to the DMZ, but I'm just speculating. After a certain checkpoint, I only saw buses.    Not sure you'll be given this opportunity. North Koreans know that the West is against Marijuana, so unless you have a cool guide/escort, he'll probably refuse to provide you with some, or tell you where to get it. North Korea doesn't want bad press, ironically enough.  Plus North Koreans don't smoke for the same reason as Westerners do. To them, it's just cheaper than cigarettes. It grows wherever, so might as well smoke it. And it's also used for medical reasons. So it's not like people promote it, really. And if you're in Pyongyang, you will not encounter it has much (provided that you will most likely see and meet people who can afford cigarettes).   Lastly, you won't be given the opportunity to just chill with the citizens, unless it was planned. Sometimes, if you visit a school, you may spend some time there. If you visit a 'model house', you may be able to chat a bit with the inhabitants. But as a tourist, you won't be able to visit a random person and just go inside their home, sit back and smoke weed. I think the only people you can chill with are other tourists, the guide/escort (if they're really cool), and maybe some of the hotel employees. But not for long. They aren't being paid to be your friends.    I understand the "don't want to encourage them" argument, and I remember someone discussing it here, actually. I wish I could find a link.  However, it is not that risky. Honestly. If you behave like a descent human being and you listen, you will be 100% fine. They are not dumb. They know when a tourist has made a mistake and when one is deliberately trying to start shit. You must be extremely unlucky to have a guide/escort that is gratuitously mean too. Most of them are just honest workers trying to bring home some money (and they are as scared as you, since if you get in big trouble, so do they).    The worst that can happen to you as a tourist is to be sent back home. Unless you broke a major rule, which to be honest, would be a really stupid thing to do. I mean. If you consciously took the decision to go to North Korea, you have to be a really dumb person to not respect any rule.  As for insulting statues or whatever, they know when it's accidental or deliberate. If it's deliberate but still minor, again, chances are they'll send you back home. If it's bigger (and I mean, if it's a huge deal), you may end up in prison but your country of origin, hopefully, won't be like "Well fuck. We lost one. Good luck, chap!" they'll do everything they can to bring you back home, and then you'll be banned from North Korea forever, etc.   If you insult it by accident, they'll just tell you to behave differently. They know you're a tourist. How are you supposed to know you've made a mistake?    You obviously can't go to Korea, as a tourist, on your own. As a tourist, you have to get a tour pack, which you can find online actually. Sometimes (usually the summer), this means tens of people with you. If you're lucky (or unlucky?) you can be alone with a guide/escort. To get permission to get inside of North Korea can be quite tricky, since obviously they won't allow just about anyone to get in.  If you're South Korean, good luck. You will not get in. Sometimes, they may be harsher with Japanese people as well. I think if you're Chinese though, the process will be much quicker. As for Americans, it's actually quite easy now. The only thing is that you are not allowed to take the train to North Korea anymore (from China). And if you're a journalist, there's no way you'll ever get in.  You cannot walk on your own either. You will always be with an escort, and you will be asked to stay with your group. Therefore, everything you will be doing and seeing are well planned and calculated. No spontaneous walk in the park or whatever. You can 'drift off' from your group "by mistake", which is how the most daring people have managed to capture pictures North Koreans officials would never let the Western World see, but that technique only works if your guide/escort is a cool guy. I've heard of people who got in big trouble from doing that. Other than that, you are asked to stay in your hotel room, which you can visit "freely". Many floors and rooms will be barricaded and locked though.   According to the guy I know who went there, it's expensive as hell. Just the trip to North Korea is 1000+ USD for five days. Keep in mind, 1000 is the cheapest so you'll most likely pay more. Also, that is the price for the entire guided tour. However, you have to pay your way to China, which itself is quite expensive.    I think what's annoying with downvotes is that you get buried so deep into the thread, and only people part of circle-jerks seem to notice you. That can be so infuriating.    Man I'm glad you changed your mentality because I must say this, I truly hate it. It's so dumb, and I especially hate how it's considered normal for people our age (college kids) to do and think so.   But personally, I have yet to feel a moment where I'm like "Well, time to grow up." because unfortunately, from age 12 or so, I transformed into a bitter old lady. I think I need a "Time to be young again" moment, but at the same time, I'm kind of enjoying being a bitter old lady. Well no. Not enjoying it, but I truly hate the other option so might as well stay the way I am.    Nope, just someone who knows the difference between the leader of a country, and the country itself.    It is not expired, North Korea just thinks it's invalid. In 2013, they wrote their own peace treaty to replace the armistice, but obviously South Korea will not sign it.  The UN and the US have no interest in changing the armistice or making a new one or whatever, unless both parties agree on it. So that won't happen.  In any case, I meant that it was not a very dangerous country. If we want to get technical, South Korea is a war zone as well, and their capital is about 60 km away from the DMZ, which should make it a sketchy place to be at. That doesn't stop millions of tourists and residents to roam the streets of Seoul, though.    I blocked everything I've ever posted on Facebook (and I've had an account since 2007). As for other social media platforms, I very seldom post personal informations. I mean, I do have like personal anecdotes here and there but you wouldn't be able to put a face or a name on it.  I had MySpace before that, and it was a mess! I didn't know the meaning of filter back then or something, because anything went on there.  But then I guess I'm kind of doing the same with Tumblr, but in moderation. If you're lucky (or unlucky) and you follow me, you might have seen my face once or twice. My name is right on my blog though, and I do share personal anecdotes, but I don't think I'm getting much attention on Tumblr, so it's all good.    I'm not so generous of a person. I won't share something with someone unless I talk with that person regularly. So ... eh, no. I talk to maybe three people regularly, so they'd probably know about it. Th rest? I don't see the point.    It's a very interesting country, and the people are amazing. Korea is not a war zone, the danger level is not high. When you're a foreigner, as long as you listen to the rules, you'll be fine and you may enjoy it. Now of course, if you have eyes to see and you're not being too much of a tourist (a.k.a wanting to look at pretty things only), you'll feel uncomfortable all the time, because you'd know what's really happening 'behind the scenes'. And you'll feel for the people who probably worked countless hours just to make the country look good to you. But then again, North Koreans are great people, the country itself is quite amazing (see all they've done with the little they have), and you'll be learning a shitton of history.   I never went there though. Just spent countless hours watching documentaries on YouTube, reading stories from actual tourists and other officials who spent time there. However some guy who works with the people I live with went there. I have never been so envious.    I try not to listen to lyrics, personally. I have yet to find a song that has lyrics that I liked. It always sounds really awkward and forced. However, I like how language sounds. So I have no problem whatsoever with foreign music. So basically, I like how things sounds.    Yu-Gi-Oh. I watched episode of that and fell in love with Yugi. I think he was my first TV crush.    I remember Sister Sister so well. My sister and I would run from wherever we would be, just to do the pose they do after the opening credits. Damn we must have looked ridiculous.   No, sorry. Canada is huuuge and I'm from the West part of it, while Edmonton is more to the East. I've only been there on a plane. Well, I flew over it. So all I can tell you is that the general era, the Rockies, looks amazing! So if you're into nature and all, you'll very much enjoy it.  However I know that in the summer, in Calgary (which is 2-3 hours away from by car) has a stampede. So if you're into that, there's that as well. But really. Canada is super various from province to province, so someone from province A won't really know what's happening in province B. I'm sorry : ( But TripAdvisor is your friend! :D   Ah since you're a foreigner, you wouldn't be eligible unfortunately. It's for students only.   However, during the summer, you can get some really good deals depending on the time or the location you're at. Sometimes, you can get a really good deal if you attend certain events, or shop at certain places, etc.   By the way I used to be in Montreal, so I don't know how other cities deal with this.    I was lucky enough to have attended private school all of my life (except for two months, since I emigrated in April during 2nd grade, and only public school allowed me to get in for the remaining two months). From Grade 5, I attended a catholic smallish school, and on top of that, from Grade 7 to Senior Year, we were all girls.  Bullying didn't really happen, and everyone fitted in (no one was left alone, unless they chose to be alone). Girls fight and hate on each other behind each other's back haha. However, my self-esteem dropped immensely some time in Grade 8. I have no idea why. I know it's related to school. I became extremely self-conscious. One of the many reasons I like to blame was that it was in Grade 8 that we started a project, which was a student exchange with kids our age in Mexico. I personally really wanted to just build a cool friendship with someone, and I was unfortunately matched with the 'hottest guy'. We talked, but soon enough I noticed him using me to get to the pretty girls of my year. When they finally came in Grade 9, I went to him to say hi, and he was like "Hey! You're 'train_subject9951', right?" and I was really happy he remembered me, but seconds later, he turned his back and started talking to another classmate of mine, who, for some reason, decided not to wear much that day.   I was both unhappy and kind of shocked, because, well, I'm not a pretty girl. Felt like all the attention I'll ever get from there on would be from being pretty, which I am not. Girls like girls with whom they can relate to, and most girls of my school were into partying, makeup ... being stereotypical teenage girls. I was not like them. My social skills then dropped to absolute zero, my self-esteem reached an all-time low, and I slowly started secluding myself. I'm having a hard time undoing all of that.    Actually, I really hated turning 18 because where I lived in Canada, students who were 17 and younger were able to pay a reduced price for all fares (on their public transportation cards), but once you turn 18 and until age 25, you pay full price for everything but for the monthly pass. It's cool, but sometimes I'd only need a week pass, and paying full price was a real pain. (26+ pay full price on everything no exception).   Other than that, I really wanted to go to a Drag Queen show, which is 18+ for obvious reasons. Never got to attend one though. Yet.    It has nothing to do with how we are wired. It's 100% cultural. Europe for instance is just recently becoming prude. Twenty years ago, a topless German woman answering the door to the mailman was no big deal, and I believe it was the same with France. If you go to remote tribes today, breasts are mostly seen as those things young children get their food from. Plus covering them would be uncomfortable and not so practical.   So yeah. It's culture.    Not only immature, but we've sexualized them. Overly prude people who find them indecent are a problem, but the "mmmmmm boobiiiiiies *drools*" type of people are incredibly annoying and problematic as well.   What I find funny is that on Untucked, they censored nothing at all. Even (I believe) Tempest Dujour drew a vagina on her and it was not censored.  Though Untucked is on YouTube so yeah I guess it's different.   Twin!    FPH being banned, to me, was good news. Because that subreddit was shit, the people there were just being hateful for the sake of being mean, but eh, whatever. I didn't care before, as long as they kept it to themselves and they aren't going around, messaging people, going on other subreddits, choosing random victims, etc. Like I imagined it as a text-only, kind of "this fat bitch at the supermarket today smelled like rotten cheese was stuck in her neck rolls" type of stories being written, and everyone just indulging in their uncalled for hate.  But, it's not. It's like, as soon as someone from there finds a fat person, they go in the subreddit and link that person's profile, or comment, or picture. And they go fucking nuts. Threatening personal messages, harassment, downvoting all comments, apparently doxxing?  But obviously, if you ban one, twenty thousand billions will pop up, because Reddit is filled with a bunch of kids. I think for the other subreddits, it's better to just let them happen. Most of them will be forgotten anyway since they were created kind of in the moment. If it gets out of hand though, just block everyone. This isn't a matter of Freedom of Speech. This is a matter of not being an idiot, but nah Reddit doesn't get it.    Being black on Reddit sucks. Being a woman on Reddit sucks. Being fat on Reddit sucks. Now imagine being all three. Yay me.   That sounds great!   I am unfortunately not an outdoor person, but I truly enjoy opening my window when it's really cool and raining outside, and just chill in bed. However I did enjoy walking my dog in bad weather, at night. It felt so great.    Same! I miss autumn/end of winter. Usually, those periods also mean lots of rain, lots of grey skies, lots of wind. Paradise.    Is it a thing one can do? How do you regain pleasure again? Personally I am at a point where in order to call something fun, I need to put myself in someone else's shoes and try to guess, from their perspective, if it is indeed fun. Kinda sick of it.    Yes, I do it quite often. Except, I try to be as passive as possible. I do it (or try to) in a way that will let the other person believe that they are the one distancing themselves from me, and not me pushing them away. Usually, I just frustrate them, and kind of go for the "See? That is reason #609-5 section b why you should hate me and abandon me." 'technique'. I don't want their pity or whatever, I don't fake anything, I just do it I guess, and I have no idea why. If I were to truly think about it, I think it's because deep inside I feel like I do not deserve their attention, but most importantly, that their attention cannot be genuine towards me, since I am not worth it.   As for the moods, I think it has something to do with your level of motivation, and not so much 'different' personalities.  	108
