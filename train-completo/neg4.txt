 Yea, my connection seem to just start dieing after I did that update as well. I was trying to connect to the PSN but I kept receiving an error. After a while I was able to and tried to download Outlast and that's not working Either. Lastly I decided to just watch Netflix but that's also not working for me. I know it's not my Wi-Fi because the phone and laptop connect just fine.  I'm just gonna leave it off for a couple hours and hopefully I'll be able to play a bit of Outlast tonight.  I'm in California, some people don't seem to have any trouble connecting online though. Not sure if it has to do with location.   That looks fucken siiiiiick and detailed as well! I just saw that episode too!!   Dios mo! You are gorgeous!  How do you subscribe to a person's post!? Can't wait to see more of you   That's a fuckin beautiful shot. Just became my new wallpaper on my pc!    Glad you did, loving that look you're giving. Good angle too ;)   Ohh very nice, excellent way to start the weekend. Would only be made better if your face was visible, with your glasses and all   Very nice! Thanks for posting this! I'm always looking for new artists to listen to.  	7
 Mynd you, moose bites Kan be pretty nasti...   Cliven Bundy has a thing or two he'd like to let you know.      And that a right to healthcare is slavery... oh wait   Strong Neo-Confederate sympathies are a very common trait among backers of the Paul Family.     No, it was a deliberate word choice on the part of the poster.  He's a right-wing troll who sometimes instead tries to imitate what he thinks "those damn lib'ruls" sound like.   Not nearly as good as starting with the "Department of Defense."    Rand Paul deserves enormous credit for his actions particularly when you consider he's going against many in his own party  So Rand deserves "enormous credit" for being a member of a Party full of morons? Those are some pretty low standards of which to be proud.     And yet, the Republicans have been getting away with selling ignorance as a virtue since the Reagan years.   Sounds like Santorum's ready to work himself into a froth.   Until the rent-seekers rape it out of the workers again.  Extortion from captives is neither "freedom" nor "liberty," unless you belong to the permanent leisure class of exploiters.  Americans need to stop voting for the permanent leisure class, and start voting for their own interests.    They tried to conceal the snaps where the hairpiece is attached.   It's simple, as in "Josh dug her  and her, and her, and her, and her, too!"  Also: rhymes with "bugger."   Seriously, though, read *The Jungle.*   And not enough Banksters.   In before self-aggrandizing dimwits posting mises/lew rockwell spam!   You'd think that Conservatives would be keenly interested in *conservation.*  This leads us to the question: What are Conservatives conserving, exactly?   So Jesus wants us all to be wage slaves to the Tyrants of Capital?   The social and economic damage that Fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity has inflicted upon America for the past four decades is incalculable.   http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yy5y/statement_by_the_president_on_the_passing_of_beau/  Will the Reign of Terror and Error of these Censorship Mods ever end?   As you can see from the link below, the Censorship Mods just pulled a statement from the President as "Off Topic -- Not US Politics."  http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yy5y/statement_by_the_president_on_the_passing_of_beau/   They killed it!  I think it's because the Censorship Mods must really love "LIBERTY!"^TM   This is a statement from the President of the United States, and it's "Off Topic -- Not US Politics"???!?!?  How do you people look in the mirror?   And of course, it doesn't hurt that Koch Industries is headquartered in Kansas...   Let's see if the Censorship Mods delete a statement from the President as "Not US Politics."      Don't forget the right-wing Supreme Court which installed Dubya in the Oval Office.    The conservatives of today's era are also Royalists, but this time of Capital.   "The Party of Personal Responsibility"   TL;DR: "It's the damn liberals' fault!"    The Church has been so hyperfocused/misfocused on pushing right-wing extremism at the expense of the more traditional "Good Works" that they've alienated the last several generations of would-be Catholics.   Catholics, despite what the American branch of the Church seems to think, just don't want to hear about the evils of abortion and birth control every damn week. If people want to hear that sort of shit, they'd go to some Evangelical Protestant Duggar-esqe "Born-Again" megachurch where all intellect is checked at the door.  This is why children and grandchildren of Catholics just don't go/donate anymore.   "We should simply end this illegal program, just like my son should stop assaulting flight attendants and getting into drunken crashes."   I think it's because he's so "pro-life."   Note also the Right's "Colleges are just liberal indoctrination centers!!1!" meme-lie so popular among the Fox/AM propagandists.    Jack Hunter is not racist though.  [Sure about that?](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/07/09/rand-paul-staffer-southern-avenger/2502637/)  Also, what does [this picture of Jack Hunter and his "Southern Avenger" outfit](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YhKjH9pQno0/hqdefault.jpg) indicate to you?   About two years ago a gang of extremist right-wing "Censorship Mods" took over. Anything that these Censorship Mods disagreed with (i.e., showed the American Right for what it truly is) was marked "Not US Politics," "Off Topic" or "Rehosted Content." Many news sources (along with any redditors who dared to disagree with the Censorship Mod's fiats) were often banned summarily.  They even banned "Mother Jones" for a while (for the crime of breaking the "Mitt Romney 47%" story,) but the outcry was so great that they were forced to relent.  Within the last month or so, three of the most offensive and blatant "Censorship Mods" were bounced, as they should have been long ago. Their legacy remains, however.    Right-wingers have a persecution complex.    "fighting for our freedom."  Whenever this phrase is uttered, the "Bullshit!" alarm of perceptive students of history and politics goes off.    Given the Paul Family's longstanding affiliations with White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates such as Jack Hunter (the self-dubbed "Southern Avenger" who co-authored a Tea Party book with Rand and thinks that "Lincoln was a Tyrant!!1!" and that John Wilkes Booth was a hero) I tremble to think what kind of Supreme Court Justices that Rand would appoint.  That's reason enough *alone* to completely discount Rand's candidacy.   Let's not forget the Paul Family's decades-long ties to White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates, either.  The last thing America needs is a return to the 19th century.   "And then I will force a MONEYBOMB!!!"   Q6. Are the daughters essentially hostages?   [The Only Moral SmushShmorshin is My SmushShmorshin](http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/anti-tales.shtml)    It's basically anti-sex.  Right-wingers: The Senior Anti-Sex League     It's because he's so "pro-life."   Whole Lotta Teabaggery   Teabags ... teabags everywhere    So at what point in time does it become a human being?  When loud-mouthed, right wing assholes stop giving a shit about it.     It's not just another being, it's a human.   So in your view, tadpoles are frogs?     *Parent comment sponsored by Koch Industries.*   *populace   Kansas, home state of Koch Industries.    we're actually just coming out of a drought.  See? Rick Perry's rain-prayers in the stadium finally worked!     Texas Republicans: sentencing their fellow Texans to suffering and death just to spite the President.   Because Josh dug her, and her, her, her, and her, too!   I wonder if American Catholics differ significantly based on region?   Wonkette has a good summary of just about every incident in American politics. It's a shame it's banned from this subreddit.    The "forced birth" crowd is losing influence rapidly.   Because they're cranks, and their base is mostly made up of stoners who know little/nothing about them.  Don't forget about the White Supremacists and Neo-Confederates that have always followed the Pauls around like puppy dogs.   The born-again Christians would have him re-crucified within a week.   They should market it as Shamu water.   Hair recognition.   Whenever right-wingers try to do humor, they just wind up embarrassing themselves.    I guess now we know what the "Hastert Rule" really means.   First, stalk and shoot your victim. Beforehand, trail him slowly in your car for several minutes, then get out and follow him on foot. It helps a LOT if your victim is ... well, you know.  Then, plant some Skittles and Arizona Iced Tea on the body. Whack the back of your head on the pavement so you can claim he attacked you, thus violating the Non-Aggression Principle, and thereby allowing you to act in your full, reasonable, rational self-interest by plugging him one right in the heart. Tell everyone he started it, and that you were only acting in self-defense! After all, you're just the friendly Neighborhood Watch guy.  Not only did you get to live out the "I Thrill-Killed a Violent Thug and Got Away With It!" murder-fantasy, you'll be hailed as a Hero Patriot  and a Genuine Lover of Liberty in no time!   How about some life-altering YouTube videos, also? Those always work out great for you guys.   And "libertarian 'social' ideals" get thrown right out the fucking window whenever even a dollar is at stake. *Every. Single. Time.*  American libertarianism is a cult of greed. It's the Scientology of politics.   Shitebart!   No, it's not libertarian. American Libertarians are even further to the right than the Republicans.   I relish the idea of watching them all turn blue.    The *extremely* anti-American nature of those who most loudly proclaim themselves to be "***Real*** Americans" is hard to miss.   Why doesn't Ted just get an cash advance on the funds he'll acquire in the the "Transfer of Wealth" during the End Times?     It'll just trickle-down .   All their beef jerky just got rehydrated.   Confederates never learn.   Those poor sister-victims were forced to pray Josh's play away.   Women are not brood-mares for the state. I'm sorry this disappoints you.   Even they know it's a losing issue now.  Which wedge issue will the American Right lose next?   If men could get pregnant, abortion would be declared a sacrament.    Something is wrong with society when forced breeding is a desirable outcome.    Clearly his hatred of "the damn meddlin' Fed'rul Gubmint" is conditional.   Elm-tree killing motherfuckers    23 hours a day in an 8x8 box with either no window or a slit only a couple inches wide. That's torture.  Do they get the Internet?     But the death penalty isn't as much of a populist rage issue today as it was back in the 1970s-80s.  Much of the success of American Right over the last 50-60 years has been built on exploitation of rage/fear based wedge issues.  They've all but lost on gay marriage now. What will be the next wedge issue they lose?   *Tales from Walkerstan* (a Koch Brothers Production)   Nice try, Josh Duggar      Alinsky's writings proposing the construction of the interstate Wal-Mart tunneling system are well known in leftist circles.   I really don't know how any Texas woman (or conscientious Texas man) can vote along with the GOP.   That's terrifying. It's a right-wing cult.    Hey, another Shitebart story!  Why are they allowed in this subreddit, when Salon, Media Matters, and other genuine, legitimate sources are banned?   Only right-wing sycophants will be stupid enough to believe Jeb's lies.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of stupid right-wing sycophants haunting American society today.   More from the Duggar Diddler Files.  No one seems to mention the actual victims of this: the sisters that Josh molested. Maybe they were just told to shut up and endure it because "God has a plan"?   If anyone is going to be tried as domestic terrorists, it should be the Cliven Bundy Militia.  Also to be charged: the head of the "Oath Keepers," who threatened Sen. John McCain's life recently (though the story was banned both in news and politics.)   This would allow Snowden to turn off the lights.   I'm sure Texas will refuse it. They don't need any help from that damn meddlin' Fed'rul Gubmint!   It's because he's so pro-life.   Can greatness be far from his grasp?      West Virginia ... Mountain Momma   He should really do a IAMA.   Well, if the shoe fits...   And in every case of this defense I've heard used by its proponents, the "socially liberal" goes to the chopping block over "fiscally conservative," *every single time.*  Libertarian economics is nothing more that Reaganomics on steroids. Recent decades have proven that these models should be moved ever further away from, not toward.   Many White Nationalists, Neo-Confederates, and conspiracy theorists/militia preppers have come to self-identify as Libertarians now.  Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Murray Rothbard began deliberately cultivating an audience of paranoids and bigots in the mid-1980s. Rothbard even named this strategy "Outreach to the Rednecks."   One product of this strategy was the infamous *Ron Paul Newsletters,* which have continued to haunt Paul and the Libertarian Party. [Ron Paul was the Libertarians' presidential candidate in 1988.]    Clearin' brush down on the ranch.   Great comedic potential?   I'm not surprised. Something scummy just oozes through all their advertising/PR.   He might be resurrected as a VP candidate, however.   You wanted "States' Rights", Red States? You got 'em.  Can you feel the LIBERTY!^TM yet?  *Brought to you by ALEC, funded generous grants from the Kochs and their ilk*   If you have a job, hen you can be assured that your employer is only paying you about one-third of your worth to him at best. *You* are his profit center.  Here in our America, workers need to get over the idea that has been implanted in their brains: that somehow the noble Job Creators^TM and their financial backers are to be worshipped and trusted and placated at all costs.   It's disgusting that for mere survival, so many Americans must live in permanent servitude to feed the hunger of the rent-seekers, profit-harvesting financiers, and the permanent leisure class of multigenerational wealth in their united, undying quest to extract and acquire ***MORE*** from us for themselves.  That is neither "Freedom," nor "Liberty."   Or in Cliven Bundy's case, to take it outright.      I don't understand the love about raising the minimum wage. I get that it is very low, but I believe the minimum wage should be a starting salary, not something you strive to sit at.  What I don't understand is the opposite: why does the Capital Class feel that they are entitled to next-to-free labor force to exploit?   *Real* Americans pay their employees a living wage.      Rural people tend to be independent. As such, they don't trust the government... they would rather scrape by than to be dependent on the government.  They sure trust the government when it comes to farm subsidies.    Because Grover Norquist.   I hope Ohio's Republicans have budgeted for the results of their new "forced birth" policy.   Last time it became a bribes-for-votes scam between Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul.  Will anyone really miss the phony Iowa straw poll, except for the state GOP fundraisers who fill their coffers from it?   I ain't gonna play Sun City.   [He even minted a gold coin in his own honor.](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/4976596305_a3c1819dd1_z.jpg)     Maybe it's God punishing them for being such regressive right-wingers.  Is this statement really any different that Falwell and Robertson blaming 9/11 on gays and abortion?  Yes, it is. Because millions of people *actually believe* the second statement, and their bizarre doctrines are poisoning America.   [crickets]   Let's not forget that Reaganomics tripled the national debt in only 8 years.  That was a massive amount of stimulus spending, but Republicans will never acknowledge it, as it detracts from their masturbation fantasies : "all gub'mint spendin' is evil!" and "Saint Reagan unleashed the economy by cutting taxes!!1!"  They'll never mention that the Reaganites exploded spending.  Also, before some mouth-breathing right winger says, "but ... but ... Congress spends all the money! It warn't Saint Reagan's fault!!1!," here's a fun fact you'll never hear in the right wing media: in *every* budget the Reagan Administration ever submitted to Congress, more spending was requested than Congress ultimately approved.  Maybe it's time for "the Party of Personal Responsibility" to accept some.   I'm sure his fellow inmates will make an exception for good ol' Sheriff Joe.   The "murder fantasy" lies at the heart of American gun culture.   *Helter Shelter*   He'll be eating a *lot* of moldy bologna, too.   You want to know what's *really* fucking evil?  Forced birth is fucking evil.   *Josh Craves Honey's Woo-Woo*   American Exceptionalism!    I don't think libertarians are that gullible  Are you serious? They fell hard for neo-Conferderate goldbug Ron Paul.     the "ex post fuckto" clause   They're the real victims here. All this time they've been instructed to "pray Josh's play away."  Given their indoctrination into the family's radical right-wing perversion of Christianity, they may even have been made to feel that they deserved or invited the abuse, because "God always has a plan."   Another point: the Duggars and their apologists can't blame public schools, the mass media, porn, or video games, because they kept their kids strictly sheltered from such corrupting influences.   *Can You Feel the Froth Tonight*   Also, Josh Duggar destroyed Josh Duggar's record.  I wonder how Josh's sisters are dealing with the legacy of their sexual abuse at the hands of their brother?  Did the Duggar sisters get the help they needed, or did they they just get "pray away Josh's play" counseling?      Josh Duggar. And her, and her, and her, and her, and her, too!  I wonder how his sister-victims are coping? No one seems to give them a second thought in this.    DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT SHYLAMALAN   Libertarians don't like anyone, and least of all themselves.   "And also my MONEYBOMB! Please give generously, or you hate Liberty."   They meet to further divide up the world amongst themselves, yet still lament the stray crumbs from their tables that others must survive upon.     Of course not.  They're 100% American Fundamentalist Evangelical Protestant "Quiverfull" Kool-Aid drinkers.  Fundamentalists like the Duggars are the reason so many roll their eyes today whenever people boast about being "Christian."  The point is that the Catholic Church did itself a great disservice when they allied with the American Religious Right (who view Catholics as heretics who will be cast into the Lake of Fire when the Christian Right's little "End-of-Days" revenge fantasy takes place.)    There aren't really many gaps.  Josh begs to differ.   Probably more in a Trent Reznor/Nine Inch Nails sense.  	143

Right but this is not the case here "But Americans' lean toward conservatism is also steadily dissipating, and that goes for both economic and social issues. In fact, the conservative advantage in both of those areas is as low as it has been (or lower) than at any point since the start of the 21st Century, according to Gallup."

The correspondents were disgusted. They were all well accustomed to working within the constraints of censorship during wartime, but this decision seemed different."  Fascinating story.

That's why I went with the above title.    No problem at all. My apologizes!     From the article: "In my opinion, even if the photographs are not the best of the actual conflict, many of them document the vision that the generals and politicians wanted to present of the war  they show resting soldiers who were well-fed, well-housed and well-treated."   Thank you, nallen. Thing is, I hesitated before submitting the story due to its writing not only over the top title (and accompanied image). I should have known better.   I followed the rules of submitting the exact title or something similar. In this case I submitted the exact title. Thanks for pointing it out.

 Personally, I'd much prefer an older Captain Marvel. It gives the appearance she's more experienced, also there are almost no decent action roles for women over 40.

The Oath   Pulp Fiction - that way you have seen a bit of every movie released before 1994   Fuck Dexter's last 4 seasons!   I don't really understand calling his music dumb. Like I easily get finding it bad or being greatly annoyed by it, but it is inherently clever.   bingo   I prefer to call it the Dollars Trilogy. The Man With No Name has appeared in so many movies beyond those three. Pale Rider, Rango, The Outlaw Josey Wales are all just subtle variations on him.   I have a few reasons why, but I don't like sharing them because I always get viciously downvoted. If you'd like I'd PM them to you.   Transformers - I've been reading the current comic series and it's actually quite thought-provoking and very interesting. The films are anything but.  Also, not a big fan of Looper, I found it a bit slow and the mechanics of time-travel didn't really sit well with me. I also had a hard time agreeing with a lot of the characters were doing a lot of the time. I can see why a lot of people like it though.  Funny, I just criticised one movie, by saying I'd prefer it to be thought-provoking Sci-Fi, then proceed to criticise a movie that was exactly that.   End of a TV series, so kind of cheating.  Two men - one sitting, one standing, both in a hospital car park - debate the purpose their last twenty years, concluding it was all a battle between light and dark. Pan up to the stars.   An embarrassing thing happened to me yesterday. It's not really relevant, but I thiught if we're airing stuff out, I might as well share. I was coming back from a gathering slightly drunk and thought it was a good idea to stop and get chicken. I was 45 minutes from home before I started to notice what a bad idea getting chicken was. I tried rushing home, but it was too much to handle and I messed myself. I had to squelched my way home and then I took a long-ass shower. I don't know why I've added this to the thread, but it feels good to say.   I hope there is no explanation. It'd likely seem forced an detract from Johnny and Sue's relationship.   Twist: they don't care; it doesn't matter to them.   I've felt that for the whole run.   His dark side is called Ed Brubaker's run and is a highlight in his 75-year history.   Sorry, I must have misunderstood what you were trying to say wih the video.   Wow, that's kind of rude, just dismissing my opinion as a troll. Also, I didn't give a review, as I didn't mention the things those films did well.   I greatly respect your opinion, but I must ask this partly because I asked you to explain in the title of my post and because I'd love to hear why?  Is it the dated style of filmmaking, the clunky dialogue or the iffy acting?*  *I love these movies and I think that's all part of the charm.   Is True Romance really an  auteur film? It seems more driven by the writer's style of dialogue than anything else.   I'd say he's a skilled director who makes smarter-than-average and flawed, but very entertaining blockbusters.    For me it's Lord of the Rings.  Here's why:  * The characters are uninteresting and dull (with the exception of Boromir).  * There's way too many characters. It wasn't hard to follow, I just didn't want to.  * (Only really a problem with the Fellowship) The first one seemed to be aimed at young children with lots of childish jokes and dumb slapstick and dialogue - which then seemed really odd because of some of the darker things in that movie.  * The action is really boring. I spent so much time waiting for something interesting, but it never came.  * It's so slow and so long. There's just so much that doesn't need to be there (like the last 40 minutes of RotK). You could say these moments enhance the world, but it already is so rich and vast those moments just drag.  * The lack of an interesting villain. I don't even know why I should care at times.  * The plot revolves around a MacGuffin and is full of Deus ex Machinas (an army of ghosts? WTF?).  * Too much exposition.   * Too many subplots that just don't matter to me. Why should I care if Aragon found love or didn't or whatever? I don't care about Aragon.  * There isn't actually that much plot there. Just look at how little Sam and Frodo's story progresses from the end of the Fellowship to their encounter with Gollem in RotK. If you cut out all of their story up to that point, you could still follow along just fine.       He'a not an Avenger. Eric O' Grady is just some dick who stole an Ant-Man suit at the expense of his friend's life. There's a reason he's the irredeemable Ant-Man.   Ahh, the important questions straight off the bat.   Millar's run after Ellis was great too.   IMO, all of thise great things from the comic, couldn't work on film. It's a unique medium, especially considering the that you can read multiple panels and text boxes at the same time.   Sometimes I feel in the minority about Ant-Man looking good. Reed doesn't have the best track record, but the effects in the trailer look great.   I really like Batman: Year One, but I think it's only really great because of the strength of the original comic. The amount of narration really weighs it down, but I think they realised this when adapting Frank Miller's other great Batman story, The Dark Knight Returns.   When a movie is *that* good, I think the circlejerk is completely justified.   That team was perfect.   For a second, I thought Bendis was your flair.   Superman: Red Son or Old Man Logan. Alternate worlds seems to be off the table.  Outside of cape books, I'd love to see a Y: The Last Man mini-series.    Don't worry, we're here for you now.   She is, but she isn't telepathic.    Is it smarter?   Watching a 200 minute version of a movie I didn't really like and thought was already too long doesn't really appeal to me, but thank-you.    But Damon wasn't the producer for the Bourne movies. The MI movies are Tom Cruise's baby. They're *his* movies more than anyone else's.   Captain Marvel isn't telepathic. Who did you think she was?   The movie is already quite long and quite boring, I'm not sure I could sit through that.   [Oh, the joys of ant powers.](http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_588,w_500/t_mp_quality/18dy5dvh22ytejpg-ant-man-the-avengers-phase-3-and-the-crisis-at-marvel-jpeg-72937.jpg)   I think you'd be surprised by the number of people that didn't get the pirate story. It's hardly Nolan-level hand holding (I love Nolan though).  Ignoring the symbolism and parallels between Ozzy, that's one of my favourite parts of the book as it's actually quite fun. While it wasn't really needed, it certainly would have added more depth to the film.   Rob Reiner doing another Coming-of-Age movie would be awesome.    Sorry that was the video, not the movie.   And my interest.   Mission Impossible is TC's franchise. He'll either end it or keep going into his sixties.    Base Transformers on the current IDW comics. It's really thought-provoking Sci-Fi.   The Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man are near identical movies in everything, but tone, villain and love interest.    [This is a pretty good reading order if you have Marvel Unlimited,](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-x-men-reading-order-guide-modern-marvel-comics-era/) but it's missing a few things like New Mutants (2003), New X-Men: Academy X, Mike Carey's X-Men Legacy, Vulcan's time in space and a good chunk of X-Factor.    The funny thing is, I thought it was a very left wing movie. It made great points about the rich being not so great and that being a gentleman is about how you behave, not class.   Consider Aaron's Secret Invasion tie-in. I think it's the last three issues. It stands alone really well and is very badass.   Luke Cage, as I'm a massive fan of the blaxploitation genre of cinema, so inserting him into the MU is just a blast. He's also shown to be a pretty great leader and a quite the badass.    Some good action and effects.    Or maybe Zack Snyder is the cause of the criticism.    I think the biggest fault with Watchmen is the fact it didn't deviate from the comics more. They should have changed the story enough to do their own thing and try and do something clever. Rather than just pinching elements from the comic and diluting them, they should have come up with some clever things themselves, like the X-Men movies have done.  That way, people like /u/Stankshadow would be more ready to accept its differences.   I don't think he really understood the book at all.    It actually has a lot of minor changes that really made the difference. Things like the pirate story or the death of Nite Owl I or the therapist or just the odd line of dialogue by Rorschach. Those completely change my perspective on the story and as a result the movie seems hollow.    I prefer the book's ending because the amount of character deaths and the gore was really impactful and the movie didn't have that. Also, they butchered "I already did it, 35 minutes ago."         The Walking Dead - whilst never being the best comic series (it's not even Kirkman's best current book), the affect it had on the comic book landscape in incomparable and it is thoroughly enjoyable.    More. After killing that universe he proceeds to kill famous literary characters like Sherlock Holmes as they inspired Superheroes. Then he renames himself Dreadpool and proceeds to try and killl every Deadpool in the Multiverse.    I was bored during the last act, not because the action was bad, but because there were no characters I really cared about. None. Superman was just a symbol - more like several conflicting signals actually - and if it wasn't for Snyder's direction, he wouldn't even be that.  I'm still not a fan of Snyder, but in the way I'm not a fan of cubism or interpretive dance. He's just not for me.   Luthor was exactly the way he was in the comics at that point. Which is a shame as I'd have preferred businessman Lex. M   Don't try an explain your BS with real world science and we have no problem.   Events were great and so was him being part of the Secret Avengers. It was like getting Dick twice a month.   It doesn't have to be a beer.   Damn right. I wish they wouldn't call themselves feminists, otherwise people like /u/Bigman61 will get confused.   I thought she was owned by Sony and has now returned. Even if she wasn't, that must've been a bit of a grey area.    I can recommend you some good Dick if you would like?   I had you at the Dick?   Never forget; actors can sign up for more movies. See: RDJ in Civil War.    Spider-Woman, but lets hope that's fixed down the line.    It's worse in Punisher MAX, he really wasn't good at making pop culture references.   It's certainly true for that Judge Dredd panel you linked, but Matt Hollingsworth is one of the best in the business and I'm really fond of his colouring.   There's a whole article there explaining it.   When weren't they?   It's moments like this that make me wish Joss never left Twitter.    Why can't we have nice and fun Superman in a gritty environment?   Also: last ten minutes of Reservoir Dogs   Be cartoony, do you mean nice and friendly?   **Noooooooooooo!!!**   But Bay's destruction isn't even visually appealing. It's like a dhitpost on /r/DestructionPorn   They have comics from the 30s! It's great! If you're looking for some older X-Men or Iron Man when he drank, you're in luck.   13K comics for $10/month. It's a ridiculously good deal.    You'd still be missing out on so many great Image comics.    I'd definitely prefer Cumberbatch in his native accent, but I think I'll try to stay open minded about it.  Strange is from Brooklyn, right?   /r/wallpapers   In Shinto Mythology there are these two-tailed cats that shapeshift. They come into your homes at night and kill your cats then take their form. After a while of studying you and learning your mannerisms, they kill you and take your form living out the rest of their days as you.    Add a scene of the mother tucking the daughter into bed first so we know what the mother looks like beforehand and the nighttime setting instantly makes it creepier.   A relatively new bromance, so we'll see how long it lasts, but I'm loving Tony and Bruce - Science Bros.   More female Superheroes, so probably White Tiger, Spider-Woman and Ms Marvel.  I'd add a few YA movies like The Runaways and Young Avengers. I know a lot of people think The Runaways would work better as a TV series, I'd prefer to see a female-led franchise on film.  I wouldn't hire D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to write Inhumans as this season of Game of Thrones has proved they're not very creative.  I'd introduce Dick Rider in an Annihilation movie.  I'd try and make the movies have more personal and emotional climaxes. I'm not interested if Spider-Man ends with him beating Doc Ock and winning, what made the end of Spider-Man 2 interesting was Doc Ock's sacrifice.  I'd make every sequel a team-up movie a la The Winter Soldier. How cool would Doctor Strange is Spider-Man 2 be? Or Black Panther in Thor: Ragnarok?  Hawkeye miniseries based on Fraction's run.  And of course, Dark Reign and Seige must happen.    I thought that about Martin Freeman until I saw Fargo.   Richard started as a teen hero (he's about Spidey's age) and he doesn't have to be white. I still prefer the war-hardened Nova from after Annihilation though.   I don't see any of these as bad.   Outside of the MCU, that black and gold armour is super sexy.   My mum as I'd want Peter to have someone looking after him that's as nice as she is.   He could make him really campy and still do him really well. I think I'd prefer him campy as watching Cranston have fun nowadays is an odd thing to see.   Goddammit! I didn't realise how much I wanted this until now.   Maybe one of Jackman's clones wants revenge for something.    I can imagine comic books and TV miniseries spinning out of this.   I always wanted an NWA movie so I guess I really lucked out. Their lives in the 80s and 90s always sounded so interesting even after them splitting up. I hope they don't glamourise it though. A gritty NWA movie would be awesome.   I frankly think this is more interesting than the subject of 8 Mile.    John Wick and the Raid   Who is also her girlfriend. She's dating a fucking dragon! How cool is that?   The Star Wars universe is so rich, I'm shockingly disappointed by the lack of genre diversity in the Expanded Universe. I'd love to see a noir-flavoured spy thriller in the Star Wars universe.   I think I'd prefer to see the other Quasar or Adam Warlock, but the Guardians is currently a bit of a sausage fest, so two new girls wouldn't be a bad thing.    "I don't want to kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they came from."   Looks like Macbeth was about to slice a guy from crown to navel.   But the visuals are kinda the point. It'd be like taking away the visuals from a Sam Mendes film.   What's  New World?   Ideally action focused and foreign films are welcome.   I've only seen Die Hard out of those three and whilst it was pretty good, it doesn't reach my top 10.  	116
 Mutu....  Now that's a name I haven't heard in a loooong time   I... don't get it. What a waste of a meme. A hipster cop would obviously go around arresting people for breaking archaic laws that nobody knows are still in effect.   #JusticeForColby   AYYYY LMAO   Honestly, I love moments like this purely for the quick little glimpse it gives into a person's real nature. I live in a majority black country and grew up thinking all my white friends weren't racist. But over time, every now and then, one of them would let slip a moment like this, and I'm grateful every time. I don't say anything, just make a mental note, then slowly eek them out of my life.  EDIT: I'm not talking about wee little moments of prejudice, or politically incorrect views. I'm talking about flashes of outright racism. It's something I hate with the core of my being and it fundamentally changes my view of people to the point that I don't want to know them anymore.   /r/quityourbullshit   This girl had her life ruined over this video when the guy she sent it to uploaded it to the TOR site Pink Meth. Guilty boner.......   This happened to me in London. Travelled from one end of the city to the other, getting off and changing at all the same spots as a really cute girl. I was thinking I'd say something to her jokingly and we ended up getting off at my stop. She looks back. I go to say "heh I swear I'm not stalking you" but she bolts before I can. Shaved my moustache as soon as I got home...   Goats? Psh. My dog killed geese. GEESE. Lovely little black lab taking on dozens of 3-foot honking pieces of hell. It was a bloodbath.   Being seen as a "trusted student" by a teacher the rest of the class dislikes puts that student at odds with their classmates, fostering distrust among their peers. In the hyper-social setting of a classroom, this can be severely detrimental to the student's social standing among the group.   "This kills the ____" is a meme, in this case applied glibly to signify that such an action by the teacher would leave the "trusted student" figuratively "dead".   In comedy, hyperbole is often used to "play up" a truth. In this instance, "This kills the student" is referencing the social strain being labeled a "trusted student" would induce.   While one could have commented: "This would severely hamper the student's social standing among his peers", such matter-of-fact comments often go unnoticed on forums such as Reddit, where one-liners and popular references tend to generate more reaction and, in turn, karma.    Send a trusted student  This kills the student   Repost or not, I love seeing this. It's really the simplest advice you can give.

Clinic defenders protect abortion clinic workers and clients from protesters who try and shame women as they walk in.

"Feminist" work differs wildly from country to country, according to how much work is needed to be done for the rights of women IN that country. American feminism, as the average person sees it, looks like Tumblr. Turkish feminism looks like a woman beheading her rapist in the fucking street.    "American feminism" would imply feminism in America is different.   "American feminists" implies feminist women in America are different.

It's one of my many pet names for him. Haz, Hazzy, Jazz Haz, Hazmat, Hazdribal, Hazilla, Hazim Zalabim, El Hazerino (if you're not into the whole brevity thing).

    Good one, Tuck!      Beautiful shot, beautiful place.    In fact, I think BitShares has been running a concept called "Get hired by the blockchain". Developers and even marketing folks can make an income directly once they offer their services to the community.    These are very exciting projects.    Doesn't Detroit need a DH until Victor Martinez gets back?   Proof of stake...works anywhere!   You mean the Kenyan terrorist?  Gallup's still pissed at him because they blew the General Election turnout models so badly in both Obama elections.   Really? Didn't PPP have Walker with 25 in NH earlier this week? It's just noise at this point.    A subsidized pool? Is this supposed to be a more profitable choice for miners?          I'm glad they are a loving family. Pardon me while I gag.   If a third party rises and takes over part of the agenda and vote share, then we will retreat again into a two-party system. It just won't be the same two original parties. Look back at American history; somehow, the country just sets up well for having two strong parties. There are many theories as to why.    That's big indictment of Stellar in this article:  "This is clearly the end of the line for Stellar. I mean, theyre not admitting that, but I mean, my God, you might as well be running a currency on an Excel spreadsheet. Stellar is now counterparty to a currency. And its a very weak counterparty. If Stellar Development Corp goes out of business, holders have nothing. Compare that to ripple or Bitcoinif there was no Ripple Labs, ripple the currency would still exist, just like Bitcoin. The new proposed Stellar protocol defeats the whole purpose of distributing protocol and theyve had to stop that because their consensus was broken. Theyre trying to pin this on Ripple but from where I sit, Ripple has never been more stable. Theyve never been doing more transactions and have something like 90 people on the team. I suspect Jed probably broke something about a month ago, but make no mistakethis is a catastrophe for them. This idea that Jed is gonna invent a new consensus system in a couple of months and their phony 4 million accounts will just sit there and wait   At its core, Stellar is no longer a cryptocurrency. Its a token form counterparty, and what is the risk of that counterparty? They dont disclose how much money they make. I mean thats why the SEC exists, right? So not only can you not rely on transactions of any kind going through because, as the sole validator, Stellar is the entire arbitrator of that, youre holding assets that used to be a digital asset that is now a digital liability. Thats a fundamental change, especially ironic coming from Jed, the purist libertarian. Now he runs a sort of unregistered central issuer of liability. Its really stunning.

Is Barry Bonds available to DH?   Wow, that's great news.    Wait, is that the Dixville Notch vote? Did all 50 of them vote already? Just kidding. Thought Christie would be higher, but the rest don't surprise me. NH has become a less useful predictor since the GOP has turned into a mostly southern party.    He's probably worth more at the trade deadline, given that there will be additional suitors then.       "If they lifted the blackout rules, I would definitely get MLB TV."  Me too!   Can we just have the election now?   It is getting pretty old to see this same picture on something like 1/10th of all /r/Bitcoin postings (slight exaggeration, but not by much).    Your feelings are understandable, then. I took you for just another expat complainer, but you have good reasons and experiences to back it up. Good luck to you. I hope things turn out well.    From the thumbnail image, I thought it was a ship!   You asked about BitShares. This allows you to send money to anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world, instantly, for (present cost) 3 cents per transaction. The "money" is cryptocurrency and, if you wish, you can keep it in one of the market-pegged BitAssets they have available such as BitUSD or BitGOLD. Holding these yields a small rate of interest, by the way. Plus, with TITAN, you can send BitShares currency or BitAssets using just a name/nickname (e.g. "Bytemaster") rather than an account number. Traceability is a bitch, though every transaction is part of the public ledger. In this way, it is like Bitcoin, not entirely dark, except that BitShares is faster and solves Bitcoin's volatility issues.   So if your idea of Dark is 'ink-black' dark, then BitShares isn't for you. But it does have some advantageous features for those who want to stay off the proverbial grid and stick it to the government using a decentralized approach that was carefully designed to be legally compliant. And I think that's right in line with what Maidsafe could also bring, if they ever are able to make the Maidsafe technology work. The author of the article cited in the original post is a big fan of both.    If you get strung up on a BS charge in that foreign country, your first call will be to that U.S. embassy. And suddenly, they'll be your best friend. If you don't think so, why do you still have your passport?   By the way, I'm not trying to be a jerk. I've actually been in your shoes before myself. And as the years passed, I realized I was glad I kept my U.S. citizenship.    Bitcoin's volatility issues have been solved, once and for all!   Really wonderful site!   Which tells you all you need to know about the GOP Iowa caucuses.   EXACTLY! Thank you. The going rate for these expensive elite pitchers is ridiculous, considering they only start around 30 games. Give me someone who can play the better part of 161 and potentially affect the score every time he's out there. Even on a bad day, he makes the lineup around him a whole lot better.    Maybe he should leave his party then. Complaining and saying 'no' is about all they know how to do.    Wow. That's an unbelievable margin. Uncle Joe, there will always be a City Council seat for you back home in Delaware.    That all may be true. I was surprised Colletti lasted that long. But I don't think anyone in baseball has seen a roster quite like the Oakland A's had last year. The depth and versatility of those players at multiple positions was a step beyond the typical Moneyball team, which everyone else has caught onto. Both Beane and Forst have publicly credited Zaidi with a lot of their innovations in recent years. Now maybe he doesn't need to go to those extremes with a larger payroll (Zaidi has a healthy respect for traditional scouting also). We will see.    There are a lot of very intelligent people who are libertarians. The main focus of their intelligence often is on other areas (e.g. engineering or tech) so IQ does not necessarily translate into smarter political decisions.   I'm not saying libertarians are bad, just that this doesn't make them more correct than anyone else.    I don't know, but Colleti was more old school than this crowd. Wasn't the platoon thing Zaidi's biggest contribution in Oakland? With Friedman and Zaidi, I think the ownership sent a strong signal they want to win with those technical tools. I'm not sure the roster really reflects that kind of team, but I would expect there might be a stronger inclination towards using technical advantages at some of the positions.    You won't sell many unless it's a closely related topic. Just sell on Amazon and trade your currency for Bitcoin.    Mattingly's going to have his hands full again. Especially with all the switches he'll need to satisfy his new Moneyball/platoon/shifting bosses.     	42
 We are sad country indeed.   A win for the train to nowehere.   I love that outfit on your cat.   Yummy!    Why we do need more red light camers infringing our civil liberties.   While we do not have a lot of jazz venues, Steamers is an excellent jazz club venue that gets a quality-acts.     Bad move for the Dodgers, Good move for the Padres.   Why we should care?  The agency should be defunded anyways.   Giving up South means that you are giving up favorable demographic trends that going your way.    Changing the minds of white Southern voters will be hard, but it can be done if you run a socially conservative, but a person who supports the economic views of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren could win down there.  Pick up the black and hispanic vote and you have winner.    In reality, a conservative Christian who properly follows the views of Christ teachings (in my opinion) would be socially conservative on abortion and other issues, but side with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders on economic issues. Bascially, that is what the current Pope Francis's view.   Not me.  Sanders or Warren who are the people that I will vote for.   It shows that they want a cabal of rich people to run the country.   That is what happened in those sneaky omnibus billa.   One group of people vanish from Existence right now would be the Koch Brothers.   The facts of the story demonstrate that the man is mentally disable.  The problem is the law where the bar is set too high claiming mental disablity.  The death penalty should be reserved for cold-blooded killers not for mentally  Governors have a fear to commute sentences because they fear a conservative, bloodthirsty electorate.  Instead of fearing the conservative electorate, do what is right and commute the sentence. Or better yet, commute all of the sentences on death row if you cannot trust the courts to do its job.  The death penalty works when the bar is set high for the death penalty and there are more commutations than executions.  And then real cold blooded killers who deserve will get what they deserve.    If you really interested in getting involve, please go to http::// ocprogressiveevents.info  There is a progressive community out there.  You just need to go that website.   I need to warn my roommate about your plight.  He thinks that he is going to have it easy when he graduates from RN schools.  He should be cautious that the market will not be so smooth sailing.   I have same the problem, but I normally move my eyes back and fore to stim myself. Another method is that I randomly surf the internet to deal with thensions   Well, it will be interesting to see what Chris Christie does now that he no has to worry about be tarnished by Bridgegate.     But you have to weigh the consequences of drinking.  Drinking can leave to DUI and possible jail time.   Please spare us. It just way to spike ratings.   Do these people care about the health of other people? At the expense of violation of some "strict interpretation" of the constitution.  Then, where were these people when Citizens United was passed.  Lets get honest here.  You are only "strict constitiutionalist" unless it meets    I always wear a conservative combination of a polo shirt and dress pants.  I also clean shaven and get my haircut monthly in a #2 cut.  I could careless about label, but I am interested in looking, neat, and presentable whereever I go.  My circle of friends could careless about labels, but also cares that you do not dress as a slob.  Being trendy is too hard for somebody with autism unless you keep up styles.  If you were really want to really learn about style, go to /r/ malefashionadvice or make check it out GQ or Esquire on a weekly basis for male fashion trends.    The best way is to get a psychologist trained in autism that is experience with autism and to set up a conference with the employer to discuss reasonable accommodations in the workplace.  The other way is to enter a job training program especially suited for Asperger's.  They are very, very hard to find. I am in one but only because my parents knew somebody and you have to live in the Orange County, CA to be in it.   Dude, it is a called a "crush".  NTs have them all of the time. That is completely normal.   Yeah, then Alec should be stopped at all costs.    The culture that failed to prosescute torture is the same culture that fail to prosecute banks and police officers.  That is why BUsh and Cheney should have prosecuted because the Obama administration would have the courage to prosecute the corrupt police   Real justice would have been Dick Cheney = Life Sentence Without Parole George Bush = 25 years + 3 years post-release supervision  Then we could have gone Lloyd Bankfield, Vikram Pandit, and James Dimon for banking fraud with terms of years between twenty to fourty year plus five years of post-release supervision.    Go away Landrieu! Lets elect a real democrat to replace them.   A lot of people call him a racial huckster.   My old AA sponsor told me this is worth going to.  Highly worth it.   One way that I learn on my own is by animals.  Having a animal like a dog and showing it constant love and affection is a good way to train yourself on how to show love and affection to the opposite sex especially hugging, touching, and cuddling. I still have a real hard time showing sexual assertiveness    I had the same trouble.  I had a psychologist who gave me advice but I never engage in his advice because my Aspie stubbornness made me more interest in my web surfing than watching TV and reading books that would help increase my understanding of NT emotions.   Which I do not understand from the GOP.  The GOP could fully fund their tax cuts by zapping defense budget if lower taxation is their primary goal over balanced budget. (Note: You cannot have both).   No, the ghetto of the OC is   1. The apartments on Standard St in Santa Ana 2.  The area near Beach and Ball 3. Certain neighborhoods near between Bristol/17th and Bristol/1st.  This is based on personal experience. I do not know all of the neighborhoods of Santa Ana and Anaheim.  But those areas I have been where it get skecthy late at night  And No, Lake Forest is not a ghetto    He is nuts!   Boo!   I think so if it is on a Sunday.     This one of the few reasons for supporting the Keystone XL pipeline.  But the pipeline should not be built anyways because it involves that the tar sands oil which pollute the environment.   I think Texas should be told that the death penalty should be banned.  While I like the speed that they get guilty executed, there are too many cases where   If the governor had an active history of commuting/pardoning death sentences, then I would have agree with Texas approach.  I support the death penalty but I also aware that they are many cases that where innocence does occur.  If I were a politician, I would have no problem commuting death sentences.  In my state (California), they are too slow to execute the guilty so victims get no justice waiting for a death sentence.  I think California should just scrap death penalty and make it life without parole.    If state has too much of history of executing innocent or mentally ill inmates, then its death penalty should be scrapped. In conclusion, I have no problem executing the guilty, but I also have a real problem with executing the mentally ill or innocent. Too many Southern governors are the type who inject the needle and ask questions later.  Also, lethal injections take longer execute people than short-drop hanging in Iran so maybe we should just scrap the whole concept of the death penalty in the first place.   What is the point of using cursive except for signing documents.   Well, then why not bring back Adrian Peterson then?   Knowing this guy, it is a bunch of BS. I just do not trust him.   That is why we should fight these guys.  We did so in Bosnia or Kosovo.    How about offering a class in personal finance?  I bet better financial literacy would helped people made better economic decisions.   That is too big of an ass for my tastes.   Being endless twelve-step meetings has taught to be vulnerable without losing confidence in oneself.  The idea is that learning that you have character flaws like everybody else and it is okay to admit your problems as long you intend to work on yourself.  Every great leader has vulnerabilities.  Look at the bible.  Every biblical figure has great spiritual traits but also fatal flaws.  Look at David and Solomon.  They were never perfect.    Then why should trust our companies ability to fight war.  The political class seems has to lost sight of this.   The real systemic problem is that police procedures are written to allow this to happen.  The jury has too much discretion in determining whether there was allowable use of force.  The officer has too much discretion allowing him to do this.  The rules need to be tightened to narrow officers ability for using of lethal force.  Violations of the law can result in criminal prosecution for involuntary manslaughter.  The activist class cries for justice, but does not look at the real reason which is the lax police procedures for use of force in this case.   If the grand jury testimony is to believe, the officer should use had use a nightstick, pepper spray, or better yet, a tazer.  I have watched a bunch of episodes of COPS and the officers on this show (who are well trained) would use the taser.  If this guy had a taser and did not use it, than I would vote him guilty for involuntary manslaughter.  Unfortunate, none of the stories that i read this morning failed to mention that.   1.  This is because big business lacks the internal controls to properly self-monitor itself and needs detail guidance from the government on how to do so. 2.  Government provides too much regulation to business instead of just saying "no" to a business practice and not permitting that practice in the first place.  Just saying "no" might be cheaper to a business than 'Yes can do this, but there is billion of rules to follow".  Maybe, business would rather have the practice outright banned and not paying the money to comply with regulation that allows them to engage in the practice but have all kinds of hoops to jump through in order to engage in the allowed pratice.   This is what you get from the GOP.  Care about big tax breaks for billionaries and try to create a cult of worship around the CEO and big business.     What we need to realize in society that there needs to arms-length distance between government and big business.  Big business and government need to coexist, but need to be independent from each other because it is job of big business to create the consumer and industrial goods for this country and it is job of the government to regulate the excesses of capitalism.  It seems that our country seems have to lost the properly distinguish the difference between the two.   I am not a big fan of the ARTIC.   Probably a deeply misunderstood individual. Still, I do not think this individual made his remarks in the proper context and the GOP cannot afford to have individuals who do not properly understand the cultural context of their remarks in leadership positions   I guess the US is being cut out now.     The GOP wants do nothing on this issue and they are take down the entire economy at the expense on making some guys wealthy in the short-term.  What a bunch of schmucks.   Benghazi was a just a conspiracy used to drive GOP turnout at the polls and making the Republicans have avoiding their views on the real issues.   Because it takes the pressure off Assad and prevents his regime from being overthrown.   Jail her for life.   Because this is what you elect the GOP.  The NC GOP does not care about you. It only cares about big business and its wealthy donors.   I wonder if this their last stand.   Imagine ten years from now when all of these countries have to fight over resources from climate change.  There will be rivers of blood as far as the eye can see.   The entire Middle East is burning up right now.  I wonder if there will be some huge regional war in the near future.   What is this merits of this stupid lawsuit?  It shows that they have no interest in legislating.  There is a lot that could be done even with this crazy GOP Congress, but they choose to do nothing.   That guy seems to have "foot-in-mouth" syndrome for making such remarks.   Remember. It is just satire.  Matt Groening has used the Simpsons to skew all things in Americana in Burning Man.   He would get a life sentence in California. 15 to Life.  He should get a 16 to 24 year sentence for what he did.   I dialed 911 because somebody who was epileptic had a seizure in my recovery house today. It turned out that the guy had a meth pipe in his possession. Go figure this one.  The firefighters and all of the first responders came.  The guy was rushed from the hospital and most likely is going to get a long lecture from the landlord.  Then he will be given the boot.    What is bs is this guy spewing?   30-75 years sentence for these fools.   Who is this chick?   Awesome!   Wow. I thought that he was one of the better GOP Southern governors.  I guess my assumptions are not true.   Isn't Ted Cruz is the leader of this group and the better candidate of this group than Huckabee.  There is no way that I would ever, ever give my vote to Huckabee or Cruz, but I just feel that Huckabee is just a retread.   This is a bogus requirement by the state.  This is a strictly faith-based organization designed for the fellowship of bible-believing Christians.  There are few student organizations that specifically cater to the spiritual needs of bible-believing, conservative Christians at a public university.   I was a former member of InterVarsity Christian fellowship in the 90s.  Even though I am a no longer professing Christian, I still think this is a bogus requirement because I know what InterVarsity really stands for and this CSU bureaucrats have no clue what the organization's real purpose.  And it has nothing to do with politics.  Bible believing Christians are often a tiny minority on campus and often need to find place to make friends and fellowship.  I was in similar circumstances in 1996 when I attended Cal State Fullerton because I had few friends.  InterVarsity provided me place to find friends and make friends.   There are bogus charges that should be thrown out.    You got to be kidding. Even very liberal countries like Sweden and Norway have women's prison, what planet is this women on.   The real problem is that people just do not have money to spend because all of the wealth trickles to the top.  How you get the rid of that problem is a million dollar question because it would take a large segment of the US voting population to vote against their own prejudices and beliefs, even voting in that format would be in their best interest.  Also, it means that you would have electorate that would ignore all of the campaign ads and actually would research the issues/candidates..   Would that not be the comment about Raw as well?   I definitely agree with him.  Students need to get engage in more voting to protect this democracy.   Depends on your professor's personality.  Some professor's might decide to laugh it off.  Others might cringe at it.     Didn't they close this trail for a reason? Just to prevent stuff like this happening? Yet, people still disobey the law.  I am concerned about this, but they were forewarned about this in advance.   This has to be a joke.   Why do they give him 62 jails for torturing a dog? He should sent to straight to the big house.   Yes, you can get progressive radio on the Internet.  Download the AM 950 app on I-Phpne. It is radio station for Minnesota that streams all of the major progressive raido stations.  In addition, you can stream Thom Hartmann's show at thomhartmann.com   No there is this station. It is Pacifica station, that is close as progressive as you can get. KPFT    Crazy   Well, even though he does a help for protecting free speech online, it is still wrong to hack into computer for the purposes of personal enrichment    I wonder how it long it take to pay off the Iraq/Afghanistan War debt/ 200 years?   Well, Isn't that why we locked up Johnthan Pollard for all those years?   SImple solution.  Make everything go brown unless it is drought-resistant.  Go look at any street in Arizona and you do not see lavish greenbelts like you do in Southern California. The lavish greenbelts are going to have to die out.    Southern California can support its current population as long people are willing to accept a barren landscape.    Corporations are not going to increase wages until the tax system is changed to place a disincentive on certain behavior  For example, every time that corporation use cashes to purchase its shares back, it is taxed for it.  Most people do not have a fundamental understanding of economics and how government work.  We can argue whether Austrian or Keynesian economics is better.  But the average voter does not so they are vote based on feeling or not vote it.  A vote for the GOP is basically sending the message. "We are tired of Congressional Gridlock and we want the GOP the opportunity to pass its economic agenda"  However, voters should understand the economic consequences of that vote, but really do not have a clue what the economic consequences of their vote really is.   This is US national news.  Please put in US national news under /r/ news.   Sounds like a false conspiracy theory to me.   In the US, you would never see this happen by placing a murder in a low security prison.   Sad to hear that people have to resort to such desperate measures.   That has to be a way that Shariah law allows for human rights. Or maybe does not and the Iranian needs to get off their dependence on an ancient legal system that is old, decrepit, and does not lead true to justice to victims or defendants.   Thanks for the advice.   Sorry to hear about it, hope your brother finds it.   I have never been impressed with Hillary Clinton.   He is certainly missing out on you.   Such sweet dogs.   Funny.   I still think that Burqa deprive women of their rights and is mainly done for men who have very backwards views on women.   Dragon Warrior.   I thought they were supposed to be the "good cops"   Is he that radioactive?   One way you drive money away from politics is to create a special appropriation line item in the federal budget - "Funding for Federal Campaigns and Elections".  All of the money used for federal elections for both President and Congress would come from that special appropriation.  It will never happen though.    I do not care how the employer can go. I want a job no matter how much the employer pays.    Nice place to walk the dog.   You might want to seek out some advice in /r/ jobs.    Another dumb liberal gaffe.   How many days in jail that he actually spends.  Let me bet that actually means 12 days (120 days * 10% of time served).   He will probably do time in a city jail so he will actually do the sixty days.  In OC, he would do sixty days in jail whether he was in the county jail or a city jail. It is ridiculous that criminals only have to do 10% of their effective jail sentence in jail in LA County jails.  I do believe in early release parole (1/3 of the county jail sentence but you would have to voted by a county board of parole) for sentence over 90 days, but not automatic release for only serving 10% of your sentence.    No wonder why the Sunnis support ISIS with the Shia doing stuff like this.   Why should we give them right to snoop even more? The answer is no. No, you do not deserve the right to snoop more because Edward Snowden proves that you violate the civil liberties of Americans.   That would be a tedious job.   Bus running at 1AM? I guess Portland has better public transit than Orange County.  There are only four buslines that run until 1:00 AM on the OCTA.   War Crimes!   So cute!   That is why probably a lot of old men watch Fox News and spend a lot of time on conservative activism (at here in the US).   If you are in recovery or a member of a church, there is will never be a problem.   Bad link.   In my opinion, people should be waned about the consequences of not finishing their education and the amount of debt that they are placed in.  University of Phoneix are designed for people who schedule's do not permit them to attend the traditional university structure and need to get a degree in accelerated of period of time.  Also, traditional public schools are have impacted programs where it i is difficult for people to get into competitive programs due massive amount of people who want to enroll them.   These companies are supposed to be for the student who needs a schedule where a traditional university does not meet their needs or the students who is in impacted major and needs to get the degree as quick as possible. Unless a student fits in two these categories and who has been counselled about the cost of the program, a student should not enroll in these classes.      First, you got put Bush and Cheney for war crimes than Obama.  It is only fit that they go first because they created the entire mess that twe are only in.     I would pick Jeopardy because it the game that I do best on.   I saw that guy on the freeway on Sunday.   Fuck. I would be drinking too if I were in your boat and I was not in recovery.  Its worth a fucking drink.   Nice photo!    $19.9 million for house in the OC. That is obscene wealth.   I would recommend living in Costa Mesa over by 17th Street / Newport. Lot of bars and clubs.  Nice play to live.  A lot of young people live there.   Accounttemps /Robert Half is the largest agency locally.  There is also Randstand, Volt, Accounting Principles, Accounting Advantage, Beacon Staffing,, and also Nelson.   What a tragedy!   It is cult of death. Off with your heads is a sacrifice to their false God of the Koran.     Why does LA have a problem with this.   We have no privacy these days, so what is else new.   How about cracking on all those hit and run deaths? LA seems to have a lot of them.   Mine is #ThereGoesMy401K.   A Chippendales outfit.   Because of we have a Constitution.   It should be tied to one's cost living in the particular area.  California should have $11.00 minimum wage because most of the state lives in high-cost areas. In Texas, which is lower-cost state, the cost living is much lower so the minimum wage should be $9.00.  The idea of an $15.00 minimum wage is ludicrous.  I think the real problem is that employers are too cheap in giving lower-wage workers cost of living and merit increases for time of service and high quality of performance.   Sentence is too high.  Should have gotten 30 years for the crime.  A person who would throw his wife off the building and plan to kill his life would have gotten 25 to life.  Premeditated murder is worse than this crime.  Unless of course this guy had two strikes, than the sentence is totally justified.   What is your budget like?  I went to several rehabs in the OC.  I give you a list of places but it depends on the budget.   I wonder if Boeing is going to screw up pricing on this like the Delta Rocket.  Google Delta IV site:bloomberg.com to find out more.    What about trying to portray yourself as emotional?   I would state it would be easy just to set a shop at the local Starbucks and just observe the women that come in and out of the store.  I could be work of number of computer projects, writing blogs, or reading the news, and if I find a chick that meets my criteria than boom. If you find a girl that looks a particulary interesting, than maybe say something to her.  This is probably the best place for people like to meet girls because I am a recovered alcoholic (with 18 months clean)  and prefer not going to bars.   This is an example of the kind of tactics that turns off people towards the environmental movement.   I would to go to a psychologist with PHD who specializes in ADHD who have significant knowledge of medication.  After meeting with the psychologist, it will be easier to consult with the psychiatrist.   Long Beach Library.  They blast the air all day in there.   Sweet little thing.   I adore huskies!   It should be banned for moral purposes.   That is art and not porn.   This stuff just makes me angry.  Makes me want to send the killers to the gallows for stuff like this.   The reason why the guy got 45 years was because it was his second strike and therefore, the sentence would have been 22.5 years if he had no prior strike.     What about doing at least a year in jail?  Even normal US parole rules requires offenders to do 1/3 calendar time before able to apply for parole. In some states, you have do at least 85% of the sentence.  I heard in the Netherlands, you have to 2/3 of the time.   Go blow it! Ted Cruz!   Long Beach Community College is probably your best bet on affordable housing in the area.  Alternatives would include Fullerton College or Santa Ana College. However, when attending any of three schools, you have to be very careful which neighborhood that you select.     These guys are so sick and repugnant.    Are our leaders crazy? Do we have supposed massive deficits that prevent us from entering into another foreign war?   Disagree,  Watch this and found why  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1_TVbJbsk    I think ISIS is more interested in expending its resources in stating a sucessful Islamic empire in the Middle East instead of trying to put a off massive 9/11 type attack.  If they do attack, it will some lone wolf inspired by ISIS to do a Boston Marathon style attack.   I would be real concern about than a real coordinated, precise effort.  There are plenty of young Islamists will to do a suicide bombing at a crowded even. And ISIS seems to be real good job of getting recruits from Western Nations and that is what we need to be where of.   I heard Lake Perris is a good spot.   Well, I know the issue.   Brutal crime, but still does not meet the standard of life sentence.  By Texas standards, this should have been a 30 year sentence but a not a life sentence because there was no intent to commit capital murder.   Should school districts be able to do this?   Some guy on the Route 43 told me about it and I decide to post the route for those who live in La Habra.   Cops going overboard.   Why would an atheist want to work at a faith-based organizations whose missions statement is contrary to both the LGBTQ and humanistic world view? It would be last place that I want to work except for telemarketing company.   That is his personality.

Based on my experience on the churches,from first-hand accounts of my friends (I am Unitarian Universalist so my selection of churches is a lot more narrower than other people)   1. Sanctuary- a good biblical church based on  2. The Crossing 3. First Love From First-Hand Experience 4. The Effect in San Juan Capistrano 5. Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church 6. Reverance Chruch   Church Number #5. I went to for five years before turning officially agnostic/atheist Church Number #6- I never went to this church except for one time but the pastor is an excellent teacher of scripture.  I am UU because I have issues with Christianity based on science and historical facts but not theology (I am moderate conservative Reformed Christian with progressive political/social leanings if I am a believer.).  The UU church fits my current belief system better than a Christian church so that is why I am a UU and not a Christian.      My average recently is about 140-180 MB per day.   The easier solution: Just force $3.00 tax on gasoline (except for fuel purchased for commercial purposes) and use it fund public transit projects.  That will people off the road.   ISIS=Nazis.   It might be your social cues that you are not even aware of.  I have autism and I probably send a lot of social cues to people that I am not where of.   Now I find this hypocritical. At least pay your interns minimum wage.    Why would you like to join?   Not everybody does. Go read any US conservative publication (The Blaze, National Review, American Thinkers, and others) and you will find Pro-Israel stuff.  Also check out the Jerusalem Post as well.   Crash of 2016?   He did $10,000 of dental work for me.  He is a very nice dentist and good guy.   Dr, Ronald Takai.  Expensive. But excellent dentist.   The CIA needs tobee  definitely starved off resources.  It needs to do more with less.   I never grew out of Atheism.  I never was an atheist. I am agnostic.   Great Analysis!    The real problem is that all these young men turn to Islam is the same reason why African-American and Latin Americans turn to ethnic-based gangs.  Both do so because there is few economic opportunties and joining a group like ISIS gives them a sense of purpose when the rest of society does not give D#W$W#$ about them.   DUIs do kill people.

It is time to defund the NSA and cut its budgets by 30%.   These are real terrorists.  If they would have the ability to attack America, they would.  They are worse than Al-Quada in my opinion.,    Actually, it is not bad.  I have gotten work the last two days just by unloading trucks.  The only thing that sucks that you have to be down there at 5:30 AM in the morning.     If you are absolutely desperate for a job, go to Labor Ready in Costa Mesa.  They will put you to work immediately once you complete their registration process.  There are also telemarkets galore in the OC, but unless sales are your thing, I would not recommend it.  I am working for Labor Ready part-time because my part time job fell though and even though I work in the mainly in administrative and accounting fields, those jobs are harder to get.

 Enough with all these cooking competition and 'rescue' shows. Show me how to make something good or show me where to find the best stuff to eat without forcing me to endure Bro Fieri.   PLOT TWIST: Road Head! Better call in the SWAT Team!   Yep. Duke's or GTFO   Also distant relative to 80's New Wave band Oingo Boingo https://youtu.be/Jm-upHSP9KU   Growing up in West Michigan (now considered a craft beer hot spot) my first time trying Bell's was in the late 90's while visiting friends at Western in Kalamazoo for a football game one weekend.   During that weekend visit we went to Bell's brewery (think I was 22) and I tasted and then drank several pints of awesome beers that got me much drunker than your standard Bud Light (coupled with a concert out back with the local Kalamazoo band Knee Deep Shag).  The beers I remember most were: Oberon, Two Hearted IPA, and Java Stout. Those 3 kinda changed my life as far as getting into beer. Before that it was all mainly high school and college keg parties with Busch Light, MGD, PBR Tall Boys or 40's of Malt Liquor because we all listened to gangsta rap and wanted to be like Ice Cube.  Today's beer hipsters may say Bell's or Sam Adams are too big or mainstream now. But you gotta remember 15-20 years ago nobody was really doing these kinds of beers or at least had any real distribution so it was pretty cool to have something like Bell's and also have it made in your backyard.  So now and forever: Cheers to Bell's from me. HopSlam is pretty good too (but IPA's are not that interesting to me anymore) and I've been out of the loop on other Bell's special beers and have some new favorite breweries these days. But I do still stock up on my 3 Bell's favorites whenever I come home to Michigan. :-)   To be fair, this person may lose their job on this movie set, but it was a judgment call to post the video and this hero decided the Internet needed some Quaid Rage. And they were right. Totally worth it.   Wow. Amazing. Both Dennis and Randy are at the top of their crazy game right now.   Has anyone ever answered more AmA questions? You seem genuinely excited to be here and have much more of a rsum and following than I knew. Stay cool. Definitely not a Rampart situation.      I've got a Tahoe Limited (last of that GMT400 era) and I still love it. Great looking trucks. Everything since then hasn't 'done it' for me. Gonna give it an LSX heart transplant at some point and retire the old 350 SBC. Also a 4L80 instead of 4L60.  	10
 Probably not very helpful opinion but as you said, these are ahistorical. There is a reason these swords were invented for the movies... If you're looking to cut than I'd hugely recommend a more traditional Katana. The curvature of the blade, while an artifact of production, helps hugely with slicing. The major issue is that these are slicing weapons, not chopping. As such if you're looking for functionality I'd go with what's been historically tested and proven. Just my two cents.   The Arcadia National Bar is perfect for a bachelor party... Beer and arcade games.   It seems like something worthwhile to learn, even if you don't do it for practical reasons. It'll certainly increase understanding of the iaito (shinken, etc) if ntohing else   I'll certainly try adding another Seppa, I don't think there is that much play, but it's something I've been toying around with in my head for a while. What about using some thin copper sheet and cutting my own seppa?   Treat it with Beeswax... I see where this could certainly help, but would you mind going into more details as to why and how you do it?  Thanks!   so I purchased a [tozando toryumon classic iaito]( http://www.tozandoshop.com/Toryumon-Classic-FAST-SHIPPING-p/070-toryumon[fast].htm) about 6 months ago and so far its held up well enough but it has developed a bit of play in the tsuba and the samegawa/ito is shrinking or slipping. I would imagine with a lower end iaito this would be common. I do practice frequently but take excellent care of my equipment. this raises a couple of questions  - what are some common issues with iaito (or any gear like hakama, etc) that are treatable or even preventable. what do you do that other might not know about?   E: [images of ito and samegawa wear]( http://imgur.com/N1MDaSK,H7vpooI)   Late to the party here but a couple of points:  - read up on [Miyamoto Musashi](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi). He is a historical, and legendary, samurai. Musashi was most famous for writing Go Rin No Sho (the book of five rings) which was a book on tactics and swordsmanship. Find a decent translation and give it a read. But prior to writing it he was heralded as one of Japans greatest swordsmen... Ever. Among Hus feats was defeating a man named Kojiro who wielded an odachi. Musashi allegedly carved one of his own from a boat oar to win the duel. Also relevant to you is his development of a style called Hyoho niten ichi ryu. Niten ichi ryu is centered on using the katana and wakizashi together and simultaneously. Very unusual.  - As an iaido student believe me when i tell you this: one handed odachi is not the best choice. Super human strength (mentioned in other comments) will work  only in suspending belief but not to anyone with practical historical context. The katana and odachi both are slicing weapons, not chopping. Propper cutting is wildly difficult to do even with years of practice.  A factor to consider is that a good cur must come from using your core muscles and legs. This requires both arms to do well. Clearly this is not an absolute as musashi was able to make effective cuts with one hand but its wily atypical.  - short of trying some classes yourself check out some iaido and kenjutsu videos on YouTube. Any koryu videos will provide a good context of what good Japanese sword techniques should look like.  - at the end of the day its your book and write what you love. Two quick and awesome reads would be the book of five rings and the Hagakure. They'll give you a lot of historical context. Just make sure you find a martial translation rather than philosophical or business related.   Oh for sure! but what you don't want to do is take them unless you're I'll. Sugar and especially salt have so many field uses (sterilization, treating oral injuries, etc) that its useful to have raw. Also this mixture will replace sodium, chloride, and iodine ions you lose in sweat, urine, and stool as well as help supply glucose to your nervous system to combat dehydration. Its not to be used to combat illness but rather to rehydrate and make the infection less life threatening.   One huge thing you can add to an altoids kit is salt and sugar. Instead of using packets buy a pack of drinking straws (preferably multiple colors) and pinch one end with needle-nose plyers over a candle to crimp. Measure in 1 table spoon of salt. Crimp open end same as first. Repeat for sugar. This will create waterproof and compact storage. The W.H.O recommends treatment for diarrheal diseases and dehydration with a mixture of salt and sugar in clean water (where there is no access to medicine or medical attention. Eg refugee camps). I'm on mobile and don't remember the ratios but a quick Google search will pull that up.   This. Everything about this. I can no longer binge on skittles since they fucked up that damned beautiful rainbow... Well maybe I'm full of shit and I still guzzle skittles like Jenna Jameson but I'm not happy about it.   Very much yes. All the yes.   I grew up in NH in the 90's (80s baby here) and we used to rock so.e serious spades. Down down baby was a second d/third verse. However there is absolutely nothing to do in New Hampshire except sing that song and throw rocks at trees. So there's that haha.    Its a common childhood rhyme in the US but it differs regionally or even between groups of kids. If you've ever seen the movie Big with Tom Hanks you'd have heard it.      Early Children of Bosom for sure. Especially the album Something Wild. Check out the track Red Light In My Eyes (pt 1 even has harpsichord intro IIRC)   Alagash White. Done.   Corbin Dallas multi-pass   Saw them tour off this album. Loudest damn set I've ever seen.   Same with our pup. We adopted her from the south in march and she was dead silent for about a week. Then as she got more comfortable she started yodeling every now and then. She sounds like Chewbacca bred with a husky; pretty damn funny!   Jesus, our dogs could have been from the same litter http://imgur.com/Wrx0hDO  We adopted her as border collie and Shepherd mix but our vet thinks she's border collie, husky, and basenji. Does your dog yodel or bark?  	20
 I know the feels, same movie and around the same age. Probably the most scared I've ever been by a movie.    Coincidentally, my grandfather made this for dinner today and my grandma was pissed because the two 'don't go together."      Even though it ended in disappointment on my part, that was definitely worth reading. Good effort for something so random!   The Railway Rifle is hands down my favorite weapon. I just wish you could get it in unmoddded F:NV.      YES! Came here to say that actually! Probably one of my favorite games from back in the day   Fucking hermit crabs. Don't ask me why, but those things terrify me.    Just got mine yesterday, 98 Cadillac sts. What was yours and what's your best story with it?   Hey /r/Cadillac I got my first car yesterday, the 98 sts! Let me start by saying that I love it, it drives nice and is pretty quick. However with it being over a decade old I'm sure there are some things that I can do to make it better. Any suggestions on what I can get done?   I'm surprised nobody said Bully. It really hits you right in the feels at several points.   This. Once I started the only thing that stopped me was the energy running out, and then I was right back on it when it came back.   Mine would be pretty sick :(   Mashed potatoes.. Imagine sticking your hand in that on a hot day   Back when I was a kid I had this dream (reoccurring for months) where I was at a carnival-like place and these Smurfs with knives would chase me around and eventually kill me. Then i would appear back at the entrance and it would keep happening until I woke up. May not be as bad as some of these, but it kept me from ever watching the Smurfs again.   Donkey Kong 64.. That game was simply amazing to me   That was the most depressing thing I've read all day...    That's actually exactly what I was talking about. Thanks for that   I really don't know the technical term for this because I just started playing recently, so I'll give an example. The tabs I found for the song raining blood have you holding the eighth fret of the fifth and fourth strings, and then you have to go to the ninth fret and then back (only playing these two strings that is). However, when I try it I can't make the transition without it sounding bad. So first, any tips would be appreciated. And if someone knows the term for playing two strings at once, please share. Thanks (:      I read the first three paragraphs about 4 times thinking I had misread it. Then I got scared that North Korea just took over the world. Then I saw the name of the website -____-   My god. I wish there was something like that around me.   Alright guys, I'm on a mission to get a picture of me holding a sloth before the summer comes. Unfortunately, I live in Pennsylvania. So does anyone have any idea as to where I can go to hold a sloth?   Well..  	24
 Yes. Yes, I did...   It's self mutilation... I was looking at piercings, clicked a link, and another... and ended up on the most fucked up site I've ever seen... THEN THIS!

 There is a reason that scholars call it the "creation myth" because that is just what it is. It all depends on who is defining what is or isn' t a myth. For instance, a man who possessed the power to raise the dead was crucified by Romans and came back to life, is considered kosher, but an indigenous peoples' belief that a turtle balanced the earth on its back is considered suspect. Both are myths.   support congress   I believe religion in any form is evil. They all claim to have the only true answers, their religious writings portray an evil and cruel god, they thrive on excluding others as a form of righteousness, and they interfere with my personal rights by forcing a religious viewpoint on the laws that govern my country.    Tell that to the evangelicals.   Lucy, Daughter of the Devil, totally riffs on religion, as does Moral Orel. The christmas special for Moral Orel is really black comedy at its best.   I can't believe no one has mentioned RobotChicken. The show did three Star Wars themed episodes that will make you laugh until you pee.   They introduced some dark stuff when brock tripped out and had visions of the OSI chief with his huge breasts. As if they couldn't have enough men with breasts, Sgt. Hatred grew a pair, too. Hilarious.   "Stop whining, Woodhouse, you'll get your spoon back."   What is the length of a day to their god? Does it conveniently conform to the twenty-four hour rotation of the earth? What does this concept do to your understanding of the creation myth?   gummy worms or bears   "Do you happen to have any toilet paper on you?"   He threw Bush under the bus and then stepped in front of it. I hope prosecutors can use his words to indite both he and bush.    And what Mitchell would have Americans believe is that they're stupid enough to not recognize his and other intelligence officials attempt to rewrite history, while trying to lessen the torture program's importance by comparing it to the current drone program, which is just as despicable.   I've argued that term limits are the way to go with the SC, but Roosevelt's plan was too broad for its time. I believe that term limits would allow a greater variety of law opinions to influence the court, as the turnover would create more opportunities for sitting judges. It would force the court to experience the same generational change that is occurring now at the local and federal level. As younger generations enter into the political process the nation has experienced a sea change in the way drug crimes are being prosecuted, and mj has become legal in many states. Another area we've seen progress is in lgbt laws that allow marriage or civil unions.   ty   The six month determinant is the number one indicator of whether an american is in the middle class. There are a number of other indicators, such as net wealth, but being able to live comfortably for six months on savings is the main factor in determining class.   Peter H. Irons.

A group of us went to a rave in Vegas, but the event got shut down not long after it started because under 21's were found sneaking in. The seven of us had already taken a couple of mdma pills and a gelcap of acid on entering the event and we now found ourselves pushed out onto the Strip. It was a blast. We went into the Bellagio, and someone had the bright idea that we should all buy drinks so that it looked like we were drunk. One of the girls bought this bright red frozen concoction that she just carried and never drank. The casino's rugs resulted in so many funny visions that one of our group refused to walk out onto it because she might sink. We noticed hotel security had begun following us so we left for the Mirage. Once out the Bellagio's door, my friend who bought the red drink realized it had melted and proceeded to dump its contents onto this beautiful marble entrance. If she'd been sober this would never have happened, but all of us immediately knew this could mean trouble. We hustled out of the area and on to the Mirage. We made it about 10 minutes in the casino before finding security was again following us, so again we left. When we arrived at Excalibur, security was already waiting but because we hadn't done anything really wrong they just followed us around. I think they figured out we weren't really drunk and were just having a fun time watching us trip. I still remember sitting down at a chinese restaurant to eat, and one of the guys asking if I was still tripping? I lifted the menu to turn it over and saw myself looking down this great deep well where the menu had sat. When I told my friends, we all agreed I was still tripping. I've been to Vegas on many occasions but that was the best time I've ever had.   One of the things I learned from military instructors for personal defense is that there is no such thing as dirty fighting in hand-to-hand combat. We were taught that in any physical altercation the ultimate goal was to end the threat within context of events. If fear of imminent death existed, nothing was off limits. For less serious threats, attacks to the softest areas of the body were encouraged. The throat, groin, ribs, elbow and knee joints, eyes, and ears were the surest means to end any personal threat. If someone wanted to complain, it was to be while they're looking up at you, and no longer a threat.   My mother became a prescription pill addict and alcoholic around 1972 after suffering a burn injury when her nightgown caught fire after she fell asleep with a cigarette. She experienced multiple skin grafts to her right upper arm, breast and neck area, taken from skin harvested from the back of her legs. I was an 8 y.o. kid with three older brothers who worked and a dad who labored at two jobs to afford the operations and the drugs. We lived in extreme poverty so my mom's injury and the resulting addictions only made matters worse. My dad refused to accept public assistance because of the stigma attached to its users so we were often hungry before and during school.      Many families become closer when faced with adversity but ours seemed to go in a different direction. Because there were seven of us, the competition for attention, toys, and resources could be brutal. I found myself taking complete care of my youngest sister who was born just prior to my mother's accident, and partial care for my two younger siblings, a brother and sister. Meanwhile, my mother seemed to have lost all interest in our existence after her recovery from injury. I didn't realize until three years after I left home for the military that my mother was an addict. We were so isolated by our rural existence and my dad's religiosity that our mother's odd behavior of staying up for days on end, and sleeping until the late afternoon seemed the norm. We were forbidden to use milk because she used it for her coffee, and we were expected to use powdered milk for cereal. I cooked for my siblings, but meals were simple things like PB J and mac/cheese, or grilled cheese sandwiches. I don't remember any of us eating before school because we were always late catching the bus.      By the time I left home, I felt disgust for mother's behavior and anger at my dad because he was a stranger. I believed dad took two jobs just because he didn't want to be home. My relationship with my mother was so poor, I didn't speak to her for the entirety of her remaining life, even after she got sober. And she did spend the last ten years of her life sober, but by that time the concept of having a mother was foreign to me. I didn't know how to feel sad about her death because she meant nothing to me. Today, I have no relations with my family because we don't know how to act towards one another. We are emotional strangers, only able to express the most primitive of feelings such as anger or disgust.      I guess a summation of my mother's sickness on my life would include a deep distrust of women, and a serious emotional impairment that keeps others at arm's length and promotes a lone wolf existence.   Then you have resided in more than one class, and it sounds like you've fluctuated between them. You are a good example of someone who might vote against their own interests.   Please tell me where you're getting that estimation of "tens of thousands of irish slaves"? I've studied and taught American history for the last fifteen years and have never seen that figure thrown around. As for whites being held as slaves, they were called indentured servants and served for a set, contracted amount of time. More time could only be added if they misbehaved. AA were not given that same courtesy.    The affordability of lawyers has been an issue in the US since its inception and I don't have any solution for this problem. In the case of Dred Scott, he was forced to run an ad in the New York Times begging for a lawyer to argue his case before the Supreme Court. As for for solutions to the SC's activism, it's up to Americans to demand a more just system. Justices are given lifetime appointments, proponents argue, to keep them above the political fray; this is completely untrue and justices need to be held accountable when they ignore the law in favor of political expedience. To date, only three schools of law are represented at this highest level - Yale, Harvard, and Columbia. This is a trend that began in the 1950s and it limits the social understanding of sitting justices who reside in that rarefied air occupied by the elites. I personally believe that the justices should have term limits of between 10 and 12 years, at which time new justices are vetted. This allows for a type of generational change that allows the SC to remain current with the times. As for the burbs and white americans, these trends are now driven more by the economy than race. I would argue that "poor is the new black."   Americans understanding of social class are horribly skewed, which leads to the majority of people voting against their own interests. For instance, depending on how you answer the following question, it's easy to pinpoint an individuals social class: If you lost your job today, how long could you maintain your living standards before having to find another job?   To understand racism in the United States we must begin with the Constitution's role, which placed a black person's worth at 3/5's of a white person. Most Americans believe the document was written to protect them, and this is true if they can afford a lawyer to represent them. But the average American can't afford to hire lawyers so they remain unrepresented under the Constitution. We also live at the mercy of how the Supreme Court justices interpret the law and this is extremely worrying. When presented with multiple opportunities to correct the country's flagrant racism - think Dred Scott or *Plessy v. Ferguson* - the SC justices throughout history failed miserably.      Our national government also failed to curb racism, but the real heinous reason that racism remained so integral to white americans is African Americans (AA) treatment by local governments. Red lining and covenants kept out not only AA but also jews, irish, italian, sicilian, and some eastern europeans. When these practices were finally deemed unconstitutional and minorities moved into mainly white spaces, white americans fled to the suburbs. This is the reason for the busing controversies of the 1970's when the government forced the integration of the school system. That trend has now reversed with AAs moving to the outskirts of cities and into the burbs with white americans repopulating cities.   I don't believe in god, but if we don't act soon on climate change the resulting damage will place Earth on the same irreversible slide that created Venus. When people say that we must save the Earth, I laugh, because the Earth will go on spinning, humans just won't be there to experience it.    Wait...you think it's okay for kids to drink dirty water and breath dirty air? You don't believe climate change and sinking cities are real? You must be tired considering the level of willful ignorance you observe.   I like to read articles like this because they remind me how batshit crazy the right is and what new fears it's conjured up. Republicans are rapidly becoming the party of cowards because everything scares them: women, immigrants, ebola, minimum wage, taxes, marijuana, unions, minorities, voter fraud, gun laws, campaign finance reform, industry regulation, equal pay for women, ...I'm tired of typing.   Sure it did...during the final testimony, the police reveal that two men matching the defendants' description were arrested after robbing several other small gas stations. Without economic inequality, there's no reason to steal.   Sure there was...the store owner was robbed and murdered by two guys. If there were no income inequality, the original robbers would have no reason to stickup the store. Then your story becomes about two guys driving through a rural part of the U.S. and they enjoy the scenery.    My favorite show is about a high school chemistry teacher who gets terminal cancer, but his family will be okay in the future.   He did all these things before his "brain disease" days.   Ronald Reagan was an informant for the FBI while employed as the head of a labor union. He spoke out against divorce but was divorced himself, and couldn't remember his son's name when asked.    Spelling.   religions -  because they all try to exclude people, and each claims it's the best, as are its members.   Let's flip your argument on its head and force politicians to undergo testing in order to determine whether they have the intelligence and ethical values necessary to represent the electorate in a just manner. The US believes in setting benchmark scores on our elementary and high school students that determine teachers' abilities and the students' learning. Isn't having an informed legislator as important as childhood education? As with term limits, contemporary politicians rebel against any changes that require them to prove competency, but imagine how many idiot politicians such a policy would weed out. If this had been in place in 2000, the US could have avoided the whole stupid Bush presidency.   I was banned from /r/askhistorians because I made a point of asking for citations and they didn't like my "tone." It's a pity because I'm a historian who believes in objectivity and truth, and the decision was disappointing.   Sounds like a Monty Python sex-ed class. If you've not seen the skit, it's a treat.   Not according to the soldier.   [I doubt you'll](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dying_vets_fuck_you_letter_to_george_bush_dick_cheney_needs_to_be_read) be interested in this link, but it speaks about a soldier's perspective on the Iraq war.   It sounds as if you are a very trusting soul if you believe everything you read on google. I only really trust books from the university press system because it uses a peer review method.   Now here is a fight Mitch McConnell could morally back by fighting for the workers' safety in a "coal industry" he so loves. But he won't. McConnell is an example of a politician who has an agenda that protects two countries - the US and China. He married into a wealthy Chinese shipping family and regulations that restrict coal usage are a threat to his home state of Kentucky, and his extended family in China. His dual interests in connection to the coal industry should be a cause of alarm for every American.   You can continue to blame Americans, but they're simply swallowing the news that the media is feeding them. If that news is of the truthiness variety, then it's a poisoned pill for Americans.   It's easy to blame Americans for not knowing the issues, but it's because they are overworked and lack the time necessary to understand the issues. However, the blame really falls on the news service industry because it tailors the news cycle for a specific viewer in order to increase advertising sales on its specific channel.      Politicians take advantage of the average American's lack of understanding by pushing the "fear" button. As an independent in a two-party system, I've noticed that republicans are especially adept at massaging American's fears. It's as if they took FDR's statement "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself" and used it as a campaign strategy. It's literally the party of wealthy cowards because so many things seem to scare republicans such as: immigrants, muslims, viruses, election fraud, gun laws, LGBT, unions, renewable energy, science, and campaign finance laws. By pushing the fear button, politicians have discovered an easy way of tricking Americans into voting against their own best interests. It's a sad state of affairs for a once proud nation that's claimed to be a democracy, but in reality its political system has only been another form of control by a white majority that now finds itself on the way to being a minority.   I bow to your censorship.   lol^      What he was known for, and what he really had, are two different things and easily confused by anyone desperate to defend w., the iraq war, and its relationship to the disaster simmering now in the middle east.   "And there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq."   Peeing - women standing up, men sitting down.   B.S.   I could've continued by saying that Republican legislators demand their pay be fair and keep up with the cost of living, but don't believe the average American deserves a fair minimum wage. They belong to a party that has staked its success on suppressing voter turnout, and by consistently and loudly telling the same lie about how to fix the economy.   An itchy perineum (taint).   I quit shaving four years ago and instead keep a neat beard by using a beard trimmer I've owned for ten years. A razor is two thin, sharpened pieces of metal encased in plastic, and probable cost pennies to manufacture. Screw Gillette and their like, for marking up the price of a razor by a thousand percent.   I love the history of words; how they came about and are attached to the past. One of my favorite words is "sinister", because it comes from the Latin word for left hand side - sinistre. In the ancient world, left handed people were viewed with suspicion, and it was considered one of the signs that the individual might be a witch/devil-worshiper. Mothers would tie their child's hand to their side in an effort to halt any proclivity for using the left hand.   I am an extreme loner. I've not had any serious friends in seven years because of the economic downturn's affect on my income. While I can go for entire weeks without saying more than a handful of words to another person, I'm okay with it. I grew up in a very rural part of the South, with only my immediate family for company; after I migrated to the West and lost contact with them, I've lived a quiet loner's lifestyle.      I know that my introversion interferes with everyday life, but I'm so accustomed to it that change seems almost impossible.   1. The "door ceremony": when two men approach a closed door, they will jostle for position over who opens the door, because the person holding open the door is in a "power" position over the other person.      2. The second action is taught as a method to identify whether someone is watching you. Look at your watch, and then glance around to see who else is checking their watch. It is instinctual for an observer to mark the time they observed you marking, thus unknowingly giving themselves away.   Economic equality.   Candy flip once a month!!!   USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.USA.   I'll start by providing a number of websites that provide information that are important for informed voters.      First, [This](https://www.congress.gov/members?q={%22congress%22%3A113%2C%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22} pageSize=2500) site provides a searchable list of Senators that give their biographic information and voting record.      Next, [This](https://www.congress.gov/committees) site has links to the subcommittees and their members; this is where the voter can find which committees the legislator sits on and offers a good indication of legislative power.      Continuing, [This](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) site will help the voters find their House representative, and provides biographical information along with voting record.      Additionally, [This](http://www.opensecrets.org/) site offers information about the money behind each candidate's election/re-election.      Finally, [This](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=ALEC_Politicians) site provides information for the voter concerned about those candidates with links to the ALEC program.   Religions are the most pernicious form of controlling humanity ever invented. They discourage the individual from investigating and reporting on truth by using fear of exclusion in this life, and the "next." They set individuals apart from society by claiming them "chosen" and the true stewards of morality, and identifying unbelievers as deserving of punishment for failing to have "faith." It allows one form in the middle east to impose a vile form of control over a small arab population, targeting women and children in an effort to destroy the inhabitants future. It provides justification for destroying the earth through climate denial, and control over women's health issues. In every form, religion is a fairytale that allow those with a guilty conscious to find absolution for past and future wrongs, and a tool for oppressing the individual.

The rich aren't stupid, but they can't think creatively. The most recent writing on this comes from William Deresiewicz, *Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite*. The wealthy are so sheltered from the population that it experiences a level of naivety in relation to poverty. The last time the US experienced such a level of inequality between the haves and have-nots was in the 1920s. Unlike today, the wealthy lived shoulder-to-shoulder with the poor because the car was still in its infancy, restricting the distance for travel to work. Additionally, when the Great Depression struck the US, the government didn't protect the rich. This had an equalizing effect on public opinion of the poor, as the former-wealthy found themselves at the bottom. Much of the support for New Deal programs came from this re-evaluation of public sentiment towards the poor, and the government's responsibility to uplift those most in need.      Had Wall Streets most powerful been left to Adam Smith's invisible hand, a large portion of the wealthy would've experienced a new reality, and you can bet they'd be demanding changes, just as occurred during the New Deal period.   I once considered myself a middle-class American, but I came from generational poverty that my mom and dad couldn't escape. To live a better life than my parents, I worked 2 jobs to make my bills if I lived alone, or one job and attended school while having a roommate. When first starting out, I blamed my parents' for the poverty we lived in, even though my dad was working two jobs to support our large family. He became a stranger in my life, unable to attend baseball games, help with homework, or offer any of the life lessons to ensure my success as an adult. I now realize the heroic sacrifice my dad made to keep me fed, clothed, and sheltered, by forgoing his own comfort and sticking around. He voted Republican.      Unlike the author, I do behave like a corporation in my day-to-day dealings with the corporate world. I think of this as 'exploiting hidden investment opportunities.' When I find a loophole in, for example, a corporate coffee shop or drugstore, I exploit it viciously. The same applies to energy companies, television/radio entertainment, and travel. And like a corporation, I feel absolutely no remorse for my actions. I feel no pity for the corporate world or the monied class because I know they care nothing at all for me. I encourage anyone and everyone to behave like a corporation, and look for ways to exploit them.   I have written about the Constitution and the Supreme Court's role in [validating unconstitutional ideologies](http://streetwithnoname.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/the-lie-that-provides-supreme-court-justices-with-lifetime-appointments/) that perpetuate economic inequality. The majority of the Constitution's framers were lawyers, a profession most colonists distrusted, which made ratification an extremely difficult task. Peter Irons addressed the class divide and its ramifications for the average Americans in *A People's History of the Supreme Court*. Irons stated that the Constitution supports a legal system that requires the individual to employ lawyers, a financial burden that deterred the most economically disadvantaged from filing a suit. Even the defendants in the most famous cases often needed pro bono assistance, as in the case of Dred Scott, who placed an appeal in the NY Times for representation.   I lived in a small Turkish city in the mid 1980s and the country was under military rule. I learned that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk fought hard to create a secular system of government because he understood the instability inherent in a religious system of government. It seems his vision is collapsing back into another version of the Ottoman empire that Ataturk despised. Turkey isn't joining the fight against Daesh because it would help the Kurdish people, and strengthen their fight for an independent region. This move may backfire, as Daesh could possibly overrun Turkey.   I've not heard about this and would appreciate if you'd give me a list of states this happened in.   I've [noted](http://www.truth-out.org/speakout/item/25369-generational-change) some of the author's complaints about the Supreme Court in the past, and support the idea of placing term limits on our justices.   Do you really believe Perry can pull those kind of numbers?   I salute your effort, but feel it's important to point out that Marx's theory wasn't critical toward the American economic system because it was still in the late stages of a market economy and hadn't made the transition to capitalism. However, from its beginnings the American form of government was designed to protect white male property owners. This created the perfect climate for the growth of capitalism.      I would also point out that former Socialist Presidential candidate Eugene Debs campaigned from prison in the 1920 election and received almost one million votes. Imagine that happening today.   Your post took a lot of time and effort, and I applaud the results.   I'm sorry there's not enough participation. I wanted to update and continue my discussion but I am also on deadline with a story. Here is the list of resources that I used:      Cliff Sloan and David McKean, *The Great Decision Jefferson, Adams, Marshall, and the Battle for the Supreme Court* (New York: PublicAffairs, 2009).      Doris Kearns Goodwin, *The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism*, First Simon   Schuster hardcover edition (New York: Simon   Schuster, 2013).      James MacGregor Burns, *Packing the Court: the Rise of Judicial Power and the Coming Crisis of the Supreme Court* (New York: The Penguin Press, 2009).      Peter H. Irons, *A Peoples History of the Supreme Court* (New York: Viking, 1999).      Ill begin with the construction of the Supreme Court, which consist of 8 Justices and one Chief Justice. There are currently 9 federal circuit courts with a SCJ assigned to each circuit, a tradition begun by George Washington when he chose the Courts first justices, which he did by region as a means to appease the infant nations eclectic population. A SCJ serves for life, unless they retire, resign, or suffer impeachment; the reasoning for the lifetime provision is to place the SCJ above the political fray. This rationale has never been true, and I would challenge one to find more than a handful of SCJ who werent ideologically committed to the political party that brought their nomination. Beginning with Washington, who chose only loyal federalists while president, each POTUS has searched for candidates that reflect their, and the Partys, ideology. Pundits describe a justice as conservative or liberal, but these are just code words for Republican or Democratic. The Courts mandate is to test the constitutionality of legislation, a power it derived from *Marbury v. Madison* in 1803. The Constitutions original and driving intent is to protect white, male, property owners from legislation that would impede economic growth. With this mandate in mind, the Courts decision to expand free speech rights in *Citizens United* played right into its wheelhouse. Let me explain why.      The contemporary Courts roots are planted in the Reagan/Bush Era, and both administrations stated strategy to place enough justices to gain the five votes necessary to overturn *Roe v. Wade*. The 1990 presidential election between Bush/Clinton was a mandate on the abortion issue because whoever won would choose a minimum of 2 justices. Clinton vowed to protect *Roe* with his nominations, and the people responded by choosing the Arkansas governor. Had Bush won, his nominations wouldve joined Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. Instead, Clinton placed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Joseph Breyer, a move that dampened any move to challenge the abortion law. I mention this because the abortion issue turned on the personhood of a fetus and when it gained viable recognition.      When it comes to determining personhood, the Courts record is woeful. Beginning with the *Dred Scott* case, the Court denied blacks any of the Constitutions enumerated protections. Chief Justice Roger Taney decision stated they were property, regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that they had no rights that the white man was bound to respect; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his own benefit. Historians describe this decision as the opening shot in the Civil War. The passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were the price to fix slavery, but the Court created two levels of citizenship, national and state, that it applied to *Plessy v. Ferguson*, and in support of separate but equal legislation.      As both the abortion and civil rights issues discussed above demonstrate, the Court is more comfortable ruling on the personhood of a corporation than that of society. The idea that the Constitution might protect the average American on gained prominence with the Warren Court, and the rights it provided are being eyed jealously by a conservative base that finds the rights of labor, women, immigrants, and the poor alien to the Constitution.    Do you want that sent to you in a message, or ...?   An exploration of the *Citizens United* case should consider the decision in context with the Court's long history of assigning person-hood as precedent. To answer how the decision effects Americans, a discussion should include *McCutcheon v. FEC*, which passed Constitutional tests based on the *Citizens United* precedent. There are many more elements to consider, however, I'm just spit-balling ideas because I don't know how detailed this post is intent on.   And Wall Street investigating Wall Street. It's an opportunity for climate denialist to cast doubt over an investigative organization that provides hard data on mankind's role in harming the ecosystem.   I didn't down vote you, but I will answer. If it turns out the money was used illegally, I'll recant my statement. A statement by the organization's oversight committee said the money was used in line with contemporary standards of similar agencies.   Read between the lines on this article. The investigation is simply another attempt by two climate-change denialists to discredit a regulatory organization.   I will look for the thread, pull it, and see where it takes me.   I enjoyed the writeup by the mods, but I want to caution that understanding the U.S. political system requires first answering who was the Constitution designed to protect?      Contrary to most American's understanding, unless the individual was a white male property owner, the Constitution was not written with you in mind. Additionally, when the word "property" was used in the Constitution, it was understood as a code for referring to slaves. Another fallacy was that the founders were a bunch of farmers, but nothing could be farther from the truth; most were merchants and forty-seven percent were practicing lawyers. This is one of the reasons it was so difficult to get the Constitution ratified, as most colonialists deeply distrusted lawyers.      Of even greater importance is the fact that the founders did not trust the public to understand politics well enough to participate in voting, considering it a threat to a democracy. You see, they thought the average person was not smart enough and chose, instead, to saddle future Americans with an electoral system. You can thank the system, and the Supreme Court, for giving the world George W.      Finally, the Constitution was written to support an economic system of growth, but it was not the capitalist system because that was yet to develop. Instead, it was written for a market system. All the laws that Americans follow were adopted as the economic system changed, but the original intent of protecting propertied owners remains the focus of our Constitution. It was only with the Warren Court that individual rights gained prominence, along with the passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act. It was only then that America almost reached its goal of being a fully democratic nation. Until LGBT individuals gain the same legal rights promised to American citizens, the U.S. will not be "the land of the free."   Theodore Roosevelt: He lobbied for labor rights before it was popular, and an eight hour workday. He placed aside a huge chunk of American wilderness for future residents to enjoy. He attacked the political patronage of Wall Street, once telling J.P. Morgan that the President of the United States answers to no corporation. He was tough and smart, willing to sleep on the open plains and able to capture a horse thief alone. He won the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Nobel Peace Prize. As N.Y.C. Police Commissioner, he is credited with overseeing the city's first honest election. There hasn't been another Republican close in stature to T.R., unless it's Abraham Lincoln, which was his hero.   This is just another Republican Party attempt to create an issue before the elections that can be used to further divide the public's attention. Anyone paying enough attention will notice that the Republican's traffic in fears of things that might happen, but there's rarely anything behind the issued to provide the truth. A couple of good examples of their fears include the war on christmas and voter fraud. Now we can add jihadists at the border.   *Continuum* is a sci-fi series built around economic issues and their influence on future government.   And you thought you were having a bad day.   Thank you for the reply.   I took the test because I seemed to have broken all of this subreddit's rules at some point in the past. Despite feeling confident in my answers, I must not have done as well as I thought.   It's imperative that the U.S. government remain separated from religion, or the country will be dragged back to dark ages. When government and religion mix the results are Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Ghana, etc. Religion remains one of the most destructive forces on this planet, and for all those who would claim that it does more good, I call bullshit. Knowing right from wrong isn't automatically imparted to those that are "saved". I don't need the threat of some distant, undetectable entity to live a moral life. Religion gives its adherents the permission to behave despicably because asking for forgiveness absolves them.   I wrote an [article](http://streetwithnoname.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/history-repeating-itself/) comparing the sociopolitical events at the turn of the 20th century with the same at the turn of the 21st century. Both were scarily similar.   So, I'm referring to the Republican's proven record of legislation when I provided the examples. I disavow any association with the list you provided, as I don't share your opinions. I have often been called a redneck, and a hippie when I was younger. However, your argument that the left has shifted is one I don't support. I believe Democrats have shifted right.   The OP doesn't really need any help bashing the Republican Party as it's doing a good job alienating almost everyone on its own. Women, LBGT, minorities, unemployed, uninsured, veterans, alternative-energy supporters, and homeowners are just a small sampling of the groups the GOP have actively legislated against in the last decade. If its members aren't commenting on "real rape," they're running away from the public rather than answer the tough questions facing contemporary Americans.   I believe most Democrats have shifted right over the years, becoming what were once called moderate Republicans. Living through the Clinton years, Democratic politics became actively pro-corporation, a quality once reserved for the Republican Party. The regulations that kept Wall Street from wrecking the economy since the 1930s were dismantled under Clinton, and Obama continues enjoying a cozy relationship with corporate leaders, despite his rhetoric. If Hillary Clinton wins the Dems nomination and becomes the first female president, don't expect any changes to the financial gambling taking place on Wall Street.      That being said, if the Republicans win back both houses, it will join forces with the conservative wing of the Supreme Court, and create laws that roll back the social advances made by the Warren court. This might lead to overturning *Roe v Wade*, denial of same-sex marriage rights, defunding or overturning of the ACA, renewed support for the carbon energy sector, and more support for the surveillance state.      If the Republicans win back the presidency, the party can pack the Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority after Ginsburg retires. Unlike the Warren court, which interpreted the Constitution as protecting the people, the Roberts court views it as supporting corporations. Additionally, the Republican control of all three branches of government may result in a continued weakening of the separation between church and state. The Hobby Lobby ruling is just the opening foray by conservative S.C. justices in regaining their idealized understanding of the good old days.   The simplest answer is that commerce follows the flag. American foreign policy supports the nation's economy, and the amount of "assistance" a country receives is in direct ratio to the amount of resources available for plunder to the U.S. business community.   That ten dollars would be better used helping poor Americans. But I do understand your sentiments. The Abrahamic religious writings are littered with examples of child slaughter, so its something acceptable to religious people who profess that killing is wrong. Israel now plays the part of a smaller bully that's protected by a bigger bully (US), and when the world protests its actions, plays the victim. Israel isn't trying to stop Hamas; it's destroying the Palestinians' future by killing their children, which is another well accepted and religiously sanctioned strategy.   I'm from the U.S. sickened and enraged that my tax dollars are being used to murder children.      Edit: Wow, [the Pro-Israel brigade](https://twitter.com/JIDF/status/31644105444425729) is out in force on reddit. I'm okay with that, but supporting the atrocities occurring in the 25 mile wide Palestinian territory is morally bankrupt. The Israeli government and its military lost any credibility after targeting those children playing on the beach. In fact, Israel began fomenting trouble when the US started talks with Iran, and countries of the world began recognizing Palestine as a nation. When Palestine applied for recognition with the UN, Israeli leadership went ballistic with anger. The disappearance of three Israeli teens gave hardliners in Israel the excuse they needed to seek an invasion, and unjustly claim the role of victim. It's almost as if Israel has said to the international community, "Okay, if you want to recognize the rights of Palestine, we'll just wipe them off the map."      I'm not okay with that.   Wrong...the greatest example of Supreme Court power is the subjugation of black Americans until 1965. In the Dredd Scott decision, Chief Justice Taney described black Americans as subhuman and lacking intelligence. In the Plessy case, the court decided separate but equal was appropriate. I would call the ability to keep an entire race of people in subjugation a mighty form of power.   If he went kitesurfing on 7/20, did it take them ten days to find the body, or did it take him ten days to die? The news report for this story is dated July 30.   I agree with you that discussions should stick to the issues, instead of pointing fingers to muddy the narrative.   The power of a handful of supreme court justices to choose the direction of American law over a number of decades.      When I mention this in reddit political conversations, people push back claiming the court has no real power, but this is simply untrue. It decided a presidential election, whether corporations deserve a voice in the political system, who gets health coverage, and when religious prayer is appropriate.      The media ignores the ideological battle that shapes the justices' view, as though the group is politically neutral. Additionally, too few Americans know the history of the judicial branch, and the changes that combined to produce an out-of-touch Supreme Court.   I missed the foreshadowing you mention, but now it makes sense. I viewed the way the characters died (sun or freeze) based on the morality they portrayed. The captain, psych officer, nuclear engineer, and his female friend all show a deep appreciation of other people's lives, and die by fire - which is considered a good death.      The communication officer and engineer are more concerned with their own lives or the mission's success, and ignore the needs of others. The comm officer is willing to take the last space suit to survive, and the engineer is willing to murder the grieving nav officer to save oxygen. Both die by freezing, which is an irony because they're so close to the sun.   It's been a while since I've seen the movie, but I'll try.      The Captain dies first during a space walk to repair the heat shield that protects the ship. As the ship's computer makes the necessary corrections to the shield, he is exposed and vaporizes.      The communication's officer is the next to die. After the ship docks with its long-lost counterpart that was launched years earlier and considered destroyed, the exploratory crew become stranded when the ships unexpectedly break the connection. As the new commander, the communications officer demands the derelict ships only spacesuit, but the engineering officer gives it to the nuclear engineer because of his necessity to the mission's completion. This is a form of moral weakness and fear of death. To make it back to the home ship, the communications officer and the engineer must wrap up in the derelict ship's insulation to survive the cold of space in the short interval between being fired from the derelict's airlock and their ship. Realizing that someone must remain behind to operate the airlock, the psych officer volunteers, acknowledging he's the least important to the mission. The communications officer misses the airlock and floats into space where he is shown freezing over before hitting a portion of the space ship and shattering.      The psych officer enters the derelict's observation room and removes the windows protective tinting, exposing himself to the sun's full force, vaporizing him. As the gentlest and most sympathetic character, this is a good death.      After the ship looses its botanical garden, the primary source of oxygen, to fire, the remaining crew are left with only enough oxygen to support four of the remaining five crew members. The crew decides to kill the navigation officer, who is under constant sedation, and the engineer takes responsibility for the duty, but the nav officer has already committed suicide by slitting his wrist.      The female botanist always appeared more concerned with the health of her plants than for her fellow crew members. She is stabbed in the back by the derelict ship's captain, who boarded the ship in secret, and set the garden on fire. In the end, she's seen with dead eyes looking at the only surviving plant cupped into her hands.      The engineer freezes to death as he climbs into a vat of liquid nitrogen in an attempt to return the malfunctioning computer to operational status. He succeeds but died in the process. As the most morally ambiguous member of the crew, his focus was solely on the mission, despite the human costs.      The final two crew members died as the ship plunged into the sun, while its nuclear payload explodes. The derelict-ship captain's death is more uncertain as he may have died from a fall or from the explosion/dive into the sun.      Burn, freeze, or knife - a consistent theme.   *Sunshine* was a very interesting sci-fi movie because it was well cast. I also found a theme in the way the characters were killed off. The characters that are sympathetic for the viewer died by fire, while the characters showing weakness of moral apathy died by freezing. Two died at human hands, and by knife. There is a consistent theme via death throughout the movie. It's a deep movie that asks some interesting questions.   These quotes come from an [interview](http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view a=1725) done with Judge Thomas B. Griffith. His statement directly contradicts the stand taken on this court issue.      Carter: You served in the legislative branch (as Senate legal counsel), in the executive branch (as an appointee to the Title IX Commission), and you now serve in the judicial branch. Many recent political battles have stemmed from the disputes about the appropriate balance of power among the three branches, and much has been made about the "accountability" of the judiciary. How do you view the role of the judiciary generally, and how would you describe the judicial philosophy of Judge Tom Griffith?      Griffith: I believe that life-tenured judges in the federal judiciary have a very distinct and limited role. They must avoid the temptation to make law or to substitute their own judgment about what is right in any given case for what the people have already decided through legislation or regulation or for what their courts and the Supreme Court have already decided in case law. The role of a judge is to apply the law to the dispute at hand and to avoid the temptation to substitute his or her personal views about what is right.      Man is the cruelest animal.   I've looked into this further and Reuters edited the lede after I posted the story. For any article from Reuters, I always use the first paragraph as the submission title for the article because Reuters almost always puts the lede in there.   I've gone through this with other moderators. I use addthis to post articles from my news feed, feedly, and this is the title that the site uses. Go to the article and read your tab and you will see the true title the website used.   This quote comes directly from the article and reflects a substantial argument.   I agree with your bias opinion concerning NPR, and when I read a news source I pay close attention to the writer's choice of descriptive words and overall tone. A good example is that NPR originally followed right-wing media outlets in calling the Affordable Care Act "Obamacare." By using that term, NPR perpetuated the negative image of the legislation, a mistake it has since worked to correct. I can recognize immediately the bias in an article by focusing on tone and word choice, but visiting multiple media outlets (Reuters, AP, AJE, NYT, WaPo, Slate, The Nation, Scientific American, LA Times, Salon, etc.) offers the most well rounded view.    *Lucky Number Slevin* or *Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang*.   *Sunshine* and *Mr. Nobody* are both excellent movies that deal with existential issues, with the former combining sci-fi and horror, and the latter providing humor.   A well thought out list, thanks.   The early 1900s were years when the political machines on both sides thrived using a patron system. Tammany was a big Democratic political machine in New York but its influence stretched to the White House. Mark Hanna was the big political boss for the Republican party and after Roosevelt left office and Taft took over, Hanna was able to exert considerable control over the presidency. He was aided in this by the Platt machine, and by Roosevelt spending a year abroad big game hunting in Africa. Taft didn't really want to be president, instead wanting to be a member of the Supreme Court. When the promise of advancement to the Supreme Court was dangled in front of Taft, it was like the horse and carrot being led wherever the driver pointed.   Again, you're correct.   Now I get it...sorry if I seemed a bit harsh.   Nice list.   If you're a truly conservative Republican, how can you continence governance by a foreign citizen?    I like Taft, as well, but his desire to please Republican bosses made him a puppet-like president.   Would you place them in that order? That's a very good list, by the way, although Coolidge is a bit of a surprise. What do you like about him?   I don't know that many will respond to this post because reddit appears very liberal, but I also don't want to leave any presidents out of the discussion.   Suburbanization began with the introduction of the automobile, however, the number and class of people who could afford the move didn't increase until after WWII. After the war, the Kaiser corporation, a former U.S. battleship producer, applied assembly-line techniques to producing houses. Flush with wages from working for the war effort, Americans could afford the mass produced housing, and the suburban landscape exploded in popularity.   I see your point about composition vs. development, but I view the question from that of an urban historian. A more complete understanding of my view can be found in *My Blue Heaven: Life and Politics in the Working-class Suburbs of Los Angeles, 1920-1965* by Becky Nicolaides. Because working-class suburbs bordered upon mixed race housing, there was more friction among whites and non-whites that eventually erupted in the Watts riots of the 1960s, according to Nicolaides. She describes many of the points you mentioned in your post, such as residents building their homes in a piece-by-piece fashion, and the close proximity to industrial buildings in the neighborhoods.   You've done a fairly thorough job of making a case for the car's influence on American cities, but there are also other factors that influenced the suburb's rise. Kevin Kruse's book, *White Flight*, describes how race impacted the rise of suburbia by allowing white Americans to escape the city's grip. Red zoning and covenants, made suburban areas more attractive to whites by excluding non-whites as homeowners. The failure of this policy is well documented by Thomas Sugrue in *The Origins of the Urban Crisis*, a superbly researched book about the decline of Detroit. If you would like more reading material about L.A., Allen Scott edited a wonderful book of essays entitled, *The City: Los Angeles and Urban Theory at the End of the Twentieth Century*. It is a thick book, but well worth the read for L.A. residents.   I will not agree to disagree with you because we would both be wrong. As I've stated in the past, I will trust my colleagues' assurances that my statements are appropriate over that of a mod. They reminded me that a reddit mod in all likelihood has never presented a peer-reviewed paper for publication, nor forced to defend it before an audience of history professionals. In reality, it's a minor subreddit on a site that most historians are unaware exists and that I infrequently perused. As for your reply, it's as pithy as any I ever posted with the exception that I wouldn't have wasted as much time on it.   You find the truth upsetting, but when I was invited to join this subreddit, it was with the direct intent of providing a level of expertise regarding questions of American history. As for requiring citations, this comes from years of requiring students to prove the thesis under argument. That's what historians do, by standing on the shoulders of giants and recognizing their contributions through citations we set historical precedents that will hopefully lead to the truth. It's just this mindset used by creationists to decry evolution, and the mods buy into it when citationless statements are given as fact because it has a feeling of truthiness. You may continue to take my vocal stance against not trusting uncited sources as rude, but I consider it a prudent practice. However, you did decide that one of my posts was uncited and politically motivated, so there's some hypocrisy going on with your statement.      As for the statement about being downvoted, that was in a q a about making the subreddit more professional and trusted, and I received replies from mods in agreement that directed me to use the report button to alert the mods. I stand by statements about the subjective quality of language, and its ability to "make" people feel an emotion. If something in my language hit a nerve, I would recommend exploring why it made you feel "bad" in order to overcome the offending complex. Finally, the "veiled threat" post was in response to a mod's comment that I not further pursue the matter in question, by suggesting it would get me banned. That is not really a veiled threat, as it's just a threat. I don't consider myself confrontational, but I will defend my position with citations and logic until they are proven wrong. The comment I was banned over was an observation that an event as historically important as the call for war among nations in WWII contained *x* number of comments but no citations. When I last checked, fourteen other redditors agreed with my assessment. Apparently pointing out this inconvenient truth is considered rude. It's also why I expected trouble with r/askhistorians because its mods promote the subreddit as being eminently trustworthy when in fact, Wikipedia requires citations to support a statement or a *citation needed* flag is attached. Conversely, r/askhistorians just shrugs its shoulders and places the burden of trust on the reader, who must ask for a citation.    Perhaps I've mistaken the purpose of this subreddit. I was under the impression that it was a place to come for trusted answers to history related questions. Now that I understand it's only around for the novelty or trivial questions that don't require sources, I won't take things so seriously. In fact, I think I'll just stop participating in this self-important subreddit so as to no longer hurt the moderators childish sensibilities.   I have plenty of sources on WWII and the call to war, however, I don't give out information to a question without an appropriate source to cite. When I read answers without citations attached, I consider it conjecture or hearsay, and not to be taken seriously.   Twenty-seven comments reported, but I can't find a single citation among the lot. It's all opinion, or "I'm a huge WWII history buff," without any substance.   I suggest searching the [National Museum of American History](http://americanhistory.si.edu/), the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/index.html), and the [Internet Archive Digital Library](http://archive.org/).   Beware Greeks bearing gifts.   I don't have a copy of the radio announcement, but you can see a newsreel about it [here.](https://archive.org/details/tobacco_pew27a00)   This submission's relationship to history is obvious to the viewer, however, r/history mods have removed it because I didn't leave a summary telling reader what to think about the submission. I believe r/history redditors are smart enough to figure out what's going on in the link. I submitted the post because it's interesting and about history, but I don't want to lead any type of discussion, give you my thoughts and feelings on the matter, or provide inspiration. In fact, this is probably the last item I'll submit to this subreddit.   Reading biographies from people of Philby's era, many appeared deeply offended by the economic disparity in the surrounding world and believed that either communism or socialism offered a solution. Students absorbed a more liberal message from professors at college, much as happened in the 1960s, with the Freedom Rides, Civil Rights, and Vietnam War protests.   Good call. Philby was a member of the "Cambridge Five" that burrowed so deeply into British and American Intelligence. Two members of this group, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, were credited with alerting the Chinese to American military positions during the Korean War. The Chinese learned from these Brits that the Americans were unwilling to use the nuclear option and would not invade China if its troops aided the N. Koreans.   No one important.   Anyone interested in understanding the impetus for climate-change denials should read [this](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/26/sponsors-of-pentagons-alarm-raising-climate-study-/) story from the Washington Times about "Retired officers poised to profit after Pentagons alarmist climate change report". The story quotes the United Nations as denying the evidence for climate change.   You are not a source, and lacking citations, I can only take your comments as opinions and untrustworthy.   Wow...good article by the WaTi on the military experts who are implementing positive change on the environment and making money while doing it. The writer turns his laser-like attention on where these guys get there money. Now it he could only do the same investigation on the crooks on wall street who wrecked our economy.      edit: For those too thick to notice, this is sarcasm.   Can you provide me some sources that support your thesis? I stand by my sources offering proof of Soviet superiority in the intelligence sector.   The Soviets ability to put Sputnik into orbit, and its plans for spy satellites, pushed the U.S. to develop a technical intelligence. Stalin's spies placed bugs, and tapped phones at the highest levels of American government. The U.S. contemporarily holds the edge in electronic intelligence collection, but discounting the advantage of human intelligence (humint) is foolish. The Soviets placed more top level agents in the CIA, NSA, FBI, DOD, MI6, etc. than Americans, and the amount and quality of information they collected far exceeds anything the U.S. could manage.   Roosevelt suffered from a crippling affliction, and treatment required regular contact with average Americans. In addition, his wife visited and actively supported the nation's poorest. And mentioning Bush as a credit, and deserving of entrance to Harvard because of his intelligence is humorous.   I'm surprised no one mentioned espionage, but in the field of intelligence gathering, the USSR out-spied the US. This ability allowed the Soviets to produce an atomic weapon in 1949, a far shorter time frame than U.S. intelligence sources predicted. It also gave them a edge during negotiations during and after WWII because recruited sources provided information about where U.S. policy was firm and where it could me manipulated.      In contrast, the majority of foreign agents the U.S. tried to infiltrate into the USSR were captured and killed or placed in Gulags. Stalin's network of spies within country kept a close eye on any foreigners because he distrusted any non-Soviets. WWII Soviet army veterans were also considered untrustworthy by Stalin because of contact with Western decadence and targeted for Gulags, as well.      Sources:      1.

Legally buying an election - brought to you by the Supreme Court and the RNC. If you can't win election with the popular vote, just buy it.   If this is the case, I commend Harvard's administration for helping students. My point, however, is that we have a narrow range of higher education institutions providing our future presidents' with socialization and education in their most formative years. When our presidents attend smaller institutions, such as Reagan and Johnson, their attitudes reflect an inclusive and empathetic attitude toward the most economic disadvantaged.   You don't see the inherent contradiction in providing lifetime appointments based on a blatant falsehood? The selection process for a SCJ requires the appointee be vetted through the legislative branch, which decides on whether the seeker is politically acceptable. The belief that a lifetime appointment automatically creates an impartial judge is laughable when viewed in this context. A quick glance through the court's history on civil liberties reveals that its members followed the ideological tides by supporting both slavery and separate-but-equal laws when any impartial judge, and history itself, would view them as a moral outrage.   No problem. From its very beginnings the SC has been driven by political ideology, and the manipulations of presidents to place like-minded individuals in this seat of power. The case that provided the SC with its power over judicial review is a good example of this. *Marbury v. Madision* hinges on the fight between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans to control the judicial character of the SC. The fight to control the court's ideological makeup continues with each President, the exception being Jimmy Carter (no appointee). Rather than placing a justice above the political fray, a lifetime appointment allows SCJ to "treat the Constitution as a thing of wax, to be molded into any shape the members so desire," as T. Jefferson warned.   I am currently researching the Supreme Court's history to understand why American historians teach that Justices receive lifetime appointments in order to remain above the influence of the contemporary political climate when this is clearly untrue. I've read and made notes on the following:      1. Cliff Sloan and David McKean, The Great Decision Jefferson, Adams, Marshall, and the Battle for the Supreme Court.      2. James MacGregor Burns, Packing the Court the Rise of Judicial Power and the Coming Crisis of the Supreme Court.      3. Sandra Day OConnor, Out of Order.      4. Peter H Irons, A Peoples History of the Supreme Court.      5. Frederick S. Lane, The Court and the Cross.      I'm searching for additional readings that discuss the cultural and social aspects of the scholastic atmosphere S.C. Justices encountered. Any help on this is greatly appreciated.    To answer this question, visit renowned oral historian [Studs Terkel's](http://conversations.studsterkel.org/index.php) website. He does a wonderful interview with [Cesar Chavez](http://conversations.studsterkel.org/results.php?keywords=cesar+chavez startdate= enddate= title= summary= nameI= gallery=) that addresses your question.   I have a graduate degree from a university not in the top 10, and would rate it as good, if not better than an Ivy League graduate. Gaining knowledge is a personal journey with results dependent on the individual. A degree from an Ivy school imparts a sense of sophistication and learning earned just via the school's name - a pedigree of sorts. It also means a sheltered understanding of the greater world. The two presidents who didn't attend a top 10 school were Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. Both presidents had a profound influence on the average American, with Johnson launching the war on poverty, and Reagan redefining the definition of poverty. Is it difficult to recognize the influence education had on these two men?   I can't speak to every elected president has shared the urge to institute change, but I can discuss the commonalities of the presidents who were elected in the 20th and 21st centuries.      First, the U.S. elected 18 presidents during this period, and seventeen graduated from college. Only Harry Truman failed to attend college. Fourteen of the seventeen presidents graduated from a school in the nation's top [20 as ranked by U.S. News   World Report.](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/data) An education at these universities costs an average of $43,000 annually.      The complaint that our leaders are out of touch is absolutely correct, as they are educated at elite universities that celebrate exclusiveness. The imbalance on the Supreme Court is even more alarming as 5 Justices are alumni of Harvard Law School, 3 Justices attended Yale Law School, and a single Justice attended Columbia Law School. All three schools are ranked in the top five universities. That's a very narrow scholastic range for such a diverse country, and it results in an elitist point of view.   I feel the same way sometimes, but if I can't provide the citation, I just forgo answering the question.   I know this will be down voted viciously, but I've had run in with the mods for the tone of a reply comment. My complaint is that the mods allow too many responses that have no citations. Users are simply regurgitating information they saw in a movie, or on a History Channel special, without investigating the veracity of the information. If the mods maintained a level of consistency regarding the citation of information, I would trust this subreddit much more. Additionally, while wikipedia is a great place to find sources on a subject, it's too susceptible to manipulation, and should have limited trust as a source.   I began working in the tobacco fields of middle Tennessee at eight years old in the early 1970s. I made .25 cents hourly, and by the time I left the fields for more traditional employment at 16 years old, I was making $2 per hour. My family didn't own any of the tobacco fields; instead, I worked in a neighbor's fields, or any of the other area growers needing help. I did everything from laying out the seed beds in preparation of the spring planting, to stripping and bundling the leaves for its eventual sale. I once fell off the top rung in a three story barn while hanging the tobacco leaves, freshly cut from the field, and in advance of the firing process that gives the tobacco its brown, cured appearance. Because I was small, I fit well in the small spaces at the barn's roof, but the inside temperature was well in excess of 100 degrees. I passed out and woke up in a bed of tobacco leaves in the tail-bed of a truck. I was told I fell right into the back of the truck, which probably saved my life because the leaves cushioned my fall. The guy I was working for was irritated because it slowed work down. He watched as I drank two big cups of water, and then sent me right back up to the top tier. It's extremely hard work, but the only paying job in the area, at the time. Tennessee labor laws didn't allow a child to begin work until age 16, and even if it allowed for an earlier age, the area was so rural that only tiny country stores offered employment. Additionally, most of those jobs went to the store owners' kids.   I would also point out that most of the supreme court justices from this era were former lawyers for the american railroad industry, who brought their unique perspective of capitalism from that business sector.   Looking at the bigger picture, why has the Supreme Court shifted its support of free speech in elections from protecting voters to protecting corporations and large donors? It all begins with precedents and Citizens United set the stage for McCutcheon. More recently, the Court decided to break the barrier between church and state by deciding prayer before government meetings is acceptable.      Taking a closer look at the Justices themselves, five possess law degrees from Harvard, three have law degrees from Yale, and one attended law school at Columbia University. These are among the top five universities in the U.S., with the most millionaire alumni, and a rarefied atmosphere. The cost to earn a law degree from these universities averages $280k, well beyond the financial reach of average Americans.      As for religious convictions, there are six Catholics and three Jews sitting on the court. This doesn't bode well for the pro-choice crowd if another attack on Roe v. Wade takes place. How long will it take corporations to earn religious rights from the court?      We have six men on the court who bring a sense of entitlement to their positions, while the three women offset it with empathy. Most of the court's members have operated within the elite atmosphere populated by the very wealthy, and have lost touch with average American. We should be very afraid of the ideological reach enjoyed by the Supreme Court, and question its pivot in free speech from that of the average American to the wealthy and corporate elites.   The influence of the Supreme Court is overwhelming in American history. I would point you to the Dred Scott case that left an entire population of black Americans in slavery until after the Civil War. Next, I would remind you of the "separate but equal" hogwash in the Plessy decision. Explain to those millions of lives that the Supreme Court has no power and played a limited role in keeping them enslaved.      Wow...the truth has no place on this subreddit.   This is original content that examines the political impact of charter schools.   Good response...this helps me understand the argument against lifetime terms.   I didn't offer hypotheticals, instead providing two concrete examples of when a Supreme Court decision was ignored. Your prohibition examples are more of a straw-man argument.   Thank you, as this is precisely the way I view the powers of the Supreme Court.   Can you provide me with some sources so that I can understand this issue better? I want to trust your word, but the "political question" explanation is one I've not heard before.   The Supreme Court has the final say on whether a law is constitutional, and if not, it is struck down. The president and congress can legislate all day but if the law's considered unconstitutional, it is overturned. While the court doesn't have the power of enforcement, it still makes the laws. The U.S. is a nation built on laws, and I can only think of two instances when a president ignored Supreme Court rulings: A. Jackson and the trail of tears, and A. Lincoln and the suspension of habeus corpus during the civil war years.    Thank you for the source, but Hamilton describes the judiciary as the weakest of the three departments. When did this change, as it is by far the most powerful of the departments today?   I appreciate the detailed reply, and you appear to say that Justices are appointed for life to remain aloof from politics. This appears to be the common argument, but are there any other reasons given for lifetime appointments? I would also like to study more about the ideas you listed so may I please have a source?   Is this the only argument given for allowing life-time appointments? Also, can you give me a source for this answer?   Yes, your answer does help in the context of the dred scott case, but was it considered an outrageous statement by contemporary society? Was the supreme court viewed as an impeccable institution?   I did not mean for this to be a soapbox question, so it will be resubmitted as a properly phrased question.    According to the readings, it was a failure of the entire system, both regulatory and industry, to protect the investor from buying bad stocks. The number one imperative of a stock broker is to protect its clients from bad investments. The largest investment firms ignored this imperative and pushed stocks they knew were "toxic" on a variety of investors that included city governments, union pension funds, and municipalities.      Fueling this binge was home sales across the U.S., with Country Wide leading the way in offering loans to individuals that in no way qualified. The loans were variable interest that began small and then ballooned into larger payments when the economy dropped and interest rates climbed. Associates were told to expedite loan approvals and ignore or fill in blank spots - anything necessary for loan approval.      Wall Street took these bad loans, cut them into "tranches" that were spread across several stocks to reduce the risks. Ratings agencies provided the stocks with unrealistic ratings, and Wall Street sold them to the world. The stocks were insured, and when the collapse occurred it wiped out the big insurers that paid off the large brokerage houses, leaving nothing for the small investor.      Goldman Sachs role is particularly heinous because it sold massive numbers of these toxic (the word appeared consistently throughout all nine books I read) stocks, and then bet against them on the market. The amount of money this firm made off of the misery of the poor is pornographic.    You are being an apologist for the corporate malfeasance that occurred during the run-up to 2008. These are individuals that micro-managed large amounts of money and knew exactly what they were doing and how to hide shady practices from regulation. Most people don't realize that financial institutions get to choose which federal department will regulate the company, and opt for the regulatory agency that is the most understaffed and least informed about the type of trades in which it specializes. Read the books I listed above and I guarantee you'll be absolutely livid by the devastation caused by the industry's greed.    That is a question I cannot answer.   I don't have the books in front of me, but you'll still learn more by reading about the event.   I'm sure examples of casual clothing abound throughout history, but my favorite is that of Thomas Jefferson. When Senator William Plumer arrived to meet Jefferson at the President's House in Washington, D.C. on 1802, the president was "dressed, or rather undressed, with an old brown coat, red waist-coat, old corduroy small clothes, much soiled, wooled hose and slippers without heels." Imagine the uproar in contemporary media if a president conducted business dressed this way.      Source:   1. Cliff Sloan and David McKean, The Great Decision Jefferson, Adams, Marshall, and the Battle for the Supreme Court (New York: Public Affairs, 2009).   In my efforts to understand the financial crisis I searched for books about it and discovered this [list](http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/9050.Understanding_the_Financial_Crisis_2008). I read all the books on this list up to #9, which I considered the best book, and all the authors detailed how investment and banking firms used poorly regulated methods to basically con home buyers into financing/refinancing loans. Sadly, the authors contribute the lack of criminal prosecutions to an unwillingness by the government to prosecute the offenders. If you want to understand the crisis, read the books on this list. The 2008 economic crisis and its causes are far too complicated to explain in a reddit post.   Many civil war historians aver that by passing the 13th amendment, northerners believed southern slaves would desert or turn on their masters and create additional turmoil and fear. A persistent fear experienced by a large portions of southerners during the antebellum period was that the slave population would participate in an uprising. Nat Turner's rebellion and John Brown's raid both played on these fears and were fresh in their minds when the 13th amendment was ratified.      Sources: 1. Tony Horwitz, Midnight Rising: John Brown and the Raid That Sparked the Civil War, 2011.      2. Richard Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004).     As for the number of presidents who grew up wealthy, I researched the individuals elected during the 20th and 21st centuries, and where they attended college. Of the 18 presidents, 14 attended a top ten ranked university where tuition and lodging costs far exceed the national average. Only three of the 18 attended small public schools - Warren Harding (Ohio Central College), Lyndon Johnson (Southwest Texas State Teachers College), and Ronald Reagan (Eureka College). Harry Truman is the only president serving in the 20th and 21st century who did not attend college.      The remaining fourteen presidents attended Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, Columbia, and Amherst. I realize it is unfair to generalize an individual's economic standing by alumni status, but to successfully reach the position of president contemporarily requires attending a school that provides a degree with a pedigree.   Hello Dr. Mack, and thank you for taking the time to answer questions. My question is about the repercussions on Earth for a large meteor strike on an inner galaxy rocky planet. If a meteor strike hitting Mars, Venus, or the Moon was powerful enough to change its orbit, would this have detrimental effects on Earth?   Creationism wins!!!   So the relationship between peer-reviewed research and creationism, and its effects on the scientific community is unacceptable for this subreddit?    Journalists weren't the only individuals filming the war, as some soldiers brought along their own equipment. A good example of this is Robert Fuller, a Hollywood director who served as an infantry soldier with the 1st Infantry Division. Fuller carried an 8mm Bell   Howell camera with him while storming Omaha Beach on DDay; he earned a Silver Star on that day helping to open a hole on the German line, and when communications went down, making an insane dash across open sand to inform his commander. Fuller said he preferred the B H because it was rugged and handled wet, cold conditions well. He filmed the Battle of the Bulge, and near the end of the war, the liberation of Falkenau Concentration Camp in Czechoslovakia. I saw portions of this film while doing research at Huntington Library, and it shows the citizens of the city next to the camp - man, woman, and child - being forced to walk through the camp and view the human carnage. He filmed as his unit forced locals to collect the dead bodies littering the camp, and give them proper burials that included a funeral procession.      Sources:   LIBERATING IMAGES?

I don't know if this info helped but you might also consider looking into George Stevens, another Hollywood director and cameraman who was assigned by the military to film the war. Like Fuller, he filmed DDay landings, but from a greater distance. He also filmed numerous concentration camp atrocities that were used during the Nuremberg trials; the footage was also placed in the Library of Congress.

Follow the same steps with the resulting sources and you start building a fairly solid historiography. Good luck.   I commend you for reaching out here to collect topic suggestions. I wish this source had been available when I was a graduate student. I find my best writing occurs when I connect the past to the present by asking questions related to interesting topics. Lately, I've asked myself how S.C. justices have evolved during the court's tenure? For instance, much is written about the legislative and federal branches of government, but the Supreme Court's influence is often overlooked except in extreme cases such as *Dred Scott*. This is just an example of how to generate ideas, but I also suggest you keep in mind the availability and accessibility of primary resources. In order to do part of my thesis, I was forced to travel to UCLA and the Huntington Library, because they housed a generous number of archived film from Hollywood's early years. The greater number of primary sources available makes for a stronger, reasoned thesis analysis.   This article contains original political analysis, and the title is lifted from the article and is a summation of the reporting.   I don't know if this helps but over at Engadget there's a video that...["Over the course of roughly 90 minutes, Shuhei Yoshida and Mark Cerney cover everything from the former getting banned from Nintendo's Miiverse (twice), how the PS Move controller signaled a new era of design teamwork at Sony and what it was like working under SCEA's legendarily hard-nosed chief, Ken Kutaragi."](http://www.engadget.com/2014/04/24/shuhei-yoshida-mark-cerny-playstation)   It was the battle between the two ideologies that most hurt the poor. When the U.S. exited WWII, it was the only major country that didn't experience the direct devastation of war. In fact, it offered funds to struggling nation's so as to rebuild. Those loans were repaid with interest, but it also placed the nations receiving funds under U.S. economic control of its market development. With all of these economic advantages, the U.S. government decided to invest in the military instead of its people; it chose guns over butter.   My studies on race, urban, and media history has profoundly changed the way I view American society. Understanding media's role in the "red scare" and government's response to socialism, along with its fight against labor, allow me to understand the world I live in today. If we include Cold War history, almost the entire 20th century history in the U.S. revolves around the battle between two disparate economic ideologies - socialism and capitalism.      The battle between these two ideologies touched every U.S. citizen in some manner, but the greatest burden fell on the nation's poor. Detroit is a good example of what happens to a city when it ignores the plight of the poor, while concentrating on the wealthy. Thomas Sugrue, *The Origins of the Urban Crisis : Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit* provides a chilling history of this event. Moreover, I don't understand why more historians don't become angry over the repeated examples of government's ill treatment of the poor.    Not if you've defined yourself out of poverty. The current economic system in the U.S. is not designed to alleviate poverty. Capitalism is an economic system deeply dependent on the ideology that it selects winners and losers impartially, but this just isn't the case. Americans believe that if they own *x, y, or z*, they must be in the middle-class. Ask yourself, "If I lost my job today, could I go six months without unemployment benefits, while maintaining my current lifestyle? Do I have enough saved for retirement that one minor emergency (medical?) doesn't wipe out my entire funds?" If you answered 'no', then you aren't really in the middle class.   I believe Americans avoid looking at the realities of their social position because it means the individual might have to acknowledge living in poverty.   I am, however, educated in determining social classes. I don't just limit my definition of social class to economics. To be firmly in the American middle-class, I argue, the individual/family has sufficient income from a paycheck to place a portion into savings or the stock market after paying the monthly bills. They own a home, with multiple cars, and can afford to send their children to a state college without student loans. Credit card use is for the sake of convenience, and not because it's needed. If an individual/family lives paycheck-to-paycheck, the future is the now and offers little hope for advancement.   This hasn't been my experience, but let's take you for an example. How do you define the social class in which you reside? What are its boundaries? Is it all about income, or does access to education and other social institutions also play a part?   When did alternet become a restricted domain for r/politics?   Why is your reply with the veiled threat suggesting I not pursue the matter, and your demand for unearned respect not posted? And please provide me with a definition of the terms "snippy" and "dismissive" along with examples from my reply that you consider disrespectful.   I won't apologize to you or the OP for being "snippy" or "dismissive" as they are subjective qualities. The reality is that I can't make you "feel" anything as only you have the power to do that. I can, however, point out the faulty nature of an argument, and if that hurts someone's feelings, I suggest they grow a thicker skin. Such is the nature of academics.   He questioned my source, a university press book, because it didn't match his wikipedia source. If my attitude was "dismissive" it's because I don't believe in wikipedia as a source, and my students aren't allowed to use it other than to find a starting point for finding library sources for a topic.   I did make a polite and sourced rebuttal that the OP called " bullshit".    While Nixon didn't get hired by Hoover, Reagan worked as an informer for the FBI while working in Hollywood as an union president.   No need for expletives, as I didn't allude to a large number to describe the Irish movement, opting instead to use the ambiguous term "many." As for your argument, its third sentence contradicts the first two sentences by admitting that a number of Irish were fighting for independence. Arguing over size is simply an exercise in semantics, and one you should address to Snay, not Shay.   If you have any arguments with the Fenian question, you should direct them to Mitchell Snay, or perhaps his publisher, Louisiana State University Press. Make sure to tell them you're upset that Snay's research doesn't match that of wikipedia, and that a university press's validation process just wasn't thorough enough.   What I believe you're trying to ask is why the "other" or "outsider" in the U.S. was identified as such, and how/why this changed? For the purposes of this answer, I define anyone who is not white or of Anglo descent as the "other".      In the nation's history, black Americans have occupied the position of "other" for almost its entirety. The defining characteristics of African Americans popular in antebellum America changed after the Civil War when they gained agency through economic and educational growth. In the southern states, new laws restricted this development for AA's, allowing many negative stereotypes to persist.      Source: 1. Richard Valelly, The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004).      The evolution of the Irishman also developed during this period, as many were taken straight of the boat at Ellis Island and placed directly into the Union Army. Back home, the Irish were fighting for independence from England and many came to the U.S. to gain military experience that they could take home to Ireland. As the U.S. experienced the second industrial revolution, and urban populations exploded, the Irish earned greater acceptance in relation to AA's and Eastern European immigrants. Irish immigrants told friends they learned 3 things about America. First, the streets weren't paved with gold. Second, the streets weren't paved, period. Third, the Irish were expected to pave the streets.      Source: 1. Mitchell Snay, Fenians, Freedmen, and Southern Whites: Race and Nationality in the Era of Reconstruction (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2007).      As for the additional races and their acceptance, the best way to gain validity as a U.S. citizen was to buy a house. The reasons for this are many, including: it meant the individual was invested in the nation; owning a home required steady employment; homeowners were less likely to be radicals.  Source: 1. David Roediger, Working toward Whiteness: How Americas Immigrants Became White (New York: BasicBooks, 2005).      Hoped this answered some of your question.   According to Cold War historians, the American leaders viewed the rearmament of the West Germans as a mainly symbolic gesture to reassure Europeans that all NATO members shared in the defense against communist aggression. The French and Russians were greatly alarmed at the thought of a militarized reunified Germany, and to allay these fears required the aforementioned stationing of U.S. troops in Germany. The U.S. viewed Germany as a temporary speed bump so devastated and wearied by the war that it stood little chance of slowing down a Russian offensive.   I realize now that my remarks seem a little harsh, but describing the Soviet Army as a juggernaut seems disingenuous, even for the Soviet experts that populated the period's State Department. Although historians describe the U.S. and U.S.S.R. as the only two superpowers standing, the reality is that the U.S. experienced economic growth without the disastrous wreckage that haunted the Soviets, and in truth was the only real superpower. Stalin admitted that his country and people were tired and needed at least ten years to recover. The rearmament of Germany took place during the later Eisenhower administration, after U.S. policymakers switched from the ideology of containment pushed by George Kennan, to one of brinkmanship or massive retaliation sponsored by Dulles. This change meant that the military response to aggression became only one of a multitude of possible responses, with the atomic option becoming the overriding U.S. strategy.      Sources:      1.

First, there was no "Soviet juggernaut" waiting to push through Europe and the ideology belongs to the Traditionalism history espoused by W.E. Griffith or T.T. Hammond, according to Chris Ward, author of *Stalin's Russia*.      Revisionist historians such as J.L. Gaddis and R.C. Raack acknowledge the devastation inflicted on Russia by the Germans, but that Stalin hid the nation's weakness with oratory bluster and demonstrations of technological prowess (Sputnik, hydrogen bomb). The U.S. State Department lacked the personnel to properly evaluate the Soviet Union because of the Red Scare and McCarthy's accusations which resulted in the department losing a huge number of analyists.  As to the original question, Germany was rearmed because U.S. leadership believed it was a necessary deterrent, but the French demanded that the Germans host American soldiers as a means of keeping the German Army from reemerging as a threat.

Unlike being an agent, referee, or coach, there doesn't seem to be a process for becoming a proper scout. It gives the impression of being haphazard. Being a scout needs to be more than gut feeling or impression. But I don't feel that it's more than watch several players in a region, take deep notes, record video, conduct interviews, and report back...which honestly would be a job I would love to have                   agreed, Palmer's quality is that of a back-up who's starting because the team has zero options   did you see that Wired article from a couple months ago? Always, it seems: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/   went through   did some cleaning up. sorry it was rough, I just wrote it   posted      I like to think myself and wife are a bit responsible for Kansas going into the MNUFC column                                                    Keep: Shipp, Nyarko, Earnshaw, Johnson,   Segares. Get rid of the rest by any means necessary   that might be where I found it originally, I tend to make this with more cheese   garlic pepper than usual   usually I would as well, but this is among my 'what's left in my pantry' recipes   depends on how liberal you are with the sriracha. mine are low, just a calm warmth      Ingredients  1 can of black beans (16 oz.)  1 red bell pepper  A third of a cup of scallions or green onions  3 cloves of garlic  1 egg  1 tablespoon of cumin  1.5 cups of quick oats  A third of a cup of sesame seeds  A third cup of sriracha  Directions  1) Rinse and drain the black beans. If youd like, mash them up.  2) Chop up the bell pepper into manageable pieces that can be put into a food processor. Toss the pepper, onion, garlic, and beans into the food processor and chop it all up. Then add the egg, oaks, sesame seeds, cumin, and sriracha and mix it all together.  3) Dump the food processor mixture into a bowl. Add more oats if necessary to thicken up the mixture. If you want to have a firmer mixture to form into patties, put the bowl into the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   4) Put a piece of wax paper on a cookie sheet (aluminum foil would work as well). Dole out the mixture into dollops that form patties of about two inches wide maybe half an inch thick.  5) Bake these at 375 degrees for at least 10 minutes.  http://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2014/09/27/foodiesphere-artichoke-chicken-sriracha-black-bean-burgers-tuna-fish-melt/   Artichoke Chicken Ingredients 1 can of artichoke hearts (15 oz.) 1 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese 1 cup of mayonnaise 1 tablespoon of garlic pepper 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or tenders) Directions 1) In a medium sized bowl mix all the ingredients together. 2) Once the ingredients are all mixed, set the bowl aside. Take the chicken and cut it up into strips. Lay the chicken out evenly in the dish. 3) Then spread the mixture in the bowl over the top of the chicken.

Question is, just how much development time did he lose being wasted with Chicago   exactly, Tampa Bay has plenty of forwards. So many, in fact, that it often pushes them out of position out wide where they are ineffectual--this, of course, merely a casual opinion                     Did you guys know about this Minnesota United merch via the Admiral website? Just discovered it. The black polo and training tops look tough http://admiral.axissoccer.com/admiral_en/catalog/category/view/id/121?club=4   a little too Silverbacks   Scorpions looking for my tastes   a third kit would be fun, a Kicks throwback      I had similar worries. After next season's expansion teams (Jax, OKC), the league is going to have to focus entirely on the Pacific timezone. I think USSF's insistence may over-saturate the West coast. But really, I have a hard time coming up with viable locations--maybe Tacoma (the Milwaukee of Washington State), Nevada feels like a black hole, San Diego could work, there have been rumors of San Francisco, Fresno would have a nice population but the city is so very poor, and the rest of southern California is a crap shoot.   I'd rather see investment in places like Omaha, Calgary, El Paso, Albuquerque, Hamilton, and Detroit. Well, it'll be fun to see what happens   to the USL question: no, the standards to operate an USL club are much much lower than NASL. USL will not be D2 any time in the foreseeable future                        yes, the egg fluffs it up a bit         well, Mendes and Bracalello are more wingers. And Polak   Pridham aren't really ready for primetime. But Burgos is most certainly the real deal, so that gives us three top choices which I feel is the minimum necessary for a top team   but without Campos, depth at striker is rather shallow. I think it would make sense to bring him back   sorry about that, I just shared it from the site I saw it on. And really, watching the video is the only thing one really needs to see. but I'll try to do better next time                                                                        yeah, sorry about that, in the course of cutting   pasting and then adding more some of my sentences got a bit convoluted. Will do better in the future, thanks for reading         why do you discount Colorado Springs?                     then I'll invite you to not cook it or eat it. thanks for your thoughts     I've made it with kale (minus the chicken) and it was very good. great texture   yes, I typically have a few cans of chunk chicken breast (chicken of the sea, swanson, or generic)   this is what I used               you surely could. I didn't because I wanted to make it faster   I detest handling raw chicken   right, I only cooked my broccoli and garlic for about a minute or so--just long enough for it to turn a brighter green than the drab green of raw veg  	137
 I love how Ben dropped his character but kept the voice when he told that story.    The subreddit was full of hatred for the show but also for others. Everyone kept giving out about people who were being positive about the show, but they didn't really exist. The subreddit spent most of it's time just discussing itself (much like this weeks Community) but in a bad way.    You catch more of the jokes but the feeling of "jumping out of your seat and clapping your hands while you giggle" only happens during the first watch for me.    Our lowest time was before you joined. This Subreddit during season 4 was a genuinely vile place.   That's my first thought when I see this as well. They all look well into their 20's.    You should. There are a bunch of these on YouTube but this is the earliest I could find.    It could very well be. But since the CBB episode was recorded a few weeks back it seems like too much of a coincidence they released this video today.    You should at least skim it. The moment when it's just his legs is hilarious.       1. Happy late-Birthday. 2. Try doing driving related things and see if it hurts. 3. If it does, you should probably cancel. The driving instructor won't mind. The decision will mostly only affect you so do what is best for you. 4. If it doesn't hurt GO PASS THAT TEST EYELIKEPIE2!!   We need to get a post high on /r/teenagers. It should be easier since Sunny is a mod there ... but I don't know if he still comes here.   I knew that though.      I was going to post this to /r/woahdude but I figured it might be too much noise and stuff.   That would be a very tough one to do. Not really any long shots to use, he'd have to just be in the background.    I'd buy an album of just remixes of the video.   Thanks. Someone with a stronger computer could do a version of this with all 30 Shia's at once though. That would be amazing.   That should be the name. If someone does a better version of this they should name it that.   I tried to match the pauses together at certain spots but I think that's the only noticeable one.    Wait Paul F. Tompkins isn't playing ball droid?      At least she hasn't given 36 blowjobs.   That video was hilarious. I can't wait to hear the scene they do of it and the return of Eric!    Wasn't series 2 delayed because of the episode with all the shooting in an Americian high school?   Have you seen Danger 5? It's very similar to Kung Fury.   That's my second favourite one. The one where he keeps saying SnapLegs is my personal favourite.   A network is basically the company inbetween you and youtube. They call themselves networks but I don't know if they fit the definition of one.      Nope most Youtubers join a network when they're big enough. Especially gaming youtubers, since the network can protect them from video game company's.   Whoever told you a million views is a grand was way off.      Does this mean Nathan For You isn't back this Summer?         As somebody who doesn't anything about WOW or MMO culture I am very familiar with Leeroty Jenkins. It's not a very unknown thing.   The teenager character is so good because he's playing a character of himself playing a character.    He also has a very important cameo at the end of "Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie."   No I'm sure that's it. The flower scene in the trailer rings familiar. It's just that the memory has been in head for so long it's changed a lot over the years.   That's not an actual link to the film by the way. As far as I can tell it's not streaming anywhere online.    Yep, you're just a "grower not a shower" as they say.    You used the same link for Yo La Tengo and Once In A While.   I guess this must be it. I think I morphed the movie so much in my head though that watching the trailer isn't making me feel like I found it.     Nope it wasn't animated. Live action.   Here is the very random plot points I remember. -The main characters sister was part of the club -The main character's crush may have been a princess but to prove it they had to prove a series of conditions one of which was that she was allergic to flowers. There was a dinner scene where the main character distracted the girl while the rest of the group tried to figure out if the girl was allergic. -I believe in the end it turned out the sister was the princess.  -At one point the clubhouse was split directly in two.  If anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it. I've been trying to find the name of this movie for the past 10 years.  I should also mention I watched it on the UK Nickleodeon and while I'm sure it wasn't british it could have been made anywhere else.    I'll play it.   It was doing alright upvotes wise and then it all went downhill. My 15 seconds are over goodnight guitarknowitall   But carpe diem.   This happens to me twice or three times a day.  	47
 Mississippi   So I'm genuinely curious. What's the general consensus on these import bans? I'm not seeing anything wrong with the Crimea situation, so I've been against them from the start, but I'd love to get others' opinions.   Sure, I knew that, but I don't imagine they're doing any dirty work until they're 18 or so.    Well, looks like I've got some reading to do. I agree with you in the functioning of militaries in the modern world, as well. Sadly, armed forces are more often sink pits for surplus population and wealth that could be much better used in much better pursuits. This is not unique to the DPRK. The US does it, most European nations do it. Sure, there's military actions in these states, but it's often to the ends of amoral puppet masters and not to the ends of the national interest. Rather like the DPRK, though in a grander scale and different guise.   Absolutely. For example, I'm sure that whoever founded Nestle had no idea they'd become the amoral bastards they are today. I'm sure that the founders of the Republican and Democratic parties had no idea they'd allow America to become what it is today. And I am abundantly certain that the old Bolsheviks came to rue what became of their revolution. Movements can certainly lead quite far from where they're intended to go.   I can understand the moral side to this, but from a practical perspective, the North Korean military isn't a fighting force. It's a social institution which rarely wields martial power as it knows that any sort of war they fight is a losing proposition. Instead, it's an internal control mechanism which exists to scare people into line and run camps. I highly doubt that 16 year olds are given rifles and told to shoot people. More likely, they're learning to shoot and parade around and basically nothing more.  Further, the military is likely the best route most North Koreans have for getting regular meals. To say nothing of medical care and possible opportunities for education and social advancement within the wretched *Songbun* system that military service affords.   So, while I abhor the DPRK regime, letting 16 year olds into the North Korean military is acceptable.    Movements have a way of getting away from their founders.   Ah, well. Have some upvote.   That's the joke. I worried I was too subtle. Such jokes are better said than written, I guess.   No, but I'm working on it. (Sfine)   I guess there ain't any lips touching theirs then, huh?   Kotaku is garbage. Please avoid giving them traffic in the future.   I want one...   MADD are fucking puritan fascists.   Do you smear cream cheese on simians?   Is there any canon info on Asari gestation?   An emblem of lies for a land of lies. I take it back, that's horrendously offensive.   Offended? By Greenland?   Or aliens.   Direct to door? That sounds amazing.   I didn't know that was a thing and love historical cosplays. Next year...   Possibly, if they were spaced right. I know that cosplaying in the dead heat of the Georgian summer has made me beg for a winter convention, though. That would be nice. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love that. But you can't just move Dragoncon to winter. It's a summer fixture. So there's at least two cons right there. Maybe devote one to fantasy and one to scifi?    Twenty? Maybe ten. In twenty years, without capping or expansion to mitigate crowding, Dragoncon will have to be split into two or three different cons throughout the year.   Hello, fellow Gainesville-ite.    My serious answer would be covert assassination and massive electronic assaults on their information infrastructure.   So Putin's kin are responsible for something done accidentally by some rebels funded and supplied by people way down the chain of Putin's command? I mean, fuck, they should have trained their AA people better, but I don't think they set out to murder civilians. They thought they shot down a transport carrying some of those guys shelling their cities and killing their people.    John Candy esque whining: "Why don't you care, press? Writing that book about how much I hate you men really took a lot out of me. It kiiiiilled me!" *laugh track*   There's a Fallout wiki called The Vault. Great for lore stuff.   Ah, right. Better to live on your knees than die on your feet, eh? I never bought that notion. A life lived in submission isn't truly worth living.      Please speak more truths, brother. Let the slaves of the false god hear your words!   "I tried but it just keeps doing that whole 'pile of broken bits' thing. Think I should delete System 32?"   This is really good propaganda: simple, direct, difficult to refute.   I don't seem to remember it that way. My friends and I all thought the camps were pretty well formed and battle lines drawn at that point. I could be misremembering, but I'm quite sure of it. I will admit that it hadn't become nearly as shitstormmy by then.   Labor Day 2014? It was slightly after. I remember wondering if the SJ people were going to flip shit about it and discussing it with friends at the time.   Maybe the same race that Guilty Spark encountered in the wreck on Installation 04?   He showed up at Dragoncon last year without issue. He was super fun, very genial. Great guy, all around. It hurts to see people dogging him so unfairly for having an opinion.   John Candy as Andrea Dworkin would be the greatest movie ever.   Utterly tactless.   I can't recall. It was Neelix heavy and had some guy who developed a superweapon that was used against the Talaxians.   Thanks, hombre.   Looked it up, didn't find it.   Soviet and Communist memorabilia. I can typically identify which era of Soviet history a specific medal or uniform was manufactured and worn in and the identity of most East German, Chinese, Vietnamese and North Korean decorations.   Whelp, we finished Reddit.   Well, eventually a conservative faction of real Mandos shows up to bust heads and set shit right, but it still seemed really forced and contrived.  Also, as mentioned, the art style of the show was really bad to me. I would have LOVED it if they had kept the Tartakovsky Clone Wars' style and knocked it out in Flash or something. I don't know why it bothered me so much.   Yeah. They were the ruling government on Mandalore. It was awful.   Voyager also wholesale ripped off "Duet," possibly my favorite DS9 episode.   I'd source this, but I'm on my phone. Check out IBM and Ford's prewar activities, though. They're two companies I know off the top of my head who dealt with Nazi Germany. I can't think of any US companies that were working with Imperial Japan, however.   Pacifist Mandalorians fucking ever  Sorry, bud. I disagree for lore breaking examples like that. I also wasn't a fan of the art style. Blech.   Never in our lifetime   It's not a focus, but they do it better than a lot of other games do.   "Just try to find a prop now, Wannabe Snakes! Fuck you! Hahahaha"  -Hideo "Laughing Fox" Kojima   I haven't played it yet. I'm just now looking at the IMFDB entry and I've got to say: holy fucking frankengun, Batman! Those are some strange gats.   I'm not talking about specific firearms models (and he features plenty of actual firearms in Metal Gear). I'm talking about things like trigger discipline and proper detailing, with adequate consideration given to things like actually fitting a mechanism in the design of a fake gun. You can draw any sort of gun you like, but drawing one with a believable location to hold the thing and put a magazine in it that will have the right amount of room to feed into the chamber and a believably placed trigger mechanism is quite another.   Could be bakelite? Maybe some very thick varnish? If it's in Japan, though, it's most assuredly airsoft.   The man seems to know guns. He gets a lot of things about them right in his games that others fuck up.    The Philippines has a claim on the islands there too. If it was still part of the US, that means the American Navy would be there to enforce those claims.  I agree entirely. However, we could also look for the Communist Chinese to build a much stronger navy. The [PLAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Navy) has, until recently, been something of a red headed step child amongst the Chinese armed forces. Naturally, the Military Commission had been rather keen on the advantages of a true blue water navy for some time, but until very recently the technical expertise and vast resources necessary to create and maintain such a force had eluded them.   However, in the past twenty years, China's economy has exploded and (coupled with the opening up of former Soviet technical expertise) the Chinese have been able to acquire the backbone of a true blue water fleet. Where once they had been able to field a token submarine force, they're now able to field carriers and light cruisers.   Now, back to the What If. One imagines that with a US territory not too far off and their Nationalist rivals licking their wounds on Taiwan, Mao might look at a Navy as a much more vital asset. The Communists might even have looked to their friendship with the Soviets in a more careful light and worked harder to placate Khrushchev in an effort to avoid the Sino-Soviet split, thus ensuring that Soviet naval power (which was far from inconsiderable) would come into play in the West Pacific. This is all highly speculative, naturally, but the naval situation alone could pose for scores of HistoryWhatIfs.   Underwater, you mean? Andrew Ryan was an incredibly successful businessman topside. In a museum located at Ryan Amusements, the story of the voyage (and subsequent refitting for ocean floor construction) of Ryan's private ocean liner The Olympian is detailed, along with the hard work of Ryan's private army of laborers. These laborers were given places in Rapture for their trouble (and, one assumes, to preserve Rapture's secrecy) but were forced to settle in the maintenance tunnels beneath the Atlantic Express rail lines, now known as Pauper's Drop.  In other words, a lot of the Family Splicers that Delta murdered there are the men who built Rapture. Thanks, Delta. Jackass.   That poor rifle.   Glad you think so! Thanks!   Kroger unionized employee here, making $7.25/hr for 25 hours a week (if I'm lucky) and I'm responsible for a huge share of our positive feedback surveys. I look at moves like this with envy, personally.   Rapture employed a system of fog emitting shrouds to keep people from finding the lighthouse which served as its entrance. Of course, during the initial startup phase, there were problems: mass dieoffs of fisheries, oil slicks, and the like. However, as Rapture's defensive systems (torpedoes, mines, inferred anti-air capabilities) resulted in disappearances of shipping and aircraft that remained unexplained to the wider world - coupled with the extremely inhospitable nature of the frigid North Atlantic meant that a large swatch of sea was left quite avoided: cursed to the superstitious and commercially dead to the rational.  As it was never a particularly well travelled region of ocean in the first place, nobody really felt the loss for this and, by design, Andrew Ryan's shining utopia achieved perfect isolation from the outside world... barring the errant daredevil diver or a domestic situation that would make Jerry Springer gasp. Otherwise, Rapture marches on.   I imagine it would be a similar situation, but with far more pressure for either independence or statehood given the Philippines' substantially larger population. I'd really like to see how having a large US territory in that region would impact relations between the Communist and Nationalist China. I'm sure Chiang Kai Shek would have been more confident in his position with so many more US Forces swarming around in the Pacific.      What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation! Do it now, Samuel!   I agree entirely. We've let bigots ruin so many cool things. Let's reclaim them. Fuck prejudice.   It's okay. If she does get rid of them, they'll just come back.   Yep. ~~Guy~~ Gal who designed it was a Socialist, IIRC. Good on ~~him~~ her, I say. Capitalism is a rotten, rotten system and we need to dispense with it.   I didn't downvote you, but your tone was needlessly condescending and I thought I'd point that out. Whatever.   Because everyone totally knows what the national symbol of the Ukraine is.   This guy gets it. Kudos, solefald.   "We're not a stereotype"  Don't leave a tip.  Class act.   I'll start you off:  Allons enfants de la Patrie,    Le jour de gloire est arriv !   This idea's got Moxie, Billy.   More like /r/UnusualIdeasAndSubredditSuggestions, amirite? Except for Shifty. The things /u/Shifty_Drifter are doing with this subreddit are commendable and worthy of praise.   Do it. Now. Make it the prime time of your life.   They'll never ignore you again.   Wait, picking it up doesn't... I've been playing this game for years. How did I not know?   Read the Thrawn Trilogy. Do it now. Also, Darth Plagueis and the Episode III novelization.   Seriously. You're discussing a word, Reddit. It's 'niggers.' You look childish if you dance around it like that.   Fuck you. Upvotes away.   For real. Whatever happened to courts and pageantry and uniforms for civil officials? Casualism is so boring.   This just tells me that nature hates base 10.   I've said it before and I'll say it again: the ATF is too powerful and needs to be disestablished, its functions scattered to the winds and its personnel devoted to running a chain of one stop fun stores.    While it is very restrictive (not all that unusually so for nations on the Asian continent), it is distinguished by having successfully unified China (for the first time since the downfall of their last dynasty) and having done more for literacy and human development in China than anyone else. For these reasons, the Communist party is not without its supporters.  Not sure why communist is used as though it's a bad thing. Ever read Marx? Communism is, at its heart, a very good and benevolent philosophy - much moreso than capitalism.  Also, the Guomindang are the Nationalist Chinese, the ones currently in exile (for the most part, see: The Revolutionary Committee of the Guomindang) on Taiwan.   That's a funny way of spelling Mr Rogers in a Blood-stained Sweater.   I'd really like to see something set in a post Lamb Rapture. No idea what they could possibly do, and that's what makes it so exciting.   Misogyninjas   Ever read about the Guomindang? It got pretty shitty after Chiang Kai Shek took over.   Rent is cheap? FREE ON STEAM: CONFIRMED.  Something something metro? ENDLESS SLOGS THROUGH TRAIN TUNNELS: CONFIRMED.  OP has found a goldmine.   OP's title is misinformed, if nothing else. Inaccurate, in any case.   Except that the majority of Crimeans have no love for the Ukraine and identify as Russian. The majority of Crimeans wanted to either be independent or rejoin Russia before this whole thing happened. The status quo was not all that popular. Only small groups of people sought any sort of tight union with Kiev.   He ended it after it was stabbed in the back and the questionably legal [Belavezha Accords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belavezha_Accords) made continuing the Soviet Union an impossible prospect, yes. Note that the signatories of this pact were traitors acting in their own interests. The majority of citizens in Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Russia and in many other SSRs were actually quite in favor of continuing the Soviet Union. I've no doubt the world would be better off if it were still around. It would have saved everyone a lot of suffering and bloodshed, for sure.   Relevance being? Most Tatars today weren't born in Crimea. Their ethnic group may have had a claim to the place at some point, but if most Tatars alive today weren't born in Crimea, it's not really a homeland, I wouldn't imagine. You're attempting to argue from emotion. That's a poor debate tactic.   The legality of the Soviet Union's dissolution aside, [Russia's legal continuity from the Soviet Union on the international stage is well established.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states#Soviet_Union)   Those guys who lost it in a battle and mostly weren't even born there since their ethnic group only started moving back in relatively recently? Nope. It's mostly ethnic Russians that live in Crimea anyway.   Crimea was ceded to the Ukraine under peaceful terms when they were part of the same country. As Russia is the sole legal successor to the Soviet Union, an argument could be made that they can take it back. The Tatars are not in the same position.   Isn't Fallout supposed to be all about Americana, though? Seems to me like foreign countries would be great for DLC, but that's it.   It's not so simple as that. Crimea was Russian. The only reason it was ever ceded was due to Soviet infrastructural convenience. Crimeans never wanted to belong to the Ukraine for the most part. They intervened on behalf of their people because they didn't want the Crimea getting swept up by post Yanukovych, anti-Russia sentiments. You'd act on your people's behalf, too, if Azov Battalion was a factor.   Curious: what's wrong with the Crimea situation? The Ukraine was unstable and the majority of Crimeans never wanted to be ruled by Kiev anyway. They were ethnic Russians, by and large, speaking Russians and even holding Russian passports in a lot of cases. I've never spoken to a Crimean who lamented the events. So I have to ask: aside from Kiev losing land, what was the downside of Russia reclaiming Crimea from the Ukraine?   Kind of tacky, putting politics on a goodwill message like that.   Nothing changes in the Ukraine, I see. All that changes is foreign policy. My thoughts and best wishes go out to the Ukrainians.   Free speech, democracy, etc.   Georgia? I know we're turning blue, but did anyone actually think these would have a chance?   (FWIW: I'd never stop voting for a pro gun Dem.)   Hunter S Thompson would have thought him adorable.   Krokodil Me.   Thought so. Words shall not be marked, OP.   No one likes SRS   Can countries be kicked out of the EU? I don't think they can. They can sure be made to feel unwelcome, however, and voluntarily withdraw.   There's a difference between telling someone something they're going to have a tough time after the collapse and telling someone they're just going to die. It's pretty shitty.   The lands that Russia is in were never Kiev's to begin with and never wanted to belong to the Ukraine. This is not hard to grasp.   Honestly, what would you even call the war in the Ukraine? The west and Kiev can't even seem to agree on the nature of the conflict and Moscow won't admit that it has people in the Ukraine. Then you have Crimea which arguably belonged to Russia anyway and the whole thing just collapses into a semantic clusterfuck.  I'm just going to call it The Great Soviet Tussle and be done with it.     They adopt the tactics of the bigots they claim to loathe and are just as intolerant of "privileged" people as they claim the privileged are of the disabled, women, LGBTs, and minorities. SJWs are a useless, disgusting lot.    Do Christians believe that consciousnesses created by Man can get to heaven? What would an AI have to gain by being Christian? This pastor seems to be misunderanding why people would want to believe in a god.   Well sure, but speaking as a disabled person, we all know that already and it's needlessly douchy to point it out.   Report, downvote and move on.  Edit: What did I say?   Are the mods as pro-Ukraine as everybody else seems to be or what?   Paraplegic here. I've wondered this as well. Fortunately, my group of friends and I all have a really cohesive plan for a collapse of society and local order and I feel pretty good about that. My advice? Try to do the same if you have friends interested in prepping.    I don't know. I'm still not all that convinced. Next you'll be telling me that Leela's a mutant and not an alien.   Maaaaybe. I've got a full plate at the moment, but I'll see.   Nah. Defect to North Korea. Pays better.   They only yell all the time because they love me, too. Discuss?      Do it now, waffle boy!   For best results OC weapons and sing The Internationale in Korean.               Basically, I have a shitload of obscure music from the Communist world of varying vintages, a level of skill at writing stiffly propagandistic radio copy, and a degree of experience with voice work. What I'd love to do is make a radio station for either FNV or FO3 that broadcasts as a service of the irradiated ghouls shambling around in the old Soviet embassy.  If this sounds like something you'd like to be a part of, let me know. I really only need someone with enough GECK know how to make all the audio that I level and produce to come out fine in the script and in game. As I have no plans to make any in game content, it should be a modest undertaking at its most difficult.  If such a mod already exists, I apologize for the seeming redundancy, but I'd dare to venture that my effort would make a worthy and immersive addition to any play through of either game.   UPDATE  I've recorded several DJ quips and have a nearly finalized selection of tracks I'm putting in. This is subject to change, and if you have any suggestions feel free to speak up. Chances are that I probably have it.  **Soviet:**  My Army  There, Far Beyond the River  If You'll Be Lucky  Lenin is Young Again  On the Hills of Manchuria  Russian Sailors Dance  Pesnaya  Lenin is Always With You  War Century  Na Strazi Mira  Anebopok  The Rockets Are Always Ready!  Ne Plach Devchonka  Kiev Waltz    **Chinese:**  When That Day Comes  Chen Sisi: My Dear Chinese People  When The Motherland Calls Upon Us  The East Is Red  Socialism is Good!  Unknown Mao Zedong Red Opera    **East German:**  Ernst Busch: The Left March  Erich Weinert Ensemble: Spartakus In Berlin   **North Korean:**  The General Is Seen at the Outpost  Don't Ask My Name  We Will Follow You Forever  Korea Does What It is Determined to Do  Footsteps  Where Are You, Dear General?   **Hungarian:**  A Parttal A Neppel  This list is very much in flux and open to suggestion. I may add or remove things in order to create the right tone for the station. Additionally, if you have requests for things you want to hear the DJ talk about and put a commie spin on, feel free to suggest them here.   **Preview**  A preview of the mod is located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkC6gsMCLzY)   **UPDATE 01/15**  Principal recording of DJ lines is complete. Track listing is complete. All that remains is placing and some audio post-production. I'm quite pleased with how everything has come together, and I'm pretty sure it even plays nice with canon and lore. I'll make another post once the whole thing is done, and I hope you all enjoy it.  To celebrate this milestone, [here](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1wZJvPoQRxa) is another preview of the DJ copy.    What are North Korean attitudes on the fall of the USSR? I know that the DPRK is no longer technically a Communist state, but is there any sense that they lost an ally or fellow traveler? Do they regard it as a failing in Leninist thought that Juche has rectified? I've always been curious about Northerners feel about the Soviet Union and its fall.   Conditions assume that each party has only themselves and their respective skills to rely on. Atlas has his shadowy connections and skill set while Fitzroy is assisted at random and unknowable intervals by the Lutece twins.      The booze consumes the molecules you need to stay asleep, so you'll wake up early without fail. Do it! Do it, asshole!   I know that information is sparse, but I really wonder how the Soviet Union, Europe, China, Japan and Australia faired the various wars that ultimately consumed the world in and around 2077. Anyone got any hard sources or conjecture? I know Tenpenny claimed to have made it out of England, so we've obviously got something resembling global travel still.   It's a crime ridden hellhole. What the hell drives people to live or invest there?   Assuming that one would still qualify them as industrial, that is.               Think about it. They've got the poor guy in jail. Their revenge could not be sweeter.            Britain's cockney culture is characterized by a charming accent that is famous the world round for evoking images of chimney sweeps and Dickensian orphans. HOWEVER, there is an untold tragedy behind this distinctive brogue.  You see, the cockney tradition of calling strangers 'guvna' does not, in point of fact, stem from rhyming slang and the archaic term 'scrivener.' In fact, all cockney people suffer from a terrible and debilitating condition that leaves them unable to properly identify the current governor. Therefore, in a mixture of respect and a fear of terrifyingly draconian British laws regarding the failure to pay proper deference to government officials, cockneys are left with but one recourse:  Greet everyone as 'guvna.'      Greetings and salutations!  I'm an Atlanta area resident looking to get into voice acting and voice over work. I specialize in playing villains, but I can do just about anything. In addition, I dare say I've got the best mid-atlantic accent delivery in the amateur market.   My rates are extremely competitive and open to negotiation, and my growing portfolio can be found at www.modernchristory.com. Thanks for giving me a look! I hope I'm right for your project!   Feel free to contact me either through my site or via PM.      For all those currently relying on Skype and the like: hang in there! It gets better! My girlfriend and I met online and the day we met each other was the happiest day of our lives. We've been living together for over two years now, but we still look back to our days of falling asleep on Skype and chatting online fondly. Hang in there. You'll be together some day, and let me tell you: there's nothing more rewarding than that final visit to the airport.    Is there a central bank? Some manner of mint? Who standardizes these things and why are they good in every era with seemingly no change?        	153
 Please look into the adoption route, if you are in Canada west coast feel free to PM me and I will offer any help I can. Heck, no matt where you are PM if you wish.   Your friend is beautiful. I see nothing wrong with her in any way.    Your readers are smart people, they will understand the implications with very little input.    Your oil change is overdue...      History is written by the victors. Do you really think that they will honestly tell the entire truth, or the truth at all?    And there is a Montrose in Canada as well...BT we have the T-Rex here.   No, you can start on the last day, just have to type fast!   Hopefully my next one, I can see it in my head, I just need to get it made!   Even though I make less than 10 bucks a month from my writing, I still do it. Even have another book coming out next month. I love making the stories. If I make money one day? Great! If not...maybe my kids will proffit from it, or at least have something to remember me by.   Either way, the stories will always continue.   Book one on Amazon is called Past Jumper. Would love to have your take on it.    Thank you!   The first book is actually free on amazon right now, I am editing the last book (5) as we speak. :)    Time travel, shielding, flight, pyromania, healing unfortunately the world isn't sticking around long enough for any of it to last.   Thank you. Every one helps.   If you could also share my page on Facebook or any other media, I would be very appreciative.  HTTPS://www.Facebook.com/jamieheppner     My mental capacity will degrade in the coming years, it's one way to leave something for my children, and perhaps they will reap some financing from it as well.    I remember.   So, nice pictures and all, but what books were you reading? Any chance one of them was one of mine?   This is the warning on the back of some very "offshore" lights that the store I work at has started selling.   I feel like I am going to have a hard time standing behind this product.      As a general rule, linking your work like this is frowned on by Reddit. I speak from experience. You would do better to find another method of promotion.   And yes Anal? Is this supposed to be a XXX story?   So far the longest I have had published is at 96k. A touch under the majority, but I still think it's plenty.  Have a few sitting at the 40-80k as well.    Yeah, no.   I read that as ponies...Still one you don't want to listen to.    Why is a good question. It keeps you sharp.   I auth - therefore I am... -er-   I am an author, insanity runs in my blood...and they let me out on a day pass...so back off!  ;-)    If I couldn't control them, it would be very hard to type this from under a semi truck wheel...   That's why I started writing. At least computer time has a purpose now.    The consistant ones can be hard to ignore.    I am having a hard time thinking of a use for it...but it's better than none at all!   They are all mine, just the public and the not public sneak out sometimes.    This one! So much this one...   For instance, I was just walking down the street and a semi drove by really close. I thought, "Hmn, it would be super easy to dive under the wheels" Of course, that would be counter productive. But the thought was there. What random thoughts have popped into your head during the course of a day that are totally not your norm?  (I am by no means suicidal, it was just the thought.)   I will have to start squirreling away some money, thanks for the input.   The reason I have chosen to be an indie is that I am lacking in extra $. What I do have goes to debt, or bills. Spending more on promotion isn't an option.   I am an author. I have many books out and more coming soon, yet I am seriously lacking in the exposure side of my work.  Things I have done are:  - blog release - tweets (many) - Facebook promo (shares, promotions, giveaways, paid promotions) - local promotion, friends, word of mouth. - Reddit ( limited, self promotion is frowned on, I know)  I have the work, it's available, people like it, yet I am lacking in growing my reader base.  Anyone have some suggestions on things I might have missed? Or is this it for me?   I text them to my wife, no-one cares if you text things.   Yes, I need a trailer too. But, I still need my limbs.   I have had some very good experiences there.     Bring that photo over to r/redditgetsdrawn something tells me you will love what they do with it.   May 19 is my birthday. I will remember.   Just getting my flair! Yay for books!   Awesome. Thank you :-)    That's beautiful. Thank you very much.   Give it to ten complete strangers and tell them to be honest.  Once you have that feedback, look at getting it out the farther. Until then, go write another one.     Great line of thinking, would make a very interesting story. I will have to keep this thought of yours in mind and see if anything developes.    If you are still giving out flairs, I would just love to have "Aspiring Author" as mine, but since I see it's not a choice, I would be happy to have "Mirror Thief" as my second choice.   It's the title of my latest work. Mirror Thief.  And Mirror Thief, since advertisers say you have to say something at least three times for it to lodge in your long term memory.   Thank you :-)     Normally around 1000 per hour, but when I get in the "zone" I have topped at about 1500. It helps when I am writing an action scene. Those go faster...  Hence why I try to write in a lot of action.   And I am glad you did. Thank you, it's awesome!   Love it! Thank you, and I see you snooped back a bit ;-) awesome.   Nope, and I thought someone would ask this sooner. It was all done and placed for me. I had no say.     Jetsons will never die!  LONG LIVE ROSIE!       Very welcome, would always love to have another reader.   You got it.  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks field-keywords=jamie+heppner rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Ajamie+heppner    I will cross my fingers for you.    Ahh, I thought you had seen mine in it, sorry, I was confused. ;)     Bother. Do it, if you don't try you have already lost.   I will be looking into that asap, thank you.   Really? Pardon my ignorance, what is Books-A-Million? Do you have a link?   It all starts with one. :-)    That is a big deal too, thank you!   Thank you!   I did. It took a while to get it right, but in the end I used Createspace. After that it was a lot of personal contact, pushing my own sales and making friends with a lot of people. Sadly, you can't (normally) just write a book and hope it will get out there, you have to sell yourself as much as the work.   I find it interesting how I just posted a few days ago how my first novel, The Event, was written almost solely on my lunch breaks. It was the only time in my day I had nothing else to do but sit down.     A couple years ago Amazon left my pricing alone, lately they have beef flip flopping it all over the place.   Amazon will not inform you when they change the price, you have to watch it yourself, constantly, and it's an incredible struggle to get them to put it back. You lose almost all your rights when you sign up with them.   I may consider sending that email. Communications with them about my work have been a little painful in the past, but thank you for the suggestion.   E-book pricing is generally lower than print book pricing. Yet Amazon takes a larger cut on e-book, so you have to decide to make far less, or raise your price some to compensate.  You get to start the pricing where you like it, but Amazon will change it with no notice to you. I believe you print version doesn't change the e-book versions pricing data all.   Thank you! If you like, I have some free works up on Amazon to pass your time with.    The joys of being forced to work with Amazon. They control the price structure. To make anything on it at all you have to mark it up, so when they choose to mark it back down for you, it's close to where you wanted it in the first place.  I am showing it at 160 pages though. (Paperback) Don't know why the kindle version is listing it at 111...   Huh, front page yesterday...Repost today...   Yeah, that's cool. I like that one.    Advice...Keep trying, if all else fails, try again. When that fails, try again.    You are your own worst critic.   And lastly,    Trust in yourself, and never stop promoting.    If you are interested in taking a look at what it is about, please feel free to look it up on Amazon.      My first real paper book is available in a real book store. And I am happy to share shelf space with other great authors like Brandon Sanderson and Amanda Hocking.   Yeah, the side bar said not to though. I try to be good even if I want to shout READ MY BOOKS! from the rooftops.   I have been told that isn't very classy.   Mine is Mirror Thief, and I am sharing space with Brandon Sanderson. :-)   Was trying to NOT turn my joy into shameless self promotion. But so be it!        Losing your walls can be a great way to move on.   Everybody hurts.   Was my first thought...gunna crash back into someone's back yard.   Two years during lunch breaks at work on the first one. Bout four months on the second. Many other short stories and long ones started-finished in between.   Come to think of it, I have way too many stories going on right now.   Yes, except I have pretty much gone full indie, so not exceptionally good there...   Finding a beta reader who will be honest with you can be a true challenge. It helps if you have no personal connection with the person yet still value their opinion.   If you do happen to come across a person that fits this bill, you also have to remember that their opinion might not match the masses. That's where you have o go find another 5 of these people and compare all the notes. If they all agree, you have a problem.   That's why sometimes people just decide to pay people to do it. It's a faster way to the same end.   That being said, most people, like myself, can't afford to pay people. So when you do get a core group of beta's keep them close to your heart, their input can be immeserable.   Maybe we need to get some cross promoting going, hey, every post counts!   A caf I can understand, but I sell car parts now...lunch rush isn't related. Sometimes I dream of an office-cubicle job where everyone ignores you. Or for one of my books to take off, either would be nice.   And it's always around 11-3 or what we call, eat your lunch cold time.   I swear they just mill around waiting for a predetermined time to all rush in at the same time.    It's a conspiracy...   I have been working the same job for 19 years. If I didn't have my family, and my writing, I don't know what I would have done. If you can find a way to get out, do it.    What gave it away ;-)    If the customers would just stop coming in, I would have so much more free time...but they don't.    *this or Angel...always loved that show.   I have a collection of short that is up for free. It has hit the top 100 on amazon a few times.   Before I put them for free they rarely sold at all. I can't say that they help my other works, but people do give them great reviews. Maybe in time the other stories will start selling better.    During the day I help people diagnose and fix cars while giving them the best deals on parts. During the night I am a superhero...or I write stories...one of those is a lie.   Incredible! Thank you!   Already...That is a win! Love it so far thank you!      Sadly, self editing is almost impossible.   I know.  And I am so stubborn I keep trying to do it anyway.   I'm sure there is a reason, or I need to dust off some of those stories I haven't finished and get them up for sale asap!   Am I reading this wrong, you book is on sale for 4.99, yet it's only %10 done?   Glad to be of help.   It's not that hard as long as you work the scenes well. Be clear on your transitions and split the fight only when necc. It wouldn't hurt to have a reason why you shift, a loud noise, or an object moving from inside to out. A thrown chair perhaps? Give the reader a reason to shift from one to another.   POV first. I would start with the inside one for ease of structure. Who is seeing it? Are you in third person? How does it start.   Writing fight scenes isn't that much different from any other scene, with the exception of how much detail to pour in. You don't need to describe the sound his knuckles made as they impacted his front teeth for instance.  Work with your characters, pay attention to the flow and let them tell you what is happening next. Describe that to your reader, and you will have your fight scene.  If that doesn't work. Call over a friend and have them act it out for you while you scribble furiously.    Touchy subject much?   Bump? Really? This isn't a FB post on a buy and sell...   If you ever decide to start writing proffesionally, let me know. I would love to work with you on something one day.   You forgot to mention the poop.      My son asked me at bedtime, "How much money do you have?" I have always done my best to be honest with my kids, so I answered honestly, "About $70." His response was, "How do we live?"  Pretty deep for a 6 year old.   I work my 8-5 and it pays the bills. I have the dept, same as almost everyone else. I try to pull in money for my family on the side, when I can, yet there is never enough. I write books, my wife cleans peoples shitty houses. We are always living one paycheck to another.  There is never enough.  And I am getting tired of being broke.  I want to throw off my chains of my adult freedom. Yet, I wouldn't give up my life for anything.    I have know a lot of pretty faced women who were very ugly on the inside. If you are truly a beautiful soul you need only wait and the right guy will find you.   Just be sure you don't trap yourself in your own failing by looking at only the exteriors of the men around you.  	110
 Land Rover: All the looks of a rugged off roader with none of the reliability.  Buick: We reinvented ourselves because our customer base is dying out.    Back when I was in middle school there was a bakery in my town called Get Baked, which means to get high on marijuana. A lot of our parents were not happy about this.      I said Craigslist because it is a plain looking website where most transactions, especially sexual ones require meeting a complete stranger, and it has been used by murderers.   On here, we often see creepy old fashioned photos, costumes, clowns, dolls, etc. So what from today will be creepy in the future. My guess is that many attempts during the 1990s up until now of creating realistic CGI humans, such as those in movies such as Polar Express or in some video games will be looked at by our grandchildren 50 years from now the way we look at a vintage doll and call or creepy. I also think that the idea that we used craigslist will creep them out somewhat.    r/unexpected      Looks like a CHUD https://nitehawkcinema.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/chud-1.jpg   Don't know why you've been downvoted. It might be hard to do because of technical limitations, but I think it would be pretty cool to be able to go between Los Santos and Liberty City.   So I guess a title such as "Give me some tips on when it is appropriate and safe to stop, speed up, or keep going at the same pace  at a yellow light" would have triggered better responses. Interesting how two sets of wording can refer to just about the same question and give readers a different idea/feeling to readers. I probably worded it that way due to how much I am concerned about this and want to drive with the lowest risk of an accident.      I decided to do a post asking for tips on how to handle yellow lights more safely, I got some good replies, but otherwise it was the largest collection of non-constructive comments and undeserved downvotes I have ever seen on a single post here.   http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2y76cy/any_advice_on_how_to_break_my_habit_of_flooring/   So, this is what I have concluded from the more constructive answers here. I should slow down to stop or keep going at the same pace on yellows, depending on where I am on the road. Yellow means anything but "speed up and try to beat the light". Flooring it once and making it through the yellow isn't dangerous, but doing it repeatedly causes red light running since this is nearly impossible to do every time. Using an icon such as road markings to indicate the "point of no return" is very important. I also think part of why I got so many negative responses has to do with my wording.         I wasn't going out of my way to run a red the two times I did, just thought I could make it while it was still yellow because of a lack of experience. We all make mistakes, it's just a matter of how we deal with them and understand the potential repercussions if repeated. I just felt it would help if I admitted here that my driving isn't perfect and needs improvement in the area of choosing to stop or go through the yellow. Just because I did something wrong doesn't make me an idiot.    Seriously, if you even have to ask the question, and state you are "trying to quit the habit", you do not belong on the roads and threatening lives.  I have already been doing this less because I realize it is bad and should come to an end, I just decided to ask here to see if there was anything else besides "just don't do it" that would help me.   I am really regretting this post. All I wanted was some pointers on how to be a safer driver, but instead I made myself look like an idiot.   My problem is with yellow lights. I appreciate that you felt like posting the diagram, but I already know not to run red lights, and do not do so purposefully for obvious reasons.    This is like asking "I can't stop licking electrical sockets, how do I stop" and wondering how to fix the problem.  I was thinking this was more comparable to doing something like smoking or nail biting, but I guess you can compare it to anything you want. Despite the fact that I find this an odd comparison, I've found your comments the most constructive so far.  Edit: I know that just not doing it is the solution, but also wanted to see if I should know anything else that would be important to discouraging this.   At least I realize that this is a problem which needs to be corrected. Also, neither of the red lights were at major intersections, which I am more careful about, but that still doesn't make it any better.  Edit: I'm getting downvoted for saying this needs to be weeded out of my driving and asking for ways to help besides just "don't do it"? This has to be the the most misunderstood post I have ever written here.   I have developed a bad habit of flooring the gas pedal at yellow lights. So far, it has caused me to run a red light twice. It is something I do out of impulse since I want to go through the light before it turns red, but can tell that it isn't exactly a safe thing to do, especially if I end up running the red. I used to sometimes have a problem with hitting the brakes too hard at the yellow lights but stopped doing that because of all the tailgaters on the road. So far I have only had my license for about six months and this is the only thing about my driving that I currently have a major concern about.  Edit: I was asking for advice other than the obvious "just don't do it". I probably also made this sound worse than it really is. Thanks to all of you who made constructive comments. I will keep those in mind. To everyone who decided to be a flat-out jerk, I could care less about rude, pointless comments made by some stranger on the internet.   In addition, it would be nice to also see a return of the Virgo and Marbelle, even if the Marbelle is pretty average-ish. I just like that era of cars.   Personally I would like the PMP 600 and Faction from IV back, just to name two I can think of right now.      Was playing SA and all of the sudden heard this guy say "have you ever done a cat up the ass?"       2. Look at cars like a 69 shelby cobra, would you rather own the car that was never crashed or the one that had an accident in '72 and has non-factory original paint?  Would we even necessarily know if there was an accident back in 72' on a pre-Carfax car?   I was thinking maybe a 1980s Plymouth Gran Fury since it is of the age the Fury was back then, shares part of its name, and was essentially the successor of the Fury, but something tells me that as a boxy, average looking sedan, it wouldn't seem as creepy. The Monte Carlo would be more intimidating, especially if it were an SS.      UAZ      The scrappy doo of cars         I asked this same question 2 months ago and got mostly vague responses indicating that it likely happens in negligible numbers, but after re-reading some old Bring a Trailer posts and seeing two federalized Audi RS Avants, one formerly owned by Paul Walker, I have to assume that there must be others out there.  http://bringatrailer.com/2013/06/05/very-youngtimer-federalized-2001-audi-rs4-avant/  http://bringatrailer.com/2014/05/18/federalized-non-usa-2003-audi-rs6-avant/      The DHS makes seizing smuggled cars a priority when there should be more focus on seizing smuggled drugs and keeping terrorists out of the county.   Okay, I just used that as an example since a gun seems like it would probably be more dangerous than a car if used improperly, not because I am someone who vigorously opposes gun rights or is afraid of the AR-15.   The legislator claims that the Obamacare ruling in 2012 made the NMDAA, which forces states where the drinking age is under 21 to forfeit funding unconstitutional. Also, they could prevent the number of drunk 18 year olds on the road from rising significantly if they lowered the drinking age and also toughened drunk driving penalties.       The Equus and K900 look like the kind of fictional luxury cars made from an amalgamation of different vehicles that would appear in a video game so the studio doesn't have to pay manufacturers.   In my state, New York, which has among the toughest gun laws in the nation, the AR-15 and similar firearms are referred to as assault weapons in legislation that banned them shortly after the Newtown massacre.   Two other things are stupid about this,  **1.** Foreign market cars under 25 years old are illegal on the federal level, but in most states, ordinary citizens can legally own deadly assault weapons. Edit: after going through the proper process and obtaining a license.  **2.** The maximum sentence for this is 20 years, many murderers don't even get that much.            Russia   I don't get why hitting brakes to signify that a tailing driver is following too closely is so commonly done. If you brake check and they ignore it or don't pay attention, doesn't this increase the risk of a collision? Why not do something else?   Maybe the owners died shortly after buying/leasing them.      I wouldn't go that far, Marijuana legalization seemed very unlikely 20-30 years ago.   I remember hearing a few years ago that the ruling that Obamacare was unconstitutional because it forces states to comply could potentially set the stage for making the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which forces states with a drinking age under 21 to forfeit highway funds unconstitutional as well. With this already done, what would it take for the drinking age to have a chance of being lowered, or the NMDAA have a chance of being repealed?    Fuzzy dice   The USVI drives on the left, but as a U.S. territory has hardly any RHD cars since they are subject to FMVSS regulations. Therefore, the only RHD cars legal over there are the relatively rare RHD USDM Jeep, Subaru, and Honda mail wagons, and 25 year old cars from the rest of the world. Could 25 year old RHD imports potentially gain popularity as used cars for non-enthusiasts over there due to potential advantages of using them in left side traffic, or would it make little difference to people who drive there. Would the age be a turn-off for buyers?      These would seem really cool to me,  - GTA Japan set during the bubble economy.  - GTA Russia set either right after the break up of the Soviet Union or during the 60's-80's height of the Cold War.  - GTA Mexico set during the present-day drug cartel situation.  - GTA set in any grungy 1970's era big American city.   Surprised they haven't all been stripped or sent on a ship to the third world by now.      Since it is in Michigan, it may have been driven for some time with manufacturer plates, or brought in from Canada. There were plans to sell these in the US, supposedly. There is an e38 730d I have seen around my town for the second time in 6 months, it hasn't been crushed yet, knock on wood. I really don't get why the Feds have to use the energy and money to crush grey market cars instead of auctioning them off on the condition that whoever buys them exports it.         Probably wouldn't happen, but I've always liked the idea of a GTA game set outside the USA. Perhaps go back to London like the GTA 2 expansion packs, deport Niko Bellic and set the game in Eastern Europe, or even go for an entirely new setting and character, such as one in China, Japan, or Mexico.            Didn't think of the possibility of fraud.    Documents and actual events are two seperate things, so I guess you can change a birthdate as much as you can destroy all records of a person, edit them out of photos, and say they never existed (as in Stalin era Nonpersons). It would be more appropriate to consider reform of certain age related laws.   This is why I came up with the 90 day limit. And no, this particular person's parents did not give a fake age and he didn't justify those who did.   With their complicated, expensive, components, I don't expect modern-day Mercedes-Benzes to become legendary beaters in the kind of way that the W123 has been for years.    Well, on paper the government claims that newer cars can be legalized by a registered importer after undergoing rigorous, expensive testing and modification, but often this isn't possible and when it is barely anyone actually does it because of the price. There was this for sale half a year ago, formerly owned by Paul Walker, http://bringatrailer.com/2014/05/18/federalized-non-usa-2003-audi-rs6-avant/   Good choice, but not legal here until 2019.   It would essentially be changing the date when someone is legally treated as a person of a certain age. Now that you say it "changing your birthdate" would just be a more complicated, more extreme form of emancipation.   During 90 days little aging or development happens. A former classmate of mine told me that he came to America with no birth certificate because he was born in a country where a war was taking place and newborn babies were being killed in hospitals. He said that his parents remembered his birthdate and had it printed correctly on the birth certificate he received after immigrating. However, he also said that he had heard stories of other foreign born children, including ones from his own country, who came to the US with no birth certificate whose parents made them 1-2 or more years younger than their actual age, usually with the idea that this would give them an advantage in sports.    What kind of fraud?   Where?   "legally do certain things slightly earlier," -  A lot of things.  "or just don't like the date of their birthday" - I'm not one, but it would probably suck to have your birthday on Christmas or 9/11.   Height can change due to certain medical conditions, and besides just names, people can also change their legal sex and race.    It wouldn't legally be considered a margin of error.   I know that your birthdate is the day you were born, but a lot of things are legally one way, but physically another. I would, however, want it to be limited so you can only make yourself 90 days older or 90 days younger, and once every 10 years, so we won't see things like high schoolers making themselves 21. Some people want to get their kids into school earlier, legally do certain things slightly earlier, or just don't like the date of their birthday. I don't see the harm in making oneself slightly younger or older on a piece of paper. This would also be a good way for the government to make some extra money if they charge a fee to do so.

With it's crooked grill, faded landau top, el cheapo rims, and panels that are all in slightly different shades of maroon, it looks nothing like a car that royalty would drive.   Perhaps the 1980s Lincoln Town Cars or Mark VI. The Mark VI has most of the same styling cues of the 70s Lincolns but is downsized like the Town Car. Probably get 18-22 MPG. There is also the 1983-87 Continental sedan which is a mid sized car which should get better MPG and has Lincoln looks. It was also available with a BMW diesel engine, though these are rare. The front drive 1990-93 Chrysler Imperial and New Yorker also have pop up headlights, a big grill, and limousine like feel, but are less substantial looking IMO.   Saw the Mustang with "LEFT HAND DRIVE" printed on the back window. I've heard that is a legal requirement for the remaining LHD cars in India.   I saw it happen yesterday. This random girl (not a hooker either) got angry and randomly started shooting at cops. Should have taken a screenshot. After she killed the cops, I was able to take the police car without acquiring a wanted level.      While playing Grand Theft Auto and garaging, as well as customizing and respraying vehicles stolen off the street, I thought about a story my uncle told me years ago. During the early 90's he had a popular late-model luxury car which was stolen and then recovered two weeks later. It came back waxed, washed, and with new tires, brakes, an oil change, and a full tank of gas. The man who stole it had been using it as if it were his own car. He said that this guy thought he would be able to keep the car longer and get away with it. To do this in real life seems pretty dumb, but I guess it can happen.      rolling coal   Porn theaters   I keep hearing outdated, but doesn't firearm technology rarely change?   On one hand, I think it would make sense for the US Army to use the enemy's stuff they have captured for themselves so they can have a larger supply, kind of like police departments using seized vehicles as patrol cars or undercover units. On the other hand, it might be good to destroy them so the enemy has no way to get them back.   Hypothetical            After reading this post I did over a month ago, I have decided that there are two possible scenarios for Malaise Era cars. http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2ftkc9/will_malaise_era_cars_ever_increase_in_value_or/  1. Malaise Era cars other than the ones that are currently obvious collectibles will go up in value/popularity in about 10 years as they become more distinctive from modern cars, 70s-80s imports will go up in value, and they will be discovered by a new audience. Today, a Malaise Era car on the road stands out due to its strong differences from modern cars. Some 70s-80s European and Japanese cars are beginning to go for stupid money, while most Malaise Era cars can still be had for dirt cheap. Some may become the lower priced alternatives, if they aren't already. In ten years, the oldest Malaise Era cars will be 50 years old. That is a long enough time for many of these car's faults to not be well remembered anymore, especially by hipsters who crave borrowed nostalgia for decades they never experienced. They already seem to be becoming surprisingly popular among collectors in Europe. I will also note that I read Hemmings Classic Car which regularly runs articles about domestics of this era.  2. Malaise Era cars other than the obvious collectibles are not fondly remembered by most enthusiasts and will fade into obscurity. A few will be collected by a small cult following, but that is it. When they were new, these weren't the cars that kids of the 70's and 80's wanted, they were mostly what the older generations wanted, so the market for these cars is dying out. They also have already had about 20 years to become top dollar collector's items but haven't. It took about 15 years each for people to redevelop a fondness for 40s, 50s, and 60s American cars so there must be some good reason why this hasn't happened yet with the Malaise Era. It will be a buyers market for these cars in about 10 years and most people will look at them at car shows the way they look at old beer cans in an antique store.  Which one is more likely and why?   Yes, but perhaps this decreased the number of black W123s in warmer climates over the years because this made them harder to sell and therefore more likely to be sent to the scrapyard, resprayed, or bought solely for their bargain basement price by people who abused them.         Usually black is a very common color for Mercedes, but black W123s seem to rarely show up for sale. I have seen more online in avocado green than black and only one ever in person. I would have expected that black would be more popular for these cars since it is a very common color for W116s, W126s, W124s, and W201s.   Thanks, I had an image in my mind of 200D drivers spending their entire time using the Autobahn with the gas pedal floored.   The Autobahn is speed unrestricted in many parts, and many European market cars have 100 hp or less. Are such cars able to use the Autobahn successfully, would they not be able to keep up, or is there a legal minimum amount of power required to use it?         I've heard that most W123s and E30s in Europe are just old clunkers, while they have a large following and higher prices in North America.      Mercedes GLC      Diplomats are technically allowed to use their immunity to drive non US spec cars on American roads. A few years ago a Lancia Thesis went up for sale in Washington D.C., I believe it was advertised as for diplomat use or export only, http://jalopnik.com/attention-diplomats-a-lancia-thesis-is-for-sale-and-it-1462465134.      The Prado is essentially a Lexus GX with a different front clip. Perhaps somebody converted it.   I've heard the quality of these is terrible. After doing some research, it is claimed that some begin rusting when still new on the dealer lot. As for how it got here, my guess would be diplomatic immunity or driven across the border from Mexoco, since late-model non US spec cars are nearly totally banned here and there is probably no way it could pass Cali emissions testing. Reminds me of Crazy Vaclav's Place of Automobiles on The Simpsons.         Name some examples you would like to see built.      I write this because as much as people say Malaise Era cars were terrible, I think there were some high points. There were far fewer high points for the low powered, outdated, drab, "Commie Cars" of questionable quality. I think that if I had been a recent Eastern European immigrant in America when Malaise cars were still current, a midrange 1974-84 domestic such as a Chevy Caprice would feel like a king's car in comparison to Trabants and Ladas. On the other hand, old Eastern Bloc cars today seem to enjoy a larger cult following and higher continued use as daily drivers in their home markets compared to Malaise cars in North America.   I have noticed that this seems to be the case among many manufacturers all over the world since at least the 1950s. Sometimes it's the same car available with a variety of spec levels (Mercedes-Benz E-Class, BMW 5 Series, Toyota Crown, Volga), if not, they often share the same platform (Ford Panther, GM B-Body, Holden Commodore/Caprice)               Looks 10 years too late, the only real improvement over the current generation is that the grille no longer reminds me of a 70s Oldsmobile. Better, but would still take an S-Class over it.   Infiniti Q45, Cadillac Deville/DTS, Lexus LS400, Chrysler 300C, Buick Park Avenue, 1990s Mercedes or BMW.      Nissan President   Could be for one particular make, model, era, country or region of origin etc.         I have seen many youtube videos and pictures on google images  and some car sites of BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes, usually older though, that have been similarly butchered in places like China or Russia. I guess communism lowers their standards.   I'm sure this would seem really cool if you transported it back to the year 2001, but IMHO it is 10,000 times worse than a beat-up 318i with M3 badges.   Mazda Cosmo JC   Is it economy, development, culture, politics, or physical location? I have heard Japan being referred to as a Western country, despite being located in Asia, while also hearing Cuba being considered Eastern, despite its close proximity to Florida.   For example, have you ever been somewhere that seemed like a piece of another country that was brought over somehow, in ways beyond just the language and culture predominant there and perhaps been confused about where you actually were.      To think that a car built on an assembly line in Detroit, from a midrange brand, with fit and finish issues when new, and that was a common sight in trailer parks 30 years ago is selling for ultra-luxury exotic money seems ridiculous to me. I could understand $100k, or even, $150k being paid by some old rich dude who really wants it, but $350,000, really?   I found this site with a large number of black   white pictures of old American cars in the USSR. Some appear to belong to diplomats or foreign governments, but others I'm not so sure. There seems to be one or more of almost everything from 1950-1979, including Cadillacs, Lincolns, Chevys, Mustangs, Challengers, and even AMCs. I had thought the import of US made cars and other products to the Soviet Union during the Cold War era was banned, and if not, extremely restricted.  See them here: http://www.freedomcars.ru/retro/oldamcar.shtml (in Russian)   Def a GTO if it was left hand drive   A very old lady in my town used to have a tan, beat up 1976 Chevy Monte Carlo. Last saw it about 5 years ago. She drove it year round, including in the snow.   Usually the oldies stay in the garage when it snows.   Weren't they built in 1990, next year you will be able to get one imported under the 25 year rule if you are in the US.         I regularly read that site, but outside of CC, and also sometimes The Truth About Cars, these types of cars are either ridiculed or ignored as I previously stated. I wait a long time for when Bring a Trailer decides to post a Brougham, which is rarely, and when it does happen, the comment section is overrun by trolls. They would rather see Ladas and black bumpered MGs with Lucas electronics for some reason. When I go between CC and BaT, I am amazed by how much difference there is between the tastes and opinions of the readers.      Among other things, I really like Malaise Era American cars, and no not Trans Ams, DeLoreans, and Fox Mustangs, my thing is mainly the Great Brougham Epoch models. Lincoln Continentals, Cadillac Eldorados, big Buicks, Bonnevilles, Caprices, and Chrysler New Yorkers for example. While most on r/cars say that this was a dead zone for American cars, I think of the mid 70s-mid-80s and see a lot of domestics I would gladly own. Style wise, I find the oversized models just as attractive, elegant and intriguing as the earlier 50s and 60's versions. Many of the boxier, downsized versions I believe can be considered among the cleanest, best proportioned cars ever made, right there with the W123 and E30. They may not have been the pinnacle of reliability, efficiency, or engineering, but they have their positives. When I see them on the road today, they stand out from modern traffic with their boxy, sharp edged, un-sporty, un-aerodynamic lines, size, and presence. When I read r/cars or other car sites and see little positive being said when this era of American cars are brought up, I feel like I have the automotive equivalent of a strange fetish.   It seems like it in rare to see a late model (96' and up) car that has been made into a true lowrider. Not a stanced car, or bagged one, but one that has been modified with hydraulics and the other common customizations such as pinstriping. Is this because the mostly 50s-80's classics and older models that are popular are particularly suited for these sort of modifications? Are newer cars too hard to modify and work on, or do they just not have the right "style".   Here's a riced out E60 replica from China, http://www.carnewschina.com/2012/01/06/brilliance-bs6-really-thinks-it-is-a-bmw/   Meh.   I should have specified "classic car" shows.      Salvador Dali bottle      I have a raging foot fetish.      I once saw a 400 mile 2009 MY car at a dealer. The story I was told is that  it was leased by a guy whose health failed shortly after obtaining it. He spent over a year in the hospital, during this time the car stayed parked and he was not allowed to cancel the lease. I'm guessing that his ability to drive was limited afterwards. This is the lowest mileage I've ever seen on a 4 year old car, so what your looking for is probably few and far between.   These are rare today.      Cuba's vintage cars are banned for export, unless special permission is obtained. There is also no guaranty that an end to the US trade embargo will mean Cuban cars becoming exportable. The export ban is mentioned in this article, http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/cuba-gives-green-light-to-buying-selling-cars/article557923/.   20k or 35k makes a big difference. At 20k you are in CRV and Santa Fe territory, at 35k you are in X1 and GLK territory.         Maserati sales went up by about 250% with the introduction of the Maserati Ghibli.  	162
 What the hell does retiring or standing down have to do with representing one's constituents in Parliament. Either they're people's MP or they're not. Are you saying they get to stop early becasue they're not after people's vote next time and so don't have to do their job properly? They should be supporting shared parenting becasue it's the right thing to do, not just to get votes.  I suppose you make a fair point about minister's sometimes tending not to sign, though in most cases the sexism accusations still stand for those MPs, particularly Lynne and Lorely (and increasingly so for Jo too). Lynne has a very long history of terrible sexism against men and it's a scandal she's ever been allowed near any equalities position given her obvious contempt for half the population. How often did you actually see her actually do her job and pushed for shared parenting (or for any significant equal rights for men and boys for that matter). I hear that Lorely is quite the sexist too, with Jo now also getting in on the action and actually campaigning against any progress toward equality when it doesn't benefit women: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html               All feedback is appreciated, I'll fix the article so it suits a more global audience.      the second paragraph uses the full terminology for "EDM"   Bit of a shame really, I expected the Lib Dem women would be more in support of equality than the likes of Labour.   Actually it's not all that dumb becasue many other issues elsewhere also see significant rises, for example the number of road deaths in countries such as India is staggering, thus easily dwarfing murder of women.  Any articles debunking lies (and UN lies at that) has to be extremely welcome         Thanks for this, i think I may well add it to the article as an explanation for the results.      Are there any Firefox or Chrome plug-ins to block Gawker sites?      Most are/were complete cunts though and that's the criteria we're looking for here.    This is an issue that disproportionately affects men, so it is unsurprising to me that it would attract proportionally more male signatories.  Except we're told that the reason we need female MPs is that they'll all be far less macho, and instead of focusing on big engineering schemes and the military, they'll push for equality and for breaking down gender roles. Thus, were the female MPs to act as we were todl they would, then their support for shared parenting woudl be significantly igher than the support from men.  Furthermore, this is not simply a men's issue. Child are damaged hugely by a lack of relationship with their fathers (both boys and girls), and wrongly exclusing the father from a child's life almost always goes in hand with excluding grandparents, uncles and aunts etc  Anyway, thanks for checking the stats, there seems to have been a rounding error and so 12 looks to be the correct figure. (BTW  60% represents how many extra female MPs would have been needed were the number of male supporters adjusted downwards - i.e. if the 104 figure was fixed)   Update, I tweeted some of the various female MPs who failed to sign the EDM and one actually replied! No indication of her changing her mind though unfortunately.   * Schmeichel * G Neville * Ferdinand * Keane * P Neville * Giggs * Rooney * Scholes * Ronaldo * Van Nistelrooy * Cantona        Lots more new research planned in future, though we're going to move onto taking on Amazon next so keep an eye on the blog   Care to elaborate? Any mistakes will be fixed asap   Lots more new research planned in future, though we're going to move onto taking on Amazon next....         Exactly. The Lib Dems weren't responsible for Rotherham (nor countless other similar cases)   TBH I haven't seen too many sex offenders in UKIP at all. Similarly I've never seen them hanging around with terrorists or planting bombs. Corruption seems to be something of a recurring issue in UKIP to at least the same extent as in Labour.  Ultimately, I think it's fair to say that the types of undesirables seems fairly different between parties.   Looks there's actually one Labour MP I'd consider voting for after-all.         At HEqual we ran a pretty successful campaign last year against the Boys are Stupid products.  In the end we got more than half of retailers to withdraw the products and most of the biggest UK book distributors also cased stocking the merchandise. Perhaps it's time for phase two now?   Danczuk seems to have more common sense and be of more use than all the other Labour MPs combined.   Yes Paypal is accepted, I've asked Mike to include the Paypal link in future videos as he seems to forget to do that a lot. Anyway, here it is:  https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick hosted_button_id=BQX55DAV9AEKW  Main donation page is: https://j4mb.wordpress.com/donate/   Could you perhaps name some of those players for the benefit of those who don't follow the sport too closely?  Thanks.      A really sickening practice, it's a shame politicians don't dare stand up to this abuse of children.              the fact of the matter is that vast majority of domestic violence is male to female  Utter nonsense, literally hundreds to studies show gender symmetry in terms of perpetration of domestic violence. Yes a lot more males abusers are found in police statistics, but that's simply due to the failure to seek out, report and arrest females perpetrators. When you actually look at more reliable indicators such as crime surveys you find huge numbers of male victims and female perpetrators.  http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.5578 rep=rep1 type=pdf  To further emphasise just how false your remark is, just think about all differnet types of domestic violence out there that we ignore. For example there's domestic violence against children, a notable aspect of which is the tendency of mothers to abuse boys much more than girls. also think about homosexual relationship, which many studies note are the most violent of any type. The idea that domestic violence is almost always men abusing women is quite simply a lie.   Thanks, a slight correction: I've now found an article that describes it as "domestic violence" but only in the context that it "isn't the first domestic violence incident between the former couple". There is still no source that outright describes this particular incident as domestic violence in itself.    I couldn't find a single article about this issue that used the term "domestic violence" to describe these crimes. Amazing how the media changes it's terminology when it's the male that's the victim, or the female that's the perpetrator.   Fantastic video, it's interesting to hear knowledgeable campaigners speak in depth on men's issues.                  There are other mirrors of some of the videos                     Note the BBC's bias here (and the media generally)  What we have is a set of laws that refuses to protect innocent male babies from dangerous, non-consesnual and irreversible mutilation, with such barbaric practices even funded and supported by the taxpaer! On the other hand, the same laws are  over-protective of females to such an extent that the laws becomes concerned with mere piercings on consenting adults.  It's obvious that males are subject to extreme discrimination by the government, yet the BBC has to pretend it's females are the victims despite the reverse obviously being the case.            Here's the info on the three constituencies and candidates (they are all in the Nottingham area):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashfield_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broxtowe_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s     Actually that's not true at all, you can help out from afar in all sorts of ways.  For a start you can share J4M B links and videos, follow them on Twitter and retweet them. Comments on articles about J4M B help too.  Donations from abroad are also permitted just as long as they're not thousands and thousands of pounds.  Feedback is good too, for example you can suggest improvements and submit better academic sources for any weaker parts of the Manifesto.  They don't' even have a Wikipedia article yet either so perhaps someone could help with that also.   They aren't seeking to ban abortion, just to change the present limit on the time frame at which abortions are not longer allowed. The main purpose of this seems to be to ensure no viable foetus is ever aborted                                                            Here's the second video with the screaming and ranting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfyekgkpB5I               Anyone know what happened to the false accuser?         It's not about me - the point is that a lot of people on Reddit use iPhones etc and therefore won't be very likely to block ads.  This proves we need to avoid linking to sites making money out of misandry and instead need to use archive links.   As far as i'm aware it's not link spamming - the problem seems to a lack of IT skills by J4M B staff combined with the total absence of any spare time in the run up to the election. I have passed on comments to Mike and he's promised to get round to fixing it after the election  Anyway i will make a text post soon after getting some more specific details of when people are needed.   There's not much on ios   J4M B are standing in three constituencies in the Nottingham area. It would be great if these guys could get a semi respectable number of votes and in some cases at least defeat other smaller parties. Details of the constituencies they are contesting and the rival parties are here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwood_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashfield_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broxtowe_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s          That's not completely true, for example it's harder to enable adblock on phones and tablets etc, and therefore people might only use it on their computer.      Not really fair to insist on highlighting such as chasm, afterall MGM is funded by the taxpayer, so just putting a stop to that waste of money and making the abusers fund the mutilations themsleves would be a start.      Actually, I think the filter pre-dates the SPLC nonsense   Well 95% of blocked sites were identified through my research, I identified which technology was behind the blocking, and which companies use it.   Some more articles I've written on this topic:  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/an-email-to-the-symantec-board.html  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/o2-and-symantec-equality-for-men-is-more-hateful-than-stormfront.html  http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/symantec-o2-still-censoringdefaming-mhra-sites/  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/07/now-fathers4justice-are-censored-and-defamed-by-o2-and-symantec.html      I'm not familiar with Symantec's politics, although I found one person involved to be a feminist (though she was only responsible for defending the sexism and not in charge of the actual filter technology).  It does occasionally block really extreme feminist sites, though generally it does seem that the "hate" classification gets triggered by  the transphobic content on those sites and it generally doesn't appear to be programmed to block  sites containing hate speech directed at men.   Would be nice if those rules in the textbook applied to the domestic violence industry in terms of how they refer to victims/perpetrators.   I saw that censorship of men's human rights sites was a hot topic right now so best re-post some of my investigative work into the matter. I wrote this article over two years ago but it's all still 100% accurate today becasue nothing has changed,   I'm probably the foremost expert on the censoring of men's human rights sites by web filters and I've written 5 or 6 articles investigating exactly what's going on and which companies use the filters.  I'll share more of those articles later or others are free to post them. If anyone has any questions on this issue I'll be able to answer most of them fairly easily and accurately.  Some further reading of my research into the matter:  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/an-email-to-the-symantec-board.html  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/06/o2-and-symantec-equality-for-men-is-more-hateful-than-stormfront.html  http://www.avoiceformen.com/misandry/symantec-o2-still-censoringdefaming-mhra-sites/  http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2013/07/now-fathers4justice-are-censored-and-defamed-by-o2-and-symantec.html      Hi, I've written more about the blocking of men's human rights sites than probably anyone else out there.  There are actually quite a few school who use the Symantec filtering system. It blocks men's human rights sites as "hate sites" so your school is probably better than a lot of others and at least only censoring instead of also defaming organisations.                              Except the court wishes to see the child's undergo sexual assault and irreversible mutilation, all completely against his will. It's even willing to jail those seeking to protect the innocent child. It' surely advisable to stay well away from institution that uses such threats and supports violence and sex abuse?   I disagree. If the father wants to mutilate his kid than that's one thing, the truly abhorrent part here is the court trying to force this mutilation upon the child.  There are plenty of crazy and messed up people out there who want to do evil things to kids, we can't change that to any great extent, but we surely can at least stop the government joining in and taking their side.            Thanks for making this a sticky!               Meanwhile companies such as Symantec block men's human rights sites every single day. A few examples of what they consider to be "hate" sites:  * http://www.dvmen.co.uk * http://dvmen.org * http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com            Note that the article actually uses the term "paternity fraud". That's real progress and almost certainly down to the work of our movement and our insistence on using accuracy terminology to describe such a crime.          I prefer it. If you aren't and prefer it, good. It's not yours or my business what others do.  In this case the boys clearly doesn't' prefer it, yet this mutilation is being forced upon him by the state against his will and against the will of his mother. Such an outrage is everyone's business and courts shouldn't be ordering the mutilation of kids.     So she went form supporting child abuse to opposing it. Surely people who read the evidence and change their minds after learning the facts and ethics about an issue should be commended for doing the right thing instead of put in prison?  Even ignoring all he above, at the end of the day the child has stated he doesn't' want to be mutilated. It' his penis and if he doesn't' want people chopping bits of it off then it's his choice.   perhaps you should be aware that America is about the only developed country to endorse such abuse and that others regard it as so harmful that they are looking at banning it.  As with all things, also be sure to follow the money to figure out how some AAP decisions come about.   The Bloodstained Men are a excellent and extremely long running intactivist group who campaign against male genital mutilation in America.  They're great at raising awareness and confronting those performing and endorsing MGM. They're targeting the north-east this year due to it's higher than average rates of MGM (over 70%!) so its' really important to challenge attitudes in such states in order to protect children from this form of abuse.  A few videos of them in action for those who haven't seen them yet:  * [Protest in Denver] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSsdPE4AC0g) * [Interesting exchange in Tuscaloosa, Alabama] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-PujOfGYZ8) * [Protest at the AAP convention in San Diego] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGPu4jB_L2g)   They're looking to raise $5K and at the time of making this post they are at $2,140, here's the donation page:  http://www.youcaring.com/nonprofits/help-fund-the-2015-northeast-bloodstained-men-tour/294627  These guys work hard and have even been wrongly arrested while protesting, so they deserve our full support.  Thanks   Any supposed benefits of MGM will never outweigh the risks and harm caused. It's obvious that important body parts should never be amputated unless they are diseased or damaged beyond repair.  Butchering kids genitals just for the hell of it and without their consent is sickening child sex abuse.   There's a big campaign to tweet about this using the hashtag #SaveChase  It also seems to be a trend to draw said hashtag on your body, and upload the photo of it.  There's also a legal fund set up to fight the case, though note that I haven't fully investigated who's running it etc and exactly how the money is being spent: http://chasesguardians.org/wp/                                    Really generous of someone to spend 1,000 to donate this to J4M B.      Laughable article, but it's well worth reading the comments section                  I too was suspicious about the likelihood of a genuinely right-wing party proposing such a thing, and it's actually almost completely false to categorise this party as right-wing. It was true at one time, but according to Wikipedia they've shifted over the last decade from being right-wing towards the center:   "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Coalition_Party   More coverage here: http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Fathers-4-Justice-protesters-gatecrash-Harriet/story-26124727-detail/story.html                                                                                             Mirror (for international viewers and anyone wanting to watch after 28 days): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur98y80Q7as   Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur98y80Q7as   Youtube link now available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur98y80Q7as      People outside the Uk often can't view iPlayer content.

 lost in translation m8    dark souls 3 confirmed    More of a techno goth. I think it was movies with alternative club scenes like Blade and The Matrix when I was little that really got the interests flowing.     Here's some stuff i'm into. I can't afford these particular brands so I settle for minimal, toned down versions of the look, but this is the kind of aesthetic I really dig.

All these people who claim not to be assholes but justify another assholes behaviour.... probably assholes.    I disagree and personally hope this completely ruins her career. She straight up roasted that woman, that's the kind of shit that makes depressed people go home and off themselves. If only more rampant bitches were forcibly humbled like this maybe the world wouldn't be such an intolerable place for all us "regular folk."   Not even on my worst day ever would I resort to that kind of language and behaviour, and i'm just a nobody college student not some professional whose entire image is based on public perception. If she was really half as smart and savvy as she's convinced she is she'd have never acted that way to anyone, ever..    It's okay, I didn't know you could lock on to enemies until after Anor Londo    I just meant if you're planning on starting the game on the trip 9 hours won't be enough to get anywhere in-game :P   9 hours - hah!     lol first thing my mind went to was DS when I saw this on the front page    I wanna clear this place out and use it as my HQ to take over the world    You may be different but generally people don't want to sit right next to someones bare feet on a hot crowded train...    probably got bedbugs from that shit.    Punch her right in the pussy  na but seriously i'd tap her on the shoulder at least and ask her to move. Done it before countless times.    I'm officially gay now :(    lold   Yeah i'm sure it's a good time, I'm not hating or anything just found it a little bit funny in my head.    Yeah but meeting up to play videogames makes sense because you actually have something to do. :)    lol I mean I love my mechanical keyboard but a bunch of people meeting up just to talk about and take pictures of their multiple keyboards cracks me up for some reason.    Macbook Pro    Yeah those dragonslayer archers are admittedly hard to get past, even if you know what you're doing. Also that fucking titanite demon in the cathedral one hits me even at 46 vit and full Havel armour in NG+ lol   First play-through I was having trouble up until Anor Londo. Then once I got to the big ol sunny city everything just clicked and I was taking out those giants and gargoyles like nothing. Farmed the painted world for little while and got a bunch of levels, got lucky and killed S O second try, smooth sailing from there on.  Now in NG+ I'm back in Anor Londo and S O are making me their bitch.   UP anybody?   play this every time by default    Izalith. Fuck that titanite demon shortcut.    I agree with pretty much the same things everybody is saying here. Dark Souls 1 is a more special experience in almost every way, the only thing DS2 has on it is updated graphics.   The design, atmosphere, lore, combat, and overall consistency of DS1 is far better.   The Second Renaissance. It's a part of the Animatrix compilation. Short but well worth watching. I believe it's in parts on youtube.   holy fuck H M got a bigass sign now    Behold, the great white towers of Detroith   love it, kinda reminds me of old Skinny Puppy. 808's all over each track and still managed to keep it deep and dark       Also read up about the legendary nightclub Berghain. It's literally a standing temple devoted to hedonism and cheap overindulgence to this day. It  began as a sex club that happened to play music and evolved from there. It is what immediately came to mind when you described the sort of place you envision.    Anyone who plays the mainroom at Berghain. I recommend you check out some of the Reclaim Your City podcasts on SoundCloud to see if they fit your aesthetic. It's generally dark and future-industrial but still dancey club techno. It's the stuff the real heads are listening to, straight out of places like Berlin, Tokyo, Rome, etc. Idk if that's your thing or not, but I love it and I totally feel like it fits in with the whole cyberpunk aesthetic.  https://soundcloud.com/reclaim-your-city    Merely having billions of dollars is not my definition of a success. It depends what is done with it. And most people in the bracket we're discussing haven't done a thing to earn their fortunes anyways, most are born into it. (with obvious exceptions.)  I like Gates because he actually puts his money where his mouth is and donates the vast majority of his personal fortune to causes that benefit society. But this earth doesn't need more families like the Rothschild's or the Waltons, whether they admit it or not.    So you don't see the problem then, clearly..    Nobody cares about the doctors taking home 400k for decent honest work. That's the American dream.   It's the corrupt politicians who give their powerful friends breaks and enable the ultra-rich to get richer that people have a problem with. Sadly while being a billionaire is great, self made or not... you've gotta face the ethical qualms of having a personal fortune worth more than some countries entire GDP and still actively trying to get more.    So you're not convinced there's a wealth gap at all because there's not a reliable source in the video to confirm it?  lol have you not seen rich people? have you not seen poor people?    To most people it's not the doctors and lawyers that are the problem, but some of the more prominent politicians, bankers and CEOs who really make up the gross wealth gap.   400k a year is still relative pennies to the super-rich "1%" (more like 0.0001% probably) who take home millions, in some cases billions a year. I say fuck those guys too.. nobody needs that kind of money in a lifetime.          I thought it was Shenron not Shenlong   $120 on asparagus... o.O   +5 is the max black knight weapons go sadly :(    Interesting, had no clue! TIL. Thanks haha.    Exact same here but with 11th grade bio.    12 years old = high school where you live?    wtf is 6th form? are you niggas evolving in there?    oh to live in America, where you can buy beer at the 7-11 but only three years after you're able to die for your country...   Thanks man, I just wasn't getting close enough the first couple times haha. You really gotta get up in there with melee. Auto-lock helped a lot too, I always forget to do that lol.  As soon as I got close enough they were a piece of ez     I'm a melee knight and i'm rocking a Black Knight sword+5, which so far has been holding up great for the duration of the game (already went through Anor Londo with it). But when I go back to vs the Four Kings I virtually seem to do no damage. Do I need to use a transient curse or something? Or just find a weapon with magic damage? What do you guys recommend? I have virtually no INT..    A good chunk of the world still has trouble feeding themselves.. This idealistic article fails to take into account that this technology will only be available to a relatively small percentage of wealthy people with expendable time and income, generally first world countries. Sure it's gonna be awesome for those who can afford it, but it's likely not going to stop any ideological wars in chaotic countries that don't even have adequate basics such as food, shelter, etc.    Her ovaries just exploded  *scroll down.. see that jokes already been made in like 30 different ways    Honestly all DJs have different styles and methods of mixing their music. Some mix straightforward, back to back with two decks. Some scratch or use creative use of effects. A hip hop turntablist is still a DJ, but the methods involved in mixing hip-hop are vastly different than say a 3,4 even 5 or 6-deck purist techno set with loads of loops and tools.   Unfortunately, typically the bigger a producer DJ gets, the more he has to adhere to a specific sound, the one all the fans who started following him want to hear. That plus the insane logistical nightmare bigger shows have of lining up sets with lighting, fireworks, pyrotech, etc is what generally leads to more predictable "press play" type sets.     If I had a dollar for every person i've heard say "DJs only press play" but couldn't tell me the first thing about what the mixer does...  Obviously there are fake/"unethical" DJs, but people act as though there's this race of magical mix-elves who pre record everything for the DJs and then they just have to go up on stage and hit play.    Sometimes it's better to stay underground with a dedicated and loyal following.    You guys just made me sad :(    Google    Hoover dam ranks 57th on the list of the worlds biggest dams. Why is it the only one they predict will remain? Or is just like a "fuck everything beyond the scope of America" thing?    Really cool video. Second half was almost hypnotizing.    Seems like a bleak place. They need more colour!    Not quite seeing the cyber...   How do you hook up your two external displays to that macbook with only one display port? I want an extra vertical monitor for reading but idk how to hook up a second one.   	64
 haha I promise i wont :)   I dont. Im in the Philadelphia sector. Sorry.  The way this account works is that they are sub accounts. So you only get to see video nothing beyond that. Well maybe free internet access at a verizon hotspot.      Its not. Its great for people overseas or those that dont have access to these channels.

Get as many A's as you can in your freshman year. These will be some of your simpler and easy classes to get a's in. That said most people do bad in these classes because they feel like they already know the material or are too busy enjoying life.    Lately, someone I know has assumed that girls in India get randomly raped all the time.  Thanks Media!   We obviously disagree on this and the general population does too as evident by the polar opposites of how they enjoyed the movie.   No you shouldnt. Be yoked with someone of equal.   My opinion and opinion of many people that have watched it has been the same.  I dont pay attention to movie critics as they are judging the movie as a work of art, whereas user reviews tend to portray if you as a normal human being going solely for the enjoyment of the movie is going to enjoy it. Based on rotten tomatoes. Critics 17%, users 82%. So take your pick. :)     Chariots of Fire - Eric Liddel.  Side note. Gods not dead was an awesome movie. It was great to see someone stand up for faith when most people shy away.   Paradise Biryani     I would say get the a6. A4 is just too tiny.    A mega man movie   I can attest that this is true!  But im at least thankful to have Fios   How do u like san diego? I was thinking about moving there but your comment makes it seem like its not a good place to move to.   5 guys sucks compared to In n out! Trust me. If in n out was in the east coast i'd eat that thing everyday. Lol   Lol i loved the screechin space-alienship noise.    I totally agree with him.  I was in complete denial that a Christian could have anxiety. I went to the route of allergy, gerd, etc doctors issues before realizing/being confronted with the fact that I have anxiety.  I still dont have it together but I am undergoing counseling and though its nor solving the anxiety to the T. It is helping me cope with what I have and be better aware of things.  Feel free to PM me about this if you want some guidelines etc.  As far as reducing your anxiety goes...  Here is one tool that can help (do all of them sitting or in some comfortable position) 1) find five things to see 2) close eyes and find five audible sounds you can hear 3) touch/feel five different things.  Repeat but step down. So go from five things to four things then three.  If after you finish the steps you still feel anxious then start over. And keep doing them until you have a better control on your breath.   Prayer is great but it alone cannot solve this. I wish it did but God provides people and other help to aid us in life. Thankfully for me I can go to A christian psychologist. So dont let prayer be your only aid.    Todays devo is great on this topic. Read it if you get a chance.   http://rightfromtheheart.org/devotions/6685/   When should one apply seeds? Some say spring some say fall.     If this truly works then you should seriousely advertise this in Bold letters. Almost all enterprise companies will jump ship to ie11 (of course after intense internal testing)   Thats a huge price to pay.    I was working in Exton in 2007. Its 2014 and they are still working on that patch of road. Its like come on just get it done with already.    Perfect! Thanks!!   I can totally agree with this. Im not saying that Christians dont curse. im saying we need to hold to a higher standard and not curse.   and yes there are lots of topics we can discuss and say Christians shouldnt do this or that. but this is one thats very apparent and very public. and one of the things that really puts me off of this subreddit in taking this as a serious platform for believers.   Colossians 3:8   ok so let me give you another verse then Colossians 3:8 "But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language" (NLT)  You bring up two good points. One the separation of cursing from something that brings another person down and one that is used to express an extreme emotion.  For something that brings a person down I would say well we both agree that its wrong. And i'll add that this type of cursing is a result of anger, possibly built up anger. So controlling that will help ease the possibility of cursing unnecessarily.  For using cursing as a way to express ones feelings : My encouragement in that area would be to use a better choice of words. Yes, I can completely understand that sometimes it would be great if Christians could freely curse. But lets be honest. How would you like it if your favorite pastor was cursing during his sermons? Would it be fitting? My fav pastor is Billy Graham and second to that Francis Chan. I could never see them deliver a God given sermon and make use of curse words. And lets be honest you wouldnt either.  If pastors, who are supposed to be role models of followers of Christ, cannot have that privilege then why should we? And keep in mind that the world will look at us the same way that Gandhi did when he commented that I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.   We can try to be more like the world or more like Christ.    I'd like to know what happened per century. Its been 20 centuries since Jesus and alot of those centuries are just ignored by majority of humans living in the present day and age because so much has happened in the last century alone.   So my humble plea to those that are passionate about history! Can you please share great events per century as far as Human History is concerned.   I tried to search for a list already but didnt see one.   Just because its used to relieve stress doesn't mean its the best way or ideal way for a Christian to use it as such.  People abuse drugs, alcohol, etc to relieve stress. Does that make it ok? No!   I'm just saying we should use a better vocabulary and hold to a higher standard.   In this subreddit and even in general I hear Christians cursing as if its completely ok! I know I'll get alot of downvotes in this but this kind of behavior doesn't suit us!   James 1:26 "If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless."   I did notice that on my recent trip there. As a Christian I was amazed and a lil weirded out. Weirded out because why are there so many churches?  My greatest concern would be how are the people there. Are they going to church because thats the thing to do or are people spiritual too?   Duh! Thats whats written   This actually sounds interesting and not boring. Name of movie?      Find someone else to like. Thats the only way.   Buy used, sell it used. Pay less than renting it. U wont always get the amount u paid for it but its better than nothing.   You need to get married! Which is true but you really dont need to say it.   They have one similar to this in Boston airport  	45
       Oh please, go back to writing your angsty poetry, would you?   Well, yeah, but it's *French* you uncultured swine.   Hmm. The connection is tenuous.   Is, um...is it...a dick?

Don't be so rudely pointed. You could afford to suggest improvements more tactfully, if you want them taken seriously.   Just so you know, OP, you misspelled "probably." Otherwise, everything is spelled correctly.

That makes more sense, but I prefer the other explanation better because it validates my opinions.  I'm torn.   Honestly I'm very surprised there isn't more content there.   You missed the reference, that's why you got downvoted.  Life is unfair.   I instantly read it in her voice :)   C'mon man, in layman's terms please.      Totally agree. Unsubbed a while ago. Very glad, much fewer random pictures of (what I think are) uninteresting things showing up on my front page.  Some people enjoy the sort of click-baity stuff that makes up most of the defaults, and that's fine, it can be fun. But I don't.   Where do you live? You can register in WA state online! Maybe you can in your state, too.   There is much hatred for this comment. It isn't the best comment, certainly. But the hatred seems disproportionate.

 Join the 944 master race, 3 years or 20,000 miles Edit: forgot to mention balance shaft belt, rollers, and water pumps as well.   I had no idea this existed... Your friend is very lucky    Was this at Stafford?   :(   First gen Honda NSX, Porsche 964 Turbo 3.8 or 993 GT2, and a Dauer 962 which is the street legal homolgation Porsche 962 Le Mans car.   Yeah I'm level 32, the only car I got was a beetle, and I've never gotten a payout above 18,000   I remember reading somewhere, the 25 year rule had to do with Mercedes. If I'm not mistaken, it had to do with buying car cheaper overseas and importing them, rather than buying directly from show rooms. And yeah, emissions and safety are a massive thing too.   Probably not, the AE111 had a high revving naturally aspirated 4 banger with ITBs and a 6 speed.   Every single time I see a petition for it, I back it up and it always gets shot down.   Nope   Look! Another car we can't get in the USA but we all want!   Mines a 1986, and what I like about it most over the other ones, is that it has the newer interior. But if I'm not mistaken, 87 was the first year when air bags and anti lock brakes were introduced, so if your going for a more mechanical feel, I'd say go 86 or older. As for cost, I can't say for sure.   I'm going to go out on a limb and say the 2.0 VTEC. I have it swapped into my AE86, with a maxed out naturally aspirated build and it just revs and makes the coolest induction noise.   You'll enjoy it, I'm really glad for you it worked out in the end.

My dad has Hagerty insurance on his cars, so I threw my 944 on there and I only pay $100 a year. The o my problem is, I'm not allowed to drive it without my dad in the car until I turn 21. What really puzzles me is Hagerty actually has something on their website about younger drivers and getting them involved in the car scene, yet they don't want to insure us.    The 964 is easily one of my favorite generations, congrats on the purchase!    I really want a 4AG in my 944 with ITBs.    What's with all the not silver 918s on here lately? Not in a bad way though, the Orange one that was posted here a couple days ago was fantastic.      Yeah it is the CTR, CTR 2 is the 993   You'd be correct, black headlight buckets and HRE 935s.      Dude your girlfriend has an FRS and 993!   Who'd you normally do the track days through? NASA does HPDE for around $50 each if you have a membership. You also get instructor time as well. Edit: I read it wrong. It's $45 membership and the actual varies from track to track.   It's doing well. Its my autocross car, and starting next year dedicated track car. I'm in the process of stripping it down to bare minimum now.    I dig the blue accents, it suits the car very well.   Doesn't the lotus esprit use them as well?   It's nice to see a 918 that's not silver for once.   Do it, I bought mine last year right after I turned 17. Out of all the very few cars I've driven, the 944 is the best. I was told it would be a money pit, and since I ordered pretty much all the parts from Rock Auto I saved a bunch of money. The best part is you get the satisfaction of telling people that you fixed a Porsche yourself.   I'm going to guess, timing belt snapped, or you need to replace it?  	32
             Great post, /u/NonnyMouse69 -- this is "Baby Step"-like instructions for moving forward!            I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I am keeping Thursday SOBER in my part of SD World!  PS: And who is on-deck to do the morning check-in next week?  Volunteers?               Welcome /u/last_picked to /r/stopdrinking -- I was in the middle of posting a comment to your post when my SO asked to run an errand.  So I like to offer all the newcomers the [Baby Steps link which is apost](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) that lays out some simple next steps to getting sober. These are the things I did.     You're really doing it, /u/xXThrowaway71Xx -- that's great news.   Welcome /u/legalize_crack to r/stopdrinking--the sidebar FAQ has lots of relevant information.  But to answer your question about how to stop--why not read through [the Baby Steps post and see if any of the ideas there resonate for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck!   You are not alone.   I personally was on the road the day I was able to stop drinking for 1 day.  I did it via the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.      Coulter is a rightwing grifter.  This is her shtick--her bread and butter.                    That's exactly right, it's the patient's privilege to waive.         That's completely on topic.  This is explicitly about US politics especially Texas politics and the current national debate.  That the owner of this company is a Texas politician is what made this Texas Tribune worthy.            Glad you found us, /u/thenewmeihope.  Have you seen [Baby Steps post, yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck on getting a sober day.  Stay close ; )   Thanks, I thought I had fully scanned for it.   Why didn't this doctor's carrier settle this case and seal the record?                                 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; even if I am still cleaning up the mess from the second basement flood in eight days.   9 PM   This was a huge step for you, congratulations!   Sure.  I wake up about 4:30 AM EST without an alarm clock apart from a cat.  After I flip on the light over my bed I take down the 24 hour a day meditation book and I read the day's entry.  I slide out of my bed onto my floor and I spend a few minutes reflecting on the AA 3rd Step and my wishes for family and friends.  I log on to /r/stopdrinking and record my commitment in the daily Check-in or later in the morning depending on what time it gets posted. Then I do a few things around the house and I'm off to coffee and to read the New York Times at a local Starbucks with my pal, "the Dude" where we solve the problems of the world, flirt with the women customers and hob nob with the other regulars.  Every Day.     I have to do all the things that are part of my daily sobriety rituals over and over again as a reminder, lest I forget.  There's an amusing insight about people like me: we are slow learners and quick forgetters. ; )   Good luck!   1.  I didn't "quit drinking" which implies "forever."  Instead, using the [ideas at the Baby Steps post I stop drinking by making a renewable resolution to not drink TODAY, only no matter what happens good or bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  2. I was in professional and criminal trouble, and I was seriously considering killing myself;   3.  I needed to extinguish the old reinforcers--friends, bars, clubs, events that fed my need to drink.  I found new reinforcers in recovery, morning rituals as I described in the [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) and by participation on r/stopdrinking.  Good luck to you.   Beautiful.  So glad you shared this.     Let's get it going.  I am not going to drink TODAY in solidarity with you.   One definition of alcoholism is progressively being unable to control the amount of drinking and actions under the influence of alcohol.  If you're interested in stopping why don't you consider the ideas at the [Baby Steps post?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Lots of us came to sobriety with doubt and after we spent time sober discovered that we highly valued the new way of life for a variety of reasons including never driving drunk.   Congratulations on you new resolve /u/randompete21 -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out exactly what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope that you will find something there that will resonate for you.  Best of luck.   Good deal, /u/dirtydan72 -- I hope you continue on the upward path for a good long time.     Then don't go.   When I was new in sobriety I was told and I believed that my number one priority is my sobriety.  That gave me permission NOT to undertake stressful or anxiety provoking adventures.  There will be other Pride events in the future when you're more secure in your sobriety.  Good luck.   My advice is very simple: 1. you aren't qualified to run a sober house so don't try; 2. keep alcohol out of your premises; and, 3. go to al anon meetings.  You might also try asking your question at r/alanon.  I don't mean to be unsupportive but the situation sounds untenable in my experience.   Best of luck with this and thank you for caring so much for an alcoholic to dare to undertake it.  I hope I'm wrong but it does not sound like a good idea for you, your family or your friend.   Wow, I am totally pumped for you.  Stay strong my friend.  And please keep updating us as you go along.   Good for you, /u/dansusedcars!  Keep doing what you're doing.               Excellent post, /u/Skycakes -- I strongly relate to your experience.     Sort of the Rolls Royce of commuter bikes, right there, my friend.         Clinton Cash author demolishes HRC according to Rupert Murdoch.   Libel is not an issue.  HRC is a public figure and a libel action would be virtually impossible to maintain under existing law--especially in a political context.            Good for you, so keep doing what you're doing and before you know it you will have a week--if you can stay focused on not drinking TODAY.  That's how it works for me.   Congratulations on 15 days!  That's great but that brings me to the [least popular advice in early sobriety: dry people, dry places.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  Obviously, this is your sister's wedding, so you must attend, but what compels you to sit through a drinking reception and all that nonsense beyond an initial appearance and pictures?    What I did in early sobriety was insure that I was at an AA meeting before and after the event.  That my transportation away from the event wasn't blocked-in, and I WALKED the moment I felt stress or temptation.  Good luck to you and keep us posted.   KJ, you have superb taste in music.   Welcome /u/SpanglesUK to r/stopdrinking.  At [this link is a post called the Baby Steps that you might find useful](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) of not as a good first place to find some simple "next actions."  The Baby Steps are the things I did to stop drinking and to get sober.   Good point!   My sponsor is a gentleman I met at one of my first meetings and who was familiar to me as an acquaintance from my professional life.  John G is about 10 years older than me, and I see or talk to him on average once a week.  He's like a big brother.  He's more conservative re: AA than I am, but he's also the primary source of the information that makes up [the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I too shared the /r/stopdrinking website with him and he really doesn't get it, but toi be fair he really doesn't understand his cell phone, either--although I told him that lots of info that I communicate originated with him.   I get SUPPORT and good information from John G about recovery and someone who will pick up the phone when I call.  I couldn't ask for more.  If I need friendship and running buddies I can find that too, although they don't need to be sponsors.          Welcome /u/throwawaycuzworried1 to /r/stopdrinking.  At the end of my drinking I was into major gyrations of anxiety and panic attacks.  Stopping drinking and staying stopped was my only hope and ultimately solution.  I was able to stop drinking by doing the [things I describe at the Baby Steps post which you can access at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you, you never have to go through this again if you don't pick up the next drink.                  I am so proud of you, my friend for all that you have accomplished.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; and I'm grateful to be wide awake, rested, SOBER in Cleveland but able to click onto access to my brother and sister sobernauts worldwide on r/stopdrinking.   That's the historical comparison that comes to my mind.  Instead of red-baiting a la Nixon, we have Union-baiting.      Excellent post, /u/yurikovski!  But, my friend, this is far from unusual. Coming to see and value the lifestyle changes in alcohol abstinence is really the point of the push to sobriety.  And the insight that alcohol use is merely a symptom of a larger problem, is classic recovery dictum.  So, here's my cautionary note: an object in motion tends to stay in motion, a drinker who is not making progress often as not falls back into the drinking abyss.  I did after 15 continuous years of sobriety.    Good luck, my friend.                  I'm not sure my comment was snide; but you're mistaken if you think I routinely downvote comments that disagree with me.  In fact I routinely upvote comments that I disagree with that are respectfully expressed.  In fact, I'm going to upvote YOU.    Funny how who donates money to a campaign is only a liability when the shooting starts.  I think this is so true.        Amen!   There's a list on the sidebar FAQ   Keep doing what you're doing.   Good for you, that's awesome.   I wonder how that money is going to be funneled to them now, there's a Super PAC for that!      Thanks, Meghan!   Current example from Politico:  House conservatives lash out at Boehner's 'culture of punishment' | After Rep. Mark Meadows was punished for crossing the speaker, conservatives consider blocking GOP legislation and trying to shake up leadership.    I apologize in advance for being dense, but is the Title + Subtitle format still appropriate?   He is an idiot.               Very interesting take.   I think she's marketing herself as the GOP Hillary troll and she's counting on this to get to the VEEP nomination.   See r/badlawyer   [Opinion.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf)                           Yeah, we can't solve this problem--second amendment is an individual right, not a well-regulated militia.   If Jebby's last name had been something other than Bush, he would never have been Governor of Florida. So, you can't un-ring that bell, "Hedge."      Good morning, /u/Nahbro211 --at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I got sober and which is not a bad place to look over a couple of ideas to start stopping drinking.  Good luck to you.   No problem, my bad.  I meant to scan the new posts and I got distracted.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  I'm going to keep SOBER in Sunny and Dry (for the moment) Cleveland, all day.                 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens--in that case I don't have to worry about 4 days in a row, I concern myself with staying SOBER today, only.   The [pathophysiological discussion at the Wikipedia link is also very instructive.  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Alcoholism)   Honestly, as someone who listens regularly to him; he was having a good moment.  Usually when he talks without a script he can sound like he's off his bipolar meds.   That's country music aristocracy, my friend.   Yeah, political blowback wouldn't have anything at all to do with the Pastor who uttered this nonsense.  BTW, the librul-rag that published this, Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal.         A lot of us thought this way, but as we got a day, a week, a month we extinguished this thinking.  AA meetings helped me a lot with getting new activities, friends and reinforcements to get through these tough days.        ; )   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what my alkie brain tells me I want.  Fuck that thinking, I'm not listening to that lying bastard.  No matter what I am going to bed sober tonight.   Great post /u/big_mac_heart_attack.  I will say that when I was at 20 days sober I was in no position to judge whether I had lost a social life or not.  I was in no position to make any judgments about what the future held.  I was on an emotional roller coaster and it was going to takes some time before I could fairly assess anything.  I do know this--when I got sober I had to stay in dry places and with dry people to improve my chances of staying abstinent since in my experience and in the experience of my support network bars, clubs, and concerts were too close for comfort to my old reinforcers to my abusive drinking.  I needed new reinforcers which is what I got when I jumped into recovery which for me meant AA meetings and activities.  Good luck to you.   First, I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad.  Then I'm going to remind myself that anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse scenarios.  Next I'm going to step back and think--just like you're doing, about how my prior nonsense made her feel.  When I've established enough mental space around this, I'm going to suggest that we talk about how I must have made her feel when I did these things to her in the past because of how badly I felt.  Then I'm going to let it go.                          Thanks for stepping up this week.     I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping it SOBER in beautiful Cleveland and all over SD world.   I go to AA meetings by myself usually, and on rare occasions with others.  Your friend sounds like she's reaching out to you to be helpful, but don't misconstrue what she's saying that seems to minimize your "qualifications."  She's merely trying NOT to judge you or proselytize--letting you judge for yourself if I understand your post.  Go, have fun.  Let us know if you think you related.   I did not "quit drinking" which implies forever, instead I make a renewable daily decision that I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad and for today only.  I plan to make the same decision tomorrow, but who knows--tomorrow's not here yet.   I am so sorry to hear this.  The sober journey is sadly strewn with tragic and sometimes inexplicable losses.  We deal with alcoholism cunning, baffling and powerful.     Thank you, very much!   Welcome /u/BigDaddy350 to r/stopdrinking--[at this link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/) maybe something there will make some sense for you for starting stopping.  Good luck.   Whatever it takes, I am not drinking TODAY.     Good job /u/Leafybeans.  I pretty much know that the early days crawl by--we all want 5 years in one day, but it doesn't work out that way.  I can honestly say that at some point you really stop noticing--in fact, but for the badgebot, I would not know.              I made a decision this morning that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what--consistent with [the Baby Steps;](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/)  I went ot an AA meeting; I communicated with friends in my support network; and, even though I've had a pretty tough and anxious week I am going to bed sober.  If I thought there was any risk that I was going to drink tonight, I'd be in an AA meeting talking about it, but that's how I approach the issue.  I'm not going to throw away my continuous time sober because experience teaches me that no matter how bad I feel about anything if I don't drink it will get better.  This was true for me when I was in prison, this is true for me NOW.   Welcome /u/CashinBlack to /r/stopdrinking.  At this [link is the locally famous "baby steps" post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/38ohrj/new_here_the_baby_steps_are_a_pretty_good_place/) which I offer to newcomers on a regular basis.  I hope something there will resonate for you.  The morning check-in is quickly becoming a base-touching place where members of the community are beginning to see one another regularly.  So I hope you'll use that tool.  Also, I love the Johnny Cash username.  I have some past connections to the Johnny Cash family.   I went through this years ago.  In my case it was DTs, albeit mild.  So if you can, please see a licensed medical provider or emergency department.   Thank you for this.   That's right.   Kitten is becoming a very cool cat.      I'd love to know who wrote and sent out the talking points.  Roger Ailes?                        Recently I've been reading a scholarly work, *A Natural History of Alcoholism, Revisted* by Dr. George Vaillant, a Harvard professor of psychiatry which makes the point about "alcoholism" that academic research supports the view that alcoholism (and by definition alcoholics) deal with a "unitary disorder" or disease.  It is a disorder of some complexity and that alcoholism is NOT a matter of binary diagnosis, e.g. you got it or you don't. Instead alcoholism is often a *matter of degree* a lot like heart disease, or a diabetes.  To call it a disease is to simply underscore that once an individual has lost the capacity consistently to control how much and how often he or she drinks there is a sufficient basis to conclude that they are alcoholic and that treating the conditions makes considerable practical sense.  I don't know if that all comes off as clearly as I can see it--maybe because I'm an old guy and I get this whole heart disease/diabetes metaphor.  I'm a diabetic.  Consistently food of all sorts push my "A1C" as found on daily blood tests into a range that my chronic disease endangers my health: eyesight, heart, and puts me at risk of neuropathies, and amputation loss of extremities.  I can remain healthy and live a full life if I make proper daily decisions about my diet and exercise.  When my diabetes blood-sugar is consistently in the normal range it's easy to think I'm not diabetic, but I am.  I'm not powerless over my disease and in fact I am RESPONSIBLE for self-treatment.  The same with my alcoholism.  I am a real alcoholic, I've proved that to my complete satisfaction.  I am not afraid of the word at all.  I find it empowering.  No physician ever diagnosed me as alcoholic, and despite my several decades of recovery in AA, no one in an AA meeting ever "labeled" me as alcoholic.  I can not consistently control how much or how often I drink, if I drink even one drink.  Recovery via AA has given me a whole new way of life, and it has helped me find a path through the chaos of my life.  Finally, I've been able to put to rest the debating society in my own head about who I am and what I am responsible for.      Or . . . even the stopped clock is right twice a day.   I'm sure you're right, LOL!   I had an ibanez and it was an outstanding solid body, starter guitar.          	191

Resulting medicines could be used to treat Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Huntingdons and other diseases, although researchers were keen to stress that more work would be needed to develop a drug that could be taken by patients.  2 An experimental gene therapy treatment cured haemophilia in dogs  Two out of three dogs given an experimental gene therapy treatment for haemophilia remained free of the disease more than two years following treatment. A condition that naturally affects both dogs and around one in every 10,000 men, haemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that researchers targeted using a virus to carry the normal gene. Researchers have applied for permission to carry out a clinical trial in the next two years.  3 Ovarian stimulation developed in mice leads to successful human pregnancy  An ovary stimulation technique originally pioneered in mice has allowed a previously infertile woman to give birth. The ovaries are removed and stimulated to produce eggs in vitro by reducing the activity of the Hippo pathway, which normally prevents overgrowth of the ovarian tissue.  4 Mice can lose their innate fear of cats through parasitic infection  Mice can permanently lose their fear of cats following exposure to the Toxoplasma gondii parasite. Infected mice show no physical symptoms, but did not show an aversion to cat urine, unlike their uninfected counterparts. Toxoplasma can be transferred to humans, and this study raises concerns about the long-term neurological damage that toxoplasma and other bacterial infections might have.  5 Simple molecule prevents mole rats from getting cancer  The naked mole rat appears to be completely immune to cancer, thanks to the excessive quantities of hyaluronic acid produced by their fibroblasts. Hyaluronic acid is a long chain sugar molecule that they suspect may form a tight cage around early-stage tumour cells, preventing pre-cancers from proliferating.  6 Nerve grafts let paralysed rats pee again  A nerve graft applied to a severed spinal cord has restored up to two thirds of bladder function in rats. After six months the rats were still unable to walk, but could urinate unaided. Both the bacterial enzyme and nerve grafts have been successfully used in humans before, meaning that nerve graft treatments for spinal cord injuries might not be a far off possibility.  7 Scientists grow tiny liver in a mouse  Scientists successfully grew tiny liver buds using human stem cells, and transplanted into mice delayed death in individuals with liver failure. They even began to take on a range of liver functions such as protein secretion. After transplantation the liver buds attached themselves to nearby blood vessels and continued to grow.  8 False memory planted in mouses brain  Scientists implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will shed light on the well-documented phenomenon whereby people "remember" events or experiences that have never happened.  9 Dual-action drug shows promise against diabetes  An experimental type II diabetes drug reduced blood sugar levels in humans, monkeys and rodents. The unnamed molecule seems likely to cause fewer side-effects in humans than current medications for the disease. In mouse studies researchers found that long-term treatment at a higher dose lead to significant weight loss; obese mice receiving the highest doses lost 19% of their body weight in just one week.  10 UK firm seeks to market world's first malaria vaccine  GlaxoSmithKline are seeking regulatory approval for the worlds first Malaria vaccine after a successful African trial involving over 15,000 children in seven countries. In children aged 5-17 months the vaccine caused a 46% reduction in the risk of clinical malaria compared to unvaccinated children.

Philosophical proof is fundamentally different. The problem is that very little obeys its strict rules for proof - a few examples are:  - Mathematics - all obeys philosophical rigour to be proof. So 2+2=4 is proven. - *Cogito Ergo Sum* - I think therefore I am, it is proof for the existence of a thinking thing (most people agree a thinking self) - Logic - If all swans are black then the next swan I see must be black. If you accept the premise you must accept the conclusion.  The problem with scientific proof is it is open to questions. Near all scientific proof relies on induction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning   http://www.darwinconspiracy.com/  DISCLAIMER: Everything in the above link is bull**** I'm just showing that some crazy people think evolution is a conspiracy.   I was half joking, but like most scientific theories, it has a huge body of evidence rather than proof. Of course the theory is true - but by burden of evidence rather than a philosophical proof.  That's the nature of empirical based evidence, rather than, say, mathematical proof.

It doesn't prevent them being a success, but it does close doors that would remain open if they did a degree (many jobs are for graduates only).   I suppose if they had a very clear alternative plan then I would accept it, and I might urge them to take a gap year beforehand, but I do think that I would push them to applying to university (they don't have to accept the place).   Imagine you have an 18 year old child. They said they didn't really want to apply to university.

I think effecting public change is the real case.         Considering drums tend to support a band, the time signature bottom end does matter.  Sting - Seven Days = 5/8 Dave Brubeck - Take Five = 5/4         I didn't offer any objection - its the original title.          So put the praise chart near the door and give people ticks as they start to do the starter - others should catch on quickly   Positive praise charts - they work for all ages but you have to persist for a few weeks.  Everyone's name down one side, a tick for everything good (might be sitting down and starting the starting activity quietly - might be good homework etc.) Give lots of ticks and praise loudly.  5 ticks = positive postcard home to parents 10 ticks = positive phonecall home to parents  Be warned - they will pretend not to care at first. This does not mean they don't care.  Other aspects to look at is how you start your class - are you standing by the door greeting them. Is there a starting activity they can get on with before everyone has arrived? If they are roudy as they come in, don't let them enter - they need to wait until they are calm and quiet before coming in.         Try a positive praise chart. Those who remain quiet, or make big improvements in their quietness are publicly praised and get a tick. When they get 5 ticks they get a postcard home. When they get 10 ticks they get a phonecall home. etc.   Having been a maths teacher I wouldn't have approved of that method. It's messy and teaches poor core maths understanding.

 Kava is definitely one; at comparable levels of intoxication, it's probably safer than alcohol.  Same for marijuana (no combustion) if you don't mind having shit memory.  Nicotine is probably fine as well (no combustion, no funky e-juice) if you can successfully avoid risk factors for heart disease.  Same for caffeine and most other stimulants (including amphetamines) - it's fine if you aren't at risk for heart disease and keep the dose reasonable.  Opiates are generally safe if you have a clean source, don't combine with stimulants or alcohol, can keep the dose reasonable, and you do something to counteract the chronic constipation.  All the classical psychedelics are ok too, though tolerance will prevent use more than once every 3 days, and chronic use in combination with stimulants could wreck your circulatory system over time.  Novel psychedelics (research chemicals like the nbomes) are a big question mark for safety.  Coca tea can be consumed daily with no ill effect, in large enough doses to have a stimulant effect comparable to coffee, if you aren't at risk for heart disease.  MDMA is out.  Can't be used safely more than once every week or two.  Etc.  Most drugs are fine if you can keep the dose reasonable, avoid nasty combinations, and aren't at risk for heart disease.  One of the main reasons people can't sustain drug habits is because of interference with daily life, or because dependence and tolerance lead to unsustainable high dose habits.   Do you have a reference for that?   It's a false dichotomy; the two categories are not mutually exclusive.   The prevailing wisdom is that one should hold it under one's tongue for a few minutes, then swallow it.  This way, it really doesn't matter which one is more potent.  One common cause of failed attempts with tryptamine psychedelics like LSD is interaction with psychiatric medications, such as an SSRI.  It's also true that people vary in their dose response to psychedelics; perhaps you require a higher dose, just because you're you.   I realised that life doesnt need to have a meaning and we are just naturally curious about our existence does anyone feel that way when they drop acid  I feel that way often, if I understand you correctly.  Meaning is a human activity, a part of this evolved system of subjective experience and interaction with whatever unknowable reality there is beyond it.  Meaningness seems to be a habit of human beings, not something inherent in some substance beyond our subjectivity.   Yeah...but it's small consolation, because everybody thinks you're out of your fucking mind health food crazy if you ask the questions you need to ask as a celiac to eat safely in a restaurant (e.g. can you have the prep cook change gloves).  It was easier when nobody knew what gluten was - then we could just explain ourselves as a novel food allergy.  Now that it's a pop culture thing, it's just embarrassing to be associated with.  (I had celiac before it was cool)   That's quite a collection.  Just use [ULTRAHANGOVER 6000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) - it has them all!   Stop smoking immediately.  No other change is necessary until shortly before the test.  Two days before the test, start drinking an extra half-gallon of water per day.  Do it the day of the test as well.  At the same time, begin taking a high dose B vitamin supplement and normal dose creatine supplement.  Take these supplements each day leading up, and also an hour or two before the test.  Drink a few extra glasses of water in the hours leading up to the test.  This method works quite well, and can be found in many mild variations all over the internet.  This is how it works:  By not using marijuana, your levels of THC metabolites will naturally fall.  A regular smoker should leave at least a couple weeks of abstinence before a drug test.  By drinking extra water before the test, you ensure that your urine is dilute.  By taking B-vitamins in high dose, you ensure that your urine is still yellow.  By taking creatine, you ensure that your urine levels of creatinine (a metabolite of creatine that is sometimes tested for to check for diluation) are normal.  Neither the supplements nor the water do anything to eliminate THC metabolites from your body; drinking extra water will do nothing but dilute your urine, and so is not necessary until the test is imminent.  The supplements are only there to end up in your urine to make it appear undilute.  Best of luck.  You should be able to pass using this method alone.  The few weeks of abstinence are important for it to succeed - you can only dilute so much.   The time required will probably vary by substance.  5 minutes is probably sufficient if the supplement is known to absorb sublingually in appreciable amounts.   Drink plenty of water prior to and during your alcohol infused evening.   Hmm.  Think about it, though - if plant growth is not influenced by sound, how can you explain the results of the two good studies cited in that article?  Why assume that there is no relationship when you have good evidence that there is?   Sure, sure - establishing mechanisms is a very important part of physiology.  I just don't believe it's appropriate to maintain extreme skepticism of the results of well designed experiments that don't establish a mechanism, but do establish causality.  At that point, it seems the burden of proof is on whoever wishes to dispute the finding.    I'll remain highly skeptical of this until I hear a plausible mechanism  Why?  A well designed experiment could ([and apparently has](http://news.psu.edu/story/141343/2008/08/25/research/probing-question-does-talking-plants-help-them-grow)) already established the effect.  A plausible mechanism is not necessary in any way.   Unless you have a reason to suspect deficiency (e.g. you're a vegetarian), you probably shouldn't supplement it alone.  Too much zinc can inhibit absorption of copper.  It is probably better to take a multivitamin or multimineral supplement that contains both in similar quantities, if you really want to supplement.  Supplements are heavily marketed by companies who have a solution they need to sell you.  It's difficult to sell solutions to people who don't have problems, so a lot of material out there is designed to make you think you have a problem that supplement X will solve.  In reality, most supplements in most situations are unnecessary at best.   No need for a necklace if you get the timing and depth right, but you should really be asking /r/opiates .  Plenty of info online about how to do it right.  Or you could just harvest and dry for making tea.  Include the stalks.   Poppy tea has identical effects to extracted opium if both are consumed as a liquid beverage at comparable doses.   Are you *certain* that you're not a white man?  This is all very disconcerting...   Haha!  All a matter of perspective, isn't it?  This is an odd moment for the field of mental health; psychedelic drug use of any kind is defined as abuse, yet psychedelic drugs are being actively researched as interventions for mental illness.   So many comments assume that OP is a man... :/   Taking a COX2 inhibitor (e.g. NSAIDs like ibuprofen, natural anti-inflammatories like ginger and turmeric) can reduce or entirely block the negative effects of THC on memory.

No animosity is intended.  But you really do need to keep your mouth shut, anything you say to anybody who isn't your lawyer is likely hurt you in court.  You shouldn't even deny anything, just stop offering free information to the prosecution.  You should try to get your folks to stop talking to anybody about this to.   It's fairly common for practicing therapists with a terminal master's degree to have personal experience with what, in that field, are known as "drugs of abuse."   I think it is a better term than African American / Hispanic, because in truth the police are aggressive toward African Americans, Hispanics, Indians, Native Americans, Middle Easterners, and so on in very similar fashion.  It seems like they really do target people by the color of their skin, and not by specific ethnicity.   The only time I've felt LSD come on anywhere near that fast was one obscenely large dose that started coming on around 15 minutes in.  I think it's safe to say that if you're sober enough to post on reddit 6 hours later, you have no concerns.   Beautiful..  Would you explain your technique for us?  It sounds like there are a couple of layers, one of which is a looped clip or delay pedal - but perhaps this is an illusion, and there is only one layer, and this goes through a delay.  How did you make this?   I would debunk this for you, but I'm afraid you're just too young to understand.    I really enjoyed the vibe and sound of the first track.  I like that you're doing this with piano and a bare, relatively untouched sound.  I'd be curious to hear how this set sounded if instead developing thoughts by adding melody, you developed the harmony, voicings, and texture.  To me, there was far to much melodic and rhythmic content for it to sound very drone.   That isn't true at all.  You can't use 1040EZ unless your income is extremely straightforward.  You can't use it with dependents.  You can't use it with self-employment income - even if it is quite small (e.g. a one-off contracting gig).   There's no way 9/10 taxpayers are using that form.   Not in my experience.  Just about every daily user I've known had obvious, substantial cognitive impairment until they quit (if they quit).  edit:  Speaking only of typical recreational use, not high CBD/low THC strains or carefully managed edibles.   The distinction between physical and psychological addiction is misleading and fairly unimportant.  Marijuana can produce profound addiction, complete with a physically manifested withdrawal and severe cravings that last for weeks, which is mediated by an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain due to adaptation that occurred in response to regular use.   Indicas and sativas have similar levels of CBD, though.  CBD is not what gives indicas their uniquely stoning quality.  High cbd strains come in a wide range of THC:CBD ratios.  Some are actually quite intoxicating, but don't wipe your memory so severely.  Others are extremely mild and seem to have little or no effect on memory.   This seems to be true in my experience as well, and it makes sense; CBD is a CB1 antagonist, and the hippocampal neurotoxicity of THC is mediated by CB1 agonist.  This is actually a central finding of one of the studies quoted above.   Hey, they jive reasonably well with what I've seen of cannabis in my life.  Most people I've known to be regular herb smokers are pretty fucking dumb, myself included, until they've been off it or mostly off it for a few months.  But it wasn't until I'd actually stopped for a few months that I could see the difference and believe it.   I've posted info from some of the same studies there and in /r/drugs before, and found that people were not interested in hearing it and didn't believe it.    These data indicate that THC toxicity is mediated through CB1 receptors and not caused by nonspecific interactions with the membrane lipid phase... On the basis of the data presented in this study, we conclude that binding of THC to cannabinoid CB1 receptors in hippocampal neurons leads to neuronal death.  To be fair, this excerpt refers to an experiment in which cells in a dish were bathed in a solution containing ~10x the THC concentration in human blood after typical cannabis use, according to the paper itself.  And the effect is blocked entirely by a CB1 antagonist - a finding that should extend to other CB1 antagonists such as CBD.   I'm not talking about conservatives - most liberal people think hard drugs should be illegal in some form.  Not to mention other forms of crime that could be aided by bitcoin!  It's as though you believe that the views of the vast majority of people don't matter - that bitcoin will do just fine if only a tiny minority of libertarian tech enthusiasts use it.  I don't buy it.   I've set myself up to sound like I'm just making a no true Scotsman...but I stand by what I've said.  It isn't clear from the brief quotations in the article precisely what is meant by that statement, but it's safe to say that whatever math was done is probably correct, and if the method were actually described the meaning of the result would be apparent to any educated observer.  Because the article doesn't share any of that information, it's fairly obvious that they're trying to manipulate you.  Not by giving you fake statistics, but by showing you an isolated result with no context or even clear explication of the result itself.  That is a very specific, limited form of manipulation which is very, very commonly used when popular media cite statistics.   That isn't true.  You're promoting a dangerous and false perception that statistics are completely open to manipulation.  In fact, statistics are open to specific, limited forms of manipulation which do not include the method you've proposed.   You have given an uncharitable characterization of what I have said, and then argued against that characterization.  Most people are anti-drug (in that they reject hard drugs and endorse their illegality), and most people are ambivalent about bitcoin (in that they are unfamiliar with it).  It would be a good thing if this sub had some decent answers for those people.  If I were anti-drug and knew nothing about bitcoin, and voiced my concerns about bitcoin and drug crime on here, I would expect to be turned away and not have my concerns taken seriously.  That would leave me with a bad impression of bitcoin.   You should consider how other people see this, though.  Some people think that bitcoin is more advantageous than cash or credit/banking systems for those involved in criminal activity.  In their view - which may well be correct - fiat currency and bitcoin are **not equivalent** in their potential to serve criminal ends.  Beyond that, not everybody thinks that these crimes should be solved by changing the law to make them not crimes.  Actually, most people think that things like human trafficking and hard drug sales should be illegal.  So perhaps you don't care and think this is all stupid - but that's hardly going to help spread the good news of bitcoin, is it?   This is a self-defeating attitude, though.  If /r/bitcoin ignores facts about bitcoin that reflect negatively on it from a mainstream perspective, and ostracizes those who express those facts, it merely serves as an echo chamber for a small slice of potential bitcoin enthusiasts.  This limits the potential of /r/bitcoin to serve newcomers, and makes the community appear distasteful.    I think the comment was highly relevant.  But I suppose we wouldn't be able to agree about that.  Usually when something is unoffensive but irrelevant, it just sinks with  few up or downvotes.  It seems very unlikely to me that the comment would get 10+ downvotes simply due to a perception of irrelevance.   two video's nothing to do with the article,  [How to use apostrophes](http://www.scribendi.com/advice/using_apostrophes.en.html)   Well...it seems that you've taken my plain, factual assessment that bitcoin makes illegal trade over the internet easier, and erroneously concluded from it that I think this means bitcoin should be destroyed.  This is exactly what I'm talking about!  This sub should not downvote people for saying things that are true about bitcoin, just because people are uncomfortable with these truths.  Similarly, we should not conflate statements of fact and their truth or falsity with statements of judgment about right or wrong, ought or ought not.  Bitcoin makes some illegal activities easier.  That is a simple statement of fact.  It isn't a judgment about what is good or bad, nor about what ought to be done.  It's like saying the Earth orbits the sun.  Whether that is good or bad depends on your point of view.   /r/bitcoin seems to have a problem with the truth.  Bitcoin provides a cash-like medium that can be easily, conveniently traded anonymously and without physical contact.  **Of course it makes it easier to sell drugs over the internet**    It would be far more efficient to produce in a laboratory.  One person with a couple hundred square feet of space and access to ideal precursors could produce psilocybin at a greater rate than a warehouse sized grow op.  Also, you can create precisely measured doses, which is impractical / impossible with dried fungal matter as you cannot reasonably establish precise potency.   It's not just "more science is needed."  It's "more science of this type into this issue to answer these questions" is needed.  There's nothing to "debunk," because there's no lie.  But there are nontrivial, falsifiable claims.   This seems like the most important claim that actually has a coherent meaning:  Himalayan salt consists of mineral packed crystals that are formed naturally within the earth, and they are made up of 85.62% sodium chloride and 14.38% trace minerals such as sulphate, magnesium, calcium, potassium, bicarbonate, bromide, borate, strontium, and fluoride (in descending order of quantity).  This may be true, it may not.  Many pink salts have more sodium and less trace minerals.  But supposing it is true - does it matter?  Of course not!  By the time you eat enough of this salt that it serves as a good trace mineral source, you'll have eaten enough sodium to seriously endanger your health (assuming you do this regularly).  You can handle a couple grams of sodium a day.  If you ate a couple grams of this salt, you might get 2000mg X .15 = 300mg of various other minerals.  That's about as much dietary non-sodium mineral as you can get by eating a cup or two of cooked broccoli - along with very, very little sodium.  If your reason for eating this salt is because of it's mineral content, you'd be better served by buying plain cheap salt and a vegetable.   There's no result, really.  They needed a placebo group that didn't receive treatment.  Perhaps the homeopathic remedy did nothing, and the conventional treatment slightly prolonged the timecourse of recovery.  Perhaps the entire conventional group would have recovered on the fourth day!  Who knows.  Their only strong finding was that the homeopathic group didn't require antibiotics - a suspicious finding, for the reasons above and because they don't seem to have used a double-blind design (so whoever evaluates whether a person has improved may also know the treatment condition the patient was assigned to).   It's all relative.  It depends on what you're looking for, and how large your effect is expected to be.   It's unlikely that there is anything substantial to debunk in this paper - it's peer reviewed scientific literature.  If it were so ill-conceived that random people on Reddit could destroy it in a few paragraphs, it would not have been published.  However, the paper's claims are fairly modest, and are primarily a call for further research.  Anybody using this paper to claim that fluoride in drinking water in the United States is dangerous, for example, could be easily debunked by showing that this paper did not examine such low levels of fluoride, and provides no evidence for or against their safety.   The paper isn't arguing that fluoride in drinking water is deadly - it's arguing that there is strong enough evidence for developmental neurotoxicity that further research is warranted.  From their own conclusion:  In conclusion, our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on childrens neurodevelopment.   Future research should formally evaluate doseresponse relations based on individual-level measures of exposure over time, including more precise prenatal exposure assessment and more extensive standardized measures of neurobehavioral performance, in addition to improving assessment and control of potential confounders.  Nothing you said is particularly relevant to this claim, the central claim of the paper.   Rural Chinese water supplies are not known for their purity besides from fluoride levels, either. Arsenic and heavy metals are known to be present in high levels in both water and soil. Fluoride pollution in massive doses is almost certainly going to be connected to a number of other pollutants.  How do you respond to this (from the paper's discussion section), which directly addresses your objection?  Several studies (Hong et al. 2001; Lin et al. 1991; Wang SH et al. 2001; Wang SX et al. 2007; Xiang et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 1996) report other exposures, such as iodine and arsenic, a neurotoxicant, but our sensitivity analyses showed similar associations between high fluoride exposure and the outcomes even after these studies were excluded. Large tracts of China have superficial fluoride-rich minerals with little, if any, likelihood of contamination by other neurotoxicants that would be associated with fluoride concentrations in drinking water. From the geographic distribution of the studies, it seems unlikely that fluoride-attributed neurotoxicity could be attributable to other water contaminants.  That was a fairly unconvincing debunk, considering that you didn't bother to read the paper... :/   Well, the ideal record would be a timesheet that was endorsed by your employer in some way (e.g. signed by your boss).  But since few businesses use paper timesheets anymore, its unlikely that you have that.  So a personal record that you kept may be the best you've got.  If it was recent enough, you could contact someone you worked with and ask them to verify your hours during that time on paper, and send that.  But if you don't have a record already, it seems like too much work at this stage to go through the effort of constructing one; it's also reasonably likely that they intend to pay you and it just hasn't got to you yet.  You can make a request for payment without the exact record; it just doesn't set you up as well for a lawsuit if you need that in the end.  But you can always add records later if you come by them.   No...you've stumbled on a stroke of genius, my friend.  If modern graphical user interfaces are too much for your parents, teach them command line systems instead!  "Honey, I'm just calling because I sent my email and now I want to read it again but I already sent it away and -"  "Mom, press the windows key and type "cmd" and hit enter, then "help" and enter.  All the answers I possess are now at your fingertips!"   You'll probably crave it in some way forever.   Haha - dangerous advice for a guy who is freaking out about withdrawals from a single dose.  Tons of people take IV opiates without developing any cravings whatsoever - they are common in hospital settings.  It's not a big deal, and in all likelihood it will pass as soon as OP stops thinking about it and sobers up.  But OP - **do not dose again.** This drug is obviously not for you.   It's all fantasy; you live in your head too much.  Go talk to people, meet new people, make love to them and be rejected by them and learn.  This isn't a fucking romantic comedy film.  It's life.  The people you see, they are people like you - not like people in movies (nobody like that actually exists).  The feeling you have started in your testicles and has been fed and grown by your ideas about it into this behemoth of OMG HOW DO I MAK EMY MOOOVV.  It doesn't really matter in the long run.  If you want to find out what she is like, talk to her.  Say "Hi, I'm mlgfap and I like your skirt/top/smile/whatever.  What's your name?"  And have a conversation.  Then she'll be receptive or she won't be and you'll like her or dislike her or whatever and you can move on with life.   Yes - what material and how is it built?  If it is a bulky wooden stool, it may be trivial to add a few inches of height.   Well...wow.  Perhaps your parents really never allowed themselves to experience the natural emotions of being a parent. :/  I dunno.  My parents were really messed up people, and I can relate to some of what you shared in a first-person way.  I had a very traumatic childhood.  But my parents really did love and care for me.  I just didn't get to see much of that growing up.  Maybe your parents also love/loved you, in a private kind of way.  There could be some potential, some possibility there for a better relationship.  But you shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed if you don't want to deal with them; you're not doing anything wrong by protecting yourself.  It sounds like you'd be justified in leaving them behind.   **Yes**....teach them Unix.   If it is just a coincidence, and she's not interested, she will let you know very early on - as she will assume that you took it as a signal of interest.  So assume that she's into it and have a good time.  There's nothing special that you have to do, no approach you have make etc.  Just enjoy yourself and whatever happens will happen naturally.    Affirmative consent is the only way to ensure that it isn't weird.  That is simply not true.  I have never, ever, past  my awkward teenage years, said a single word about consent (do you want this, can I do that, whatever) during a first sexual encounter; there has never been any question about it.  And I've been with rape survivors etc, often having sex very early in the relationship, no problem at all.  Sex is not an intellectual act, and consent with formal asks is often very awkward.  It's easy to feel what's good or bad, whether a person wants more or less so long as everybody is reasonably awake and sober.   It's easy to take your parents for granted when you're young and they're alive and well.  It's likely that you'll feel very different about spending time with them when one of them has died.  It's unlikely that anybody will care about you the way your parents do - that relationship seems to be just about unique.  Your parents can love you in a way that doesn't depend on anything you do for them.  Nobody else is going to love you that way.  That said, it sounds like your Dad is a piece of work.  Guilting and shaming a 12 year old like that...ugh.  Still...they're your parents.  You shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty if you don't want to take care of them, but (as odd as this may sound) I think you may be missing out on something very precious.   If you have any record of the work you did, make copies and send those along with a letter explaining how much money they owe you and the address where they can send a check.  Send it to their HR person.  Don't send originals.  In most states, you have to do something like this within a certain period of time (often a month or two) after the job ended in order to ensure that you have a right to sue later if they don't pay.   To expect it, no.  But there is enough evidence supporting it as a reasonably likely outcome of the next 30 years of research that it shouldn't be dismissed as impossible or extremely unlikely without strong evidence.  You can find a lot of optimistic, yet pragmatic and evidence based commentary by searching for a scientist   science communicator named [Aubrey De Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey).   Unless I'm terribly mistaken, the controlled substances act authorizes the attorney general, not the president, to do this, and it is not by executive order.  That said, the president could tell the attorney general to do it.  However, this process is not necessarily straightforward.  There are limitations on what the attorney general can do and when.  For example, they cannot reschedule a drug in a way that would violate an existent treaty obligation of the United States.   Yes - major error in the title of this post.  Not about Mars at all.   Executive orders aren't able to change things like that, though.  They can't contradict existing law, for example.   The penny's add a little more pressure to keep it snug.  Pennies.  Penny's would be a way of saying something belongs to the penny.  You can't make plurals with apostrophes with normal nouns.     Sugar alcohols are a common cause, and are often found in bars.  Also certain spices - especially garlic / onion type.   Hmmm...that hasn't been my experience at all; do you have a reference?  I imagine these things could vary substantially between individuals, but I would think that most people could absorb a few hundred milligrams of protein any time...   Amino acid chelated minerals are absorbed via the mechanism that absorbs that amino acid normally (usually quite efficient), whereas minerals in an ionic compound that dissociates in water are absorbed via a mineral-specific mechanism that can be easily overwhelmed by high doses.  This causes diarrhea when the mineral passes unabsorbed into the large intestine, where it draws water out of the intestine's lining via [osmosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis).  The reason magnesium oxide so reliably produces diarrhea is because it does not readily dissociate in water, and so most of it passes to the large intestine and draws water out from the body through osmosis.  Magnesium citrate does dissociate readily in mildly acidic water, so it is better absorbed, but will still cause diarrhea in large doses because the absorption mechanism cannot handle so much at once.   I don't know - I did a quick search but it didn't turn up anywhere near as much as the probiotic supplements.  Perhaps it just hasn't been studied as much.  Medical researchers tends to explore things that can be turned into pharmaceutical products much more readily than it does traditional medicine or food based medicine; it's one problem with the scientific community's dependence on corporate funding.   Well...the review references many studies, performed in a variety of human populations with varying states of intestinal health and bacterial colonization.  But it is true that the review primarily established the effectiveness of probiotic and synbiotic supplements as disease interventions.  However, that does not mean we can conclude that probiotics don't do anything in other individuals.  Most of the disease states explored in the studies referenced by the review are small intestine disorders - these people have normal stomachs.  That probiotics and / or synbiotics are able to survive these people's stomach environment strongly suggests that the would survive healthy people's stomachs as well.  Because probiotic supplements are quite affordable, easy to use, and safe, and there is some evidence that they help in various disease states, it seems reasonable to give them a try when faced with chronic digestive complaints that may be related to gut flora (i.e. almost all chronic digestive complaints).   If your team is oriented around the five-man deathball, though, go for the agh-refresher to **compliment** them.  [Complement, not compliment.](http://www.elearnenglishlanguage.com/blog/english-mistakes/complement-vs-compliment/)   Yes.  Most of the amino acid forms, including glycinate, are better absorbed than citrate.   No - in truth, probiotic supplements are often indicated for a variety of gastro-intestinal disorders.  Of course, a good diet is important, but BrainEnhance is simply incorrect in their assertion that probiotics are ineffective.  See the above review for more info.   That is not true - you are ignorant of the scientific literature on this topic.  Probiotic supplements have been shown in well designed human trials to survive and colonize the digestive tract, and to compete effectively with existing bacterial populations.  Don't take my word for it.  Read this recent review (free full text):   [The Role of Probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria and Bifidobacteria in the Prevention and Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Other Related Diseases: A Systematic Review of Randomized Human Clinical Trials](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/505878/)   [pubmed listing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25793197)   Psyllium husk etc are mostly not fermentable fiber anyway - they pretty much just past through unchanged.  It shouldn't be expected to help, but probably wouldn't make it worse.   (off topic now)  Do you cook your own beans, or use beans from a can?  I've found a huge difference by soaking them overnight, tossing the soak water, and cooking them in fresh water afterward.   I think this is a great response.  But I would also like to add that you may find it much easier to explore these things if you found a more comfortable and supportive environment in which to use psychedelics.  In my experience, psychedelic experiences of fear are often heavily influenced by my state of mind and the setting I'm in, even if they are also a part of an existential crisis of some sort.  I've found it much easier to relax with these deep fears when I'm in a good setting and mindset.    You have provided no evidence that would convince anyone that supplements are a good idea. That alone is enough of a reason to not believe in them.  Why?  I'm just some random voice typing on Reddit.  Because I haven't provided evidence that supplements are effective at preventing MDMA neurotoxicity, you can conclude that they are not effective?  Doesn't that logic seem a bit...flawed?   If having a PharmD is evidence enough for you to believe yourself, then you really did miss the point way back in your undergrad when you learned the basics of science.   Yes...you do not understand the logic behind the science you're trying to debate.  Bye.   I think part of it is that many people just eat the mushrooms, which is not pleasant.  Because of this, people tend to dose low.  If we all learned to make shroom tea like proper psychonautic adventurers I think we'd see more interest in the drug, and more understanding.   You really don't understand.  Go back to philosophy class - you're not done learning!   Sort of - but in California, most of that demand is from out of state (or even out of the nation).  The state's water supply is being drained to serve an economic pressure that has very little to do with the state's residents.   It's not grammar, but intent.  And I won't - you're trying to get me to argue in favor of your straw man.  Why would I do that?  I have no interest in trying to establish a false claim.   Ah - that's different.  I live in a state with medical, and assumed this was a dispensary product.  Interesting...be careful with this stuff.  If eating it produces pronounced psychoactive effects, you should assume it is unsafe and may be synthetic cannabinoids.   , if any,   Of course not.  But many of the supplements people suggest taking to reduce the risk of MDMA neurotoxicity are approved for human consumption already, without human testing, because they are nutritional supplements.  So I do not think it is a reasonable comparison.  If somebody advocated for taking a research chemical with CNS effects in conjunction with MDMA as a harm reduction measure, and claimed safety on the basis of a mouse study, that would be extremely foolish (for the exact reasons you mention).   [watch this - it will sober you up fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaHOvWMPeJA)   Yeah, some people are in quite deep with the propaganda machine.  In my experience it's really not worth getting upset about or trying to change much, but when I do come in contact with it, I try to find some way to offer a different perspective without forcing the issue.  Something that they might consider later, like "huh...I wonder why he saw it that way."  Because there rarely seems to be any possibility of really breaking through that kind of ideology in one go.  It's really up to them.   Most people who get into kava and enjoy it use the root itself, usually purchased in powdered form.  Kava supplements are generally regarded as crap that should not be expected to produce a good effect.  This won't help you for your presentation, but I strongly encourage you to try the real stuff if you're prone to anxiety.  It's great!  /r/kava   Yeah, sounds like some bullshit an extrovert would say while pointing to a chart in front of a room of people like a dick.   Whoah, whoah.  I know all of that.  I'm not here to debate the details of running a mining operation; I posted only to clarify an apparently mistaken analogy drawn between miners and bank-like entities.  edit:  Wow, just read your post again.  So rude!  Back away from the computer...go and play outside!   Could be, but it could also just be that there's CBD and THC together in this oil, and they're not heating it enough for the CBD to come through.   Perhaps there is substantial residual THC, which is vaporizing in full before any CBD comes through.  THC by itself yields an intense, overwhelming high at a proper dose - which could be a single toke if you're vaporizing refined oil.  You could test this hypothesis in part by eating a dose.  If it yields a potent high like it does when vaporized, you can assume that the oil is not CBD dominant - in this case, it may be synthetic cannabinoids mislabeled as another person suggested.  If it yields little psychoactive effect taken orally, then you may have an oil that is primarily CBD with a significant amount of THC as well.  This seems to be a very common product among CBD oils offered today.    I have the desire to be an educator   whenever I get into a comment section like that I just go berserk with fact checking and proving people wrong... yet they all are so narrow  If you want to educate people with views like that, you're going to have to get more comfortable with exposure to those views.  People do not want to learn from somebody who is upset, hostile, or in any way overly invested in changing their view.  Teaching is a challenging, demanding activity.  It can be great fun!  But it does seem to require a great deal of acceptance of what your students are actually like.  It's very difficult to work with ignorance if you find it unnerving.   You got too high and likely had a panic attack.  This seems like the most probable explanation for the incident you described, OP.  And now, you have strong, visceral negative associations with your memory of the experience (sounds similar to PTSD).  It seems most likely that there isn't a direct causal relationship between the event and your symptoms over the following year, in the sense that it probably didn't "damage your brain" or something like that.  More likely, you got really high and also are prone to anxiety / panic symptoms, and this experience either triggered or coincided with the start of a chronic anxiety / panic problem.   The miners are not responsible for anybody's bitcoin, though.  It's not the same.  If they mine, they get new coins.  If they don't, they don't.  If they mine incorrectly, they don't.  But they have no liability as a result of anybody else's coins.  A better analogy would be a bitcoin exchange; if you keep bitcoin in an exchange, that entity likely has a liability as a result of your asset.  The difference, then, is that one can easily use and hold bitcoin without using a liable intermediary (like an exchange).   I think of it more like a psychedelic than like a depressant or simple buzz.  But I don't think of it as much like either; for me, it has a category of experience all to itself.  Cannabis is an amazing plant.    There is little, if any, evidence that they actually do anything.   Those are all fair points, and of course animal model studies don't offer direct recommendations for human  use.  But your language is too strong; it makes no sense to equate evidence from animal models with no evidence at all.   You're overstating yourself.   Why discount animal model evidence entirely?  The scientists that produce this evidence don't. :/  	104
 Okay, so I was wondering if you have a hammer of god (which has 4 batteries) would super sub-ohming be safer? I'm not big into low builds, but in my mind the load would be evenly distributed among all 4 batteries. Is that accurate? Why or why not? Are there any articles I could read on the subject?   Can we get a glow shot?!   Nah that should be fine. Right guys? Guys?   I've had that. I cheated against my girlfriend because I wanted to beat her just once. She had been cheating too so it became a game of luck. She still won.   Also came here to ask.   Off topic, but is 3/4th proper?   The best part is he takes the rock too. You can tell he's on a budget!   Did you bring your TURBO rda??!   Fair enough   I think we both know that no one thinks a dog has lived 7 years when we have lived 1. Their bodies are aged roughly 7 times faster than a humans though.   Couldn't you just close the door?   Did... Did you just say dogs don't age faster than we do? No one is saying that time passes faster for dogs, but they certainly do age much much faster. I'd like to see one external source that says otherwise.   He shouldn't have been standing in front of it in the first place though.   What if you'd have to drink the dick because you've been hitting it for so long   Kinda the same thing as a gentlemen's club I guess. Men come in to look at women.   Batman is in there twice too lol      Or is it incest?    I see that hammer pipe mod over on the left! I hated that thing... It looks nice but it's pretty finicky. If you're into spending any more money I'd look into the hammer of the gods box mod. It's my personal favorite.   If you like the freak show look for the mad hatter. Same manufacturer and they're both fantastic.   I said a year not two, that's just ridiculous.   Doesn't that take a year to heat up?   I bet that's got a good throat hit   The first one doesn't say "for the better".   There's two halves to every lemon professor scam!   From what I can remember in that country people could pay to get that blue light to bypass busy traffic.   Work at vegetarian store, can confirm.  	27
 What about donating them to a local college or high school?   Seconded. This is a great site, it helped me get a feel for which candidates supported what last election cycle.    If I'm posting in New York City, I select New York University as my school from a list of schools near me, and then my post falls under that category (NYU).    It's just an anonymous posting board. Generally the stuff posted there is pretty similar like "To that hot girl in calculus, I love you". It's not a networking site like FB.    http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2yrk5n/what_is_being_triggered_why_are_people_shitlords/      Some poll data on what British folk think of leaving the EU:  http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/21/eu-referendum-majority-leave-opinium-observer-poll   Also the Vietnam War protests. There were a few violent protests during those (like the famous incident at the DNC), but these protests definitely had an affect on Nixon and Johnson, as well as other Americans.   How do you mean? The harassment of any student, regardless of class, is punishable by law. The issue here is that what constitutes as harassment has a strict definition and not all universities adhere to said definition. Here's an example of vague harassment language:  http://www.thefire.org/speech-code-of-the-month-salem-state-university/   Are you planning on creating a group? This would be be a mighty fine way of getting members for such.   Good job though!   In order for such a movement to work, there has to be some sort of shared cause that cries for action. American and Canadian college students have squatted their school's before in retaliation against rising tuition costs. Here's one such instance of that: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_California_college_tuition_hike_protests  So, before you get to the steps of organizing, ask, what needs to be done for your fellow students? Maybe your school costs too much, maybe there's some policy that is problematic, maybe your school has faculty who are unfair to students in one way or the other.   If you can determine that indeed there is a problem that many students agree needs addressing, then is the time to start planning. But make sure the problem has legitimacy. Rioting over a lack of soft drinks in the vending machines looks petty, for example.      Good explanation, thank you!   Interesting perspective, thanks for the info.   And the depiction of Irish characters in TV shows implies the people involved couldn't even be bothered reading a wikipedia article on the country.  I'm not really familiar with Irish characters on TV, so what would you say these shows get wrong?     Yup, this is my view of it. I'm willing to accept that communism has never been achieved, at least recently.    Yup, Paul got it right during the debates. Iran has seen both it's Eastern and Western neighbors invaded by the US, European powers, and the USSR. It's totally understandable for them to want to be more protected from foreign invasion.      I should mention I'm not an official rep of FIRE or anything, I've merely worked with them on a few projects.   The issue I have is with _your organization's_ decision to define 1.) political issues as free speech issues and 2.) free speech at private institutions as matters of contract  This is how it legally is defined, on both accounts. For the second point, you really are signing away your ability to speak on some issues and face consequence, in the same vain that when I take a job, I can call my boss an idiot, but most likely I'll be fired for doing so. There is nothing in federal law that states a private college must adhere to the same guidelines as public institutions. States likes (like California) may have these things, of course. But if the state doesn't, there's little to be done: you signed a contract with a group that is not held to to the same legal standards as other places.   Now, if you want to change the law as your advocating, the only way to do it would be to get SCOTUS to make some sort of ruling, or to change the Constitution.   I would agree with your LGBT example, though. That's certainly a restriction, and one that needs change, but from internal sources, and not external.    I actually like her stance. Gay explosives are very dangerous.    this seems weird to me: your stance is that if the school does not claim to honor freedom of speech you won't pursue a freedom of speech issue there and the school is off the hook?  Suing a private school, like UM in the instance stated above, would result in failure due to their protections under the law. If such lawsuits were successful, schools like BYU (which adheres to the strict honor codes of the Mormon faith) couldn't operate as they do (where you can be penalized for drinking, smoking, and having sex *off* campus property). Now, that's not to say nothing can be done. Like in the UM example, public pressure can still do wonders for getting a school to change their mind and reverse problematic policies. However, legally, there isn't much leeway.   Public universities, of course, are completely bound by First Amendment rulings, as these institutions function off of public funds (and voluntary private donations). Legally, they are bound to give students the right to free speech  Edit:   By this logic wouldn't the best course of action for all universities just be to have the students sign a free speech waiver?  You actually do this for private universities. Like with BYU, you sign that honor code before attendance. Which is why FIRE doesn't have much of a problem here: you're signing and choosing to go somewhere that doesn't have to honor your rights. The issue here is when a private university claims to adhere to freedom of speech, but actually doesn't, which can go against contracts with students.   FIRE writes of such schools:  "When a private university expresses its own values by stating both clearly and consistently that it holds a certain set of values above a commitment to freedom of speech, FIRE does not rate [ that university [with their speech code ratings guide]."  In most states private universities can still more or less do as they wish, due to that clause about no necessary amount of public funding holding the college accountable to the First Amendment. From a previous FIRE case:   SCENARIO: You wish to start up a student group that discusses conservative philosophy, and you apply for funding from student fees, just like dozens of other groups at your public university. The student government, which recognizes student groups, refuses to recognize your group because, it argues, there is already one other recognized conservative group on campus, namely, the College Republicans. On the other hand, the student government has formally recognized dozens of other closely related student groups. Can it deny funding to your group?    This scenario happened at the University of Miami (UM). A group of women attempted to form a conservative organization, Advocates for Conservative Thought (ACT). Its purpose was "the exposition and promotion of conservative principles and ideas." ACT was repeatedly denied funding by UM, because, the student government claimed, its intended purpose would "overlap" with the College Republicans and with one group that promoted nonpartisan political debate. FIRE wrote a letter to UM"s president, pointing out that the school could not deny funding to one group because of its viewpoint while allowing dozens of other groups on the other side of the spectrum their individual recognition.    Such discrimination against a group based purely on the proposed purpose and ideology of the group is in direct violation of the Supreme Court"s prohibitions against content-based and viewpoint discrimination. It also violates the same free association rights that applied in the scenario relating to freedom of religious association (see Scenario 11, above).    The Supreme Court has also established that each such freely organized group has the right to equal student funding at public universities, and may not be discriminated against on the basis of the content of the group"s ideology. In University of Wisconsin v. Southworth (2000), the Court held that a public university must distribute funds equally to each recognized group on campus without any consideration of the organization"s viewpoint. Under Southworth, if the university does not comply with this limitation, it may not charge mandatory student fees to support extracurricular activities.    No matter what your group"s ideology, the purpose and content of your organization may not be grounds for denying your group official recognition as a student group. Furthermore, there is a strong constitutional right of voluntary association that allows individuals to form groups with a purpose and content of their choosing. Your group may be denied recognition on other legitimate grounds (such as insufficient membership), but the purpose and belief system of your group should never be the factor that prevents your group from gaining recognition and equal access to the school"s resources.    UM is a private university, and not bound by Southworth, but FIRE raised the issue of whether it was willing to deny its students the fundamental rights and legal equalities granted by any public college. In response to FIRE"s letter and press release, the university president convened an urgent meeting. Immediately after the meeting, ACT was informed that it would receive official recognition regardless of its content or purpose. UM President Donna Shalala wrote to FIRE to thank it for bringing this vital matter to her attention. The moral? Constitutional principles are so often not merely legal principles, but moral principles, as well. Colleges and universities ignore them to their shame and peril.   As for why California made that specific exemption in regards to religious school's, I can't comment.   FIRE's student guide actually addresses the very thing you're talking about in regards to funding:    Individual State Laws Affecting Private Institutions    In America, legal rights can vary dramatically from state to state. The United States Constitution, however, limits the extent to which any state may regulate private universities, because the Bill of Rights (which applies both to the states and to the federal government) protects private institutions from excessive government interference. In particular, the First Amendment protects the academic freedom of colleges and universities at least as much as (and frequently more than) it protects that of the individuals at those institutions.    Fortunately, decent societies have historically found ways to protect individuals from indecent behavior. Many states follow doctrines from the common law, which evolved as the foundation of most of our states" legal systems. For example, some states have formulated common-law rules for associationswhich include private universitiesthat prohibit "arbitrary and capricious" decision making and that require organizations, at an absolute minimum, to follow their own rules and to deal in good faith with their members. These standards can provide a profoundly valuable defense of liberty in the politically supercharged environment of the modern campus, where discipline without notice or hearing is all too common. (For more information about how to combat the lack of due process on university campuses, see also FIRE"s Guide to Due Process and Fair Procedure on Campus, available at www.thefire.org.)    In most states, court decisions have established that school policies, student handbooks, and other documents represent a contract between the college or university and the student. In other words, universities must deliver the rights they promise. Most campuses explicitly promise a high level of free speech and academic freedom, and some (including some of the most repressive in actual practice) do so in ringing language that would lead one to believe that they will protect their students" rights well beyond even constitutional requirements.    Since universities have the power to rewrite these contracts unilaterally, courts, to help achieve fairness, typically will interpret the rules in a student handbook or in other policies with an eye toward what meaning the school should reasonably expect students or parents to see in them. As a consequence, the university"s interpretation of its handbook is less important than the reasonable expectations of the student.    Importantly, some states have statutes (or state constitutional provisions) that provide students at private schools with some measure of free speech rights. For example, California"s so-called "Leonard Law" (more technically, Section 94367 of California"s Education Code) states that "no private postsecondary educational institution shall make or enforce any rule subjecting any student to disciplinary sanctions solely on the basis of conduct that is speech or other communication that ... is protected from governmental restriction by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 2 of Article 1 of the California Constitution."    In other words, students at California"s private, secular colleges and universities (the Leonard Law does not to apply to students at religious colleges) enjoy the same level of free speech rights as students at California"s public colleges. Other states, while not protecting students" rights to the same extent that California does, have ruled that private universities may not make blanket rules restricting speech. In the case of State of New Jersey v. Schmid (1980), the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that a state constitutional guaranteethat "every person may freely speak ... on all subjects"prevents Princeton University (even though a private school) from enforcing a comprehensive rule that required all persons unconnected with the university to obtain permission before distributing political literature on campus. This ruling, however, certainly did not grant students at private colleges the same rights as those at public universities.    While the Leonard Law and Schmid are important to the discussion of free speech at private campuses, students should not conclude that similar statutes or cases exist in the majority of states. In fact, far more states have rejected claims of rights to freedom of expression on privately owned property than have accepted such claims. (For a comprehensive overview of the law regarding freedom of expression at private institutions, see former FIRE Justice Robert H. Jackson Legal Fellow Kelly Sarabyn"s legal scholarship on the subject: "Free Speech at Private Universities," Journal of Law   Education, Vol. 39, p. 145 [April 2010].)    Beyond rights that are protected explicitly by contract or by statute, however, state law provides common-law rules against misrepresentation. Simply put, there is a long tradition of laws against fraud and deceit. Very often, a university"s recruiting materials, brochures, and even its "admitted student" orientationswhich are designed to entice a student to attend that institution rather than anotherwill loudly advertise the institution"s commitment to "diversity," "academic freedom," "inclusion," and "tolerance." Students will be assured that they will be "welcomed" or find a "home" on campus, regardless of their background, religion, or political viewpoint. Promises such as these will often lead students to turn down opportunities (and even scholarships) at other schools and to enroll in the private secular university. If these promises of "tolerance" or of an equal place in the community later turn out to be demonstrably false, a university could find itself in some legal jeopardy. The law prohibits deceptive promises that cause the deceived person to sign a contract, and such prohibitions against false advertising can be used in a quite credible effort to force a change in an administration"s behavior. As noted, our colleges and universities should honor their promises.    There is a final source of possible legal protection for a student at a private university, although it involves a particularly difficult legal and political question: When does the extent of the government"s involvement in the financing and governance of a self-proclaimed "private" college make it "public"? If that involvement goes beyond a certain point, it is possible that the institution will be found, for legal purposes, to be "public," and in that case all constitutional protections will apply. This happened, for example, at the University of Pittsburgh and at Temple University, both in Pennsylvania. State laws there require that, in return for significant public funding, a certain number of state officials must serve on the universities" boards. That fact led these formerly "private" campuses to be treated, legally, as "public." Nonetheless, this is a very rare occurrence, and the odds of any private school being deemed legally public are very slim. Unless a school is officially public, one should always assume that the First Amendment does not directly apply.    There are many students, faculty members, and even lawyers who believe, wholly erroneously, that if a college receives any federal or state funding it is therefore "public." In fact, accepting governmental funds usually makes the university subject only to the conditionssometimes broad, sometimes narrowexplicitly attached to those specific programs to which the public funds are directed. (The most prominent conditions attached to all federal funding are nondiscrimination on the basis of race and sex.) Furthermore, the "strings" attached to virtually all federal grants are not always helpful to the cause of liberty.    As a legal matter, there is no specific level of federal funding that obligates a private college or institution to honor the First Amendment. Many factors, such as university governance, the appointment of trustees, and specific acts of legislation, need to be weighed in determining the status of any given institution. That should not stop students, however, from learning as much as they can about the funding and governance of their institution. There are moral and political questions that arise from such knowledge, beyond the legal issues. Do the taxpayers truly want to subsidize assaults on basic free speech and First Amendment freedoms? Do donors want to pay for an attack on a right that most Americans hold so dear? Information about funding and governance is vital and useful. For example, students may find that a major charitable foundation or corporation contributes a substantial amount of funds to their college, and they may inform that foundation or corporation about how the university selectively abuses the rights and consciences of its students. Colleges are extremely sensitive to contributors learning about official injustice at the institutions that those donors support. This is another example of our most general principle: Colleges and universities must be accountable for their actions.  http://www.thefire.org/fire-guides/fires-guide-to-free-speech-on-campus-3/read-online/   How is the person speaking out silenced? Are they fined/imprisoned for their views? I'm not sure what you mean.  And are you referencing why SCOTUS defined sexual harassment as it did, or about something else? If it's about *Davis*, you can read the ruling here: http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US amp;vol=000 amp;invol=97-843   Already posted this to you, but I'll post it again for prosperity's sake. This is from FIRE's student guide:  In the landmark case of Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999), the Supreme Court defined student-on-student hostile environment harassment as conduct "so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim"s access to an educational opportunity or benefit." By definition, this includes only extreme and usually repetitive behaviorbehavior so serious that it would prevent a reasonable student from receiving his or her education. For example, in Davis, the conduct found by the Court to be actionable harassment was a months-long pattern of conduct including repeated attempts to touch the victim"s breasts and genitals and repeated sexually explicit comments directed at and about the victim.  ...  Put simply, to be legally punishable as harassment, students must be far more than simply rude or offensive. Rather, they must be actively engaged in a specific type of discrimination, as defined by law. Under this doctrine, there is a pattern of behavior that may involve speech so strikingly awful and persistent, and so focused on a person"s status as a member of a protected class, that the law must treat it not simply as speech, but as discriminatory behavior that constitutes a civil rights violation. Precisely because the Supreme Court cases describe only very extreme forms of speech as "harassment," we believe that it makes good sense to think of speech-as-harassment in terms of time, place, and manner restrictions that the Constitution permits: If the speech is repeated, is uttered at inappropriate times and places, and is so uncivilized and pervasive so as to make the victim unable to attend to his or her studies and other activities, then it risks being prohibited and punished. In other words, protected speech cannot become unprotected harassment merely because of its message; rather, to qualify as harassment, one must consider how, when, and where the message was communicated.  That answers your question, yes?   And some excerpts from FIRE's student guide:    Hate Speech      The term "hate speech" is frequently applied as a synonym for speech that is racist, sexist, homophobic, or similarly pejorative. Even these types of speech, however, are protected by the First Amendment. This fact may come as a surprise to many, as a significant number of Americans incorrectly believe that hateful speech is not protected by the First Amendment. But there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment, despite a widespread misconception to the contrary.     If someone contends that a particular form of vitriolic speech can be prohibited (as opposed to criticized) because it is hate speech, you now know that this argument is without merit. In order for speech to be truly free, speech that conveys deeply offensive messages, including hate, must be protected. A free people have recourse to reason, evidence, outrage, and moral witness against such speech, but do not need to turn to coercive power to silence it.    Although it is hardly admirable to use hate speech merely because the First Amendment allows it, colleges and universities, alas, often label as hate speech expression that is perfectly serious, thoughtful, and communicative, simply because it offends the sensibility of a handful of students, or, more likely, a handful of administrators. Thus, for example, a discussion of whether or not women are physically and temperamentally suited for military combat would be an entirely protected and serious exercise of speech in the public arena, but on certain campuses it would be judged, by some, to express a hateful attitude toward women. If some administrators had their way, all such disagreement would be hate speech.   Universities use many legal theories, all of which lack merit, to justify such broad restrictions on speech. However, because it is overwhelmingly clear that the Constitution grants free speech protection to so-called hate speech, it is unlikely that your university counsel would try to justify its speech code to a court on the grounds that hate speech may be prohibited on a public university campus. Such a legal theory would be frivolous. On campus, however, too many students mistakenly believe that merely deeming expression "hate speech" is sufficient grounds for censorship and loss of First Amendment protection. It is your job to teach your fellow students that the right answer to hateful speech is more speech, and not silenceor silencing. As Justice Louis Brandeis famously wrote in a concurring opinion in Whitney v. California (1927), "the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones."   In the landmark case of Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999), the Supreme Court defined student-on-student hostile environment harassment as conduct "so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim"s access to an educational opportunity or benefit." By definition, this includes only extreme and usually repetitive behaviorbehavior so serious that it would prevent a reasonable student from receiving his or her education. For example, in Davis, the conduct found by the Court to be actionable harassment was a months-long pattern of conduct including repeated attempts to touch the victim"s breasts and genitals and repeated sexually explicit comments directed at and about the victim.    Harassment, properly understood and as defined by the Supreme Court, refers to conduct that is (1) unwelcome; (2) discriminatory (3) on the basis of a protected status, like gender, race, disability, or age; (4) directed at an individual; and (5) "so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and ... [that] so undermines and detracts from the victims" educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution"s resources and opportunities."    It is worth reviewing each element of this definition. First, for conduct to constitute sexual harassment, the behavior in question must be "unwelcome," which means that the victim or victims found it "undesirable or offensive," and did not welcome, invite, seek out, or encourage it. Next, the behavior needs to be not only discriminatory, but also discriminatory on the basis of the victim"s protected class statusin other words, it needs to be negative behavior prompted by the victim"s race, gender, age, or disability. The behavior also needs to be aimed at an individual, rather than just general, broad-based actions without a specific target, and must be sufficiently severe and pervasive to drive a person off campus, depriving that person of his or her right to receive an education. "Objectively offensive" is an important requirement, because it shifts the consideration of the behavior from the subjective experience of a particular person (who might be very easily offended) to the experience of reasonable men and women. This is vital, making the standard for what is legally intolerable not the sensibilities of this or that possibly hypersensitive person, but rather the sensibilities of a typical, reasonable person. The behavior has to be both objectively offensive and perceived by the victim as offensive. Finally, the requirement that the behavior effectively deny "equal access" is also crucial, because it limits discriminatory harassment to conduct that is not only severe or pervasive and objectively offensive, but also so outrageous that it has the "systematic effect" of preventing the victim from getting an education.    Put simply, to be legally punishable as harassment, students must be far more than simply rude or offensive. Rather, they must be actively engaged in a specific type of discrimination, as defined by law. Under this doctrine, there is a pattern of behavior that may involve speech so strikingly awful and persistent, and so focused on a person"s status as a member of a protected class, that the law must treat it not simply as speech, but as discriminatory behavior that constitutes a civil rights violation. Precisely because the Supreme Court cases describe only very extreme forms of speech as "harassment," we believe that it makes good sense to think of speech-as-harassment in terms of time, place, and manner restrictions that the Constitution permits: If the speech is repeated, is uttered at inappropriate times and places, and is so uncivilized and pervasive so as to make the victim unable to attend to his or her studies and other activities, then it risks being prohibited and punished. In other words, protected speech cannot become unprotected harassment merely because of its message; rather, to qualify as harassment, one must consider how, when, and where the message was communicated.     Thanks for the awesome response. Lots of interesting points here.   Are you seriously suggesting that toxic behavior in college campuses is just "different views"? Like it's just a difference of opinion if someone is subject to hate speech or sexually harassed in their university?  Hate speech and sexual harassment are criminal activities specifically defined by SCOTUS that can be prosecuted by the law. Neither FIRE nor myself defend these activities. What colleges define as those things though, aren't always in line with SCOTUS rulings (otherwise FIRE would never exist). FIRE has written about these differences in their student guides.   Freedom of speech does not equal freedom from consequences of speech. My issue with this group stems from that they seem to adamantly insist the latter shouldn't be the case in the context of how universities decide to discipline their students  Absolutely there should be consequences, just social ones, and not legal/educational. SCOTUS has ruled out what hate speech and sexual harassment are, and if a public university isn't following these definitions, which are very specific, then they need to be prosecuted.     Okay, but my question is, when their attempts to achieve a goal of promoting free speech in universities accidentally supports hateful people...is that a goal worth achieving, at least in the way they're doing it?  Yes. Bigots exist in this world, we both know it. Should we shelter college students from that fact? Should we shelter them in how to deal with hard, important discussions about race, gender, history, religion and so on? Colleges are supposed to be a market place of ideas where discussions of all types are had so students can learn and proposer.   Hate speech already has a strict, Constitutional definition, and often colleges might not follow through with adhering to what SCOTUS has ruled.   Banning speech, in the *very* place it's supposed to be most free, is problematic.    Oh, harassment isn't covered under free speech law. FIRE has stated this, and won't defend students who are harassing others.    Oh I feel ya. I hate it when people with different views than me have the right to an education ;)  Check out that garage case I sent ya, and I recommend *Kindly Inquisitors* by  Jonathan Rauch, who writes about the importance of learning how to deal with bigotry in an open field, coming from the perspective as a gay man during the 70s. He talked at a FIRE conference I went to, and it was pretty cool learning about his experience.    I don't know if you'd qualify this case as having a victim, but I would: http://www.thefire.org/cases/valdosta-state-university-student-expelled-for-peacefully-protesting-parking-garages/   I wouldn't say they are more concerned with one or the other, but rather that hate groups are challenged more by school policy. If a victim was being silenced by their school, and the silencing went against the Constitution, FIRE will step in.    FWIW, according to FIRE's data (which you can find on their site), nearly half of all American public colleges have rules in their policy books which go against the first amendment. So when they say such, they have their own data to back it up. On their site, go to any state an look at all the "Red Light" schools listed. You'll be able to see what rules they find problematic.    Their President is a liberal Democrat, if that matters at all. I've worked with FIRE on changing my school's policies, and they really are a diverse group. I wouldn't call them conservative or reactionary.     Howdy! This is my time to shine! I've worked with FIRE on changing my school's speech codes, and lobbied with them in Massachusetts for a certain law regarding college students and legal representation. I've also attended two of their seminars, and had a great talk with their current President.   First, let me say that FIRE will stand for any group of any variant if their rights to free speech are harmed, or even bad policies are in place. For example, at my own school, a rule dictated that I couldn't annoy anyone. It didn't really clarify what that meant, the handbook simply just said it was against school policy to annoy someone. It's great to have anti-harassment policies, but not so great to have them be so vague they can be used to silence free speech.   They have a few books you can order on their website, which I recommend reading (and I highly recommend *Unlearning Liberty* written by their current President).    what I can tell they don't seem to offer much support to marginalized victims.  They absolutely will help, if such a group is facing free speech issues. It doesn't matter what the group stands for, so long as their school is going against the First Amendment.   Edit: Feel free to AMA about them. I've read a lot of their literature, and know a few of their workers personally.    You can also request FREE materials from Students For Liberty, while being a YAL chapter.    Yes, based in my interpretations, they are much more "conservative" theologically, in so much that they follow some form of simple Christianity, which Quakerism started out as just the same.   And yeah, no music. Gotta sing in your head ;)   As the equal of all else mankind, you are no more lesser than a straight man. You are indeed his brother, as both of you are born of our creator.   Thou art loved no matter thy condition.    No matter your sexual preference, remember you have the ability to access the channels of God through the Spirit through that voice that speaks within you.   And no matter who or what you are, you are always a child of God, thus you are equal to all else of mankind.      Twickenham  Damn English and their silly town names. Thanks for the info!      They're the brothers and sisters of Quakerism, as far as I'm concerned. Their love for peace and simplicity highly resonates with me.   My student group had some anarchists in it.    At my church, we have a business committee which keeps track of all donations and their use. Anyone could join the group and get a look at the numbers, if they so desired.    2011 Mormon me and current me would fight over the existence of clergy and doctrine.    Moved here from Boston! It's a neat place.   I don't think it's so much that other members are not accepting, so much as it is they feel guilt about having a friend who isn't LDS.    Just because something is beneficial doesn't mean we should do it. Alcohol has some health benefits, but that doesn't mean everyone should drink.   Plus, masturbation isn't even found in every culture. So some groups have survived without it.    Do you mean masturbation is fulfilling God's wishes, or reproduction is? They're obviously different things.     Check out http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbthavens   This is a good way to see it. When believers say "living God", it's not meant to equate God to the definition of a living creature, but rather a reference to the fact that God is active in present in our world. God is indeed supposed to be "living", just in a manner beyond our understanding.   Personally, I'll never share my faith through words unless asked (or it's in a place where I'm supposed to, like this subreddit, for example). It's better to share through actions instead of words. I care not if a man accepts the Spirit into their life, only that their life is in good standing.   Because then you can start wearing funny hats [like this](http://www.hatworx.com/media/product/287/quaker-widebrim-hat-f49.jpg), and no one would bat an eye ;)   Based upon what she said, it seems rough. The differences in theology are quite strong between Quakers and Mormons, and it seems that division is causing her troubles in making friends. It seems she gets into debates with many other students about various things (she didn't clarify on what those debates entail, but it's not hard to imagine their contents).   Only something like 2% of BYU students aren't LDS, so it's easy to see how it can cause a lot of problems when socializing, especially since Provo is so heavily LDS.   Edit: Just noticed your flair. Are you planning on going?   It seems to me that you carry the Spirit, or at least are trying to. If you do carry it, then it is up to you to spread it to those in need, like your friend. You're right in that leading a life of excess (drinking and drug use) leads us away from God, and leads to an unfulfilled life.   Show by example, as you already are. Never be afraid to correct him when he deviates from God. Our greatest friends are those who are not afraid to show us a better path.     That's an excellent line! I'm going to write that down somewhere.    We only speak when we feel compelled to by the Inner Light/Spirit. Some may never speak, as they never feel this compulsion, while others may feel it on a constant basis, and thus they share more frequently.   As for those who share a discussion prompt, they can simply bring one and read it, or a committee might decide on something to share for next meeting :)     And do note that some meetings actually will give sermons (these are called programmed meetings) where others like mine (unprogrammed) go with the flow, as it were.    It varies, but usually one to four people will speak if they feel compelled to by the Spirit. And topics can vary too. Someone today talked about the troubles of being a Quaker at BYU (a Mormon school), while another asked us to think about several young Friends in Washington who are lobbying for climate change legislation.   And occasionally there might be a discussion prompt, where someone will read something from another Friends meeting, and we'll respond if we feel compelled to.      Great! Felt the Spirit really strongly today during meeting. Felt compelled to speak on a certain topic, but refrained from doing so. Perhaps next week.    Here's some info from a previous post   http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/2xvu7o/whats_the_deal_with_gary_indiana/   Kids at my school did it just for kicks. No real reason, and we weren't in a poor area or anything.

How you find happiness is entirely up to you. *Should* God be your source of joy? IMO, no. But *can* God be your source of joy? Yes.   To find happiness, you must have a full spirit. How you fill that cup of spirit is up to you. It could be companionship, like you desire, but it could be in the simpler things, like gardening, reading, cooking, crafting, and so on. Find joy in the simple things, and life gets easier.      His beard is pretty gnarly. I want one like that.    Hates carrots   If I really dig them, I'll take a day to be mad.  Then I repeat that process.    There aren't many folks willing to date an 18 y/o on OKC. There's no harm, but it'll be tough.    What about the war in Afghanistan? It'd be interesting to see word choice differences between the beginning of the occupation and the end.    Religious institutions should be allowed to discriminate though. Otherwise, you're opening up a can of worms. Should, for example, the LDS church allow an atheist to be a bishop? What about a drinker  amp;amp;amp; smoker?  Don't get me wrong, I'm in the LGBT spectrum myself, and I hope more religious institutions allow for change, but that change must come from internal sources, and not external. Otherwise, you're going to get a case which goes to SCOTUS, and they'd probably rule in favor of the religious institution.   For private businesses (Walmart, etc), you're right though - religious leaders wouldn't have grounds there.    I just did a group date thing with someone (house party). Did not work out well. Do not recommend group things with people she knows.    For the US, yes. This is public data which we can see.    When I ran for office, I did so because each election cycle the candidate for State Rep ran unopposed, and I noticed that 15% of voters managed to get to the voting booth but they cast blank ballots. This told me at least 15% of the city objected to current leadership, so I decided to give them a choice come November.   So casting a blank vote can signify a rejection of whoever is running, and let's the public know that.      With who, though? I don't hear/read much talk of an enemy of who we will currently have nuclear war with. I've not heard a word about nuclear war with Russia or China in the near future.   I'd say it's just remnants of memories of the  Cuban Missile Crisis and Soviet fiasco with  Czechoslovakia which have taught baby boomers nuclear war is a very real thing.     Certainly his own actions are his fault though, obviously, which is what this is all about.

 I'm a guy, I've been dealing with feeling down for years. I've never been diagnosed for depression and it doesn't really affect my everyday life, but I've never been happy either and there are times that I genuinely feel depressed, and I don't tell anyone, not even my parents or closest my friends. It's a secret that I keep to myself. I have to be a great son and friend, to perform as a student and athlete, I'm also a teacher and counselor and I hear many horrible stories from people in need of psychological support everyday. I'm not the one who's expected to snap. I just can't be. There's just too much pressure. Too much pressure to perform, to excel, to constantly be the best person that I can be. But one day I think I will snap, I just don't know when or how.   There is a significant correlation between protein intake, low GL and high GL carbohydrate intake, and weight changes.       Same!   Thanks, will definitely watch!   There is no link. This comes mostly from what I learned in school and from my general knowledge. But let me try to find you a good link.    In layman's terms, the glycemic index indicates how quickly the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and then either transformed to make energy or stored as fat tissue. The glycemic load, on the other hand, is more accurate as it takes into account how quickly it is absorbed, but also, how much sugar is actually absorbed. If you just look at the glycemic index, carrots appear to be really bad because they are digested really quickly. However, in reality carrots are still healthy, because they contain very little sugar, which the glycemic load reflects.   What do glycemic index and glycemic load mean? Well, when you eat sugar, your pancreas secretes insulin which will help 'push the sugar' into your system so that, like I said, it can either used as energy or stored. More specifically, when insulin is secreted, glucose is stored as glycogen in your liver and muscle cells through a process known as glycogenesis, and when your blood sugar drops,  the glycogen is converted back to glucose through glycogenolysis, and then to a compound known as pyruvate through a process known as glycolysis, and from there, it will undergo many other changes in order to be used as energy.   But the issue with the nutrients being pushed is that more of them will be wasted (as the body can only use so much nutrients at a given time) and turned into fat tissue. So insulin has its ups and downs, but definitely more downs if you're trying to cut and vice versa.    Well, don't take everything I said as absolute truth, as science is a complicated thing and my understanding of these phenomena is not that advanced, but a good article to read if you're interested in the subject might be [this one](http://dana.org/Cerebrum/2013/Gut_Feelings__Bacteria_and_the_Brain/)   There is also research which suggests that eating healthy literally gets easier over time. This is because the nutrients you eat affect your gut flora composition, and in turn the bacteria in your gut influence your brain to make you crave the nutrients that they prefer through the gut-brain pathway. As you eat healthy more consistently, the 'bad food' micro organisms will get more and more replaced by the 'good food' ones, and you will start craving unhealthy foods less and less. So don't give up! It will definitely get easier.    To me, there has always been a difference between spirituality and religion . Spirituality makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, as it's the result of the interaction between our ability to think abstractly, and our ability to come up with answers to the questions that we raise, both for obvious survival purposes.  Religion, on the other hand, is the organization of sets of spiritual beliefs for social, political and economical reasons.   I understand both spirituality and religion, and hate the latter, and also hate the fact that most people are not aware of that distinction.       Yeah I was just messing around. I don't know to what extent more = better when it comes to micro nutrients tbh. I need to research on that, actually. It's an interesting subject. The answer is probably very complex, as it depends on each micro nutrient I would guess.    Funny fact: studies conducted on the effects of Trenbolone on livestock concluded that it drastically increases the degree of absorption of micro nutrients. I'm not saying this outweighs the other effects, but if you're injecting that compound, you might as well make the most of it by eating metric shit tons of vegetables, low GL fruits, sweet potatoes and other foods that are rich in micro nutrients.    MGF is an isoform of Insulin-like growth factor 1. It is modified at the genetic level to produce a different mRNA sequence due to the addition of several nucleotide sequences. In rodents, it affects the post-exercise acute skeletal muscle repairing process, by activating the satellite cells in muscle tissue, which then proliferate and provide local muscle tissue with additional blast cells during myogenesis for muscle tissue repair. However, testing in humans is limited, so I would advise against taking what is said here too seriously.          Rush speaks fluent English and can translate the basics.          No. Those supplements are a fraud. No one has ever clandestinely injected a virus in their body with this purpose. This is the absolute first time this has been done.    This is the method they used in that clinical trial. That's why I said you would have to be vastly rich in order to do this.    Follistatin 344 does not work, because the compound has to be injected using an adeno-associated virus.    Lol sorry I meant that the original question didn't have the 'when' in it. I made a fool of myself here. I edited.   Pretty sure he edited, the original question was 'can we use this to get huge?', unless I misread.    Full article can be viewed [here](http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v23/n1/full/mt2014200a.html).  Also, to answer your question, it could be used in the near future (a couple years from now). However, here's the trick: the TGF- superfamily affects all tissues, not just the muscular ones. So, here, they had to create an isoform, a very similar version of Follistatin (FS315 in the article) that has been modified at the genetic level so as to produce a different mRNA sequence that specifically targets the myostatin pathway. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that inhibiting myostatin to the large extent that would most likely be required in order to produce a desired outcome in an athlete or bodybuilder would work or be side effect-free, as this is the first time this has been done in humans.  So the answer is yes, it could potentially be used already, but only if you are vastly rich, can find the qualified researchers to carry out such a costly and advanced procedure, and wish to turn yourself into a human guinea pig. But the potential of abuse by athletes in the near future is in fact so real that the WADA has already added 'gene doping' to its list of banned substances and processes.    The first time this has been done in humans as far as I know. Myostatin production was previously successfully inhibited in non-human animals only.   Also, typo: trial, not trinial      As far as I know, this is the first time scientists have managed to successfully inhibit myostatin production in humans. It had previously been done in non-human animals.       I hope you're joking. If yes, sorry, it went right over my head.    He is also on steroids, he doesn't make it a secret. Maybe I should have mentioned that in the OP.          Also, if you think 17k is a lot, [this woman ate 30,000 calories in a single one hour sitting](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080369/Donna-Simpson-Worlds-heaviest-mother-reveals-long-journey-fat-fetish-videos-healthy-life.html)      I feel sorry for your toilet seat.    ...in a Mexican jail cell.    This is evil lol.    Chicken, rice, and veggies mate.          Basically, I work as an English teacher at the Elementary level, but I also have a major in Biochemistry and a minor in Human Nutrition, and I try to do activities that will also indirectly teach my students the basics of nutrition, that is, the main food groups, the macro and micro nutrients, and healthy eating patterns in general. For me, it makes sense, as developing healthy life habits must start at a young age, and the kids also seem to enjoy learning about these things, which is a big plus.  But now I'm getting angry email and phone calls from some parents... According to them, I'm 'brainwashing their kids about food', which is causing them to complain that what their parents are putting on their plate is not healthy. These parents are obviously very ignorant about nutrition themselves, and live a sedentary lifestyle and look unhealthy/overweight, but I can't exactly tell them that without getting in trouble with my boss. I'm not sure what to do or how to respond to the angry complaints. Any ideas/advice?          Thanks!   I realized that I made a few mistakes. There should be an arrow linking amino acids to glutamate, and another arrow linking Ketosis (and not lipogenesis) to Oxaoloacetate.       If you know, you can do whatever you want. But knowledge is power. A lot of people ingest these substances regularly even though they're mostly ignorant about what it does to their body, which is disturbing to say the least.    Thank you.    No, but alcohol is harmful for a handful for a reasons, both for general health and bodybuilding.   Firstly, alcohol cannot be processed directly by the body, it has to be broken down into a compound called acetaldehyde, which is classified as a carcinogen, meaning that it can damage DNA sequences and cause cancer. And a few people actually get cancer from alcohol consumption every year, mostly middle aged women.  Secondly, it disrupts the tricarboxylid acid cycle, because alcohol dehydrogenase, one of the dehydrogenase enzymes that break down nutrients in said cycle, are also involved in breaking down alcohol into acetaldehyde. Because of this, less nutrients can be turned into energy while your body is breaking down alcohol. And what happens  to nutrients that can't be turned into energy? They get sent back into the bloodstream as lipoproteins, and then stored as fat cells in your tissue. And on top of that, it also lowers blood sugar level significantly, making you hungry even though you don't actually need nutrients, since alcohol isn't broken down into anything remotely useful for your body; this is why nights of binge drinking are usually concluded at Mcdonalds or Burger King.   Thirdly, it depletes the reserves of micro nutrients (minerals   vitamins) in your body at much faster rate than normally, for various reasons. Many of these micro nutrients are involved in various processes that relate to maintaining tissue maintenance and growth.   And fourthly - and in my opinion this is the main reason why it's horrible for bodybuilders or athletes it general - it disrupts the synthesis of both testosterone and growth hormone, two hormones that are, needless to say, crucial for maintaining a lean, muscular and strong body.  And the list is actually bigger and more complex than that. This is just a few of the main reasons that I recall being mentioned in my Pharmacology and Metabolic Biochemistry classes.        Thanks for the schooling.    There is a difference between being 5 pounds lighter and having actually lost 5 pounds of subcutaneous fat. The former option is much more likely in your case, unless you somehow lost 5 pounds of fat in a single week while being at a self-reported caloric surplus.    Supplements: most of them have never been shown to work by any research and/or are based on a few controversial studies. Legal.  Steroids: benefits have been shown by serious research from various reputed scientific journals over multiple decades. Illegal.  The irony is strong with this one.    Wow, very original! I would have never come up with this myself!   Whoa! Amazing! Can't imagine all the work that went into this.    Useful to know, thanks!   Yeah, I was answering to the guy who asked if Clen was a steroid, don't worry.    You asked for an alternative. Well, here's multiple ones. :P   Come on bro. I'm all for the chicken   veggies diet, but there aren't that few healthy products, especially when your goal is to be at a caloric surplus.  Veggies: Avocados, beans (green, red, black, white, Lima, winged), lentils, sun-dried tomatoes, succotash (Lima   shell beans), soybean sprouts, spinach.   Seeds: pumpkin seeds, quinoa seeds, hemp seeds  Sources of meat: salmon (high in good fats, including omega-3), tuna, tilapia, scallops, shrimps, lean ground beef, lean ground chicken  Others: natural peanut butter, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, tofu.   This is just a few examples that I can think of off the top of my head. There are a few others.    I can't remember where I saw that, it might have been in Pumping Iron. At some point Arnold said that when he would go out with the bodybuilders that were competing against him, he would always try and get them to drink more than him so as to gain an edge over them.    As long as that single drink doesn't turn into multiple ones, sure.  Serious bodybuilding  Heavy alcohol drinking  Pick one of the two.   Why do you think Arnold used to make his opponents drink?      Actually, Clenbuterol is used primarily as a medication for people who have severe asthma in Asian and Eastern European countries. The research on its weight loss properties is controversial at best. It certainly won't work without on point dieting, and I wouldn't use if you are sensitive to stimulants (like caffeine) and/or have a history of heart issues in your family. Sympathomimetic drugs can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, and the fact that you're asking if it's a steroid tells me that you indeed don't, so I would say don't use it. :/   Ok, yeah, I was talking out of my ass here, sorry. Neither unit of measure take into accounts nutrients like I was referring to here. But it's still true that kJs are the official measure of unit now.    Well, first of all, the term 'calorie' itself is outdated and irrelevant. Nowadays, in nutritional context, the international unit used to refer to the potential energy that humans derive from food through metabolic processes is the joule, which is more accurate. The term 'calorie' is flawed because it implies that all nutrients have the same impact on our metabolism, which is false.    It has nothing to do with use of performance enhancing drugs. It has to do with understanding how the various nutrients contained in food products are processed by your body, as well as how these processes are influenced by other factors.   You call it 'overcomplicating', I call it not having proper understanding of the biochemical and biomechanical principles behind nutrition and resistance training. You probably think it's overly complicated because you're used to relying on anecdotal evidence, also known as bro science, rather than serious research from reputed scientific journals.           No it doesn't.   Yeah. After doing a little bit more research and reading, I realize that now. Thanks for the fair warning though!   A lot of people seem to say the opposite of what I've heard, that is, that it's actually more addictive than the alternatives, that you get an 'urge' to use more. I think I'll stay away lol.    Thanks, I will do my reading!   It doesn't have to have fat-burning properties to be a viable cutting drug. For example, Ephedrine doesn't have significant fat burning properties, but it helps you reach your desired caloric intake indirectly by suppressing appetite and giving you more intensity in the gym.    I have a few biochem classmates who are big into using this. They say this:   -It's an amphetamine-like stimulant, similar in structure to MDMA, norephedrine, ephedrine, etc (basically a phenetylamine with a Me group, for the chem folks)  -No fat burning properties  -Less addictive than well known related psychoactive compounds (such as MDMA)  -Very powerful stimulant   -Some side effects that are dose dependent and vary from one person to another, such as loss of appetite, dilated pupils, increased sweating, increased heart rate  Obviously this is only anecdotal evidence, but I can't find any serious research from a reputable scientific journal either. Nothing on examine.com either. Does anyone have some info/insight into this stimulant drug?    Thanks!   I do!   No one knows for sure what he looked like. No one from our time was around to tell. Just like we can't tell what Jesus of Nazareth was really like. We can only rely on the writings that were left to us.       Would love to see what this looks like with the vanilla resource pack.    As a CLG fan, I wasn't disappointed because I wasn't expecting them to do anything in the first place. Historically, CLG has always done poorly when it matters most.       'Protein' on the label usually refers to the proteinogenic (protein-building) amino-acids, of which the building process is encoded in the body's DNA and mRNA sequences, and which are condensed into peptide chains during protein biosynthesis.   BCAAs are in fact proteinogenic amino acids, so when it says 24g of proteins, it means 24g of proteins.          Wow, really interesting, thank you for sharing this! This is perspective-changing to say the least.    Oh sorry, I thought this was about hGH. Forget everything I just said.    Research wise, hGH is quite a novel hormone, it seems. There is still much research to be done. I actually asked one of my professors about this, and he said that the synthesis process of hGH during deep sleep is not fully understood yet.    A lot of people believe that the 'safe' age to start using steroids is 25, because many endocrinologists believe that the brain does not fully mature until that age.  A lot of people also say that there are two ways of using steroids: you can either use them to reach your limit genetic potential more quickly, in which case you can maintain your physique without sustained use afterwards, assuming that you keep training and eating properly, OR you can use them to go beyond your genetic limit in terms of muscular tissue, in which case you have to pretty much sustain use in order to stay there.  Now I don't know to what extent this is true or whether it's that arbitrary, because my understanding of the relationship between muscle mass, genes and hormones is fairly limited. However, it makes me worry because right now, I'm 21 and by the time I am 25, I will have been training for literally a decade (I have been lifting since I was 15 and dieting seriously since I was 17). I am pretty confident that if I continue to train and diet properly and keep improving my training and dieting method and knowledge, I will be at least pretty close to my genetic limit (if there's even such a thing) by the time I'm 25. My question is basically: assuming that I do reach my genetic potential in 5 years, if I wanna start using steroids by then, will I have to pretty much use them in a sustained manner in order to keep my gains?   I'm sorry if this post is confusing, I'm hoping that it makes sense.    I don't know about me at all, but I think you're acting like an ignorant fool right now.    As far as I know, everything except insulin and growth hormone, the latter being very difficult (and costly) to detect on an anti doping test.    Yes. It is banned by the World Anti Doping Agency.    Clearly you don't really know what you're saying. True enough, there's some degree of variability when it comes to what a substance does to the body from one person to another, but you can still make a reasonable assumption about what it would do to you using scientific knowledge. I can tell that I would lose body fat for sure if I used this compound, because I understand the very basic related biochemical principles. If you have read what I wrote and understand it and still don't believe me, I'm not sure what to say. You could also look it up on the internet, the information is out there and it's well known that DNP is an extremely potent as a weight loss aid. It's simply not used because the mechanism involved can also cause a bunch of potentially dangerous side effects.    Here's some great info for you if you're going to use DNP:  [DNP in Bloodstream for 30 days using 36 hour half life](http://i.imgur.com/ReGBdSv.jpg)  [General guide on 2,4-Dinitrophenol 'Hungry on 2,4 Dinitrophenol'](http://pastebin.com/1G2k4Njs)  I can tell you for a fact that DNP works, not because I've tried it myself (in fact, I haven't), but because I've studied the biochemical principles that make it work. Strictly speaking, 2,4-Dinitrophenol is  a proton ionophore, meaning it basically moves freely across the cell membrane, and causes the proton gradient to be released as heat rather than being used in the ATP-making process of the mitochondrion. Normally, ADP is converted into ATP and then back into ADP, but DNP inhibits this process, meaning your body has to use all the stored nutrients just to keep you alive. It has an incredibly significant impact on weight even by research standards. In fact, its mechanism is being actively studied at the moment.    Only steroid related, but does anyone have any serious research on Myostatin, Fillostatin, RNAi and muscular tissue in humans? I know it's a fairly new research subject and I haven't been able to find any on various websites, but who knows.    No, but conditioning is attainable for all. It's mainly size that separates gifted from average genetically speaking, IMHO.    Not hating. Just concerned about what him making it big would mean for bodybuilding as a whole. Even by bodybuilding standards, he is freaking huge. It's scary to think that his season weight could become the bench mark for bodybuilders in the future.    Get out.    Actually, Blizzard explicitly stated that it was the other way around - that they banned Iranian people from playing their games due to the U.S.-imposed sanctions on Iran. As a non-U.S. citizen, this is bullshit. Online gaming shouldn't be affected by governmental affairs, but I can see why they did it. I just think it's unfair for Iranian players who probably don't even have a political understanding of what caused this.       Not sure if legit or not. In all cases, it doesn't seem to be backed up by any scientific research, but it is very detailed.    Some men are just crazy...    Yes it is, somewhat. But then again, Minecraft in general IS grindy!         Yes, but reiterations in science are never a bad thing!   Great summary. Also, interesting: the essential amino acid concerned here is leucine. Leucine seems to increase MPS due to its interaction with the enzymes that can bind Guanonine triphosphate (a substrate for RNA synthesis) during MPS. This interaction in turn leads to the translocation of the kinase enzyme mOTRC1 in the cell organelle. That's what the research found anyway.             This goes to show that warfare really is the inevitable fate of humanity. It is in our nature to fight and kill each other, just like it was in our ancestors' nature as well.       I hope you step on a Lego block      I'd be interested to read your specific study on occlusion training. In some studies that I read, they found that certain ischemic conditions (such as glycolysis happening with a limited supply of oxygen)  lead to an increased production of certain monoamine neurotransmitters, particularly norepinephrine. I wonder if you drew out similar conclusions here.    Ok. I do realize that what I wrote might be a little reader-unfriendly, though. But I don't know how to explain it differently.     I'm sorry, maybe I should have clarified. Polysaccharides are simply complex carbohydrates. All complex carbohydrates are made up of units of monosaccharide, the simplest form of sugar, bound together by a molecule bond called glycosidic bond. And the rest, well, I'm not sure how I can further clarify. It's already explained in my OP.    Some endocrinologists believe that the brain takes 25 years to fully mature. So, until that age, there are definitely more risks involved. But then again,  some people get on the gear in their early twenties and are doing fine. It's not an exact science...   I believe him. Don't think he has any reasons to lie about that. If he says he was natty up until 1995, it's probably true.          Carb cycling works, but not the way most people think. It works because of the relationship between polysaccharides and leptin, a complex adipose tissue hormone of which the main purpose is to mediate the effects of neurotransmitters known as endocannabinoids in the brain. These neurotransmitters increase appetite and slow down metabolism. In experiments done on rodents, they found that leptin production tends to increase and decrease along with polysaccharide intake in the long run, but not with shorter chains of monosaccharide units, lipids or amino acids. Because of this, carb cycling should consist of high starch, moderate protein, low fat   low sugar 'refeed' days. There's no consensus on how much you should eat during those days as far as I know, but there's some anecdotal evidence that you should eat at caloric maintenance.         Synthol misuse is the most hilariously ugly thing I've ever seen.    An opinion accompanied with arguments that I like to think make sense and are well explained.    No, you misunderstood. I am actually studying these things, but in spite of that, not everything I've mentioned here is entirely based on the stuff I've seen in school. It's a mix of what I've learned in school and what I've learned on my own using the knowledge that I've acquired in school, if that makes sense. In other words, it's a mix of what I've learned, what I'll probably learn, and my outlook on the world (which influences how I interpret the pieces of information that I've acquired). In all cases, it's certainly not an actual theory by scientific standards.    It's a theory by layman's definition, not in the sense that is used by scientists in a research context, obviously. It's a set of ideas that I've had for a long time and that have grown more sophisticated and interconnected, as I keep thinking about it and as I keep learning about biology, evolution, biochemistry, and other things like that.    No, I don't. I keep that to myself, because I don't have enough confidence in my theories to put them out there yet, and also because food is a touchy subject like politics and religions these days. But it's what I think, even though I don't tell anyone at least in real life.    Clearly you haven't read 'shit' if that's all you got from reading the OP.  And to answer your edit, I haven't even learned most of this stuff in school. It's just my personal understanding/knowledge/own conclusions based on what I know. But like I said, feel free to prove me wrong and make me look like an idiot if you think everything I've typed here is false.    Maybe it's douchey as fuck like you say, but in my opinion it's true. But feel free to discredit every single one of my arguments if you can. I would love to be schooled and go to sleep knowing something that I didn't yesterday. I'm totally serious.    I've secretly felt alienated from society for years now, and most of it has to do with nutrition. Most people are utterly ignorant when it comes to nutrition, and I cannot stand ignorance. So I secretly hate everyone.  Of course I don't go around saying that. But deep inside, it's how I feel.          Not sure what you mean...       There are arrows for me. Are other people not seeing arrows either?          Amazing!   It feels like they've been rolling through the entire NA LCS with relative ease. Especially when Xiaoweixiao plays seriously and Rush doesn't screw up the early game, it feels like they're on an entirely different level.   Serious question. Do you guys think that in the future we will be able to alter the genes responsible for the production of the Growth Differentiation Factor (GDF) proteins for athletic purposes?   Inhibition of GDF-8 is already known to result in an increase in muscular tissue and a reduction in adipose tissue in a controlled setting, at least in mice and primates. And there are a couple cases of kids being born with a mutated GDF-8 gene and having incredible muscular mass and strength as a result. Seems to me that the idea won't be too far-stretched anymore in a couple years from now.       How do I explain to her that this isn't true at all?  I mean, I know why it isn't, but how do I explain it in a way that makes sense from the perspective of a 20 year old female who's fairly new to bodybuilding?  I've shown her various pictures of pro fitness girls, but she still doesn't believe me, she says that 'it's not the same for these girls', that people in her family have 'naturally big shoulders'.       Them quads...   It would make it possible to automate the trading system. For example, let's say you have a zombie spawner. The rotten flesh gets sorted, then sent into a dispenser that throws it at a cleric villager who trades rotten fresh for emerald. Every time the villager receives X required number of rotten flesh, he makes the trade and throws an emerald in front of him. The emerald gets collected by a hopper, and goes into a chest. Wouldn't that be awesome?    Just wanted to share this, because I think it's an absolutely mind-blowingly awesome design! Spruce wood for days!   Yeah, probably something I need to try and do. Neat advice, but it's not as simple in practice. Thanks though!   Cheers to you too man! That's what my lifestyle has mostly become in the past years, too. Heavy weights, clean food and gaming. Except that I'm currently single, but I'm fine with that too. Just waiting to meet the right person, otherwise it's pointless to me.    Most of what I've ever said on reddit is just how I feel 'deep inside', not the discourse that I actually have IRL. That's why people here think I'm some massively weird nut guy whereas in real life I'm just an average gym-obsessed dude. But I agree with what you said. I do feel alienated due to my own perception of my 'dual-lifestyle', but I recognize that that is my fault, not other people's.     Thanks man, yeah I'll definitely you guys know. And yes I know and watch Bahjeera. The guy is definitely entertaining and he looks nice too, granted. But I don't think he's really into bodybuilding, he's just into looking nice by having a bit of muscle mass on, which is completely fine too.    Yeah, the fitness sub is an example of me miserably failing to not let how I feel get the best of me, I'll give you that. I still believe that most people have bad eating habits due to their own ignorance and flawed outlook on the world, but I understand that it wasn't appropriate to express how I felt in that case. But I did it anyway. What's done is done, there's nothing I can do to change that...    True. My point was just that sometimes I feel alienated, like I don't belong to either group. Don't know if that makes sense. I don't always feel like that anyway.    There's a big difference between feeling and thinking. I often do feel superior, yes, but I see that feeling as a personality flaw and I understand that it is not rational or appropriate, and I don't let it dictate my behavior and I don't actually believe that I'm superior to anyone either (most of the time anyway).    Well, not right now. I used to work for my university, I was working with and conducting research on kids who have communication disorders. But the program has run out of funding, so now I'm out of job. I'm looking to start up a Youtube channel as well as a live stream and make online gaming my job, pretty much. I don't know if it'll work out, but that's my goal for the next 4 months.    Yeah, you're probably right. I'm studying in Education, so I've had many Psychology classes and have done a lot of research on Human Behavior, and based on both that and my general culture, I think it's no coincidence... In the gym, I've always wanted to be the biggest and leanest, and when playing online games, I've always wanted to be the best, the most skilled, the most advanced. For me both have always felt like addiction, or like obsessions. And I don't know if it's gonna change. But is it really an issue? As long as you're happy with something, I don't think it ever is.    Most of my friends who are big into bodybuilding are somewhat stereotypical 'fitness girls', and the only video games that they know are the Wii fit game and Call of Duty, and they don't even play them... They don't even know of computer games like League of Legends and WoW.   On the other hand, my gamer friends are somewhat unhealthy, eat whatever whenever and don't exercise.   I find it difficult to feel like I belong to either group of people, because I enjoy both - I aspire to become a bodybuilder, lift 5 days a week and count all my calories, but I also consider myself a hardcore gamer - I've been playing online games competitively since I was a kid and sometimes I play 6-7 hours a day or more. When I'm not lifting or making food, I'm pretty much always gaming.   Is it like that for everyone or am I just unlucky in my life?    But I am a guy and I care about my glutes. My last routine even had a glute day.    It depends. If you do push/pull/legs, you can have one day of each and train 3-4 times a week. You can also divide it up, and train 6 days a week with 2 days for each. I find that it's mostly a matter of preference and finding what works for your body.    Serious question. When I was 18 reality hit me hard when I became aware of my own ignorance. But then I also realized that I genuinely loved bodybuilding, that it had never really been about impressing the other gender anyway. It was like an epiphany (serious).    Whoa. This is very interesting. I had no idea such a disorder existed. Thanks for sharing this. Kinda frightening too.          Alcohol cannot be digested directly by the body, so instead it is broken down into acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA and therefore cause cancer - this is what carcinogens do, and a few people per year actually get cancer due to alcohol consumption.   Alcohol also does a handful of other harmful things to the body. First, it disrupts the body's main metabolic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Normally, proteins, carbohydrates and fats are transformed into energy with the help of co-enzymes. However, one  co-enzyme in particular, known as alcohol dehydrogenase, is also responsible for breaking down alcohol into acetaldehyde. Because alcohol is prioritized by the body (as it is seen as harmful), this co-enzyme cannot do its usual job of breaking down nutrients for energy, therefore slowing down metabolism. This actually increases stored fat, since the nutrients that cannot be used for metabolism are sent into the bloodstream and then stored as fat cells in the body.   What is even worse is that, since alcohol is broken down, your blood sugar level is lowered and you become hungry, despite not being in any need of nutrients since none have been used. This is why nights out drinking usually end up at Mcdonalds, and just create an even greater increase in stored fat.  Alcohol also depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals and reduces the production of various hormones in the body that are associated with well-being, such as testosterone and growth hormone. It is incredibly harmful to the body.    You could have just said that it resulted in his death.          I don't live in the U.S.    Taste is irrelevant to me in this case. I just want to know which one is superior from a nutritional POV.       I would love to see it and get inspired as a result. Please do.    No I wouldn't mind at all, it's no problem. Have fun with it, and if possible, improve it and personalize it. I can think of at least a hundred ways to make this look even better. I just don't have the time or inspiration at the moment.    Thanks! :)   The shit people do...   	173
 What does a group created and sustained by the state, that fights with other states about being a state have to do with a poly-centric law society...??   lol thanks:)      good point... whos to say what 'hate speech' will no longer be protected by the first Amendment on the new 'free and open' internet...   wanna keep something 'free and open' - regulate the shit out of it... lol these ppl...   I love this guy. It was so classic when he [told a statist on facebook that they were to stupid to vote and that they shouldn't!](http://dailycaller.com/2014/09/20/libertarian-nominee-in-n-c-senate-race-calls-voter-ignorant-moron/) he was polling at like 11 percent until then... lol  [Also looks like hes launched a strong internet ad campaign](http://www.medicaldaily.com/pro-marijuana-ads-hulu-nc-politician-sean-haugh-goes-all-pot-legalization-307869)   Uh yeah... in a free market bad actors fail... you dont need more government to undermine what government is doing in the first place... you need the exact opposite....  	7
 Because Dana chooses the doctors..   if your culture cant handle muslim neighbors, fuck your culture   have you ever smoked weed? jaywalked ? parked in the wrong space? etc etc  legal immigration is nearly impossible. stop using the law as an excuse to justify your hate.   their kids speak better American than you do, racist    the system is broken. it takes over 10 years to immigrate legally. this is just a bullshit excuse.   /r/postnationalist welcomes immigrants   /r/postnationalist welcomes turks everywhere   /r/postnationalist welcomes canadians   You could reply to every post on reddit with that..   too bad most amuricans feel pride when they see that image.. sigh   /r/postnationalist    Still no need for it..    Lol this comment would easily be upvoted on many subs    so youre defending "border" checkpoints anywhere within 100miles of the US border because the Supreme Court said it was ok? my god..    or youre just an idiot    why do you always throw insults in with your posts?   according to /r/conspiracy every single event is a false flag..    pass a scientific peer review? are you kidding? look /r/conspiracy , you have to stop playing fast and loose with the facts.. i love you all but..    please point out the inaccuracy of my statement   don't bother asking that, (I do believe there was some form of conspiracy on 9/11, just saying), they never answer you..   no see, there were red flakes in some dust samples that a lady stored in her house for 5 years before mailing off to a 9/11 guy to "publish" a "paper" in an online journal".. therefore nano-thermite!   america would do this too.. need a license for everything in the land of the free   k will remember keep britishpolitics posts discussion/effort   yea not a big fan of alex jones but hey.. fuck the border police~   finally the casino loses. also funny to read in that article that bryan micon only got fined 25,000$ for running an unlicensed gaming operation.. guess he wasn't very profitable?   /r/postnationalist , fuck border police   meanwhile the UK is deporting nurses..   this is actually a good use case for bitcoin, though. anywhere the government/banks don't let us operate, bitcoin becomes useful.   fuck UKIP /r/britishpolitics   and the TPP removes their sovereignty. but somehow that's a bad thing?   /r/postnationalist   because we don't let in any immigrant doctors or nurses  /r/postnationalist    /r/postnationalist   awesome please do! be happy to help fix it up too.. hope it can be a bit of a community document.   ladies of the night arent gonna hodl.. they want $    this is actually one of the few good use cases for bitcoin -- when governments/banks start fucking with you   yea but who is gonna pay for Ellen Pao if we don't let them monetize us harder?   Basically any system can be tampered with though.. At least evoting gets more people involved    /r/postnationalist    If a "terrorist" wanted to cross from Canada to the USA it must be the easiest thing ever to avoid border patrols.. Just swim.. Or walk.. Etc   I can try.. Anyone have suggestions for stuff to add?    Samsung just can't compete anymore - all the Chinese manufacturers also copy apple and sell for half the price..   oh please. OP is ranting about outsourcing and jobs going overseas. that has nothing to do with confession of an economic hitman. all it is is code-words for American nationalism.   same with most of the west.. its called "hitting your peak" [and rich people getting richer]   r u fucking serious? reddit is all anti-TPP, all the time.. every sub-reddit.. if anything id say reddit is shilling against foreign labor ~   can we stop saying "ITS NOT ABOUT X, ITS ABOUT Y"   tomorrows post:  ITS NOT ABOUT JAMES HOLMES, ITS ABOUT THE TPP   not like they ever answer them..  Victoria gets my respect if she fought the commercialization, but she was already part of the problem.. her teaching the celebs how to shill their products more effectively at us..   censored?   most AMA questions are shill/handpicked   I thought the problem was the fertilizers?   what kind of treatments did they do?   hah your stateless brothers       Plus all that bitch did was use her dank memes skills to shill celebrity products at us, fuck her    Join the OGs    /r/postnationalist if you're not already    The one that bitches about American government losing sovereignty to the TPP    /r/postnationalist supports inter-racial marriage    Don't we all?   So poor people are fucked?   You don't believe the Iraq war was about)$$?   YA the TPP is basically creating Oceania lol   Hi,?   China is cheap and safe and civilized    Wow    Humanity is just a step on the evolutionary ladder    /r/postnationalist     I've read all that too.. But.. Not conclusive. Is the fbi still hiding their results of the investigation or did they just not try hard enough?   Ask China how being "cheap labor" works.. Pretty well, actually (although income inequality is still a problem)   The interesting thing is how much this sub defends American sovereignty and "democracy" only when comes to the TPP and otherwise never    I'd rather be a waiter... Manufacturing sucks    Weird, she was such a good shill too..   I'm safe!   What a waste of $   Someone should........   Vatican jesuits? What    And also pushing for unity between twelve nations, all allies.    The nwo is coming... If it doesn't ww3 will come instead      So people overseas don't matter? Outsourcing makes tons of economic sense. Specialization. A global world is our future. Stop screwing poor foreign  people and focus on the rich fuckers..   Sounds hilarious    This should be all over the real news soon if true!!   This sub is honestly not as big on research as you'd think.. Sometimes I get disappointed    The producers of it. Same as natural news benefits from fear mongering and I benefit by pointing out the obvious    Cheaper labor is people too    Heh if you proved it you'd have the story of the century..    yep   why do u require a source for this but not for what op says  because you are biased  but any expat community of dutch people is the obvious source   im not the one who thinks this is the key to unmasking anything  if you really believed that, make it so yourself! figure out his name, and call him.. hell a simple google search might turn his name up..    break up with her   oh nothing to do with all the spying on everyone google does and their NSA connections?? please..   don't do it man, just find a new gf   if she cant quit drinking so much it doesn't matter what you do..   gamut   bankers would let them cancel their debts?   I think it was a genius way, to make it democratic   yea if people ask a scot out in public he can only say yes, right?    Could easily track down the dude..   Fuck borders /r/postnationalist    When Dutch move abroad they also create a "parallel society"   Sounds like the UK    Britain already gave police broad dispersal powers    The government investigated those men heavily.. What did they find?    I mean just because they couldn't model it on computer doesn't mean it didn't happen.. I haven't seen any 911truth computer models either..    In China here, any moron can get a 20$/hour teaching job    YA it's amazing how stupid that statement is    The farm lobby is a government subsidized mess that punishes overseas workers.. I hope chomsky didn't defend the American farmer.. They have enough advocates    If the argument is the US pharmaceutical lobby will gain control in the USA.. I'm very lost    If anything state government is more corrupt..   so fucking what? are we arguing regulations work now? do we believe in our government now?  if you ran a company and suddenly it got outlawed (THINK: UBER), wouldn't you like to have some rights too?   When I ask for a nickel-free earring because I noticed that nickel causes a rash and inflammation on my ear, no one hysterically accuses me of being "anti-earring". When you are evaluating the messages here, which you must do for the sake of your child's health, think about this:   --98% of people who want to get thimerasol out of vaccines are NOT "Anti-Vaccine" they want vaccines to be safer   --And yet, you will notice that there are hysterical straw men arguments made accusing people who want safer vaccines to be 'anti-vaccine'. Start there. Why would ANYONE slam the parent of an autistic or brain-injured child and misrepresent their story and their wish unless they had an either religious fervor about vaccines or a financial interest or a desparate wish to hide the truth? If they are really concerned that people will stop vaccinating if they learn that vaccines have dangerous ingredients, then why not join us in making vaccines safer? There is no explanation for their rabid denial that poisons in vaccines are not a good idea, and their continual misrepresenation of this. Excpet a desparate wish to avoid blame or financial loss. Or simply a desparate wish to be correct.   But what motivates parents of vaccine injured children and environmentalists like RFK Jr? Common sense and dozens of studies you can find in his book. And a wish to never see another babbling child anywhere in the world, become silent, as so many parents of mercury -poisoned have. It's a poison. Its in vaccines. Get it out! Enough said!!!!   at the bare minimum its about pharma contracts   I could never find any actual studies showing much disease from vaccinations except the thimerol stuff..   that's a weird negotiating strategy..   sometimes I admit I get a bit too conspiracy minded, hell I even did holocaust research (6 million jews did not die!) , but im not going to touch flat earth lol.. ive flown so many small airplanes..   if someone could prove this, and it would be fucking easy, every scientist on earth would suddenly shit a brick  its not a conspiracy..   for the flat earth conspiracy to be true, like 50% of humanity and anyone who has ever rode an airplane has to be in on it   Indeed, despite the often-decried undercurrent of Social Darwinism in Heinlein's science fiction, there also exists a significant dallying with transnational political organizations. Heinlein's idealism and pragmatism concerning international relations constantly temper each other, often producing entities that, if not necessarily ideals of charity and brotherhood, at least are not mindless predatory organisms but instead are commonsensical and neighborly. Heinlein seems to suggest - correctly, I believe - that without collective security we could find ourselves at the mercy of the real Social Darwinists.   Heinlein's work with transnational organizations can be grouped into four main categories: the earlier, more idealistic novels such as Space Cadet (1948), which incorporate fairly successful transnational organizations that often attempt not only to keep the peace but to do other good as well, saving lives and protecting individual rights, all the while supported by generally democratic political infrastructures; the later, more cautiously internationalist novels exemplified by Have Space Suit - Will Travel (1958) and Glory Road (1963), wherein organizations consciously limit themselves to an often more pragmatic peacekeeping; the infrequent warnings against governmental intrusion, like Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966); and, of course, the occasional pieces like Farmer in the Sky (1950) and Time for the Stars (1956), which merely employ some basically unexamined form of world government as a conventionalized science fictional backdrop. Though in 1958 Heinlein wrote to his agent decrying the naivete of the "starry-eyed internationalists" who urged disarmament and who longed for a "world state" (Grumbles 210), in his own work Heinlein himself apparently cannot help longing for some sort of transnational peacekeeping entity, albeit often a more practical one.

Welcome to the list    Ya for me watching debunker videos helped.. Lots of the 911truth info is plain wrong    Because China fear mongering    Most Redditors now fall under /r/conspiracy "shill" label; proving how useless it is   (not defending fluoride here)   Aipac would also want it classified if it was saudi too right?    Saudi Arabia    I downloaded all seasons of Steven universe in a day.. Too bad it's a bit childish for me but it's OK!    Because stealth is important vs the Arabs we are bombing..    The  enemy being China, who is happy to watch us waste trillions on this useless plane.    So how do we test for ourselves?   Unless it stresses the hair that's a myth    Also the dude is just making excuses for the status quo    Too late the USA USA circlejerking is in full swing    Oh please. It just happened. Every single news site was bashing the TPP hard, especially reddit.   check what western governments have been doing with that power lately and tell me it doesn't scare you..   /r/postnationalist welcomes you    our government isn't a democracy, if it ever was   as if they haven't suffered enough..   do you think your government cares about you now? let them lose power..

Note: Revocation on these grounds would only apply to persons with dual citizenship, to comply with Canada's obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.  ...   The vast majority of cases (those related to residence fraud, concealing criminal inadmissibility or identity fraud) are decided by the CIC Minister. More exceptional cases, such as those involving war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as cases regarding security, human or international rights violations and organized criminality, would instead be decided by the FC.    /r/postnationalist    K I deleted it already I thought    SHILL accusations are the dumbest... Everyone who disagrees is suddenly a shill    I dunno it's hard to tell what happened without seeing the comment    I watched the British government regulators totally hamstring a couple trying to restore on old castle (TV show) that was completely abandoned before they arrived..

 Schmeichel - Denmark  Rafael -Brazil  Stam - Netherlands  Vidic - Serbia  Irwin - ROI  Ronaldo - Portugal  Bobby Charlton - England  Ryan Giggs - Wales  Best - Northern Ireland  Cantona - France  Law - Scotland   Just going with one from each country for a team, had to make sacrifices like Irwin in over Keane who is obviously the best player we have had from ROI   The 94th time we have signed him in the last 4 years   Jesus my memory is better than I thought, good find    Last I heard and this was about 5 years ago it would cost about 114 million quid to go over the railway. They've said repeatedly it's not feasible at the minute but think it's because it would affect attendance for a bit so they don't want too yet   We have been chronically underfunded for years so we needed some heavy reinvestment, you can't expect brand new players to come in and settle straight away as you know. We got destroyed last year, had pretty much our whole back line leave and got a new manager with a completely new play style. This year was just bedding in, we got the minimum that we set out for, it's disappointing of course but after last year I'm happy   In all fairness city came 9th in 07/08 then spent 125 mil in the summer and then finished 08/09 in 10th so wouldn't really be talking if I were you but I'm sure you know that was all building blocks for the club as ours is.   No it was Liverpool fans last year when they looked set for the title after City   Fellaini, Duncan Ferguson etc I want to play football not get the shit kicked out of me   Kevin Bacon   Supermans first flight in man of steel, it just makes me smile like a child and makes me really happy   Went to school with him, he was so much better than everyone else and we all thought we were the dogs bollocks. He's a top lad and is a great laugh and hope he is doing alright with everything, it's absolutely shit when something like that happens   I was thinking about that myself but I'm going with the experienced head, that and the fact my grandad loved Byrne and said he was our true captain and could play anywhere himself   Pretty much what you said, watch the original trilogy then move onto the prequels. After that you can watch the clone wars which will fill in a bit more for you and marvel are currently doing some comics to add more story. There will also be a book released in a couple of months with more story between the end of 6 and start of 7   Bioshock or Mass Effect   Schmeichel, Roger Byrne at LB, Ferdinand, Bruce, Irwin at RB, Keane, Robson, Charlton, Ronaldo, Best, Law  Bench - VDS, Stam, Vidic, Pallister, RVN, Tommy Taylor, Duncan Edwards  *Edit, changed it to bench instead    Silver Surfer Requiem is a brilliant story   Your all time is not great, should be best, charlton and then argued between law, robson, keane   Sucker Punch, brilliant soundtrack for a sadly rubbish film  	18

 According to this I should have been a hairdresser. Go figure.      Good neighborhood is relative. What are you looking for in a neighborhood? Same for gyms. Nice might mean something different to us.   Not everyone has a nice car and not everyone who has a nice car actually lives here. San Diego is a big place so it looks like everyone has a nice car. And don't forget that you can lease a Beemer pretty cheaply.   Roommates definitely help and I know a lot of people who have them. You can find places pretty reasonably but you have to look around. You can find stuff on the beach for your $1k or less but you'll have to drive around looking for signs and check out craigslist.   Good stuff. Not enough people know of this band.

 the nuclear buildup??   totally get you. I wish that you find a doctor, who somehow finds a way to prescribe some ..well for me it was a type of antibiotic...while billing for some 'approved' condition.  totally illegal..~sigh~don't look here yea robots!   oh wow, I know her brothers!   If there is a spelling nazi god, you are fucked. Again, apparently.   while in his car.   that actually sucks, and I would suggest you visit a medical doctor is you are able. There are a lot of assorted treatments, many by prescription only (in US). You have likely tried over the counter solutions, so maybe try to see a doctor.  Edit: oh shoot forgot where I was.

In the event that Iran was to not finalize the agreement, they will have in place an air defense system which will ...inhibit... the ability of, for instance, Israel, USA and Saudi Arabia to respond to a buildup of nuclear weaponry by Iran.  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32139753   Don't forget the older article: http://rt.com/news/234855-russia-iran-missiles-deal/   seconded by this little series of statements?:  "The Russian defence ministry said it was ready to supply the S-300 equipment "promptly", an official there said, quoted by Interfax."...

I also love how in the Peru case "the study found that reviving amunas would be by far the cheapest option, costing less than a hundredth as much as water from the city's new desalination plant."   The results being seen in the India case are remarkable.   I'm quietly obsessing over the 'Pre-Inca canals may solve Lima's water crisis' article today.    The idea is to build a timelag into the hydrological system, delaying water run-off for weeks or even months until it benefits water supply in the dry season, hydrologist Bert De Bivre tells New Scientist. http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27311-preinca-canals-may-solve-limas-water-crisis.html#.VSszS_nF-jC   I'm liking the johads too.   http://qz.com/367875/an-ancient-technology-is-helping-indias-water-man-save-thousands-of-parched-villages/  http://www.siwi.org/prizes/stockholmwaterprize/laureates/2015-2/       Conclusions  Based on the available data, and using internationally accepted methods to assess the evidence with the most appropriate analytical techniques, WHO concludes:  1. Caesarean sections are effective in saving maternal and infant lives, but only when they are required for medically indicated reasons.  2. At population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% are not associated with reductions in maternal and newborn mortality rates.  3. Caesarean sections can cause significant and sometimes permanent complications, disability or death particularly in settings that lack the facilities and/or capacity to properly conduct safe surgery and treat surgical complications. Caesarean sections should ideally only be undertaken when medically necessary.  4. Every effort should be made to provide caesarean sections to women in need, rather than striving to achieve a specific rate.  5. The effects of caesarean section rates on other outcomes, such as maternal and perinatal morbidity, paediatric outcomes, and psychological or social well-being are still unclear. More research is needed to understand the health effects of caesarean section on immediate and future outcomes. "  WHO proposes the Robson classification system as a global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing caesarean section rates within healthcare facilities over time, and between facilities. In order to assist healthcare facilities in adopting the Robson classification, WHO will develop guidelines for its use, implementation and interpretation, including standardization of terms and definitions.

There is another reported incident from February, " An investigation is underway after six quokkas were found dead in plastic plant protectors at an island camp ground about 8pm on Monday February 23."   http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/hunt-on-for-rottnest-island-quokka-killers-20150225-13owhi.html  Very weird. Does this island attract future serial killers?  oh jeez worse. "From August 1838 ten Aboriginal prisoners were sent to Rottnest Island (known as Wadjemup to the Noongar, possibly meaning "place across the water"[8]). After a short period when both settlers and prisoners occupied the island, the Colonial Secretary announced in June 1839 that the island would become a penal establishment for Aboriginal people and, between 1838 and 1931, Rottnest Island was used as a prison to transfer Aboriginal prisoners "overseas". "It has been estimated that there may be as many as 369 Aboriginal graves on the island, of which five were for prisoners who were hanged."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noongar  omg and then it was a boys reformatory! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottnest_Island#Aboriginal_prison  too much creepy history in one spot.

So sorry this has happened again to you Kenya, my sympathies.     Climate Change, Water, and Risk Current Water Demands Are Not Sustainable  Climate change will have a significant impact on the sustainability of water supplies in the coming decades. A new analysis, performed by consulting firm Tetra Tech for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), examined the effects of global warming on water supply and demand in the contiguous United States. The study found that more than 1,100 counties -- one-third of all counties in the lower 48 -- will face higher risks of water shortages by mid-century as the result of global warming. More than 400 of these counties will face extremely high risks of water shortages  http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/watersustainability/   So you're saying that we should never buy the floor models??

Just making sure I'm reading this right:)     I have been following this, and went hunting in here , and lo   behold, you linked!  ty!   "... Ms. Pao, it emerged in testimony, compiled a resentment chart of colleagues who, she believed, wronged her. People worked through holidays and maternity leaves. The pressure to discover the newest new thing was immense.

Or were they arguing about what type of rice is the best?  Idk, this is very sad.   The mother and another brother (age 18) were not at home. I hope the 16yo will recover well, and go on to lead a wonderful life; the mom   elder brother as well.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/25/food-argument-leaves-2-brothers-dead-1-wounded/70467588/  Edit to add that I really! hope that the gun did not belong to any of the children. IDC, if this was the parent(s) loaded gun that did this, let them suffer. I just really hope it was neither the 18 nor 16 year old's.   crap, you mean I need to look again and not back out after the annoying captions? crap. taking a deep breath...cul  edit: was worth it:)   I have learned to despise emojis somehow.

Also from comments:   Mads Nielsen 1 year ago  "Thank's for uploading the amateur film, filmed by the American tourist Benjamin Gasul during his visit to Europe in spring 1939. Benjamin Gasul visited Warsaw in early May 1939, and filmed in one of the streets in the old Jewish quarter in Warsaw, about four  months before the German attack on Poland on September 1, 1939. Benjamin Gasul was born into a Jewish family in Riga in 1898, and emmigrated to USA. in 1910's."

Date of movie: May of 1939 Date of German nazi invasion on Poland: September of 1939 In the moment which is presented in movie there were NO ghetto in Warsaw. I would appreciate if You look on Warsaw Ghetto history at YadVashem Institute website: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/03/warsaw.asp  In that time (presented at movie) Polish Jews were living in all sites of our tolerant community. Jewish and Polish people where living, studying and making businesses together. And Polish people are the biggest worldwide group helping Jews in World War II, look again at website of YadVashem...: http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp  In our country (only in Poland and Yugoslavia in occupied Europe) helping Jews was endangered by inmediate death penalty to all members of family helping Jews (by giving shelter food or whatever).

Perhaps they capped the coverage.   She was working in the field. Supposedly it was part of her employees benefit package.   I can't come to a conclusion one way or the other.   She was born in Germany, but attended high school in USA   was working in job in which I think she would have needed good language skills.

It did send me off of a wiki journey where I have learned something about steatopygia, elongated labia, Saartjie Baartman, and the Khoikhoi people.    All morbidly interesting, though I may need a drink now.    Holy smokes.  A 5 year old found the baby. To me this the worst part, as horrible as it all is.    "the baby's body was found on the kitchen counter by a 5-year-old relative who was dropped off to wait for his bus to school.   The knife used on the baby was found placed in the dead baby's hand, Deters said."   I like 'OK'.  No one really knows... this is an interesting obituary, of the etymologist who, "FOR much of his long career studying language Allen Read sought the origin of OK"     "Mr Read showed how, stage by stage, OK was spread throughout North America and the world to the moon, and then took on its new form AOK, first used by space people and frowned on by purists. This being an exercise in the academic world, there remain some doubters. Some believe that the Boston newspaper's reference to OK may not be the earliest. Some are attracted to the claim that it is of American-Indian origin. There is an Indian word, okeh, used as an affirmative reply to a question. Mr Read treated such doubting calmly. Nothing is absolute, he once wrote,nothing is forever. http://www.economist.com/node/1403400   My high history teacher told us it was a password for the underground railroad.   I guess people that do these sort of bizarre things are geniuses?  No idea.    If it was a white or Asian teacher referring to a black student with the 'n' word every time she called on him in class,  would you be satisfied with a 5 day suspension???  Editing to add I am happy that the kid was unfamiliar with these slurs. Thankfully he had not experienced that particular reference (raghead taliban) prior to encountering this genius of a 'teacher'.   First encounters with blatant racism can be pretty traumatic. I will be surprised if the parents don't file a suit in civil court for damages.   I find the story sad actually. her husband dies before the baby is born,  then So as to protect myself from men and the harshness of their looks and being targeted by them due to traditions, I decided to be a man  and dressed in their clothes and worked alongside them in other villages where no one knows me.  The daughter marries, husband  has something happen which leaves him unable to work, so grandma is continuing to work to support them all   the grand kids.    look at the actual article. It isn't this simple.   no that's some quality 5 head..maybe a 6.   souls for sale??   I must have missed that in my outrage, it's too soon for me to look again though. Hope whatever your dad is doing helps and does no harm.   yes! and shore up Alaska.    	137

 I agree. The most effective change needs to be done on the State level. Which is how our country is supposed to work. We do not need a larger federal government making general policies for everyone without understand what effects it has on individual local economies. Everyones needs are different. Plus I do not think we grasp the problem enough to implement broad federal changes at this point.. Things need to be done on the state level and done with what is best for that States environment. The problem with this is citizens always try to make change on the federal level. The biggest impact we can have is starting local and seeing what works best for individual communities. Things that work will translate into general public policy.    I agree. Its the nature of the beast. Automation will reign supreme in manufacturing. at some point.   I apologize if I took your comment wrong. But increasing minimum wage overnight would be very damaging to the bottom line. I would love to increase pay for all of our workers. But there has to be a realistic option that would not cause businesses to close their doors or leave communities jobless because all companies have pulled out. It has to be a slow and methodical change. We just cant add millions of dollars to our costs overnight and not expect a catastrophic event.    You seem to have no grasp on reality. If 1000 people lose their jobs that will be a much larger drain on the community than having people work, pay taxes, be provided health insurance, retirement plans (which we match), etc. Take that away and the local economy would be drained from all of the extra social services and less tax revenue. Tell your local commissioners to have all companies like mine shut there doors. Then come back and tell me what happens to your economy once this happens. You think its bad now it would be catastrophic doing things your way.    I am not forcing anyone to keep their job. They choose to stay here and work. If they can find a better job or higher paying job whats stopping them from going to get it? I am not keeping them here against their will. Most of our employees are happy with their jobs. Plus we susbsidize our employees healthcare. Which costs us $millions$ a month. A MONTH. They pay a 1/4 of the total cost of their health insurance because we subsidize it for them. Like a lot of companies do.   So you think the almost 1000 people we employ would be able to find another job when we are one of the largest employers in our region? lol It would just cause even worse conditions for people in the local economy. And I am not forcing anyone to work for me. They choose to work for us because we provide them with a job. Which is better than no job? Welcome to the world economy. Welcome to the giant sucking sound. Welcome to reality.   I agree that automation will kill lots of jobs. Increasing wages forcefully will only accelerate the idea of automation. Businesses have to continue to create their products. We are a world economy and a balance must be met to compete. If Americans want higher wages that just means less jobs. So take your pick. Less pay more jobs or more pay less jobs. That is the reality.    If my company went out of business almost 1000 people would lose their jobs and there is nothing in this area that would be able to fill them. So tell me how that would benefit the local economy or the overall economy? We are in the process of eliminating jobs with automation because margins are so thin as it is. You do realize US manufacturers have to compete with 3rd world countries correct? So we have to keep a balance or people will lose their jobs and be even worse off. This is not black and white. You cant just say *increase wages* and it not cause a ripple effect.    We are. We are in the process of transition. Our company has increased automation by almost 20% in the last 5 years.   No it wont. If I were to increase pay it would wipe out my margins leaving me selling my product at a loss and eventually shutting our doors. That would help the economy correct? Us shutting our doors taking health subsidies, jobs, and state federal taxes with it. Thats what you think is good for the economy?   They are laborers. Labor is a direct business cost.    My company doesnt provide a benefit? lol If my company went out of business almost 1000 people would lose their jobs and there is nothing in this area that would be able to fill them. So they would become an even more drain on the social system than they already are. If they want to make more money. They need to go get training and learn a skill that demands more money. And if increasing worker pay causes inflation to the point where the increase in pay is depleted by inflation cost in goods purchased then they would be in the same place they are now. Still requiring subsidies. On top of that my company pays out $millions$ in healthcare costs to subsidize the employees healthcare. Just like many businesses do. If we did not subsidize their healthcare they would be an even bigger drain on  social services.    I can only pay what my company can afford. Businesses are in business to make money. Just like employees get up and go to work to make money. We pay our skilled laborers a decent wage.   This is exactly what is happening or going to happen. Working smarter = less employees and more automation. So what would be the point of increasing wages if less people would be getting a wage? How does that help? We already pay our skilled workers a decent wage.    Yes they are. This is why we are seeing manufacturing move to places like Vietnam or Mexico.   Exactly. Increasing the minimum wage will only accelerate this from a Manufacturing standpoint.    "Skilled" laborers make more than minimum wage. Machinists, electricians, plc programmers, etc. are paid above minimum wage for their skill.    They wont pay more. If you force a company like mine to increase pay which hurts the company, we will just move our operations overseas and no one will have a job that relies on my company to provide for their family. We have done everything we could the last 6 years to decrease costs and compete with China. Increased labor costs would push us over the edge and require us to move our operations to keep our customers. Customers will not pay more if they know they can go somewhere else and get it cheaper. Which would happen.   Well I can only speak from a manufacturing standpoint. And if I remember correctly we are trying to ramp up manufacturing in the States. This would cause us to lose out to countries with lower labor costs. The only heavy turnover I get is from people that just don't like to show up to work. Workers cant go get a better paying job doing the same thing at other manufacturers either. Cause they are in the same boat as me. We are actually replacing workers with machines to increase productivity. I will not create work ethic for someone else. If they want a job and work hard they will get hired. If they do well I will look for ways to promote them.    Inflating cost of goods to give people more money is inflation. The same people I just gave the raise to would pay more for the products they were buying. Depleting any raise I gave them. Aside from that it would cause my company to lose business to manufacturers in other countries like China that have lower labor costs.    I know the company I work for is the only manufacturer in the United States for the product we make. If we were to increase costs it would force our customers to look at manufacturing from other countries. We have done all we can to compete with other countries as it is. Increasing costs would cut our legs out from underneath us.   Kind of hard to cut costs when you have already done that. The recession caused manufacturers to run lean and thin. They are already running lean and thin. Not much more room to cut.   My margins are almost non-existent. What little profit we do make we use to increase production capacity or hire new workers when demand increases. With an increase in direct labor costs I would no longer be able to do that. In fact it would cause me to sell my product at a loss resulting in possible closure of my operation.    I can tell you from experience. I manage a company that manufacturers goods. If I was forced to increase direct labor costs, with the thin margins I am already at, it would cause me to let workers go or increase the costs of my goods.    No one said it is the only cause of inflation. It will just cause more inflation. Its apparent no one in this thread has ever owned or managed a business. You cant just pull money out of thin air. Companies have to compensate for this increase in labor costs. They will do this by letting workers go or increasing prices on their goods. This is basic economics. This will be passed on to the consumer.          It will cause inflation.   Inflation      I miss 'Dubya'.    Shits about to go down... Putin style.

"I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.      This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but, in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.      The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of public liberty."

  They make it sound like every actor, musician, painter, or other artist has it easy. Well guess what, it's the same in the other entertainment industries.   I think it's wrong to act like some periods aren't better or worse for different types of art. Musicians income peaked in the 80s or 90s and has been plummeting. Authors have been doing much worse over the past 15 years and advances are shrinking.   Just because it's always "hard" doesn't mean it can't get harder or there can't be fewer spots.   Being a tenured professor at a top college was always hard, but in the 70s or 80s there were far more tenure track spots. Now 70% of all classes are taught by low-paid adjuncts.   Point being: things change.    collection society?                      No, I don't think art or reading are wasting time. As opposed to what? TV? Candy Crush? broadway shows?   Not all of life can be working, eating, and sleeping. Books are a great combination of both entertainment and enlightenment.    fantastic book, one of my favorite story collections                                 To each their own, but I started with Blood Meridian and loved it. Then read Pretty Horses and thought it was only pretty good. Basically, the lush, biblical, southern gothic language of all of McCarthy's works up through Blood Meridian does much more for me than the sparse Hemingwayish later works.                          How in the world are "non-aware-of-puppy-nomination" authors "tarred by association"? I thought only idiots did the guilt-by-association thing?  If you win an award because of a faulty, rigged, or otherwise bad voting process then your win is tainted. I don't think that's unfair to say (if you agree the vote was rigged at least)      oh come on. The book in a bookstore is the same book as the one on amazon. And you already know the price will be higher in the bookstore before you go in. So browsing in a bookstore and then buying it when you get home on you computer is nothing like "compare and contrast" shopping, or even in seeing different prices (something people normally do online)   It's pretty shitty in all those cases too, but the difference is, I think, that with those things you can often buy from the same company. You try on a J. Crew suit, order the suit size later online. It helps J. Crew either way.   But ordering from Amazon actively undermines bookstores.    I wouldn't go as far as shoplifting, but it's definitely kind of shitty. If you enjoy what bookstores provide, you should support them monetarily. Taking what you like from bookstores (browsing, live readings, etc.), then spending your money elsewhere is a sure way to make those bookstores go out of business.

James Tiptree Jr. is an obvious example.   Here's an article though:   http://io9.com/5077952/women-who-pretended-to-be-men-to-publish-scifi-books  "Women Who Pretended to Be Men to Publish Scifi Books"   The fact that there have always been some female SF writers doesn't mean there aren't more now or, as you yourself note, many were kept out and forced to write under pen names.             This is pedantic, but the site tags the article "FANTASY" and it mostly seems to be about fantasy, yet the title says "storming the male citadels of sci-fi."   Anyway, agree there are lots of great SF/F women writers these days.       eHow videos   Oh yeah I agree. But it seems to me kind of like the GOP establishment and the Tea Party. The SP's encouraged Day/Wright/rapid puppies at first and now are kind of shocked that they took over, and try to separate themselves.     Definitely authors complain about marketing, but the fact that so many are dismissive of house loyalty is something that I think is a shift in the recent 5-10 years.  I dunno, I never got the impression that authors were super loyal to their specific publisher in the past. For one thing, editors and publicists move around frequently, so the houses aren't stable either. There's no real reason to stick with a specific Big 5 imprint if the money is the same.   I'd would be more interesting to see how many authors would opt to stick with their current editor.     Wright and Beale are different matters, of course - but Wright wasn't an organizer of the effort, and Beale had his own effort going.  Yes but... Correia and Torgensen nominated Beale last year and Wright this year, and seemed to take delight in having people like that get hugo nominations. (hard to believe they could seriously think those two are actually among the most deserving SF writers...) So they are hardly innocent for the results.          Come on, the Sad/Rabid puppies gave a record six nominations to John C. Wright and 9 to a brand new and poorly regarded publishing house run by Vox Day.   Do you really think that Wright is the greatest living SF writer and Castalia House the best SF publisher around?   This wasn't about the stories, it was about getting themselves and their friends on the Hugo ballot and "sticking it to the SJWs" (at least for the Rabid puppies)      Didn't Birdman win the Oscar and not Boyhood?       It's totally bizarre to me that people get so made about literary or artistic work winning awards over formulaic popcorn movies or beach read novels. Isn't the whole point of awards to highlight the best, boundary pushing work?   Bestsellers already, well, sell the best and make tons of money. They don't need awards too.                It's not uncommon, how much are they offering? Publishers use paintings and photographs for book covers all the time   True, except the SP nominated work Vox published, so they associated themselves with him.    According to this: http://file770.com/?p=21708   the Rabid Puppies placed more candidates than the Sad Puppies, so it seems they had more support. (Unless it was all in the categories with low votes overall)  You can say he's a random quack, but then how did he get 9 noms for his publishing house, 6 for his author, and another 2 for himself? Plus other ones that weren't on the SP slate? (And why did SP nominate works he's edited?)  I don't see how stating the facts of who got nominated suggests I'm a conspiracy theorist. What conspiracy? Vox Day openly campaigned for those nominations, nothing hidden about it.   note: I am NOT suggesting that Vox set anything up at the beginning. I'm suggesting that he jumped on the SP bandwagon, but pulled in a bunch of other voters to get himself and his publishing house a ton of nominations.    This was something Larry covered excellently himself. SP predates gamergate, but that doesn't stop the claims.  Well my understanding is that some SP and RP supporters did reach out to GG types, and there were a flood of new voters this year. So Larry himself may actively dislike GG and may have had nothing to do with it, but that doesn't mean that the Sad Puppies campaign overall didn't.   It's like if GOP presidential nominee hates homophobic evangelical Christians, but the GOP supporters drive tons of them to vote... can you not say that the Republican party is associated with homophobic christians?    Didn't Correia's sad puppies thing fail the last two years, and only succeeded this year with Vox Day?   I guess it's hard to know who brought in more votes though   I don't like that either unless the ideology is currupting the work. Like, someone like Ayn Rand, to me at least, reads very poorly as fiction. Her characters are all flat and clear representations of her opponents, and then the characters that represent her viewpoint just go on 50 page lectures about the benefits of her philosophy.   But if someone writers a great book, but outside of the work has bad opinions, I still read them. Hell, I love HP Lovecraft and he was a big racist.    glad we are mostly on the same page :)      But Vox Day's publishing house has 11 nominations! (9 for works, 2 for him as editor). Call him a quack, but he's dominating the nominees this year.          I will say though, that I know what you are getting at. There are people who think that women should be nominated 50% of the time every year, etc. I think that's extreme... because the quality of work isn't constant (and probably 50% of SF writers aren't women) So I'm not one of those, but I do think that systematic bias exists and that when the nominees are almost always men or always white year after year, that's not a great sign.    I mean, I don't think there's a static number. Women are 50% of the population. Does that mean that women should be 50% of the nominees? Not necesssarily. If it was 30% one year, 40% the next, 25% the next, 60% after that... that seems right.   But if it's 15% or less year after year after year it's a problem.   So I dont' think it's about the numbers in a specific year, but over time.    I just have a hard time believing that's the case. Like, I'd be interested in an official survey of political beliefs over hugo nominees in the past 10 years. I doubt that there haven't been some conservatives.   I definitely think the SP are 100% wrong when they claim that the Hugos have become "more liteary" and "less popular" and that their picks are the "popular" picks of fandom. It was posted in one of these threads, but the official bookscan sales numbers show the Sad Puppy authors doing worse in sales than the "literary" authors they decry.    I don't believe there should be quotas. I think there's a difference between calling out racial bias and instituting official quotas, you know?            You asked me:   Follow up question, if we disallow writers from being nominated based off their skin color isn't that discrimination?  And I said I don't believe that. No one shoudl be "disallowed" because of any skin color. But... why are you asking that? no one is saying white people should be disallowed, nor are the hugos at risk of losing white nominees... they've been almost entirely white every year since the Hugo was founded.    What does their skin color have to do with the quality of their writing?  You are looking at it wrong. It's not that skin color determines quality, it's that a third of the US is non-white. The MAJORITY of the world is non-white. So if you are only nominating white people, that means you aren't really reading the breadth of literature out there.    I actually don't care at all if a bunch of conservatives want to say "Hey, we should vote for more of the work we like!"   But, it's pretty absurd for someone like Vox Day to bring in tons of outside voters, apparently from GamerGate, to get his brand new publishing house to get 9 nominations plus 2 for himself as editor.   Honestly, all politics aside, ANY publishing house that isn't like... the biggest one around having that many nominations means the votes are tainted. Don't you think?    We've covered this in other parts here, but   A) I don't think that "everyone who isn't a conservative Christian Anglo-American" is part of the same political disposition! There is a huge range of ideologies, political opinions, and stances outside of Christian UK/US conservatisim. So... I don't buy that the Hugos weren't diverse politically before, nor do I buy that the SP slate is politically diverse.   b) Even having said the above, most Hugo nominees are not writing political fiction! And most probably aren't especially political themselves.    The Sad Puppies CLAIM their list is very diverse. I'm saying that's just a lie. It isn't diverse.   Your other questions are much larger, but not something I'm addressing there. If the Sad Puppies want to say that their 90% male, nearly 100% white list represents the best fiction regardless of politics that's fine. We can debate that. But don't pretend the list is diverse because you put a few token women and non-whites on it.  I'm obviously not suggesting that white men be disallowed from nomination! That's a weird straw man. I think it's bad for a major award to be almost entirely white men, but I'm cerrtainly not saying there should be NO white men.    I don't know what the EW story originally said, but it is nonsense that the Sad Puppies are claiming their list is really diverse. Look at it yourself:   https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/  Best Novel: all white men  Best Novella: all white men  Best Novelette: all men, 4/5 white  etc.   I only count 7 women (one listed twice) on their ENTIRE slate of 50+ names.   If they want to say no one should think about gender or race or anything when voting, fine. But don't pretend that a list almost entirely made of up white American males has racial or gender diversity.    There's a bit of confusion about all this because there are three lists: The actual Hugo nominees, the Sad Puppies ballot, and the Rabid Pubbies ballot.   I said that the actual nominees were largely conservative white men, with Wright getting six nominations and a brand new publishing house, run by Vox Day, getting 9. That's 100% true.   The Rabid Puppies list was done by Vox Day, who is openly racist and was kicked out of the SFWA for calling a black author a "half-savage" and other things. His list was not diverse in the least.   The Sad Puppies list was slightly more diverse... but only slightly. I think it's funny that the SP got EW to issue a correction, but we can actually judge the diversity for ourselves:   https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/02/01/sad-puppies-3-the-2015-hugo-slate/  The Best Novel category is 5 white men. (Note: some people on reddit have been saying Correia is Latino. He's a white american of Portuguese descent)  Best Novella is 3 white men.   Best Novellete is 4 white men and one non-white man.   So... no, the Sad Puppies are not diverse. There isn't a single woman until the fourth category, and there are a only a handful of non-white authors on the whole list.    I hear you BUT what's funny/sad about all this is... the Hugos really haven't been that diverse. Like, just glancing at the last 10 of best novel winners it appears to be:   10 white authors, 7 of which are men  100% white and 70% men is hardly affirmative action quota land.   I'm also pretty positive the film and TV awards have been super white and male too. Granted, it's likely the case that the Hugos are more diverse than 100% whiteness if you get into some of the smaller awards like short story or novellete, but we are a LONG way away from racial quotas or non-white authors even being mathematically represented to their size of the population.  Basically, it seems like the Puppies are fighting a non-existent problem.    Here's the data on SP vs. RP for what it is worth:   http://file770.com/?p=21708   SAD PUPPIES 3: Recommended 60 nominees; 51 made the final ballot and 9 did not.   RABID PUPPIES 2015: Recommended 67 nominees; 58 made the final ballot and 9 did not.   A total of 61 nominees from both slates made the final ballot.  This consists of 48 items recommended by both lists; 3 items only on Sad Puppies; and 10 only on Rabid Puppies.    If the conservatives had a great year then they should reap the rewards of their hard work  Sure... but that's not what happened here. Vox Day and co went outside of the normal voters and got a bunch of new people to vote who most likely didn't read any of the books/works. (The voting numbers increased a bunch.)  It's not like there were some acclaimed big conservative books. Rather, a bunch of totally obscure books that didn't sell many copies got on because of outside voting to "fuck with the social justice warriors"    I think they'll have a pretty hard time winning them, though.  Several of the categories are 100% Sad or Rabid puppies though, so either they win or get "No Award"   Heh, I copy and pasted the title but it's about a 2015 award for 2014 books   I gotta question the idea that the Hugos have been completely dominated by "a single definable political skew."   I can buy that the Hugos have maybe been slightly left leaning, but there is a HUGE swatch of ground between "social libertarian who is okay with gay marriage," "centrist Democrat" and the anarcho-anti-capitalism of like China Mieville. Like there are huge historic ideologies that fit in that range.   I also think most of these writers that get nominated are not especially political.   It seems like basically a lot of SF writers think there should be more gender balance and more racial diversity. That's not a horribly political stance... women make up half the population, and like 30%+ of americans are non-white.    Okay, in all seriousness, what percentage of NA ancestry does Vox Day even claim?  And also, in all seriousness, even if VD was full-blooded NA, if you call black people "savages" and shit you are racist. Doesn't matter your own racial background.     You are quoting someone else there, but this year's nominees were largely conservative white men who write really preachy christian/right wing fiction.   As to their aesthetic diversity... I can't say I've gotten far enough in to compare, but when SIX nominations to go Wright and NINE to go one publishing house, I doubt it's horribly diverse on that level either.    I doubt he really has much Native American ancestry AND poc can certainly be racist.   (claiming to have some tiny fraction of native american blood is really common among Americans of all political stripes, but this dude is lily white: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Vox_Day_by_Tracy_White_promo_pic.jpg/220px-Vox_Day_by_Tracy_White_promo_pic.jpg)   The RP's won though. Wright is on there 6 times. Vox Day's publishing house is on there 9.    Again, see my post above. The Sad Puppies didn't win this year. The RABID Puppies did, and their slate was openly racist and decidedly not diverse.   The Rabid Puppies and Sad Puppies slates overlapped somewhat, but the RP slate performed far better.    This year's nominees are decidedly less diverse than previous years. They made it less diverse.    The Nebula's are more like Cannes.    This is a great summary BUT you are missing a huge piece of the puzzle.   This year Vox Day, an openly racist and sexist (talks about blacks as subhuman, advocates assaulting women) guy ran a "rabid puppy" slate full of   A) openly racist or extreme right wingers  B) himself and his friends  (A and B completely overlap of course)  It was actually Vox Day's  slate that dominated the Hugo's not the Sad Puppy one. For example, Vox Day is on there twice, his author Wright is on there 6 times, and his publishing house is on there like 10 times.   I imagine even Torgersen and Correia are embarrassed by Vox Day   The Sad Puppies group say that it is odd that their motives are considered to be racism or conservatism, given that they recommended works by authors with diverse racial and political background.  Right, but what I said above is what everyone on both "sides" is missing. Correia and Torgersen's slate might have been pretty white and male, but at least somewhat diverse. But the Rabid Puppy slate was decidedly not. It was conservative, racist, and almost purely white. People are making a mistake conflating the Vox Day victory with Correia, but Correia and co are being silly pretending that the Hugo nominees aren't fully of extreme conservatives this year thanks to Rabid Puppies.       In addition to the density thing, keep in mind that most books that get adapted are GREAT books (well... nowadays it's often just shitty bestsellers like 50 Shades or Twilight, but in decades past).   So if the books are all great, the adaptations have a high bar to pass.   There are some movies that are almost universally thought of as better though:   * Jaws * The Godfather * The Shining (okay this is debatable, but...) * Psycho * and so on  But a lot of people dont' even realize that Psycho or Jaws were novels, because the movie is so much more famous                  It's always been hard to be an artist in any field, but that doesn't mean it isn't HARDER in some eras than others.    I think hipsters read YA now      Lol. Have you actually looked at it?  First category: all white men Second category: all white men Third category: all men, 3/4ths white  So diverse!    What you aren't understanding is that Correia's Sad Puppies slate didn't win. Vox Day's Rabid Puppies slate did: http://voxday.blogspot.com/2015/02/rabid-puppies-2015.html  Rabid Puppies had Wright on 6 times. He won six nominations.   Compare the link I just posted to what won. It was Vox Day, an open racist, whose slate won. Not Correia.                   The Baron in the Trees by Italo Calvino      haha      lol, my "side"? Not only do I think the side thing is silly, I actually think the Sad Puppies are exactly wrong. They claim that too many literary books are winning over fun, popular books... I think the exact opposite is the case.   In recent years, the Hugos for best novel have gone to JK Rowling, Neil Gaiman twice, and John Scalzi, among other super popular middlebrow writers.  (And the movie and TV awards are obivously dominated by the most popular fare)   yeah it's a clear catholic allegory. But I, too, enjoy it.    The desire here to claim SF doesn't have a huge political tradition is just bizarre. Wells, Le Guin, Heinlein, Banks... so many of the biggest names and biggest franchises/properties (Star Trek anyone?) have been overtly political.    Not really. Honestly, I rarely read a second book by an author I do like! So many other authors out there.   That said, I can imagine really loving parts of an author (their style, sense of humor, whatever) and not parts of a specific book (setting, plot, etc.) that would make me think they'd be worth another shot. Also, if the first book I read was their debut and they were known for their latter books.    In this way he's kind of like the Stephen King of fantasy (even though King does fantasy too).   If you are a casual reader, King is like the only name in Horror that you'll know. Similarly, Gaiman is like the only name in whimsical fantasy for standalone books.    He's good at what he does, but he also doens't have much competition  if you are trying to figure his popularity. Fantasy is totally dominated by gigantic multi-book series of high fantasy battles, wizards, and elves. Game of Thrones, Wheel of Time, Harry Potter, Sanderson, etc.   Gaiman does one-off books and story collections that combine fantasy, myth, and British wit. His books are fun, but have some standards "deep" threads to make them seem literary.   if you want a fun standalone Fantasy-tinged novel, where else can you turn? I'm sure there are others and maybe people will name them in replies, but none as famous as Gaiman for the casual reader.    Isn't he the guy responsible for most of the nominations? I mean, he got two for himself and 9 for his personal press. Plus more for his personal friends. He's at the center of all this.    Libraries have films, and way more people pirate TV and film than books. I'd bet a much smaller percentage of books are read via library than film/TV/music via piracy.    Scalzi never had a slate he told people to vote for that I'm aware of. And certainly no "slate' form Scalzi or anyone else ended up dominated entire nominations from multiple categories. Someone in another thread said 68% of the Hugo picks this year were from the Sad Puppies or Rabid Puppies slates. That's crazy! It would be even higher if it wasn't for the TV and movie awards that get a lot more votes.     Most of the "liberals" being railed against by the SP types are white males (Scalzi, Wendig, etc.). Being a white male doesn't mean you are are conservative or liberal.    Local book store.   Weir will likely make the same cut no matter where you buy, but increased sales of his book mean he'll get more money in an advance for his next book, and mean more SF books of similar ilk will get published.     I'm guessing he has never worked a minute of labor in his life.  You sure seem quick to judge someone whose life you know nothing about    I agree that at least this slate doesn't seem to be making the sales argument,   Also the slate that won was really the Vox Day slate that was mostly just himself and his publishing house's works. So... hard to read it as anything other than self-aggrandizement.    Ancillary was a pretty big seller for a SF book though. It was definitely a popular book. It also won or was shortlisted for a ton of other awards and got of mainstream acclaim.   I've never read it. But it doesn't seem like a good example of an obscure, dense book that mainstream audiences couldn't like and isn't well written getting triumphed over better popular stuff.    Sure, but I guess what I'm saying is that "literary merit" vs. "popular appeal" would actually be an interesting argument to have, but sadly that's not what we are having here. SP's aren't promoting popular work, but unpopular work that aligns with their politics.   The literary vs. popular is an argument worth having though.    I think you are right that a dramatic increase in voting would mitigate the problem by virtue of everyone simply voting for the 2-3 mainstream names that had books that year. But that's not a great solution either. The point of awards, from my point of view, is to bring attention to fantastic work that may not have had great sales.   We don't really need a Hugo that only goes to Neil Gaiman/Martin/Rowling/King type authors.    I'd really like to read Don Quixote   Well i've seen some evidence that they went to GG to recruit but either way, the point is that Vox Day and co brought in a bunch of new voters to flood the ballots. Which is, of course, their right under the current rules.    Yeah it predates the internet for sure. I believe it used to just be people who attended WorldCon, but then they opened it up to anyone who paid a fee (40 bucks currently I think) to vote.    yeah and this year a group actively recruited people who have never voted or cared about the Hugos before, often from Gamergate forums, to vote. The number of votes needed to be nominated increased a bunch this year thanks to influx of new voters.    I didn't read Lock-in and don't read Scalzi. I'm just saying that the popular SF/F books that sold well were left off the Hugos and the Sad Puppy slate.    The Three-Body Problem, Station Eleven, Annihilation... crazy all three of those were left off. Three-Body not only was totally beloved, but was pretty widely read (sold more than the SP books). And Station Eleven and Annihilation were HUGE sellers as well as highly acclaimed.          Good picks!   This is mostly right, but two things:    push a progressive or preachy message in lieu of good storytelling  No one can read the SP slate stories and think they are against preachy storytelling. They just want preachy storytelling that preaches their POV   Popular authors who didn't push a progressive message were being shut out of nominations.  The authors on the Sad Puppy slate are not popular, except Jim Butcher who likely would have been nominated anyway. Just factually, their books don't sell well: http://www.jasonsanford.com/blog/2015/4/yes-people-do-read-the-novels-up-for-the-hugo-and-nebula-awards   but the Sad Puppies slate isn't diverse in any sense. Look at the nominees: not only is it a ton of white men with conservative views, it's all the same publishing houses (Castalia House has nine nominations) and even authors (John C. Wright has six nominations)    It's exactly the opposite of a campaign to vote for their friends or to a political movement.   OK, one of the main organizers was Vox Day, although he called his slate Rabid Puppies. Vox Day was nominated in two categories and his publishing house Castalia House had NINE nominations.   How can you say it's not about getting friends or themselves on the ballot when Castalia House had an insane nine nominations? And friend John C. Wright had an insane six nominations?      If people want a broader spectrum of nominations, then the solution is to get out there and nominate the stories   people you think are good.  Not really in practice. In practice, everyone nominating different stories they truly loved means that small political voting blocs, like the Sad Puppies, can completely dominate. The actual solution is to have rival voting blocs so the SP can only get one or two noms on in each category, while the other voting blocs each get one or two as well.   But, really, the solution is to change the voting system.    Do you disagree that the majority of SP voters are white? Are male? And have politics that lean to the right?   I mean they explicitly complain about "liberal" SF writers     The Sad Puppy list was created with the intent of 'fixing' the vote for popular, non-literary novels which Larry Correia, Brad Torgensen and the Sad Puppy Community enjoyed.  Except the books they nominated are not popular, other than Skin Game. They nominated people with very few readers, preventing the actually popular books to be left off the nominees.     Because if it's really supposed to be about nominating authors that are popular with a mass audience  It's most definitely not. There were plenty of SF/F books that sold well last year (Station Eleven, The Magician's Land, Southern Reach trilogy) but their politics don't align with the Puppies.    Well in what sense? Mainstream Republican politicians name-check Ayn Rand, so it wouldn't surprise me if more people in America today read Ayn Rand than read Dianetics or attend scientology churches.      I'm just basing it on what the Sad Puppies themselves said:    while the big consumer world is at the theater gobbling up the latest Avengers movie, fandom is giving science fictions most prestigious award to stories and books that bore the crap out of the people at the theate   Ill say it again: the Hugos (and the Nebulas too) have lost cachet, because at the same time SF/F has exploded popularly  with larger-than-life, exciting, entertaining franchises and products  the voting body of fandom have tended to go in the opposite direction: *niche*, academic, overtly to the Left in ideology and flavor, and ultimately lacking what might best be called visceral, gut-level, swashbuckling fun.  Those are just from one blog post from organizer Torgensen https://bradrtorgersen.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/why-sad-puppies-3-is-going-to-destroy-science-fiction/ but the Sad Puppies are always talking about how their "popular" fiction is being replaced by "niche" "literary" work.   But looking at actually numbers, it's all a lie. The big literary Sf books that win awards outsell the nice Sad Puppy books. They are more popular, not less.    You'd have to lose the 40 dollar. That's a big barrier for a lot of people, even with a book thrown in.    How is saying "totally obscure?" addressing my point?   I'm not misrepresenting the slate. The Sad Puppies claim to be defending the popular fiction that people actual read, the book versions of The Avengers film (their comparison), but instead they picked a bunch of obscure books. Station Eleven, Annihilation, even Ancillary Sword sold way more copies than the non-Butcher books they picked:   http://www.jasonsanford.com/blog/2015/4/yes-people-do-read-the-novels-up-for-the-hugo-and-nebula-awards  and the the shorter awards are dominated by things like John C. Wright and  Castalia House? Just factually speaking, they are not very popular. Wright is a completely nobody next to Gaiman, Scalzi, Martin, or a dozen other people you could name off the top of your head.   ETA: I'm not advocating for big name authors like King, Gaiman, and Martin to win every award. I'm only saying that the Sad Puppy slate does not represent the popular authors despite their claim.    Well I don't disagree that getting people into short fiction would be good, though I suspect purely open voting would be really easy to rig there too and if a Stephen King or Neil Gaiman type decided to campaign they could dominate the short story awards with a few tweets.   But, that would still be better than the Sad Puppies domination, so better than the status quo.    Wait... what? What does Indian or Hispanic writers nominated have to do with obscurity?   The Sad Puppy slate was mostly full of really obscure writers, outside of Jim Butcher. And they promoted themselves as being defenders of the super popular like The Avengers.    Right? You'd expect that John C. Wright was the modern day Robert Heinlein or some shit with his six (!) nominations    This is probably true. But the "Sad Puppies" also have a valid point that the more political nominations of the past weren't going to highly-read or especially good works, either.  but why counter that with... work that wasn't widely read or good but happens to share your viewpoint?   If the Sad Puppies wanted to actually promote the most popular work, they should have had a best novel slate of Station Eleven, Annihilation, Skin Game, The Martian, and Lock In... or something like that. (Maybe California?) Anyway, only Skin Game was the only one they nominated that was actually popular.     This would democratize the Hugo. It would make it, finally, a real fans' award. It would remove the gaming-the-system loophole that now exists due to low numbers of voters. Just, make the numbers of voters huge. Overwhelm all the factions. No lit faction, no sad anything, no political anything, just lots and lots of voters.  Is that much better though? In those kind of awards, it just goes to whatever book sold the most. Most people don't actually read many books, so there would only be a couple bestsellers who could even be in contention. And we don't need awards that recongize the bestseller list.... we can just look at the best seller list.     Also I didn't know she had a cult that big rivalling Hubbard.  might be bigger at this point, the Going Clear HBO doc on scientology  made it sound like their global membership has rapidly dwindled in the last decade.       It's never been this nakedly political before. There have always been groups, but the Sad Puppies voting bloc voted on a unified slate of mostly totally obscure white male authors.   So instead of one or two surprises with, I guess, liberal politics getting on, you have literally entire categories entirely dominated by the Sad Puppy voting bloc.   Politics aside, having basically a few people pick who gets nominated for most categories isn't a great way to do awards. I'd think it was gross if one or two liberal SF writers came out with the Politically Correct Slate and then the PC slate dominated every category.    They rigged the voting: http://www.jasonsanford.com/blog/2015/3/yes-the-sad-puppies-campaign-swept-the-hugo-awards   That's the funniest part! They claim to defend popular literature by getting a bunch of obscure dudes to replace actually popular, bestselling authors.    Sorry, I just had SP/Gamergate guy in another thread tell me those two guy's alleged ethnicity as a rebuttal to my factually true statement that the Sad Puppy slate was overwhelmingly white and male. May have carried over my eye-rolling.    It's even weirder because the "literary" titles that have won, like Michael Chabon, have been popular books with tons of sales... so the idea that "popular fun books" are being ousted by obscure literary books just doesn't bear any relation to the facts.    It's not even a "popularity contest" when the works nominated aren't actually very popular. Annihilation, Station Eleven, tons of books that actually sold really well got bumped off for obscure neckbeard dudes.    There might be some, but I bet that danceswithronin was talking about having 6 short stories ready to send at any time. I agree with you that six book length works is... impossible.    six manuscripts of short stories or poems is very, very common.   Six book-length manuscripts? Never heard of that. But we are talking magazines here, right?    So... that means you can't count?    Both are necessarily in my experience, at least if you want to write anything original. If your goal is not to be Faulkner or Le Guin or Nabokov, or even Gaiman or King or Rowling... but to just rewrite whatever Twilight/Divergent/50 Shades type work is currently popular, then hard work is all you need. But otherwise, you need talent too.    Even if Vox Day and Corria are not white, do you really think the vast majority of people who voted SP aren't white?   If someone says the GOP is sexist, saying "but Sarah Palin is a woman!" isn't really a counterargument.    I didn't say mention those two much less say they were anti-diversity or not. I said they succeeded in getting a bunch of medicore white male writers to clog the nominations. That's... what they did.   That's not a knock on white male SF writers, there were lots of good ones who got bumped off by the SP slate!   Ugh, I didn't mention either of those names. I was talking about the SP voters overall, not the figureheads, and I was talking about who actually got nominations: John C. Wright got 6 nominations. Best novella is all white men. etc.   What percentage of Hugo nominees for the various fiction awards are white and male this year?   Completely vote-rigged. Maybe it will force the Hugos to change?    Well the Sad Puppies succeded in totally rigging the voting so a bunch of mediocre white men triumphed. Congrats I guess?       I just don't send to places that say no sim subs, but i don't think many do anymore?    He talks trash on Twilight a lot (but Twilight also sucks)   Two years BUT what I meant is their short lists have been good   True, SF/F fans often get mad when a book ISN'T a massive tome. I remember some crumging about Jeff VanderMeer's first Southern Reach book not being long enough. Books 2 and 3 were a good 300+ so people chilled on it, but if he had released three 200 page books people would have been mad.    I've totally been thinking that! (Not about the Arya chapter specifically, but just the teaser chapters in general... like he wants to get his version out first for some of them)   I mean, it is true compared to other writers. King publishes about 1.5 books a year. A lot of other writers, including many of the most famous, write more like one every four years. King can't possibly be spending as much time on his books as most of those other writers.   Which is fine, but will make him have some clunkers now and then.    I mean, she's right... but it was written for little kids   National Book Award (far better than the Pulitzer). Nobel only really awards already famous authors at the very end of their career.   The Folio Prize, which only started last year, is pretty good.    Sure, but all I'm saying is that GOT is merely one TV show, it isn't the sign of a wave or anything AND it's not the first fantasy adaptation to do well with adults (the LOTR films were huge, to pick one example)   Well we don't know all the changes this season, but:    ***SPOILER ALERT***  It seems like the show is cutting Aegon, and probably cutting victarion or Euron. There will probably be other big changes too   you dont' need to have his POV chapters for that to occur. We know about plenty of animosity between houses from backstory.    Can be done much quicker, four or five months, if they want   gaaah!   My bet: 2016 for TWOW, but ADOS will get split into two books. Too much plot to wrap up in two books.       Yeah totally. Today there's tons of "serious" fairy tale inspired writers (Oyeyemi, Karen Russell, etc.). 10 years ago there were tons of genre benders (Chabon, Lethem, etc.) Before that there was Marquez and the Latin American magical realists. Before that there was the postmodernists who used magica elements (Coover, Barthelme). Before that there was Italo Calvino and the fabulists. Before that, Borges.   etc.   Magic in serious fiction is nothing new.       I wonder if the plot twist is just something he is trying to do to distinguish the books from the TV show, so that it can't be spoiled... rather than something that he'd write without a TV show over his head.      	200

Stuff which skip the income statement and go straight to the balance sheet are also red flags, like unsustainable principal repayments.   I'm going to explain this from the perspective of the income statement, but it should help you understand the cash flow statement as well.   When a company earns cash, it goes into its wallet. Now if this were a 'project' instead of a 'company', the cash earned would immediately exit the sphere of the 'project' and go straight to the 'owners'. Thus the cash earned attributed to the project is obvious.   However, a company might choose to retain the cash and reinvest it into a second project instead of giving it back. Now this is a large investment which drains your cash. When investors look at this, it has the wrong effect of attributing your empty cash balance to dismal performance of the first project - when in fact it did very well.  So to record actual performance, you match the expense against the revenues of the appropriate timeframe, i.e. future revenues and not past revenues. This is the concept of the income statement.   However, companies are not static entities; they're constantly in a state of flux. The moment more cash comes in, they reinvest it. Thus it becomes exceedingly important to maintain a record of past performance (i.e. past cash flows earned attributed to past operations), so that past performance is correctly attributed to past operations. This is the net profit amount, and is accumulated in the retained earnings figure.   This also has the great advantage of allowing more complex cash movements like loans, receivables etc. Basically, divorcing the actual cash flows from performance allowed companies to delay or speed up their expenses, which facilitated the liquidity of money itself. We would later recognize this as "float".   That's why in the beginning, the SEC only required income statements and not cash flow statements; because given enough time, the cash flow statement eventually catches up to the income statement. The cash flow statement was therefore effectively redundant for making long term decisions.   The problem arose when companies started to take advantage of this divorce from cash flows to manipulate earnings. For instance, constantly refinancing at higher and higher rates until the Ponzi scheme collapsed. Basically, the authorities realized that only allowing investors to observe the tip of the pyramid - and not the base on which it rests - allowed management to hide stuff for a long time before reality caught up. This was why the SEC reintroduced the cash flow statement - to provide a check and balance against the income statement which was built on top of it.   Remember, the income statement merely matches cash flows across time; so in perpetuity both eventually converge. Thus, even though the cash flow statement was redundant for long term purposes, it made apparent the steps which were taken to arrive at the income statement. So that when the time comes to realize the retained earnings amount, the cash will be there.    This is cool. Are you related to the insurance industry?   Of more practical importance is the question whether or not investment can be successfully carried on in common stocks that appear cheap from the quantitative angle and thatupon studyseem to have average prospects for the future. Securities of this type can be found in reasonable abundance, as a result of the stock markets obsession with companies considered to have unusually good prospects of growth. Because of this emphasis on the growth factor, quite a number of enterprises that are long established, well financed, important in their industries and presumably destined to stay in business and make profits indefinitely in the future, but that have no speculative or growth appeal, tend to be discriminated against by the stock marketespecially in years of subnormal profitsand to ***sell for considerably less than the business would be worth to a private owner***.   Note that we have applied the touchstone of value to a private investor to justify two different types of *investment* in common stocks:   (1) purchase of issues thought to have exceptional prospects at no higher price than would be paid for a corresponding interest in a private business, and   (2) purchase of issues with good records and average prospects at a much lower price than the business is worth to a private owner.   See Appendix Note 45, p. 778 on accompanying CD, for the exhibit of an issue of the latter type (Swift and Company).    what buffet do you go to that costs $11?   you mean the bombs didn't consume themselves relatively neatly. they blew uranium pukechunk all over the ground before reaching critical mass and therefore didn't become radioactive.         one... two... th... th...

Now this nice handsome man is wrapping a shiny wrapper around them and your daddy can't come home because he's working so hard to buy one.   But here's a secret: this handsome young man doesn't really care about selling you the battery so you can store power for your house in it. He just wants to sell more of it so they become cheaper because he's selling so many of them. Then he can reduce the price of his gigantic toy cars which are powered by those same batteries, so one day your daddy can buy one.   e.g. expensing items when you didn't need to, free gifts, etc.   U r womanz??      /r/evenwithcontext   You don't "know" everything.

What was the state of the Russians at the end? How much had they sacrificed?   Real options. Google it.   Immediate or short period after    Mars Bar.      The new-era investment theory was conspicuously reticent on the mathematical side. The relationship between price and earnings, or price and trend of earnings was anything that the market pleased to make it (note the price of Electric Power and Light compared with its earnings record given on p. 363). If an attempt were to be made to give a mathematical expression to the underlying idea of valuation, ***it might be said that it was based on the*** **derivative** ***of the earnings, stated in terms of time***. In recent years more serious efforts have been made to establish a mathematical basis for discounting expected future earnings or dividends. See Gabriel Preinreich, The Theory of Dividends, New York, 1935; and J. B. Williams, The Theory of Investment Value, Cambridge, Mass., 1938. The latter work is built on the premise that the value of a common stock is equal to the present value of all future dividends. This principle gives rise to an elaborate series of mathematical equations designed to calculate exactly what a common stock is worth, assuming certain vital facts about future earnings, distribution policy and interest rates.

I haven't read the book, but I did go through the excerpts and it was very interesting. The underlying concept is that if fundamental value is higher than the range predicted by Black-Scholes, then puts are overvalued and calls are undervalued and you should act accordingly. I have the ebook version if you want to read it.         incredible hearing?      ... or in other words, who is the bigger sucker?   I'm an accounting grad and am now at a small buy side. Purely out of luck, I applied on their website and got it. But if you have any questions I might be able to help.   no probo ;P      *~IT'S THE NEW ENNNNROOOOOONNNNNN~*      Maybe they put their right leg in, then put their right leg out, then do the hokey pokey and turn it all about.   *dunn~ dunn~ dun dun dun duuuunnnnnnnnn~*      That is all good and fair, and if they are applying conservative accounting policies by immediately expensing R D then I commend their professionalism. But if that's true then the bigger problem is why are they expensing so much of it? R D can only be capitalized when there is a reasonable expectation that it will eventually yield profits - so if they are expensing nonessentials at this order of magnitude, you really have to wonder whether they are allocating capital wisely.   In fact, if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept this as truth, it might be even worse - since it signals that they are desperately trying to come up with something new, which could mean they *know* that their current position is unsustainable. Which is simply dumping water out of a leaking boat.   Actually I took a cursory look at their 2013 financial statements. It seems that the reason for their losses are twofold: firstly gross margins are very low, which is fine; but they also have very high administrative expenses which eat up everything left. I dug into it and found that two aspects were the leading causes: Sales   Fulfillment. Sales is the commissions etc. to bring revenues, while Fulfillment refers to affiliates-related activity. There is no further drill-down analysis.  Now, the main argument for Amazon actually being wildly profitable if they stopped reinvesting is that the cash flows are being "sunk" into CAPEX, right? Since the bulk of SG A are Sales and Fulfillment, the increase in net profit if they stop reinvesting will have to come from either of these. I did a little more research into what Sales and Fulfillment means. Sales apparently is quite straightforward - commissions etc, so there's little room for interpretation there. But Fulfillment is a little trickier - they mostly relate to warehouse activity. As the cost of building new warehouses and scaling their SaaS segment makes up most of their reinvestments, these "sunk" cash flows are being attributed to Fulfillment expenses.   But remember that CAPEX does not flow through the income statement - it goes straight to the balance sheet and is reflected as depreciation/amortization, and is insignificant compared to both Sales and Fulfillment. So Fulfillment expenses on the income statement doesn't actually relate to reinvesting activity, but rather the ancillary costs of building new warehouses, e.g. hiring more people, or paying for rights to inventory. Or they could just as well be amortization of Goodwill from their robust acquisition spree, like the impressive Kiva robots. In any case, this means that Fulfillment expenses do not actually go down when reinvestment stops - they simply stop scaling up. Thus, the net profit figure that you see now is the actual future free cash flow if they simply stopped investing today.   The point I'm trying to make is that I do not see how the argument that they would be profitable if they stopped reinvesting makes sense. The income statement matches cash flows across time, so it reflects how future cash flows will look like assuming Amazon remains as a going concern. Which means that cash flows will eventually catch up with profits; which means future cash flows = net profit. Which is bad news for Amazon. Cash flows may appear strong today, but that is just "float" which has to eventually be absorbed by future outflows.   edit - Tl;dr: Amazon is not sinking money into future growth. It is sinking money into upkeep of past growth activity, which is correctly reflected as expenses. Therefore the net profit figure IS the correct amount of free cash flow. Unless I'm missing something else, the net profit/retained earnings figure is all the future cash shareholders will enjoy from present day business.   accounting actually has very little to do with math.   http://ww2.cfo.com/strategy/2001/07/forget-the-float-the-2001-working-capital-survey/  This company is never going to be profitable, lol.    One of the great mysteries of today's market is the way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock trades at such a huge discount to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. In terms of price-to-earnings, Apple trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 12, while Amazon trades at a forward 2012 P/E of 193. This happens despite Apple growing revenues faster than Amazon, growing earnings, and growing estimates. Amazon not only has revenues that grow slower, but its earnings have been falling for two years straight. Amazon's earnings are also predicted to fall in 2012 vs. 2011, and its next-quarter earnings are predicted to fall 95% from the year before. Finally, Amazon's EPS estimates for the next quarter were slashed 90% just days ago.   Knowing this, it's hard to understand how Amazon can not only trade at a premium to Apple, but indeed trade at an earnings valuation multiple that is a full 16 times larger than Apple's. To put things into perspective, if Apple traded at Amazon's earnings multiple, it would trade at $9,000. Or if Amazon traded at Apple's multiple, it would trade for just $14.16.  So is there any explanation for this absurd disconnect? Yes, there might be one.      Do you realize how you're contradicting yourself by applying present scientific methods to your considerations?  	170
 There is a [May Festival performance](http://www.mayfestival.com/festival.html) that evening - Wagner and Verdi! Definitely fancy, and great, classic song selections; one of which is the Bridal March, so you know, romantical (if you don't actually pay attention to the plot of the opera.) If you used that in your wedding, it might be double romanticals.    or not. Let's have a 3 up 3 down 9th!   Oof, I would love to see them pad the lead here in the 8th - come on Bruce!

This is going to sound harsh, but don't. Unless they specifically have put out a call for pieces, they don't want to hear from you. Museums and curators get a million calls from people that want them to look at their stuff. And many of you may find it cynical, but we generally don't care unless you are interested in donating it. And half the time not even then. It's an issue of being underfunded and understaffed (a fairly universal problem in the world of non-profit museums) that we just don't have the time to look at everything that comes around. A lot of museum's do have days in which members can bring one or two pieces in to consult with a curator. Think Antique's Roadshow style, where we don't tell you the value. I know some of the auction houses even do it.   For what it's worth though,  it is a very lovely piece, I just wouldn't bother a museum unless you really want to part with it.

 Search coordinators said the data suggested Scheib likely ascended Yerba Canyon trail and at least got close to the summit, which rises 12,115 feet above sea level, but probably encountered trouble during his descent.  good grief, i'm not sure i could hike up a 12,115 foot trail, and i'm only 36, not 61! Guy must have been a very experienced outdoorsman.   that....sounds really good, actually?    It can definitely happen. Usually hiking's pretty safe, but accidents and weather and circumstance can conspire to get the best of people.    Other sources are saying there was a storm the day he turned up missing, and that he was actually found in a river adjacent to the trail. He might have gotten disoriented in the storm or slipped and fell. It's apparently a challenging trail.    Well there's a picture the guy cooking them.   Which, btw, who the hell thought eating lobster was a good idea? It's a giant bug. If you saw a lobster and had no clue what one was, you'd  be terrified of it! That's not for eating, that's for leaving in the ocean.    I hear it's murder to get the white house tiramisu recipe.    What, you think he was in on a conspiracy to use margarine instead of butter on the lobster? The guy was a fuckin' cook, not the CIA.   Could be anything, at this point, but yeah - i'd be inclined to think it's something pretty immediate like a heart attack or being jumped by someone on the trail (though that's very rare)    haha right?

For that price, it better come with a built-in assault rifle to shoot anyone who threatens me. Good grief.      i should stress that i have absolutely zero faith in state legislatures to not be utterly corrupt as well as incompetent. It's just to small-potatoes for them not to be.   I'm shocked the percentage of not shady ones is that high, honestly.   If we're to have private prisons at all (and i don't think we should) we should just pay them a flat rate (to keep the facility staffed and running) + a per-prisoner rate. So if it's a 500 bed facility and has 1 prisoner in it, that's fine, and if it's a 500 bed facility and it has 500 prisoners in it, that's fine.  Why it would not be set up that way is baffling to me, but i suspect the general incompetence and ignorance of state legislatures is to blame.   Exactly how i feel about it. I don't care what someone eats, but good grief, kill it humanely.    I think it's the exact opposite: people want non-threatening things. Let's say someone has a crush on suzy at works, and as any good man would, beats the bishop thinking about her. That's dangerous ground: his fantasy life could intrude into his work life and make him feel bad because he can't have what he wants.  But if he wants, someone *utterly* unattainable - his mother, a MLP character, etc - then that's safe to fantasize about because he knows it'll have to stay a fantasy forever.   That is absolutely hideous. Also, i loathe neck knives.

No one ever tried messing with the videos to my recollection. They might return them in poor condition (chewed up by a shitty vcr or what not) but generally they did not try to swap them or anything like that.  I remember we had one on display that a guy had left on his car's dashboard in summer - it wasn't just melted, but distorted in a very unique, almost wavy sort of way.    that was my thought, exactly. If this guy was up for 3-strikes, then he might figure a chance of escape is better than the certainty of dying in prison.    I am kind of legitimately wondering if he could just drive around with the controller until he picked up a signal.    realistically this is not much different than the mob dropping a health item. I don't know how well it'd work out (i mean it'd be very game implementation specific) but it'd be interesting, at least.   if you've never seen it, look up the intro video for Total War: Napoleon. If you like napoleon, it is pretty awesome.    The underwire thing i've seen personally, and i have always commented that there MUST be a better way to do what the underwire does.   The bra thing is horrifyingly nightmarish.    I worked in a video store, and there is a world of difference between little problems ("oh, they moved a movie off the shelf from where it belongs" or "Oh, someone forgot to flush the shitter") and callous disregard for the shop ("Oh look, some shitheaded prick dumped 20 fucking vhs cases onto the floor and just left'em" or "Great, some son of a bitch maggot-fucker took a shit in the goddamn sink.")   This is pretty callous disregard, at least pick up the fucking drink cups!    To me the elephant in the room is that that this giant clusterfuck mess was probably created by children, and that the real problem is that we allow children into theaters not specially designed or designated for them.    I dunno. If someone does something obviously stupid, either A) their really that dumb, or B) there's some information they know that we don't that makes their choice make sense.  I'm guessing B, here - the guy knew/thought once he was in custody, they'd either get him on a much more serious charge, or he knew that if found guilty he'd spend many years in prison due to priors or something.  Either way - i don't think he'll be free for much longer. They tend to round up cop killers pretty fast.   I mean figure you're just driving along, when suddenly some psycho just goes batshit and runs into you. Truly life is precious, for it can be gone at any moment - i'm just glad he didn't die.   I'm fond of saying that his movies are less independent movies, and more just really well done homages to previous horror films, with shout-outs and throwbacks throughout.

The foster care system isn't perfect (nothing is) but it's gotta be better than that kind of home environment.      If authors were paid every time someone turned a page, they'd have a good motivation to write pages people wanted to keep turning.   the efficiency of ants has always impressed me. They are like little robots.   What gets me is: who would be so stupid as to shoot a cop to escape custody like that? What the hell had the guy done that would make him consider *that* a superior option to going to jail for the charges he was up on?       Totally dependent on what's causing the paralysis, how severe the damage is, how fast medical attention is gotten, etc.    I couldn't ever skim past. These people, and what they've been through and their lives (however short) - they deserve to be remembered, and known, and thought about. It's just so awful.      That could work. If it didn't break the skin, it'd be alright. Probably easier to design some kind of metal cutting blade, though, mounted externally as part of the armor they would wear.    I would assume whatever doctor did the autopsy/post mortem exam would have written one up, so the navy? I'm actually genuinely not sure how that's handled, i would genuinely like to know.   Meat's meat. So long as it's humanely slaughtered, i don't think it matters much where it comes from.    That's not true - they'd write a sternly worded letter! And if that didn't work, a second, even more sternly worded letter, before giving up.      it won't undo what was done, but it'd be *something*.    Would not at all surprise me if that were the case. people are always looking for an edge.      I'm always seeing itch.io on /r/gamedeals - good to see some of the math behind it! keep up the great work.   That kid's face is the look of fear and regret, right there. I would feel bad for him, but considering his crime, not so much. He made his own bed.   it's pretty disgusting/mind boggling that no one showed up for this kid, considering the circumstances. What a nightmare he must be going through.   You can't even win Cataclysm - you can just survive until you don't.   There's so much i don't understand about this situation. I have to assume he just got frustrated, lost control, and attacked the kid - but that seems like such a pale explanation for something so awful.    And nothing of value was lost.       Firstly, he has not even the slightest most remote hope of an insanity defense. Hell, he does not seem very concerned with even mounting a defense, honestly.  Secondly, considering he's already said he was trying to start a race war, if the media hasn't caught on by now it's intentionally not catching on. Hoping that throwing another log onto the pile will change their minds is a lost hope.   Thirdly, i really could give a fuck less what this asshole's motives and inspirations supposedly are. He's just another inbred hick with a gun that figured his only chance at getting anyone to pay attention to him was to go kill some innocent people. Just like those assholes Klebold and Harris, just like that prick tim McVey, just like all the rest of them.   Give him the death penalty and then lock'em away until it's time to give him the shot. He has nothing worthwhile to tell us.   That's probably exactly what happened: without official proof of death, there was some paperwork holdup on his end. Plus, of course, its' good to have for official reasons.   I'd rather drink a cup of my own piss than read whatever this traitorous little shithead word-vomited into a text file, thanks. Whole thing should be deleted unread and unseen.   In an interview with police, (the suspect) admitted that when she wouldnt stop crying, he kicked the child twice in the back and then laid her on the floor and stomped on her back, the statement added, citing the petition.  I actually am having a difficult time forming the words for how fucked up this situation is.       damn, at least i was spot-on to be suspicious. good deal.   Good old Rob Dyke.    I wonder how effective you could make something like this and still plausibly claim it's not a weapon but a fashion accessory?    Strange situation. Wouldn't rule out mental illness on the girl's part - delusions of persecution are reasonably common, and 17 is about the age some people start to develop some types of mental illness.  that said i hope she's found, and quickly - this doesn't seem like a benign disappearance.   yeah i don't believe that for a second. I think they would hit you with whatever they could because - and i know this is shocking - society frowns on opening fire near small children because you feel mildly threatened.    I wouldn't necessarily want to see "skills" per se, but perks like being able to do special attacks or have special benefits in combat or survival.   that's all fine and well, except:   The officer fires one shot at the dog, misses the dog and accidentally shoots a four-year-old in the leg, CPD spokeswoman, Denise Alex-Bouzounis, said.  There was no person attacking him. he claimed the dog charged him and he drew and fired his weapon, hitting a 4 year old.   If some concealed carry permit holder's in someone's house and their dog (reportedly) charges him and he fires at it and accidentally hits a 4 year old, what would happen to that person?   To me, the question is simple: if this same situation happened with a private individual rather than a police officer, what would the response be?      Good on hawaii. Anything that inconveniences, harasses, and annoys smokers and the businesses they shore up is inherently to the good.    I don't think this is enforceable almost anywhere - how would you ever prove someone had a gun or did not have a gun, unless it was used (in which case you have bigger issues than if you can still drive for uber)   Some people are decent people, others are just pretending to be decent people. If someone's an asshole when there's no consequences, then they were *always* an asshole, just smart enough to hide it in polite company.      I dunno what you'd call someone who feigns a normal life while having a second life where they torment and harass people, other than some kind of psychopath.   You're cynical, i like that.  Also it did occur to me asking for donations was a little iffy in a situation like this.   Sounds like something Edward Lee would write.    Probably whoever did this knew the victim; of course, by now their long dead. ID is probably impossible unless there's a lucky DNA hit, if there's any DNA evidence.   People loved [John Wayne Gacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne_Gacy#Businessman_and_community_volunteer). Thought he was a great guy. Everyone got along with [Dean Corrl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Corll#Corll_Candy_Company) - he was so generous to the local kids. [Ted Bundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy#University_years) was viewed as a young man with a promising future. [Dennis Rader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rader#Personal_life) was a real asshole, though.   My point is: just because someone's got a "normal" life doesn't mean their not hiding something dark and awful inside them. Maybe they ain't serial killers, but never ever mistake "seems normal" for "safe".    I would argue that's more just a difference of extent and opportunity.   I think it's pretty telling that the klan wore masks. They knew what they were doing was wrong, but they also knew that if they took some precautions they were unlikely to be punished. That enabled the violence and the intimidation.   The only difference with internet groups is that they have less opportunity to do wrong and it's easier to figure when they have done wrong (see: reddit + the boston bomber fiasco). it makes them seem less prone to extremism and violence, but really it's just muted because of the fear of consequences and the lack of opportunity.    It is an odd choice of headline, but i figured i'd leave it as is more or less.   can confirm, have fried computers with screw driver, am software engineer :(    i WISH i had a transparency projector, those things are fucking boss.   I would say that all societies or groups - even ephemeral ones like SRD - have enemies and allies, even if only in their own perception. The rhetoric of "why" and "how" may vary, but the basic tenet of "us" and "them" never changes.   There is no opportunity for discourse. Anything reddit's admins say they'll either disregard as FUD or treat as an attack on them; by no means will they ever seriously consider anything they say.  Not to mention, i'm not convinced of the value of even trying to talk to people with delusions about their delusions. I've never seen it work out any better than them disengaging from the conversation.   I've known a few people who were competent at their jobs, who became *incompetent* the minute they left their job, at their own field.   I know an engineer who's perfectly able at his job, gets promotions, does great work, etc. In his off time, he told me once that he doesn't understand why computer chips don't run in 16-bit instead of binary, and refused to hear any logic as to why not. I imagine there are lawyers the same way: good at the job, crazy off the job.   it's really a case of a few loud assholes covering up all the great stuff on reddit. For every /r/fatpeoplehate there's at least 20 good small subs with great content. But that gets washed out in the constant white noise from the assholes.   That plan has a few (reasonably minor) flaws:  1. It'd scatter infectious material everywhere. If anyone has any open wounds or if there's bone shards, it could infect them with the zombie-agent.  2. It'd be noisy, which could draw unwanted attention/deafen people nearby who need their ears to hear shuffling undead approach  3. Someone could be close to the victim (rendering aid, checking to see if their just unconscious or what) when the charge goes off, injuring them quite severely  4. No system is 100% fail-safe, and an accidental detonation could be absolutely catastrophic - imagine if they were flying a helicopter or driving at speed.   No; implanting explosives inside people is only rarely the correct answer, and it's not in this case.      Probably to situational to make any sort of judgement without knowing the specifics of the situation and location. For example - illegally immigrating from the US to Canada is very different from illegally immigrating from Taiwan to Japan.   How delightfully alien and strange looking; an amazing depiction of a picture being worth a thousand words.   Got it in one. I don't think anyone seriously expects an attack against the east coast, but they probably figure it's only a matter of time until someone pops a cruise missile at one of our bases overseas or in a combat zone.   An armed society is only polite if everyone is armed; if only some people are armed, it's pretty damn belligerent.    yep and yep.  Even better, every time i've had to take someone to the ER for a psych problem, they've acted like it was a big fucking burden and a serious annoyance. The one nurse even said "well, i know your doctor said to come here, but could you hold out the 2 weeks to see your regular psychiatrist?" like it was no big deal that they were talking about cutting their arm open to see the veins.  medical community in america's fucked. It's a total crap-shoot if you get someone who gives a shit or if you get someone who just wants to get back to the break room to watch another episode of Family Guy. And that's without looking at the money aspect of it, which makes everything a thousand times worse.      What a rolling shit-show this case is. If there was a god, this would be solid proof he ain't benevolent.      Luckily i'm sure the jail cafeteria will have all the potato-based foods he would ever want. Assuming, of course, that someone doesn't take it off him.   You never know what goes on behind closed doors.      Yep. It's pretty upsetting.   the vast majority of criminals aren't very bright, and i have to think any pedo stupid enough to molest a kid at his job and right around pickup time in a public place is not the sort of guy who can come up with a super-good explanation for his behavior when pressed.  It's a good thing in a sense, though - he won't get away with it.      I like the headline style, but the rest kind of falls flat. Also the picture  isn't as good as i would like - i expected something more criminal-like, rather than what looks like a headshot for a magazine.   Couldn't hurt to try if you have a good sample. At worst it's some dead ends or false leads, and most cases have plenty of those anyway.   I'd argue that in my setting, since nation-states can "own" entire solar systems or groups of solar systems it'd be just that - a large cluster of solar systems somewhere.  Probably for like, human scale items, large warships or very large structural installations would be the most expensive things, and would be owned by companies (maybe some individuals).    That's....actually pretty profound. If you were in a situation where zombism could take over quickly and without much warning, some kind of face-mask could actually be common issue for the people sent to deal with them.  *makes notes for use in future zombie worldbuilding*   welcome to /r/worldpolitics - where you can get the very best in anti-Semitic news hidden under the thinnest veneer possible. It's a total shitshow.   i 100% blame Geraldo Riviera for single-handedly destroying the public sanitarium system in america. His expose on Willowbrook has probably caused more suffering and misery than it prevented by an order of magnitude.  If you ever want to see true frustration, try to get someone committed for their own well-being. It's a fucking nightmare.    child's leg tells me it could be child abuse. Dad beats the kid a little to hard, they die, buries them under the shed.   Alternatively, could be a random nutbar who killed animals then escalated to killing a child.   The extreme age of the site tells me there's not apt to be much evidence left, and what evidence is left isn't likely to be conclusive.  What i want to know is: where's the rest of them.    If it were, it'd well fit with the source material.   Just one of the many spiraling side effects of the country's attitude towards mental illness - dangerous lunatics roam the streets, and there's damn little anyone can legally do about it.   this is /r/worldpolitics - if it's anti-isralie, it'll stay (and get upvoted).       I'm kind of conflicted on what actual punishment should be given for this, but i definitely feel the gun owner is responsible. If you aren't controlling access to your weapon - then you are not controlling the weapon and are in the wrong.    Just look at the mike brown shooting - people were saying, literally, "if you don't want to get shot, don't steal shit!" like stealing from a convenience store is a death penalty offense, suddenly.    I have heard nothing but good things about Open Broadcaster Software.   It's just more bullshit posturing from russia to get them into the press. Luckily (for them) reporters eat their nonsense up.   I was never quite sure what he was doing - by the time i got to where he was (out in a custom mystcraft dimension he'd made) he had everything stripped. I assume it was configuration though, rather than the system he was using. Whatever it was, it smoothed out instantly once he removed it.   Even a step further: i remember people being very proud we *had* [Echelon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) and the NSA was considered to be the very good guys. It was common knowledge that we had really capable spy satellites, but no one worried about it.   of my immediate family, only one person has a degree - and it's only tangentially related to his job.    Let'em starve.    I hope whatever kills him - and oh, i hope it's soon! - it hurts like a motherfucker. This guy deserves no mercy nor respite; may his final hours be filled with fear and his final moments filled with terror and pain.   And nothing of value was lost   In a time when everyone wants a free pony, he is there offering up that free pony.    I miss the good old days, when news was murder-death-kill 24/7. Now it's all marketing bullshit for crap i'll never touch.   My theory is that what creates deranged mass shooters is actually the media itself. I think that these people feel disenfranchised, powerless, and hopeless, so they take up a gun and decide to go get famous.  Mass shooting's wont' go down until the media stops covering them so intently.      It sounds like he was pretty well known and well liked. Damn shame, and such an awful way to die.         I have no clue, but that's a very good question. I would like to think that in that circumstance, i would go all-out to save someone, but without being there we just can't be sure what happened.   that too.   At one point, we had an intermittent server fault where the server would just die and then pop back. So we finally trace it down to a dude's quarry system: it was running intermittently, and when it would run, it would bring down the entire server as processed stuff.  He couldn't power it consistently (thus the bursts - he'd shut it off, let the power build up, turn it on, bring the server to it's knees, it'd run it's power dry, rinse and repeat).    I'm sure this kid was from the 'burbs and thought if he told the nice men they had his phone they'd just cough it over, and then when they didn't he didn't realize how dangerous the situation was.  totally an avoidable fatality.   Be a hell of a coincidence if so!    [That's exactly correct.](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2923.16)  The revelant portion:  (B) No person shall knowingly transport or have a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle in such a manner that the firearm is accessible to the operator or any passenger without leaving the vehicle.  (C) No person shall knowingly transport or have a firearm in a motor vehicle, unless the person may lawfully possess that firearm under applicable law of this state or the United States, the firearm is unloaded  basically, the ohio gun law is so pants-on-head retarded that it boggles the mind (it's not as bad as Ohio's knife law, however!)    "high cost of living" stands as one of my all-time favorite comics, ever, and is in my top 4 or 5 for best works of fiction ever.   Shhh, you're interrupting the "it's not a classic until 8th grade teachers force you to choke it down" circle-jerk.    It would have worked better if it was at least a half hour shorter, but then it wouldn't really be a full-length movie.  that said, i really enjoyed how it was unremittingly batshit crazy. A lot of movies about crazy people show them as not-really crazy; they have some kind of over-arching sense to what they do. This guy was just batshit and any ability he had to make sense was purely incidental. I liked that.  	150
    Thumbs up for this. One of the best directors in the history of cinema. It's sad that he died so early. All hail Fassbinder!   Ten of my favourite screenplays:          * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        * L'eclisse (1962)       * La notte (1961)     * Pickpocket (1959)        * Sanma no aji (1962)       * Smultronstllet (1957)       * Suna no onna (1964)        * Tanin no kao (1966)          Spalovac mrtvol (1969).   Manhattan (1979).         I haven't seen Fury (2014), so my list isn't necessarily a list of movies that are similar to it, but they are ten of my favourites when it comes to war movies:     * Apocalypse Now (1979)       * Csillagosok, katonk (1967)     * Idi i smotri (1985)      * Ivanovo detstvo (1962)         * L'arme des ombres (1969)       * Lacombe Lucien (1974)      * Nobi (1959)       * Popil i diament (1958)       * Paths of Glory (1957)       * Voskhozhdenie (1977)         [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c) scene from C'era una volta il West (1968), the final duel. Pure magic. If you haven't seen the movie at all, I would advice you to not watch the clip if you are sensitive when it comes to spoilers.            I really like the ending to L'eclisse (1962). The whole movie is of course a masterpiece, but since we're talking about endings, I have to mention it. It would almost be a bit pointless to post a clip, because you really have to see the whole film until the very end to be able to put the ending in context. Also, the final shots are just breathtaking and amazingly framed. It's one of those endings that really stuck with me, it's very special.   I haven't seen it yet, but it sounds absurd to me that it would be better than Stalker (1979).      I don't know if you are kidding or not, but I hope we don't get anymore of them.         1962 was an amazing year. We got L'eclisse (1962), Sanma no aji (1962), Procs de Jeanne d'Arc (1962), La jete (1962), Le doulos (1962), Tsubaki Sanjr (1962), Mamma Roma (1962), Il sorpasso (1962), El ngel exterminador (1962), Lolita (1962), Seppuku (1962), Ivanovo detstvo (1962), Vivre sa vie: Film en douze tableaux (1962) etc.           1964 and 1969, thats two other years that were great too. Just overall, I find it hard to see how anything could beat the sixties. It was in the sixties that some of the best and most interesting waves came and/or had their peak, for example the Japanese new wave and the French new wave. It was also at that time some of the best, most interesting, most creative, and most influental directors ever were working, we had Robert Bresson, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hiroshi Teshigahara, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Jean-Pierre Melville, Akira Kurosawa, Yoshishige Yoshida, Louis Malle, Kaneto Shind, Alain Resnais, Shhei Imamura, Masahiro Shinoda, and many, many others. Just take Japanese cinema as an example, that period was crazy and filled with good cinema. Aside from film, it happened quite much in the sixties from a political view all over the world, so I guess that had to do a lot with what movies we got too.      The framing is amazing! You really sit and get amazed by every single shot. I love the angles and the compositions. The lightning is great too, everything is just so goddamn precise.   If it has to be people that are alive, I would want to see a movie with Lszl Krasznahorkai as a writer and Michael Haneke as a director.   Gamlet (1964) by Grigori Kozintsev.   * Al-mummia (1969)        * Gu ling jie shao nian sha ren shi jian (1991)         * Khesht va Ayeneh (1965)          A lot. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), L'eclises (1962), Zerkalo (1975), Sanma no aji (1962), and many, many more. The thing is, I no longer really care that much about trailers in general. If something sounds interesting for specific reasons, I usually end up watching it without looking at a trailer, especially when it comes to older movies, there's a lot of them that don't even seem to have trailers uploaded on the Internet etc. And often I don't feel the actual need to look at a trailer, it's enough knowing what a movie is about and who the director is for me.   Some examples would include Masahiro Yamada, Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray, Tonino Guerra, and Robert Bresson.   Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is great. I would rank it quite high when it comes to science fiction movies in general, it's actually that great.   Nattvardsgsterna (1962), Smultronstllet (1957) and Tystnaden (1963).   I haven't seen Tropic Thunder (2008), but if I made a top 1000 list, I wouldn't have the other two on it. So to answer your question, I've seen much, much better.   I believe the user meant The Divide (2011) by Xavier Gens. The TV-series is about a district attorney, not any kind of apocalypse.   Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. It has been described as one of the most depressing films ever made. The thing is, it doesn't need to have graphic depictions of rape, murder, cannibalism etc. I think that's mostly an easy target to the audience, and Hollywood likes to use similar dramatic situations to show us how bad things are, and they often tell us that in a very superficial, manipulating and dramatic way, to cause certain easy effects. But Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) doesn't use cheap ways to show the apocalypse, that's what I like about it. It has a pitch-black atmosphere that can't be found in movies like The Road (2009). It doesn't have any melodramatic piano music or something similar like in The Road (2009). It's just dark, depressing and actually has something interesting to say.   I like it, but I wouldn't rank it that high when it comes to his movies. I feel that it doesn't have anything against Manhattan (1979) for example.   To go after what the majority of people here think is unknown isn't a good parameter at all. It especially shows when movies like Moon (2009) and In Bruges (2008) are on the list. So to answer your question, none of those movies are really "largely unknown". And if someone wants to get a laugh, check out the Reddit thread that is linked in the article.   I'm just about to start this evening rewatching La notte (1961).   Jeanne Moreau has worked with Michelangelo Antonioni, Luis Buuel, Louis Malle, Theo Angelopoulos, Jacques Becker, Orson Welles, Marguerite Duras, Tsai Ming-liang, Franois Truffaut, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders. Not easy to beat.      Is he? He's for example not ranked on the list of directors at TSPDT and I've probably never seen him mentioned as a director on any other more serious list. He doesn't seem to be that widely mentioned and that highly regarded in film literature in general either. I wouldn't rank him so high after seeing his three animated feature films, he's mostly a mediocre Hollywood director in my eyes. And I doubt that Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) and Tomorrowland: A World Beyond (2015) would change my view of him. I think he's mostly highly regarded by every Tom, Dick and Harry, the general IMDb users, people on Reddit, the mainstream critics over at RT and judges who give out the more commercial awards, just to take some examples.         I prefer the original. The remake is horrible in comparison. Everything is better in the original. Everything from the soundtrack to the cinematography and especially how the story is told.   * Mulholland Dr. (2001)   * Persona (1966)                 * Werckmeister harmnik (2000)                     It's not been released on any form of home media, so no streaming or DVD/Blu-ray available yet. The movie has mostly been screened at various festivals so far. If you want to watch it as soon as possible, you will have to do it in a movie theater. Look at IMDb for release dates in various countries.   Nightcrawler (2014).   Jean-Pierre Laud in Les quatre cents coups (1959).   C'era una volta il west (1968) by Sergio Leone, no doubt about it. It's just perfect.   Damn! My fault!       The other two aren't as amazing as Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969), but still great and absolutely worth watching.   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, it's the best. Takes place in the protagonist's house and the cast is all female. A masterpiece.   Andrei Tarkovsky's top 10:       http://www.openculture.com/2014/08/andrei-tarkovsky-creates-a-list-of-his-10-favorite-films-1972.html          Just search for it and you will find everything about it:       http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/search?q=reddit+top+250 restrict_sr=on               There's also a list on ICheckMovies:        https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/reddit+top+250/       The Reddit top 250 exists.   * Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)       * Il deserto rosso (1964)        * L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961)         * Le rvlateur (1968)        * Rengoku eroica (1970)       * Sanatorium pod klepsydra (1973)        * Solyaris (1972)        * Stalker (1979)      * The Limits of Control (2009)       * Werckmeister harmnik (2000)         My top 5:                1. Michelangelo Antonioni's alienation trilogy:      L'avventura (1960), La notte (1961) and L'eclisse (1962).            2. Yoshishige Yoshida's trilogy on Japanese radicalism:     Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969), Rengoku eroica (1970) and Kaigenrei (1973).            3. Ingmar Bergman's religious triptych:       Ssom i en spegel (1961), Nattvardsgsterna (1962) and Tystnaden (1963).             4. Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy:          Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajito (1957) and Apur Sansar (1959).  5. Abbas Kiarostami's Koker trilogy:       Khane-ye doust kodjast? (1987), Zendegi va digar hich (1991) and Zire darakhatan zeyton (1994).         Others worth mentioning:         Rainer Werner Fassbinder's BRD Trilogy, Yasujir Ozu's Noriko trilogy, Michael Haneke's glaciation trilogy, Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, Pier Paolo Pasolini's Trilogy of Life, Krzysztof Kielowski's The Three Colors Trilogy, Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather trilogy, and Akio Jissoji's Buddhist trilogy.   The ending of L'eclisse (1962).      If you like that Bergman film, you must check out these too:       * Andrey Rublyov (1966)        * Marketa Lazarov (1967)          * dol vcel (1968)          No, I don't.   Great! One of the best horror movies of all time. Amazing atmosphere and a good soundtrack too.      Yes. I have some bad films, but some good stuff too (Herzog, Leone, Pasolini, Shind, Lang etc.). I haven't been collecting that urgently either. Here's what I have so far:          A Beautiful Mind (2001)        A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982)     bout de souffle (1960)       Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972)          Alien (1979)        Aliens (1986)       American Beauty (1999)    Basic Instinct (1992)   Beverly Hills Cop (1984)             Blade Runner (1982)     Breaking the Waves (1996)    Bringing Out the Dead (1999)     Bullets Over Broadway (1994)               C'era una volta il West (1968)      Cannibal Holocaust (1980)         Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)        Collateral (2004)       Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (1933)      Deconstructing Harry (1997)     Dirty Harry (1971)         Edward Scissorhands (1990)       Everyone Says I Love You (1996)       Evil Dead II (1987)       eXistenZ (1999)       Fight Club (1999)     Flklypa Grand Prix (1975)       Forrest Gump (1994)       Good Will Hunting (1997)            Goodfellas (1990)      Hannah and Her Sisters (1982)       I pugni in tasca (1965)        Il fiore delle mille e una notte (1974)      Krkarlen (1921)        La fille sur le pont (1999)    Land des Schweigens und der Dunkelheit (1971)      Lat sau san taam (1992)      Lon (1994)          Lilja 4-ever (2002)     Lo squartatore di New York (1982)                Mamma Roma (1962)        Midnight Run (1988)      Mighty Aphrodite (1995)       Nothing Hill (1999)    One-Eyed Jacks (1961)    Onibaba (1964)             Paura nella citt dei morti viventi (1980)       Planet of the Apes (2001)       Regi Andrej Tarkovskij (1988)        Reservoir Dogs (1992)     Road to Perdition (2002)       Road Trip (2000)      Se7en (1995)      Singin' in the Rain (1952)       The Beach (2000)    The Bourne Identity (2002)     The Color of Money (1986)    The Fly (1986)       The Killing Fields (1984)        The Maltese Falcon (1941)   The Producers (1967)             The Terminator (1984)       The Thin Red Line (1998)      The Last Samurai (2003)    The Quiet Earth (1985)   The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)           Thirteen (2003)      Tillsammans (2000)      Torsk p Tallinn - En liten film om ensamhet (1999)           U-571 (2000)     Underworld (1996)    Vredens dag (1943)   Zombi 2 (1979)     Zombi Holocaust (1980)               La plante sauvage (1973).   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   Le beau Serge (1958).   I actually did a blind buy of the Blu-ray myself. It's a great and beautiful movie with lovely performances. I really recommend it. It sticks with you.         Here's ten movies that could be something for you:        * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)       * Andrey Rublyov (1966)     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)         * Gion bayashi (1953)     * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    * Jalsaghar (1958)       * L'eclisse (1962)      * Pickpocket (1959)      * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)      * Tanin no kao (1966)      Since you know about Godard, Fellini and Bergman already, we can skip those aside a bit when it comes to recommendations. These ten movies will introduce you to some interesting and important directors, also some of my absolute favourites. All of them are visually interesting and philosophical, but mainly some of the best movies ever made, from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Japan, Soviet Union, India, United Kingdom and France, which is quite a little mix I fixed for you. If you like some stuff by Godard, Fellini and Bergman, there's a big chance that these movies will be in your taste too.         There's quite much I still haven't seen yet, but I'll take the three best movies that I gave 3/5 (the highest score so far) to from last year:        1. Xi you (2014)      2. Turist (2014)     3. Mr. Turner (2014)        For the record, I've only seen 37 films from 2014 too.   I really don't get surprised anymore, there's always going to be people who haven't seen popular and well known movies like The Godfather (1972), Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), Forrest Gump (1994) etc. I only get surprised if it's someone I already know when it comes to certain movies or any similar matter. When I just started watching more and more movies, there were many classics that I missed, so I don't get that surprised if people who aren't into movies that much haven't seen certain films.   Well, many are good and Hollywood are seeing potential in them, of course they want to use them if they are popular and can make some money. There's many kind of roles for these kind of actors. But as someone already said, "foreign" actors have always been around in American cinema. The movie industry is getting bigger and bigger, so it's easier to spot everything and everyone now.   * Solyaris (1972) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uM7722EAz0       * Stalker (1979) (Eduard Artemyev): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1QXKbhqr4       * Tanin no kao (1966) (Tru Takemitsu): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_mcyKFOEpg                      I can't say I liked it that much. The director isn't doing anything interesting with the nonlinear storyline, the use of music tried to be quirky and indie (The Smiths etc.), but felt mostly forced, cheap and so obvious. When using this kind of music in a movie, it doesn't have to be subtle, but it's no juxtaposition of interest or anything done with finesse. There's not really any good drama and the comedy parts are totally missing charm. The voiceover is quite bad, silly and doesn't do or add anything either, it's just in the way overexplaining things. I also disliked how it was shot with its distastefully "in your face" form. On the other hand, it's a bit better than the majority of similar modern romantic comedies from Hollywood, but that doesn't make it good. I've seen far suckier movies of course, but this one is easy to forget and nothing I would rank high at all.   It really depends on what you are looking after. The books are quite different from each other and cover different periods, genres and topics. But one favourite is Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema, I'm a big fan of the Japanese New Wave and some of the directors that emerged from it, so I'm happy that there's a whole book covering it. As a more general book, I like A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors because of its big, diverse and wide coverage of directors.       I'd also love to find a book on Setsuko Hara, she's wonderful! I don't think there's any book about her in English yet, am I right?   Here are some useful and interesting books that can be of your interest:      * A Hundred Years of Japanese Film         * TokyoScope: The Japanese Cult Film Companion       * The Japanese Film: Art and Industry (Expanded Edition)       * Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema       * The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films       * The Japanese Filmography        * A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors          * A New History of Japanese Cinema: A Century of Narrative Film     * Reframing Japanese Cinema: Authorship, Genre, History        * Eros Plus Massacre: An Introduction to the Japanese New Wave Cinema      * Outlaw Masters of Japanese Film      * Recalling the Treasures of Japanese Cinema        * Classical Japanese Cinema Revisited        * Nippon Modern: Japanese Cinema of the 1920s and 1930s    * Cinema of Actuality: Japanese Avant-Garde Filmmaking in the Season of Image Politics       * No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema           Some of them are more specific (like the one about the Japanese New Wave) and some of them are more general (A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors for example, which I really recommend), I think you'll notice. I actually just received copies of No Borders, No Limits: Nikkatsu Action Cinema and The Midnight Eye Guide to New Japanese Film some days ago, the later one covers mostly newer movies, but it has some pages that cover directors like Seijun Suzuki, Shhei Imamura and others that were active before 1970. Also, there's a lot of books covering certain directors, but I'm guessing that you already know that and that you're more interesting in something of a more general coverage. But this list will be a good guide for starters.               Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969) by Yoshishige Yoshida. A very rich, interesting, beautiful and complex portrayal of history, sex and politics. Truly a masterpiece.      As someone already kind of mentioned, Ozu was the master when it came to movies about everyday life with great dialogue. Check out the movie already mentioned, these are also worth checking out too:        * Akibiyori (1960)        * Banshun (1949)      * Tky boshoku (1957)         The movies by Jean-Pierre   Luc Dardenne could be something for you too, they work with quite much realism, some examples:         * Le fils (2002)     * Le gamin au vlo (2011)      * Rosetta (1999)         Also, most stuff by Eric Rohmer would fit the bill. They are very heavy on dialogue which is often very good written, check out these:        * Conte d'automne (1998)       * L'amour l'aprs-midi (1972)       * Ma nuit chez Maud (1969)        And at last, three other movies by different directors I can recommend too:        * Aruitemo aruitemo (2008)      * I fidanzati (1963)          * Struktura krysztalu (1969)        Pretty much anything from Tarkovsky and Tarr. Movies like Andrey Rublyov (1966), Stalker (1979), Solyaris (1972), Stntang (1994), Krhozat (1988), and Werckmeister harmnik (2000) are full of amazing and long takes. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpJkf76X04) is a great example from Werckmeister harmnik (2000).   Another gem from Yoshida, great stuff.      Hollywood is actually a disgusting business full of sexism and racism, this is a good example. It's just sad that not many people are aware of it.   *"The first trailer shown in a U.S. film theater was in November 1913, when Nils Granlund, the advertising manager for the Marcus Loew theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical The Pleasure Seekers, opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. Loew adopted the practice, which was reported in a wire service story carried by the Lincoln, Nebraska Daily Star, describing it as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loews picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising". Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring Charlie Chaplin at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914."*           /[Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/6rjbmdu)    * Annie Hall (1977)       * Bringing up Baby (1938)        * His Girl Friday (1940)         * Holiday (1938)          * Manhattan (1979)       * Ninotchka (1938)         * The Awful Truth (1937)        * The Lady Eve (1941)       * The Philadelphia Story (1940)     * Trouble in Paradise (1932)        I just throw them in the trashcan.   The final duel scene from C'era una volta il West (1968):     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb3P0fuM1c   You don't have to watch the first one to get the second one. On another note, I wouldn't recommend the movie at all. It's just dumb, disgusting and silly trash in the worst ways possible. There's tons of other movies that are ten times better to watch.   L'eclisse (1962), I stumbled upon it years ago on a film site. It was amazing and today it's one of my absolute favourites. It also pretty much helped to start my interest in cinema.   Possession (1981).   I think it was La passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928), a great one.   You should watch Tanin no kao (1966), it's the best.   Masahiko Shimazu, Benkei Shiganoya, John Cazale, Hohi Aoki, Jean Keraudy, El Hedi ben Salem, and Karuna Bannerjee.   Of course. Collecting is fun, I also like physical copies. And some have interesting extra features.      Tanin no kao (1966).   There's some interesting coverage on these sites right now:        https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/category/daily      https://mubi.com/notebook/         http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/all        http://www.filmcomment.com/         http://www.ioncinema.com/         I know I've seen many people that believed True Romance (1993) was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but he was the one who wrote the script and Tony Scott directed it.   The Godfather (1972), Taxi Driver (1976) and A Clockwork Orange (1971) seem to have that rating if you want movies from the top 100 over at IMDb. If you haven't seen them, I would say that all three of them should be seen if you have the slightest interest in cinema. Maybe a little obvious, but it's hard for me to figure out what you've seen when you're talking about the ratings. Considering what other movies you like, I think they could be something in your taste.      I was quite curious how the movie probably butchered everything that had to do with BDSM. And I wasn't really surprised that it would be bad, I expected it. But I think it's very helpful, useful and interesting to watch many different kind of movies., which I try to do as much as I can.   Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) probably tops my list of the ones I've seen.   The goodbye between Piero (Alain Delon) and Vittoria (Monica Vitti) in L'eclisse (1962).   It's not allowed to advertise, promote, post or comment about illegal filesharing of movies or any other media here.   It's not available to stream legally yet.   Tanin no kao (1966), with no doubt the best one. Also, Les yeux sans visage (1960) is another one I hold quite high up on my top list.   La jete (1962) by Chris Marker, the movie Twelve Monkeys (1995) was inspired by. It's great, darker and much better than Twelve Monkeys (1995), Donnie Darko (2001) or any similar stuff. When it comes to time travel, don't miss out on Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais either.   Woody Allen.         This one is great! It has a fast pace and is cool as hell.         Ah, but have you seen Norifumi Suzuki? That's some completely bonkers cuckoo-bugfuckery right there.      You mean movies by the director? I've seen some scenes from Fury anego den: Inoshika Och (1973), Christina Lindberg is in that one, heh. Other than that, I haven't really explored that Suzuki further.      There's tons of great stuff. I really don't know what you have seen, but I'll give you three great recommendations:       * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)     * Stalker (1979)     * Suna no onna (1964)       You should try Belle de jour (1967), a great one by Luis Buuel.   * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)        * Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)        * Only Lovers Left Alive (2013)      * Vampyr (1932)        	121
             If you don't have any genetic eye disorders or diseases you could try some exercises to strenghten your eye muscles which in result will help with better focus and vision.  My friend has a Stargardt's Disease ( which only affects like 1:100000) and currently there is no known cure as even glasses can't help.   20/70 to 20/160 : is considered moderate visual impairment, or moderate low vision  20/200 to 20/400 : is considered severe visual impairment, or severe low vision   It's great things are starting to move in this area as we are forgotting that estimates for blind people exceed 39 million worldwide and more than 246 million have some kind of severe or moderate visual impairment. This is probably one of the worst impairments a person can have.                                 You are right about range limit, but still as you said some preventive methods should be taken in account - better safe than sorry.  	18
 I'm not a very active user and most of my comments hardly ever get seen. I'm used to having 1 or two people upvote my posts every once in a while. I got suspicious one day when I made what I thought was a good comment on a new thread and got nothing. So I went to /r/shadowban and confirmed it.    Its a way reddit originally fought spammers. They make it so none of your posts are visible to anyone except you. You can't tell that you where banned. It was a good way to fight spam bots because they wouldn't know they where tuned out and go on doing their thing without bothering anyone.   Now they use it for anyone they don't agree with. You get no message or warning. I didn't know it happened to me for at least 2 months.  	2
 Edit: or emotional struggles Edit 2: it also doesn't have to be serious struggles, anything you just weren't expecting or didn't understand before   This looks delicious! I don't love eggs but this looks really great.  Side note: My dad went to Mexico once and stayed at a resort, ordered room service for the following morning while intoxicated, ended up ordering 3 different plates of this, among other things. He ate a bite off each plate lol.   http://imgur.com/Zh5cg0r  Pretty sure I nailed it. A++ Art Skills.   LOL, this is fantastic. After that scene I could only picture that pitch as Don just picking up a gun and shooting himself in the face.   	4
 Cool I still thought they were using two different cores, one with attachment points and one without.  It makes sense though that they would merge them and just not attach the legs, since they are all about simplification and keeping things as uniform as possible.   Yea I would guess something went wrong too, but it would be nice to hear something official from SpaceX.     Wait so do all the cores have leg attachment points now?   takeoffs are optional, landings are mandatory  I love that quote its a great truism from the aviation industry.     While it is true that the successful burns after entry are signs that no catastrophic damage is taking place, until they can do more thorough testing you can not rule out the possibility that the engines are experiencing stresses during entry that they would not experience otherwise.  Weather or not these stresses would affect the life of the engine is also unknown.    Exploring new frontiers in engineering and rocketry is fun.   Do we have any ideas why SpaceX has not released anything on CRS-4?   That is true   You are mistaken, this is only the second landing attempt for the drone ship.  The first one was [CRS-5](https://vine.co/v/OjqeYWWpVWK) where the grid-fins ran out of hydraulic fluid.  The second was [CRS-6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhMSzC1crr0) that happened just a few days ago.  There was supposed to be a try back in Febuary, on the [DSCOVR Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvHJSIKP0Hg) but due to heavy seas the [Drone Ship was Disabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKhwGOVGWUs). SpaceX instead just did a soft water landing on where the drone ship was supposed to be if it had not been disabled.  Elon said that the booster landed within 10m of where it was supposed to. I think that might be where your confusion came from about the booster missing the drone ship, but in reality they were not trying to land on the drone ship, because it had been damaged.     Check out www.crewbay.com you might be able to find what you are looking for.      You also have to remember that there is throttle control, so if the computer calculates that the rocket will reach 0 vertical velocity too high or to low, it can throttle to move that goldilox zone to the correct altitude.   They have a good point but they forgot about things like Juno   How did you do that?   It is cool when you think about it.   Ok I will address your points. Starting with your last one.  Yes police can do this if you were the first person to buy it but if you bought the gun from a pawn shop or at a gun show or other places where sales are not tracked, it is basically impossible to figure out where the gun came from besides where it was originally sold.  Addressing your points about stolen guns.  It is not hard to think of a way to remedy this.  Simply have a place to report when your gun is stolen.  I do not think that it is unreasonable to require people to report a stolen gun in a timely manner after all it is a weapon and it is dangerous, the police should know if it has fallen into the wrong hands.  Even if you didn't it does not necessarily mean you would go to jail.  A fine or a small misdemeanor charge for failing to report your gun as stolen would be fair and not very burdensome.    As for the gun store being robbed thing.  I would think if they dont do this already, a gun store would have an inventory of what weapons they have in stock as well as the serial numbers associated with all those weapons.  Simply go through the inventory and figure out which guns were stolen and then make sure that it is noted in the registry.  When those guns start to turn up at crime scenes you can interrogate the criminals about where they got the guns from, and start to make connections and possibly figure out who the people who robbed the store are, if you haven't already caught them from security footage and other evidence from the crime scene.  I do not think that a gun registry would fall apart from a few stores or people getting robbed.  I think the bigger problem for a gun registry would be the huge amount of guns on the market right now that are not registered.  But this could also be addressed with some simple but effective measures.  You don't have to require everyone to come register all their guns now or go to jail.  You could simply start requiring that all sales and transactions from a certain date forward must be logged and imputed into the registry.  Then its as simple as targeting seller that are not following the regulation.  Over time the registry would grow as new guns enter the market and old ones are bought and sold and are added to the registry.    Now obviously there will be a black market, but there is already a black market for guns.  The idea is over time with more and more guns will be registered it will steadily make it easier to keep track of how guns are getting from stores to crime scenes.  You can imagine a lot of these regulations like regulations on owning a car.  In fact owning and driving a car is much harder than owning and using a gun in most circumstances.  For a car in order to own and drive it you must have a drivers liscence, the car must be registered to you, you must re-register each year and pay apropriate taxes and your car must be inspected each year there are tons of things like this for cars.  What I am proposing here for guns is only one small part of the tons of stuff you already have to do for a car.  All you would have to do is register the gun in your name, and when it is sold to someone else you must report them as the new owner.  the same way that when you sell someone a car the ownership must be transfer to their name.   Dude chill out we are having a nice discussion here no need to explode.    Let me explain.  In my opinion what I said is constitutional.(It's just my opinion it's not a big deal)  I don't think that the second amendment was ever intended to cover things like cannons, mortars, RPGs, and automatic weapons.  I also think that the 2nd amendment does not mean that reasonable regulations can not be placed upon the sale of firearms.  I think basic things like background checks and a nationally regulated gun registry are perfectly reasonable regulations.  I also feel the about hand guns the same way that you feel about explosives that you should be able to get them but it should not be as easy as a rifle.    I am trying to explain that it is not that our beliefs are completely different, We are just at different parts of the spectrum.  One end of the spectrum is ban on all fire arms/weapons, and the other end is buy whatever weapon you want without restrictions.    As for the Second Amendment, the constitution was designed to be able to be modified.  I don't necessarily think it should be, but the second amendment is not the end all be all.  After all the 18th amendment bans alcohol, but obviously that got changed.  The Constitution was designed to be difficult to change not impossible, and the Founding fathers made it with the full intention that it would change in the years to come.  Just to be clear I am not saying we should get rid of the 2nd amendment.  I just wanted to make that clear.   That is what is important to understand here  That is where you draw your line, Explosives.  The same way you feel about explosives is the way I feel about hand guns.  Hand guns is where I draw my line.   Ok what about a missiles? Should people Be able to buy a Javelin a patriot, or a cruise missile?  And why do you want to keep the laws on explosives?   Right now you have to go through a lot of paperwork though.  You said you wanted to get rid of that.  I am saying would you want to make it so that anyone who wants to could buy an RPG no restrictions just like you said above?   Would you support people being able to buy RPG's and Bazookas?   With this innovation, how long would it take to go into production if they started developing an electric or hybrid 172 right now.   Not quite right now  the Solar panels can't keep up with the draw.  But it is getting better and better   Would you support people being able to buy new machine guns?   I think you don't understand what innocent until proven guilty is.  IUPG means they can't put you in jail until they actually convict you with a crime.  Basically you can not be labeled a murderer until they actually convict you of the murder.  In this case they would charge you with not doing the gun registration correctly, and then it would go to court and you would either be convicted or not convicted.    Until you actually are convicted they **can not** put you in jail and hold you indefinitely.   I am not saying it would be 100 percent perfect, but having a gun registry would make it much easier to see where guns are going at least on the legal side.  As I said above.  Yea one stolen gun would not be something that a gun registry would work well against but if the gun registry has tracked a bunch of stolen guns back to you over time it starts looking a lot like those guns were not stolen by accident (AKA straw buyer.).  The point is not that it would be perfect, but it would make a huge difference with keeping track of guns and how they are they are ending up at crime scenes.  Imagine if you are arrested for a drug crime and they find a gun all they have to do to check if it is legally bought or not is go to the gun registry and see if you are the legal owner.  Right now they pretty much have no idea how you got it.   Of course gun registration would not be very effective against one guy but when they have tracked down 5 guns to you you start to look a bit more suspicious.    Also about existing laws that are similar to gun registration.  They are a joke.  Usually only the first sale needs to be logged or is logged and some of the laws say that the log is not allowed to be kept on a computer, which is crazy.  Plus I believe none of them are interstate which makes them almost pointless.   I feel like the advantage to the rules I mentioned is they are much easier to enforce compared to things like laws against concealed carry and stuff.  Although I support these rules.   yea I agree   Trying to grow the sub quickly before the New Horizons Space Probe encounter with Pluto in June.    We need to people to help out posting updates, and plug the subreddit in other subs to try to grow it in popularity.  Please come over to /r/New_Horizons and check it out even if you are not interested in modding.   Wow that was a crazy attack I didn't realize that plane was still around.   Go you.   I saw an article recently saying we should send a rover to Pluto, how big and costly would this be?   oops i don't know how that happened.  I thought i linked to the picture.      I support what you said about handguns.  Although I don't feel like you should get rid of them I feel like it should be much harder to get them.   The problem is the way they are worded now is so ambiguous that a lot of times whoever shoots first is in the right.  That is very dangerous because where does it stop.  Defining what is a threat to you can be very ambiguous.   I don't agree with that statement.  I support gun control but I do not support a total ban.   Ok I hope you see this, because this is important to me.    I support more gun control.  I am not one of those guys that has never touched a gun.  I personally own a 20 gauge Remington 1100 shotgun, and a my family has a 410 as well as a rifle and an antique double barrel shotgun.  I have shot guns on many occasions I have shot pistols, rifles, and shotguns.  I enjoy skeet shooting although I have not had the time to go lately.    That said I support significantly more restrictions on guns than what we have now.  I am not saying we should get rid of guns, but it should not be as simple as going to a pawn shop or gun convention and just handing over the cash.    These are weapons not toys and can kill you and others.  That is the first thing you ever learn when learning to handle a gun.  Yet in many cases buying gun is easier and requires much less time or over-site than buying a car.  I support some very basic but effective forms of gun legislation.  1. A national gun registry.  The reason for this is simple.  If you start tracking who owns which guns it will be easier to track down who the last legal owner was.  Gun advocates like to say criminals will not follow the laws, and that is true, but 99% of guns originate from a legal source.  Some guy buying a gun in a gun store or a gander mountain or something.  The trick to reducing the amount of illegal guns is tracking down who is buying them legally and then selling them illegally(straw buyers).  A gun registry would create a history for a gun and then it would be as simple as going to the last legal owner and asking what happened to the gun afterwords.  Perhaps asking why he or the guy he sold it to did not go through the correct procedures of registering the gun with the new owner.   The problem is right now the police find a gun at a crime scene, and they don't even know where it came from.  It could have originated from practically anywhere and that makes it incredibly hard to track down who these straw buyers are.   2. Secondly I support universal background checks for all sales private or public.  If you want to buy a gun we should make sure you are sane, and not a criminal, its that simple. 3. Last, and this is not as important as the first two, I support significantly more restrictions on handguns compared to shotguns and rifles.  They are small and concealable and that makes them much more dangerous.  If you want to own one I think you should have to jump through a few more hoops.  The fact is it is a lot easier to commit a crime with a hand gun than a rifle.  Now I understand that these would not be 100% effective off the bat.  But the idea is over time you would be reducing the amount of illegal weapons and keeping much better track of the ones out there. As well as making it harder for criminals and crazy people to get ahold of them.    Please tell me what you think I'd like to know what you think about the things I proposed.   God this made me laugh so hard.   Interesting fact Mark Hamilton played Fire Lord Ozai in Avatar the Last Airbender   Wow I am amazed that guy didn't get his arm torn off.   Dude we should send this to Google it would be so easy for them to add this support.  Compared to foreign languages this would be a breeze to program for.   I think we need to get Peter to do an AMA.   I understand that we do not host content.  By carful I mean not get into the habit of supporting leaked material.  /r/spacex should not be the place to get the latest inside unauthorized scoop on SpaceX.   That is awesome its too bad there is not a ATLA video game 10/10 would play.   Yea I hope nobody ever does anything that stupid.  It would be bad for everyone involved on so many levels.   Yea I am not saying the videos or the community are bad, but we just need to be careful.  I am glad the Admins are already on top of this and ready incase a bigger more serious leak happens.   Well that was weird.  Serious question how did they get a 3D model of Korra?  Is that how they do all of the animation for Avatar?   Yea I feel like it is becoming very dangerous how Terrorism charges are thrown around these days.  It's starting to become a charge that you can apply to anything.  It's starting to become like thought police. Did he want to hurt America? Than he is a terrorist.     Yea I like the videos, but I feel like this is not good for them to be getting leaked like this.  I really hope SpaceX keeps releasing the videos.    I remember somebody mentioning that SpaceX will continue to support /r/spacex and the fan community until they become a thorn in their side. I feel like leaks like this are starting to make us look more like a liability rather than just a fun fan site.  It does not seem like much but Imagine if someone posted detailed engine schematics or something I doubt that SpaceX would continue to support us.      While that would be fun, I think SpaceX would not want to take the risk of its competitors figuring something out from said wreckage.     Its crazy how similar they look to smoke from a  fire, and volcano eruptions just a lot slower.   Perhaps he needs to find a new committee to chair.      Put it in the sidebar than.  This is awesome.   Where was the antique roadshow reference?   Wow that was awesome I wonder if the engines and legs might still be on the deck?   good thinking   That would be great.  The guy has a great message (campaign finance reform), and form the video interview the Tampa Bay times did it sounds like he has his head on strait(Ignoring the fact he flew into DC that is pretty crazy).  He didn't just fly it up there, he did a lot of planning, and it sounds like he did his best to alert authorities of his plans, kind of amazing no one stopped him.   I love the [video at the bottom](http://launch.newsinc.com/share.html?trackingGroup=69016 siteSection=tbtimes videoId=28895951) of the [Washington post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/04/15/a-gyrocopter-just-landed-on-the-capitol-lawn/).  he does not sound like a crazy nut job at all, he is trying to make a statement about campaign finance.  What a great thing to make a statement about.      god this video is great    http://www.washingtonpost.com/posttv/national/protesters-describe-gyrocopters-capitol-descent/2015/04/15/a9527df2-e3a6-11e4-ae0f-f8c46aa8c3a4_video.html  These guys are just having a great time not the freaked out crap you usually see   I wonder what they are going to do with the gyrocopter?  Will it end up on one of those government auction sites?   I didn't realize the pictures before were in black and white.   You should post this at /r/New_Horizons.

Trying new things makes a girl very cool.  I don't mind if a girl has not done something before, what makes her very uncool in my mind is when she is completely unwilling to try it.   Example, I like camping.  I don't mind if a girl has never been camping before but before you say no you should at least come camping with me and try it, before saying you don't want to.  who knows you might find something you like.    TLDR: Trying new things makes you very cool.   wow a 7 digit phone number those were the days.   Wow that was silly.    I don't think that any of the User tagging features are working.   http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111175529/4102706-3453564798-Right.jpg   Any idea when it is going to become available?   lol It will be interesting to see what /u/spkr4thedead51 thinks about this.   Did we figure out who won?  It did sort of land on the barge yet there is not currently a rocket on the barge.   I think your logic is good, but it looks like the problem here was not landing, but moving too fast sideways while landing.  They landed right in the center of the the drone ship.    Plus with your C130 option assuming you could make it so a C130 could carry the first stage, how would you detach the 1st stage so the C130 could land?   http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/reusability  Yes they want to bring it back to land.  Yes it uses a lot of fuel, but its not that bad actually.   I found the NASA live stream here https://youtu.be/XfJoDxX0m7s   Yea Challenger happened because they said what is the big difference between 20 degrees and 40.  Pushing the boundaries and saying what is the big difference, is how you loose a rocket.   I think the nasa live stream had way better shots than the SpaceX one.   We have to do this lol   There are a lot of variables but Echo has it right they could post the video in hour or two a couple days or sometimes the videos never get released.  My best guess it they will release the video within the next couple days especially since the quality is pretty good.   https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/588082574183903232  pictures from landing!!!   Its too bad this did not get more upvotes, it is amazing.   It will be interesting to see if they can find another objet to do a flyby of.   I think there is a strong chance the OP is making this up.   Are there really crop dusting jobs available out west?   I think those are fine and the mods will let them through, because they are original and interesting.  I think the mods are try to stem the flow of the boring guy in a 172 pictures.  They all look the same, and the only thing they really are is a random guy sitting in a 172.   I agree I am kind of getting tired of the look I am flying pics and its just a dude in a 172.  The selfies are fine as long as they are interesting.   thats awesome so informative   wow I cant believe how ~~fat~~ fast that happened. lol  Go you  Edit: LOL   Your official SpaceX youtube link just reroutes to /r/spacex I didn't know if you knew         did you see color changer thing also had a malicious button pushing script when the date is more than 11   thanks for this   Can you be more descriptive, is that the extension that puts the button on chrome?  i want to know if i have it or not      wow very cool thanks for the information I am sure i will have more questions.   All of these things have been building, there is a significant amount of the population that has cameraphones now compared to the mid 2000s when it was still a novelty.  Second police did not suddenly get better armed, and start pushing the limits of their authority immediately after 9/11, it has been a slow and gradual process.  Eventually people get tired of it though.    Many people forget that moments like this take a long time, the main part of the civil rights movement took over a decade.    Police have been pushing the limits for a while now.  and with recent revelations about overreaches in areas like civil forfeiture, and police brutality, people are starting to push back.   Thanks thats what I thought, but I wasn't quite sure.    Also follow up question could you give me a brief summary of satellite receivers.    I understand they serve as a backup to your main receiver, but I don't really understand, and I don't understand how they work.    Hello everyone, I googled, but could not find a definitive answer to my question.  Recently I bought a Spektrum DX-8 transmitter i am looking for some receivers.  My question is if it says in the description of the receiver that it is DSM2/DSMX compatible, does that mean it will be compatible with my Spektrum transmitter?    I understand Spektrum transmitters use DSM2 and DSMX but I want to be sure they will be compatible before I buy.            I am so excited for June   It wasn't meant to be personal.  But your proposal is a little bit out there.  What are you an engineer in?   The fairings are already made of carbon-fiber which is inherently hi-temperature resistant and probably would not require much additional material to survive Mars entry.  You don't know what you are talking about.  Making the fairings into heat shields would require major modifications, and  add a great deal of weight.  Saying they are both carbon while sort of true, excludes the fact, that they are manufactured completely differently.  The fairings are made of an aluminum carbon honeycomb, meaning most of the volume is air.  Heat shields on the other hand tend to be thick, relatively dense compared to the fairings, and designed to ablate away when reaching high temperatures.  In order to get a fairing to not melt and break up when entering at the extreme velocities from orbit and beyond orbit, you would basically need to attach a giant heat shield to your fairing.  What does this mean for your theory?  You would need to attach a heat shield to the outside of the whole fairing in order to make it even plausibly into a heat shield.  Which makes you think why are we attaching a giant heavy heat shield to the entire outside of this fairing instead of just to our spacecraft.  The benefits are not there,  why would you use the fairings which you will have to heavily modify when you could just take along a heat shield that is specifically designed for the purpose.  Read the other posts too they offer other good more plausible reasons to why they would want to recover the fairings.   We will be posting updates about the mission, and all the cool pictures that New Horizons will start sending back in the coming months when it gets closer to Pluto.      Thanks for the suggestion I will definitely post it there int the next few days once there is more content.   You literally just made all three of those subs in the last day _   I messaged you.      Yea its really to bad spirit got stuck.  Spirit had it tough with wheel motors going bad and stuff.   Lol, thanks for the enthusiasm, but I am looking for one of those three things.    If you are really interested in modding just keep looking.  I had never modded before either until only a few months ago.     we need to get assigned our position automatically, because i have no idea which one i am in.   I have very basic CSS experience, I have been mostly working off of the template over at /r/redplanet that some other guy made. But I have been getting more experienced.   You can see my version at /r/opportunityrover and /r/New_Horizons  If you are interested in either of them I can make them work on /r/AvailableSubs.   I can change some basic stuff in this template like the height and color of the header, and the size font and color of the name of the Sub.    I can work on adding other stuff if you are interested, just tell me what you want and I'll see if I can to it.  Like I said I am still a bit of a beginner.  Edit: I was looking at /r/startups and it is a variation of the /r/naut/ theme if you want I can work on installing the /r/naut theme for you as well.  Edit2: I was looking around and found some other themes that you may be interested in.  Take a look at /r/MindasHQ, /r/edurne, /r/boxed, and /r/flatblue if you are interested, i should be able to do any of these themes as well.                           Looking for Mods for /r/New_Horizons a subreddit about the [New Horizons space mission to Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons).  The objective is to grow this Subreddit quickly and make it the place for updates about the mission.   *** I am looking for some Mods that can be active and help post updates about the mission.  I am looking for people that are interested in space stuff and have already been active in other space subreddits.   *** If you have experience with CSS that is great, I am looking for someone that can make the subreddit look better than the basic CSS editing I have done so far.  *** Please come have a look at  https://www.reddit.com/r/New_Horizons/  Post if you are interested   Chill dude, it was just a thought experiment.  There is no way this is happening any time soon.   Yea I subscribed because I wanted a more whole picture of politics, and not just the liberal side.  Then I found out that they really were crazy.  They still have theories about how Obama [lost his citizenship in Indonesia](http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/31ft1a/arabic_is_most_common_language_of_refugees_in/cq1owxa) and that he is a ["Muslim sympathizer"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/31ft1a/arabic_is_most_common_language_of_refugees_in/cq1bzu6).   That is so cool you guys built that.     Don't worry go over to /r/Conservative and they still think its about to happen.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/31ft1a/arabic_is_most_common_language_of_refugees_in/cq17q4v     It seemed to me that those were tiny rockets at the end of his boots and hands.

 EDIT, did manage to find the story in full. The study cited by WSJ is old data from 1992-2003 whereas the study referenced by NASA was conducted between 1991-2011, a much wider breadth of data that includes practically an entire decade of additional information compared to the survey cited by WSJ.  If you read the NASA link it shows the reference to IOPublishing, which conducted the research of peer-reviewed journals, citing its sources and who compiled it.   Nope, it's true.  http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/      "Don't the poor understand that they are better off when the rich make more?" (or something like that)  -Jack Donaghy, 30 Rock   Perhaps, but 97 percent of climatologists have agreement on the future. Scientists have been able to, in the past, predict the future or at least identify phenomena before there was direct evidence of it. Charles Darwin looked at an orchid once with a nectary that was 12 inches deep inside the flower. He hypothesized that their must be a butterfly species with a 12-inch probiscus that would be needed to pollinate the flower. Eventually, said butterfly was discovered.  Haley of course, predicted the reemergence of the comet that was later named after him.  I don't know when 97 percent of economists agreed on anything, let alone market conditions. And I certainly can't remember a time when economists were all in agreement that a crash was coming.  They tend to be shills for market makers and Wall Street interests who profit off of bull markets. The same interests then profit from the downfall that investors never see coming because, economists fail to identify said downfalls when they occur.  	5

 Or "I'd like to pass on answering that question."   Mexico is opposed to nationals being murdered in foreign countries not on its native soil.   Looking to the future Vint Cerf is seeing the computer as a possible obstacle for future historians.   Did anyone expect a different outcome?   I post this article to stir discussion. I do not agree with the author on everything in this story.  I take particular objection to the authors assessment of seasoned journalists. We are not lazy nor hacks. There are good and bad journalists of all ages. Flat out statements about the abilities or inabilities of older journalists are ageist.    Being snarky certainly does not add anything to the discussion. Please try to be constructive.   So the stupid days are over? I didn't know.   In some subreddits an offensive user name is enough to get you banned. Individuals have to really consider what their user name says to others.   Racial/heritage slurs are not appropriate at NTO   Please look at the same site's section on [cruelty in the Bible.](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/long.html)  By your logic Christianity/Judaism are inherently violent.   The idea that a trained professional (police officer) can not tell if someone is disoriented, is either a training failure or a person not suited to be a peace officer.    Thanks for your comment. I have been where you are. I really admire your ability to keep your focus. It is so easy to lose hope.   Keep looking for that job, no matter what it is. One day that phone will ring.   The headline says 5,000 the article says 5 million.   It just showed up.   This is the best [pic](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-31085336) I could find.   Sounds good to me.   Please blame the article, it is the first sentence.   Thanks for understanding.   Then the fault does not lie with the writer but the editor who read this story and could not find fault with the obit as written.   It is the opening paragraph. Please do not try to defend this poorly written obit for sake of being a contrarian.    So what do they think about Marie Le Pen and the PEDIGA movement?   It is only six words in the most important sentence of the obit.    Their mother is a hamster and their father smells of elderberries.  Go away or we'll taunt you a second time.   Having also worked in newspapers you have to wonder why this obit had to be written on the fly.   Another article critical of The Australian's obit was [written by the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/30/colleen-mcculloch-well-celebrate-a-woman-for-anything-as-long-as-its-not-her-talent?CMP=share_btn_fb)   We are still number one in bankers who avoid criminal prosecutions.   Had no idea. Sorry.   These announcements are pre-written news stories. Thy are intended to run as is by local news media outlets. The idea is so bad that after being questioned by the news media Gov. Pence is backing off his proposal.   It took a couple of seconds but it just loaded for me.   They needed more than closure they needed justice.   When providers refuse to upgrade services because of geographic location or economic status the issue becomes political and the president has the obligation to defend those being disenfranchised.    What restrictions are being placed on providers from providing cheap, fast internet? Oh right, companies want you to pay extra for faster speeds. The problem isn't the government but the providers.   I suggest [First Unitarian Universalist Church of Columbus](http://firstuucolumbus.org/) for their warm and open approach. The church does not discriminate against alternative lifestyles. The UU certainly is not preachy.   I am not a member but I go there on occasion.    How has that worked so far?   It amazes me that it took 75 years to right this historic wrong. Many of the doctorates may have been been awarded to victims of the Holocaust.    Black sheriff killed by white survivalist, if the the roles were reversed do you think there would have been charges? You know the answer would be yes.   The wikipedia article makes no claims that the group has training facilities in the US. The article also makes it clear that the group does not appear on any US terror list. So I'm not sure this proves your point.   You insult journalism and journalism schools when you use those terms in the same sentence with Neil Cavuto.   And what did these calls have to do with terrorism? So now the US admits tracking calls to stop "terrorist attacks" and to look for supposed drug dealers.    So FXCM is too big to fail?   Facts and evidence just confuse the issue. /s   I want no executions. American exceptionalism doesn't mean we get to be worse than the next guy.   I think former host Mike Huckabee is more their cup of tea.   We know who isn't getting the Faux News endorsement.   Fascinating historical tidbit that I never really thought about.   Comments that come off as racist do not further the discussion.    They have little recourse if they are not willing to play hard ball. Every bill needs to have an amendment added to it to block the house SS change. Those not willing to vote to go back to the old rules should be made to pay at the voting booth.   Sorry. I looked for another submission on this issue and didn't find one.   Having lived in NY, I feel no safer knowing that police officers are using illegal chokeholds to subdue suspects.  I do feel the use of this illegal tactic has been used on suspects who have committed minor offenses. The end result is the police are being criminal in trying to capture "criminals."   It was not Iraq that didn't agree to a status of forces agreement but the US. The US didn't not want its forces to be subject to local laws.   So lets collectively punish all Muslims for the actions of a very few. The problem is when people talk in absolutes which allows them to blame everyone when only a few are guilty.   This is Rupert Murdoch, he believes the only unjustified violence is the violence he doesn't support .   No, they will just ignore the ruling. As we all know the police believe themselves to be above the law.    Thanks. It looks like NASA saw the Nordgren posters and created their own versions.   What next federal hate crime protection for white nationalists?   Happy cake day   This settlement is was less than Shell would have paid if the the spill happened in Europe or North America.   From Wikipedia about Byrd's record after his vote on the 1964 Civil Rights Act:  For the 20032004 session, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)[62] rated Byrd's voting record as being 100 percent in line with the NAACP's position on the 33 Senate bills they evaluated. 16 other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10 million in federal funding for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his Dream was the American Dream, and few ever expressed it more eloquently."    The difference is that Robert Byrd renounced his KKK past and became an advocate for civil rights.     It's amazing how powerful the left is according to some. They have the ability to convince 98 percent of climate scientists with a totally false theory. /s   Sometimes when everyone agrees it is not a conspiracy but the truth.   What Bush's actions say to me is there is fire below the smoke.   Thanks for the heads up.   Kinshasa   We have to remember Duke was Republican Party official and a Republican State Rep. in the late 80s and early 90s. Prior to that he had run and failed to win office as a Dem.   The mysterious death of a UN official who was taking the world out of the era of colonialism is bound to raise questions. Hammarskjold death was as shocking to the world as the assassination of JFK that happened two years later.  EDITED: grammar   It does matter. Just like it mattered to reexamine the assassinations US President John F Kennedy and Swedish PM Olaf Palme.    This plane crash stunned the world 50 years ago. Questions stlll remain about what really happened. This investigation may help clear the air.   Speculators are always moved by real news stories. The problem is when speculators take nonexistent or inconsequential news and manipulate the market to increase their profits.   Especially when they are protecting their patronage networks.   Why does every reply have to go back to the old sexist adage that women are bad drivers? Can we get past the silly notion or are you deep down as sexist as Saudi society.    Failing to file court records is not an everyday occurrence. Why were papers not filed? Has there been any punishment for the person or persons who made the error? Have there been other instances of failing to file paperwork with the court? Who was in charge of the investigation?  Just a couple of beginning questions to get to the truth about this "paperwork" error.   Five finger discount. The real question is why isn't this process computerized. To some this is exactly the reason not to computerize these records.   If you listen to BP the Gulf has been cleaned and they are the saviors of the environment.   So your saying law enforcement went ahead with a wiretap without legal authorization or as the article says they had authorization and the document no longer exists. I think the latter seems more plausible.   Please keep your comments focused on Economics not your personal opinions about immigration.   Even if your reading is correct, some of those services being provided by private contractors has been security. That security included protection for high value targets.   About your insult about getting my skills from Faux News, I can assure you during my 30 year reporting career I have never been employed by Murdoch interests.  EDITED; Please read the story before commenting  Still, the preparations to increase the number of contractors - who can be responsible for everything from security to vehicle repair and food service - underscores Obama's growing commitment in Iraq   The government isn't allowed to ask for larger fines when the oil industry is reaping windfall profits. In this case some of the excess profits were the result of the disaster BP caused.   Many of those who came before the current immigrants snuck under fences, used false documents, extended their stays indefinitely and were not recognized as illegals. However when their skin is brown it is easier to equate the new immigrants as being other and not no one of us.   That will benefit a non-first world country.   Sending a private army to Iraq is more than providing military advisers. Supplying a proxy army is just providing US boots on the ground without military uniforms.   Do you call your friends working off the books illegal workers? i don't think so. Those who are emigrating to the US are no more illegal that than those who came before them, the Italians, Jews, Irish, Eastern Europeans, Chinese and others.   Five million workers doing the jobs the vast majority of documented workers will not take  Five million workers who are exploited by unscrupulous employers  Five million workers who often pay taxes through their paychecks but are denied benefits like other workers.   Is that why Brand is continuing to make public appearances as a celebrity (musician/comedian)?   Russell Brand is a comedian by profession, while Beck is a pundit and leader of a movement. I don't see the equivalence.   BP says it has paid $14 billion to cleanup the Gulf. Just because you fix your mistake doesn't mean you shouldn't be fined for causing the damage in the first place.   The fine seems low to me.   History repeats itself but there is no savior for Russia.   Usually a DA would choose a story line and present it the grand jury. In this case all the testimony was presented without guidance which had the outcome that no one could agree on what happened. This made the no bill of indictment the most likely outcome.   Chris Hayes on MSNBC is talking about the chart tonight for some additional insight. The clip in not up on the web at this time.   How does killing a US official "support" anyone's reelection campaign? Please don't answer the question is rhetorical.      For those wanting a bettr source please [check out this article in the LA Times.](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-a-rhinohorse-india-20141120-story.html)  Thanks to /u/Athterath for the tip.   I'm sorry I forget racism is not politics.   Not a fix but a fib.   Plague is still around and is treatable with modern medicines if caught quickly. The disease is extremely contagious. There are a number of cases in the US Southwest every year.  EDIT: It is not contagious but rather carried by fleas which are rampant in areas with plague.    Certainly you do not mean 300 million Walmart shoppers in the US. [The entire population of the US is under 320 million.](http://www.census.gov/popclock/)   I thought it could be borderline. Thanks for the heads up.    [Here is a link to the journal](http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/early/recent) with the info on getting the article at the bottom of the page.   Stripping the young women is an act of shaming them. This would certainly send a message to these women not to wear mini-skirts. It also sends the message that women need to be controlled by society (men).   I'm sorry that I double posted. I put the URL of every submission into Reddit's search engine to make sure that my post is an original. For some reason it doesn't always work on BBC stories.   No, conspiracy to evade safety laws.   "To prove I"m not racist I didn't use the N***** word." /s   I don't think so. [BP's profit in 2013 was 15 billion almost enough to cover the fine.](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/bp/financials) This does not take into account the 40 billion BP set aside for the Deepwater Horizon disaster.   This is a way to get mine owners to pay up or go to jail. Now I wish someone could turn their attention to bankers.   Barbour: "I always use racial slurs when talking about the President of the US." /s   Barbour: "I always use racial slurs when talking about the President of the US." /s   Nestle is an adherent of the old adage "there is no bad publicity."   If President Obama had made a strong defense of net neutrality before the midterm election would we be facing a Republican control Congress? A Congress which is in the hip pocket of the cable/telecommunications industry.    However, no one is going to jail.   I am also a poll worker and I love that it has made you feel more connected to the political process.   Yes, people should give up their right to chose their representatives and let Christian fundamentalists, right-wing bigots and the 1% chose for them. That sounds like a good idea. /s   It is hard not to be pessimistic when the Ohio Democratic Party is such a woeful mess. The answer is to turn the ODP into a real party that is seriously interested in winning elections.   The problem was not Redfern's personality but his failure to professionalize the the party's operation and his inability to have a vision for building the Democratic Party. The party has not had anyone in charge with a real vision since at least the 1980s.   Please see the [article from the BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29859942) to understand how 100,000 people could be involved in this protest.   Ebola doesn't effect just people over the age of 21.    Tell that to the millions of senior citizens who receive Medicare which has  lowered the poverty rate for the elderly.   Given the arsenal displayed in Ferguson, I have to wonder what new military toys St. Louis County has picked up now. The money I'm sure would have been better spent f it was used to relieve economic poverty in the county.   That is if you don't include mental defects.   However, the historical complaint is that Rasmussen is pro-Republican.   I don't think Brownback would have mentioned the timing of the poll if it showed him in the lead.   Thanks. I didn't see that.   The Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 is considered to be a pivotal moment in Canadas history. It was the first time that all four Canadian divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force fought together in the First World War and is seen by some as the time that Canadians started to see themselves as an independent nation and not a colony of Great Britain   I think that is a first world problem.   NOAA says the globe averaged 60.3 degrees Celsius last month  the hottest September ever going back through 135 years of record-keeping  That would be 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Daily Caller should know that would be a world record. What else is wrong in the story?   That includes the smoke shop owners.   That is correct. Do you want Iraq politics for $400.   Basically the Iraq PM is telling the Sunnis as long as ISIS doesn't encroach on Shiite lands they are on their in fighting the so-called Islamic State.   I love learning bout historical details of events I never knew happened. While this is not a major event it certainly is unique.   There is no need for anyone on Reddit to play devils advocate. The devil does it quite well by its self.   The US may do better dropping $500,000 in bills.   Spoken like someone who has never worked at minimum wage after being a teenager.   There should be no job where your wage cannot provide you with a living wage. No one should need public assistance if they are working for 40 hours. Government should not subsidize low paying industries.   But I thought McCain criticized the president for having too many czars. The Surgeon General has not been approved by Congress because of criticism by the NRA.   I was out of work for a year in an industry which was consolidating. Yes i networked and even move to another city where I had more contacts. I was a finalist for two jobs and both fell through.   I did stay in the job and remain there. I now make more than the minimum wage.  I find your questions having to justify my existence demeaning and insulting.    I made high five figures. I lost my job and needed a new job immediately. I started at quarter above minimum wage. I must have done something wrong under your logic.   Is getting laid off their fault? Is getting sick their fault? Is losing a relationship?   Yes those people chose poverty over making more money. /s  That is one of the most shortsighted views that I have ever seen on Reddit.   Tell that to the middle age women working in Walmart or the elderly man working at McDonalds. Please get your facts straight.   Tell that the victims who survived Ebola because of the work of these nurses.   These new documents seems to add new evidence to the long running debate about Oppenheimer's loyalty to the US.   The Koch brothers.   La Liga was betting that the threat to tossed the team out of the league would get them to withdraw their support. La Liga seems to have gotten it wrong.   Once again a false equivalence argument is being used to excuse the actions of the GOP. Because some Democrats may use the same tactics as the GOP it doesn't excuse the Republican campaign of fear and intimidation.   Why aren't the companies who caused the health problems not paying the bill?   HuffPost was the first site to post this story. I am not a fan but you go with the news you get.   It would help if someone could translate this story.   Four point five million is just the price of doing business to a major driller. This will do little or nothing to cleanup the environmental damage done by drillers.   I wonder if the French Tea Party crowd are constitutional fundamentalists like their US counterparts? The French constitution is more socially liberal than the US constitution.   Also an oil spill would take everyone's mind off the Ebola crisis./s   [Yes](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/26/chiquita-revises-inversion-deal/16256989/) and a monopoly on the world's banana supply is the topping on the cake.   So conspiracists are to blame for the assassinations of JFK, MLK , RFK and others. /s   What Marx missed was the corruption of the lower classes by giving them excess cash to get them to buy into the system. Meanwhile, the rich were taking most of the money and securing their advantage for decades/centuries to come.   I don't think hedge fund managers work any harder than construction workers but their pay is wildly different. They both have different skill sets but but that doesn't explain the disparity in their wages. Some hedge fund managers make eight figure salaries.   Thanks for clearing PO Wilson before all the evidence is in. /s   Do you have a medical license? I love how people decide that those using medical marijuana are fakers who just want to get high. Proof please.   I am not sure you understand how people become eligible for medical marijuana. These are not teenagers but people with actual medical conditions.   These shareholders bought into Freddie and Fannie after 2008 in the hopes that they would recapture the dividend the Maes had not paid during the  Great Recession. These hedge funds were banking on shareholders being paid back before the government.   This is new information about how far the US was willing to go to combat the "domino theory."   I thought the chart was good even if it was not the definitive dataset that proves the world economies are about to collapse.   That was the title on the article. I know there is more than one chart but I tend to go with the story's title or the first sentence in the article.   However, every year during the switchover there are these emergency refinery shutdowns in enough separate locations to cause the price of gasoline to spike even higher than expected.    This same problem happens every year yet the refiners seem unable to solve the problem. The net result is prices rise on short supply and the refiners reap larger profits.   Abbas does recognize Israel and is not lobbing anything into Israel. He is the head of state recognized by Israel and the world. What's the issue?   Here is Stewart's take on the [Faux News attack on women in the military.](http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/b7hxzd/the-way-we-war)   There is always collateral damage in a war. /s   Here is a story from the [Daily Caller calling MSNBC sexist.](http://dailycaller.com/2011/05/26/msnbc-is-a-cesspool-of-misogyny/)   And if this was said on NBC or CBS News the right would be calling for immediate resignations even if it was on a show like Today or CBS Morning.   Asking for ID is not the issue but the restrictions on the type of ID required to prove you are who you are.   But if the open carry advocate was black would the result have been different? Setting aside the fact that an African-American open carry advocate would not do this alone because of the danger.   Would the police have fired if the guy with he gun was an open carry advocate? Almost everyone would say no. Then why did the police shoot in this instance?   That is because a selected video clip is the one that was released to the public not the full video. There has been a demand to see all the tapes as well as a full tape of the shooting which has not been made available to the public.   You have obviously seen the video. If you have not you are making facts up.   Marco Rubio is a Cuban-American.   Lets chip everyone in the US to avoid a crime committed by less than .001 percent of the public. /s   This is the basic thought process that leads to a myriad of Obama conspiracy theories.    He is running to the right of Hillary on foreign policy which is tough to do in the Democratic Party.   You are correct. In this case the opposition has gone beyond the bounds to blame the president for domestic violence in the NFL. This is how conspiracy theories are born. 1+1 does not equal three four or any other number other than 2.   I thought he already had. /s   What accident? There was a controlled release of harmless waste water allowed under their discharge permit. /s   This is mostly a divestment campaign with boycotts of consumer products.   I guess the vast majority of scientists and climatologists most be wrong. /s   [Here is a story about the different spellings](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-03-01/opinion/ct-talk-gadhafi-spellings-0302-20110301_1_spelling-moammar-kadafi-moammar-gadhafi) by newspapers for Gaddafi. The AP style is "Moammar Gadhafi."    Qaddafi was in it for the green.   [Here is CNN"s article](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/19/us/peanut-butter-salmonella-trial/) which has some more detail but there was not a lot of coverage of this historic prosecution and conviction.   The sounds of letters in Arabic do not correspond with the letters in the English alphabet. Also there has been no standardization in how those sounds should be written in English.   Thanks for the information.   There was an issue a year or two ago about a plant in New Mexico but I hadn't heard about an issue recently.   When will they even try for a criminal conviction when it comes to the banksters?   Pulling this story seems to have more to do with pleasing the Dispatch's Republican owner than reporting the news with fairness and without favoritism.  	187

 moron   I met my best friend detasseling in the corn fields of Nebraska.  Getting on a bus together at 5am and walking rows of corn until 2 in the afternoon = bonding time.  We knew each other's life-stories in about 2 days.  ("Detasseling corn is removing the pollen-producing flowers, the tassel, from the tops of corn plants and placing them on the ground.")   I got saline implants under the muscle...while I was in the recovery room waking up from my anesthesia, the nurse kept asking me what my pain level was and if I wanted to take a pain pill.  I refused.  After I woke up some more they moved me back to the room where I changed into my gown before the procedure and I slept in there for a while.  The nurse came in quite a lot to ask me if I needed anything...all I wanted was water.  After a few check-ins with the nurse I finally accepted a pain pill because yes it hurt, but it wasn't unbearable.  Upon returning home I was sore but again, nothing unbearable.  They prescribed me a bottle of 30ish strong pain pills and I only took 4 or 5.  They also gave me a packet of pills to put under the tongue for when the pain pills made me feel like vomiting.  These were a life saver more than the pain pills were.  I don't even want to think about how much it would have hurt to puke right after a breast augmentation.    That we are going to have to break up when I go active duty in the Navy this coming summer.  Don't get me wrong, I love him and all...but I don't want either of us to be miserable the whole time I'm gone.   They set the guy free while investigating further?!  If it was a full grown adult found encased in concrete instead of a baby would they be letting the home owner go?  I don't think so.  	5

 Must have had pretty severe whiplash   Well then the first thing I'm buying is a Kardashian   Claire Underwood strikes again...   I'm just high     	5
 Well that's messed up, you should move into a new house or something.   That sounds like the best pet ever, however it might be difficult to pet him if you can't see him.   Why didn't you just buy a new phone, instead of gorging you eyes out.   Why wouldn't you want him to call a medium?   Hmm....   Or drop it in a volcano to make sure it stays gone.   He probably won't die, he just might get tortured and then killed in the most slow and terrifying way ever, but he just won't die.   Yay! Your not dead!   Oh I thought you cooked your son because you wanted your wife to be sweet again.    That was a great story, i'm actually shaking, not being sarcastic.    Maybe Doug wants to take over your body, but you have to touch the box more than once.    Ummm......   Well the moral of this story is to never fall asleep on public places and have a lot of friends, but seriously i'm gonna have nightmares about this.   I shouldn't have read this at 2:43, sleep is overrated anyways.   Yeah so she could eat them, just kidding  	15
 The motherfucking BMW that that asshole in front of me is driving.    Selfie actually means something though. That's like saying "I wish people would stop saying the word 'rap'". Rap is a word that describes a genre of music. Selfie is a word that describes a type of picture. It's not some stupid buzzword that people are throwing around. It actually means something.    I work at a fast food restaurant as a cashier. When people come up to the counter and say "gimme a double double. Gimme some fries. Gimme a chocolate shake." I want to PUNCH THEM IN THE FACE. The word "gimme" is the epitome of rudeness as far as "words to request something" go. Just because I work in a fast food restaurant doesn't mean you need to be a total dick, dick.    As a 17 year old camp councilor, I can tell you that that is an excellent idea and will doubtlessly get you laid. Nothing turns a woman on more than hearing that you sometimes volunteer at summer camps.    It's okay. You're not too smart.    Sounds like your memory isn't too great    I'm curious about how to take off a shirt and bra in one move. Sound like a useful trick   *badly   Would've had a warning too    I think the girl on coke is funnier..    No, a plastic-y material    So like... 1 house.    In California gas stations are required by law to have free air pumps for public use. They can't have any strings attached either like forcing you to buy an item. Anyone can cuz em for free :)    16 year old everyone is a dumbass    Thinking outside the box    Because books are fucking amazing.    Open a fidelity investments account    "mass pussy grave"  Beautiful.    "Trojan horse economics"    I think you made this whole thing up using randomly selected letters from your keyboard    Manners maketh man. Are we going to stand around here all day or are we going to fight?   	21
 All 4 of those electoral votes from a state that is basically Vermont.    Free college and health care wasn't delusional enough?  Bring on the downvotes.    If only he had his own campaign subreddit. Oh wait...   That requires people actually watch it   Like the undecided voters in Family Guy    It would get upvoted if Trump said it because reddit loves to laugh at him    Genetic conditions are one thing...   1,000 years from now historians can just look at videos of the past, assuming they don't fuck up and lose the ancient technology of mp4 etc   I would like to reinforce that it's the insurance companies that screw up costs, not the hospital or clinic. The purpose of insurance is to collect as much money while paying out as little as possible. The hospital will charge $100 for an advil pill but will only get $10. That's why bills are so high, it's a negotiation game.    The person pays more, but the hospital gets paid less. They hospital charges an uninsured person less than an insured person because they can actually get money from the insured.  The ambulance service I works for only sees payment on 30% of patients. That means 70% of our patient won't pay a cent, including their insurance or lack of.    [Well 21% of the health costs could be fixed if people ate better and exercised] (http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2012/04/obesity-accounts-21-percent-medical-care-costs). It's no coincidence that the most obese country pays the most for healthcare.    My university had experiments on board. Good thing we still have another one orbiting Mars    I think you left out the part about cars    I reported another post for the same violation and the mod claimed the source post wouldn't load for him. It was the official Sanders web page.    That was my thought. If by some tiny chance the guy recognized his own car then mission accomplished   Does this count as a witch hunt?  Obviously not in favor of littering but reddit rules are rules    [Well this is awkward] (http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/26/rand-paul-gets-highest-marks-marijuana-policy-proj/)   Title rule violation, mods either need to enforce the rule or get rid of it instead of being selective based on their opinion    Only if lanes are clear on the sides. Good luck doing that in a traffic jam    Well there would be a car blocking the way...   Colorado Springs University    /r/tall   Fixed   You brought up football.   Colorado had one bad year after getting snubbed one year, making the tournament the next 3, including a pac 12 tournament title.    Yeah it must be great critiquing others when your school has zero chance of ever making playoffs being in the MWC and all. Especially when you go 1-7 in conference.    https://twitter.com/akjones27/status/614919314504708096  4th recruit for CU so far  [Scout] (http://www.scout.com/college/football/recruiting/player/194665-akil-jones/news)  [247sports] (http://247sports.com/Recruitment/Akil-Jones-87153/RecruitInterests)  Other offers from Wyoming, Utah State, San Diego St      Well you used the old one in the post    Says the mountain west school. Talk to me when you have 30 national championships    Alien blue shows flair    Someone didn't hear about our [new unis] (http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5526826ee4b0788926c507cf/55443953e4b0e11ffa878af3/55538015e4b03971c5bae4b2/1431535638051/2.jpg)   Because Colorado plays at Hawaii they are bowl eligible at 6-7. There's a couple other things that would have to fall in place but odds would be favorable for Colorado. Plus Colorado SOS is crazy    Like all $10-$20 of tax payer money? You should she the shit that goes on in Washington    Imagine how different this would be if she was shot    A popular phrase used to show disapproval of the current US president, specifically used here about the Infringement of constitutional rights by some states    Thanks Obama!  (yes I know he had nothing to do with it)   I'll look out for that, my browser defaults to https    Unless the people change to a "bad" view.  Like hypothetically people decided they were against gay marriage and then Obama tries to ban it.     Damn that post filter isn't catching much    Probably SNL Bush   But it also shows how the politician can be swayed    I'm not Republican    Also a lot of social media and technology has changed in the last 7 years. Bush never had the chance to make a BuzzFeedVideo    It had a lot to do with voters supporting it   So that's the change he was talking about in his campaign....   So mods, this violates the new title rules because it uses title AND quote. I guess it stays because Sanders, fuck off mods          4-0 OOC, beat Oregon, USC, UCLA. Win the bowl game. End season 8-6   The thousands of posts from people wanting to take advantage and get fake Internet points wasn't enough?    I'd say more important    Or hopping on the karma train    [he's an amazing writer too] (http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/05/29/can-you-tell-if-these-passages-are-from-bernie-sanders-weird-1972-short-story-or-fifty-shades-of-grey/)   Right around the same time he wrote gang rape erotica   Or the right wall will be the inside wall of a circle    See the side bar   Well you got it, just keep in mind they close the roads for the fireworks so you'll have to hike    Freedomest?  Well the US didn't get any smarter    Take advantage of all the people rushing to get married = $$$$         Roughly 15 lbs? About a pound a week for us Americans.    There's also stuff to open blood vessels and vitamin b. I use preworkout and lift noticeably better.    Fellow tall, I've put on 30lbs in 6 months. A good amount is fat but I was so skinny I didn't care. I'm not even skinny fat so the weight looks good. Just lift a lot and eat a lot, worry about muscle tone later unless you get a huge gut    What are you asking?   Brace yourselves for all the posts "X states their thoughts of the legalization".    And this will be the biggest post in reddit history    Sorry, my brain is filled with very small rocks    Braces yourselves for the biggest post in /r/politics history    Maybe wedding ceremony costs will increase initially due to demand? I'm just spit balling here   Can't we just celebrate this without talking politics?   Anything on if private places that host weddings are allowed to turn a gay couple down? That's the next big thing to tackle    I had no idea this was even going on in the court. That language is so official yet so moving    Says Walmart on the store    Man its sad no one on this sub cares. I'd say we should have /R/Wisconsinpolitics but politics makes the majority of content here.  Let's go Decker and Frank!    They aren't air force    Fall of Colorado    North-Oregon,Stanford,Cal   South- USC, Arizona, Utah   Games circled- Oregon, Cal, USC    Air Force, Colorado, CSU, GT.  You can't do that. The Colorado teams hare each other, GT hates CU    glad you guys could get over the clipping call, unlike someone....   3   Utah.  Ideal pac south would be Colorado, Utah, UCLA, ASU, USC, Arizona    Well an Arizona player is now playing with Dinwiddie in Detroit    [how dare you] (https://twitter.com/sportsnation/status/614232190189240324)   If Dinwiddie didn't get hurt, that year would have been awesome between Colorado and Arizona    I'm just coming from back in to talk about Stanley Johnson joining Dinwiddie in Detroit    I think the glory days are done already. Tad didn't take advantage of the success when it comes to recruiting. Probably barely .500 this season    [Just let me know how many times you hear his name] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAVEHHTz9s)   Yeah, Colorado doesn't even like him. But losing him isn't helping the team.    And cross country       Man you guys love to hate on him, you do realize no CU fans were happy he said that right?  1/12 64-63 CU 3/12 53-51 CU wins pac tournament  1/13 83-92 AZ in OT, you know damn well there wasn't enough evidence to overturn Chen's buzzer beater  2/13 71-58 CU, RedemChen, the Valentines Day Massacre.    I used muscle milk a few years ago and stopped after a couple months. Too much sugar, it's basically an over marketed halfway decent protein    Football has shown more fight than basketball. I don't know how they show their faces after the game against Seattle. No excuse for losing that tournament       Are we a football school again?    How convenient it happened the year we don't go to the desert. Conspiracy theory- XJ didn't want to leave CU without a win at Arizona   Plus Colorado died with Dinwiddie ACL    Well I believe he gets another year of eligibility, might be good in the long run since our recruiting sucks right now       Now put it in the oven and have apple chips    YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TIED UNC AND THEN WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION! IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT    How many Courics?    Well when you're high up you have potentially hundreds of people gunning for your job. Fuck up and they bring the next guy in.    Great example of why the schools don't need more money, they need to manage it better. My high school had less money than the area's public schools but students did better because of home life, discipline, and teachers that cared.    Well to be fair a big reason why inner city schools perform poorly is lack of discipline.    Well doctors already have performance checks, just in different ways. They retake the board exams every few years, those are fucking difficult. Doctors get sued and have lawyers evaluating everything looking for slip ups. If you fuck up, your patient gets worse or dies.    Those tangles    So this dude just runs out of a store with his arms full of crab legs while yelling fuck her right in the pussy and the woman working the store cries rape    I can neither confirm or deny buying beer for some of the linemen   6-7, then win the bowl game    Score on the first play of the 5th down series. Then GT would stop bitching even though the voters new all about the 5th down and chose Colorado anyways. They only won their poll by one troll vote   Or you know, a play that doesn't result in a tie for GT-UNC.    USC. It's a Friday night blackout game on ESPN.    YOU'RE JUST MAD WE LEFT    GAME THREADS AFTER DARK, COLORADO AT HAWAII 11PM MOUNTAIN    [can I get some of those recruits?] (http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58868050.jpg)   Biggest College stadium in a 500 mile radius, a live buffalo running around the field, you can legally get high before the game, the most scenic area in College football, and a [rooftop area] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wrk-ut5oUDc) WITH BEER overlooking the field with the Flatirons background    ALL MY PAC BROS ARE STILL SLEEPING     CSU CAN'T MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST NIT ROUND AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT GETTING SNUBBED FROM THE BIG DANCE    [I CAN'T HEAR YOU] (http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/3176771/eminemhigh.gif)   Coach Mac and Bobo for control of weed research.

Can here we see competition doing its job in the market    Because they game is in Hawaii, and on a Thursday. So they have it when they finish class. It's stupid   IT'S ONLY 1030 HERE   This offer brought to you by New Belgium Stadium    Well CSU will have a shiny new stadium   First they confuse us, then they shall attack    Colorado beats Arizona at home    Nov 13 (USC) will be a long night if we win, guessing it'll be the blackout game since it's 7pm on ESPN    Let me know what you find, my interest has peaked    Well we could take a few billion from the defense budget.    Colorado    Cut the budget in available areas.    I'll have class the next day, but only one....   According to a projection from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of Americans will pay 45.7 percent of the individual income taxes in 2014up from 43 percent in 2013 and 40 percent in 2012 (the oldest period available).  http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780   3) the game starts at 11pm Mountain    Middle class could use more spending money. Lower the taxes.    Well the top 1% already pays half of income taxes  http://www.cnbc.com/id/102581780   But a handful of millionaires can provide the government with money to operate   	142

 Not a whole lot right now. I just quit my gym earlier this year, but I plan on getting into it more soon.   Myfitnesspal is an app that you track your daily food and exercise intake on. It's awesome and it's free!    I was on a ketogenic diet for over a year, but now I just do everything in moderation. I think I've only had one soda this year that's not zero calorie. But I occasionally eay pizza, or tacos, but I don't eat more than 500 (max amount of calories) in one sitting.    I really watched absolutely everything I consumed. I mean EVERYTHING. I measured my food with a scale, and every liquid with measuring cups and I bought a spoon set for measuring butters and oils. I kept my macronutrients within the ketogenic scale too. Check out /r/keto, it's amazing. I did mostly low impact cardio for the first year or two and started lifting weights last year. Nothing hard core, just a simple routine. And this year I'm running daily and still watching my diet. I keep my carbs pretty low still, but I'm not strictly keto now. I love my fruit! :)   I've had that happen to me several times already. It's a really awesome feeling when they realize who I am. Haha!   I was just there for a new fitting a few months ago and I bought two new bras that are amazing. I'm not wearing either in the picture I took today though. :/   Everyone has told me how it's amazing that I kept most of my boobs. I didn't do anything specific to keep them. I think it's just genetic, many women in my family have big boobs.       Dem collar bones! But, seriously, WOW! You can really see you're smiling with your eye in the after picture. The before picture looks forced. Great job!    You look fantastic! Wow! I wouldn't be able to speak a coherent sentence to your face if I saw you in real life. I get flustered and nervous around attractive people...   I love this style!!!!!!!   We were doing yard work in the back yard today, and my neighbor was yelling at us to come quick. Her dog found this little guy and he was barely moving. I ran to the house and got a towel and called my FIL (who works for a wildlife company). He gave me the run down on what to do. I warmed the baby up and put him back under the tree where he fell. He wasn't hurt, and he was very lively, he started sucking on my fingers while I was holding him. We were constantly keeping an eye on him and about fifteen minutes ago, mama showed up and took him back to the nest! He was so sweet and so cute!      I just want to say, you are an amazing inspiration and you look gorgeous and so happy! Congratulations on your new baby and your amazing healthy body! You're incredible!    Ah! Gotcha! You have to use a crochet hook and you go through the back loop and pull the yarn through both stitches. Then slide the stitches of the knitting needles. After the first bind of stitch you pull the yarn through three stitches to bind off. I'm sorry if that is hard to understand. I'll do a video soon and post it.    I would like a link for one. Please and thank you.    If I were you I'd just buy the patten on ravelry. I tried to figure it out using tutorials and free stuff I found on the Internet, but they never came out right until I paid for the pattern.

 A game of thrones, The Name Of The Wind, The Blade Itself, LOTR   1) Don't learn about CPU, GPUS, MBS or anything that's actually about computers.  2) Learn everything about Microsoft office to show you're a trainable monkey who can work in an office one day.  For real.   This should be absolutely fine.   I play Arma 3 myself, and know how CPU intensive it can be when online, the chosen CPU should be able to handle it without losing performance, and can possibly be overclocked if needed. (Arma 3 coding is terrible, I'd stick with that cpu he's chosen.)  In my humble opinion, I'd say lose the windows 7 OS and *cough* ~~*cough*~~ buy it from *cough* [**somewhere else**](http://wallpoper.com/images/00/40/56/34/pirates-jolly_00405634.jpg) *cough* - sorry I've got a cold.  Nice computer case. If you drop the OS, you can buy some lights to put inside it, which will automatically *make everything run at least 3.4 times faster.*   * Speccy * CPU-Z * GPU-Z * MSI Afterburner  And umm... some others!     Rebooting won't fix your shit  Found this out the hard way. x)   Um, I'm running Linux now and can confirm, for Ubuntu at least, it's apt-get, same on Debian too.  It may vary depending on what distro you're using :)   Just installed Ubuntu, and holy cow was that one hell of an epidemic. CPU failed initialization before I'd even installed it, required ethenet cable to download adapter drivers which should of already been pre-installed, and then the video drivers almost destroyed the entire OS, I'm hoping it's all fixed now. Took me 4 hours just to get the damn thing up and running properly. xD   Alot more secure than the new Windows 10.   The NSA slapped their backdoors in last second before release. You can see the vunerabilities of Windows 7 simply by using Linux tools such as metasploit, most of them are listed there, and MOST, but not all, can be prevented with simple precautions such as anti-viruses and firewalls. Not only this, encrypt everything and your golden.  Now then, Windows 10 is going to be alot less secure with the NSA in mind from the very beginning is it not? Would you like Windows 7 or Windows 10? I'm using Linux as my personal OS, dual bootcamped with Windows 7 for games / production. GG NSA.  	8
 This is my swamp.   Going to homecoming this weekend (I'm a senior in high school) and I was wondering if it's appropriate to wear a knit tie with a 2 button suit. Aren't knit ties supposed to be more casual? Also, what is the appropriate width of a knit tie? I know they're supposed to be skinnier, but what is the correct width? 2 in or 2.75 in?   I recently updated chrome along with a bunch of other windows 8 updates and now my browser sizing is off. The resolution is blurrier and larger than normal. My laptop is 1920x1080 and it feels like I'm back at 1360x768 when using chrome. For example, here is my new tab page, clearly something happened to the resolution as this image used to be full screen: [Here](http://imgur.com/DofT7ca)  How can I fix the resolution of chrome?  	3

IRIS will open a new window of discovery using spectrometry and imaging to trace the flow of energy and plasma through the chromospheres and transition region into the suns corona. The spacecraft will observe how solar material moves, gathers energy and heats up as it travels through a largely unexplored region of the solar atmosphere. This interface region, located between the sun's visible surface and its upper atmosphere, is where most of its ultraviolet emission is generated. These emissions impact the near-Earth space environment and Earth's climate.

The solar arrays are deployed in the configuration they will assume when in orbit. IRIS is scheduled to launch on June 26, 2013.  Understanding the interface between the photosphere and corona remains a fundamental challenge in solar and heliospheric science. The IRIS mission opens a window of discovery into this crucial region by tracing the flow of energy and plasma through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona using spectrometry and imaging. IRIS is designed to provide significant new information to increase our understanding of energy transport into the corona and solar wind and provide an archetype for all stellar atmospheres. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art 3-D modeling, will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth.

This test allows engine manufacturers to simulate flying through the upper atmosphere where large amounts of icing particles can be ingested and cause flame outs or a loss of engine power on aircraft. This test was the first of its kind in the world and was highly successful in validating PSL's new capability. No other engine test facility has this capability.  Glenn is working with industry to address this aviation issue by establishing a capability that will allow engines to be operated at the same temperature and pressure conditions experienced in flight, with ice particles being ingested into full scale engines to simulate flight through a deep convective cloud.  The information gained through performing these tests will also be used to establish test methods and techniques for the study of engine icing in new and existing commercial engines, and to develop data required for advanced computer codes that can be specifically applied to assess an engine's susceptibility to icing in terms of its safety, performance and operability.

The component images were taken during the 166th, 168th and 169th Martian days, or sols, of Curiosity's work on Mars (Jan. 23, 25 and 26, 2013). The scene appears three dimensional when viewed through red-blue glasses with the red lens on the left. It spans 360 degrees, with Mount Sharp on the southern horizon.   In the center foreground, the rover's arm holds the tool turret above a target called "Wernecke" on the "John Klein" patch of pale-veined mudstone. On Sol 169, Curiosity used its dust-removing brush and Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on Wernecke (see http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/multimedia/pia16790.html ). About two weeks later, Curiosity used its drill at a point about 1 foot (30 centimeters) to the right of Wernecke to collect the first drilled sample from the interior of a rock on Mars. This anaglyph was made with the images as captured by the Curiosity. Another version with the seams in the sky eliminated and cropped for optimal 3-D viewing can be seen at PIA16925.   Separate left-eye and right-eye mosaics are combined into the stereo view.

In this image, the aircraft flies over the intersection of several runways adjacent to the compass rose on Rogers Dry Lake at Edwards Air Force Base during one of the sub-scale aircraft's final test flights on Feb. 28, 2013.   The scale-model aircraft, shaped like a manta ray, was designed by The Boeing Co., built by Cranfield Aerospace Limited of the United Kingdom, and flown in partnership with NASA. The X-48C is a version of NASA's X-48B blended wing body aircraft modified to evaluate the low-speed stability and control of a low-noise version of a notional hybrid-wing-body design. This design features a flattened fuselage with no tail, and engines mounted on top of the fuselage at the rear of the plane. The design stems from concept studies for commercial aircraft that could be flying within 20 years. The studies are under way in NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project.

Astronaut John Young, a veteran of four previous spaceflights including a walk on the moon in 1972, commanded the mission. Navy test pilot Bob Crippen piloted the mission and would go on to command three future shuttle missions. The shuttle was humankind's first re-usable spacecraft. The orbiter would launch like a rocket and land like a plane. The two solid rocket boosters that helped push them into space would also be re-used, after being recovered in the ocean. Only the massive external fuel tank would burn up as it fell back to Earth. It was all known as the Space Transportation System.  Twenty years prior to the historic launch, on April 12, 1961, the era of human spaceflight began when Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth in his Vostock I spacecraft. The flight lasted 108 minutes.   Pictured here: a timed exposure of STS-1, at Launch Pad A, Complex 39, turns the space vehicle and support facilities into a night- time fantasy of light.

Caption: Speed Agile Team Wins Laureate  Almost since the dawn of powered flight, military aircraft have benefitted from NASA aeronautics research. Back then - in 1917  it wasn't called NASA. It was the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which changed its name to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958.   That legacy continues today and is getting recognition. A government/industry team, led by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and including NASA, won Aviation Week magazine's 2013 prestigious Laureate Award in Aeronautics and Propulsion for the Speed Agile Powered Lift System Concept Demonstrator. The idea behind the program is to design a next-generation tactical mobility aircraft that could give the U.S. Air Force more flexibility to deliver supplies and troops to remote regions of the world that might not have traditional infrastructure such as long, paved runways. Included on the award winning research team were not only NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate's Fixed Wing Project, but also Boeing Research   Technology; Lockheed Martin; Advanced Technologies, Inc.; and Williams International.   Since the research efforts started in 2002, AFRL and its partners have designed, tested and validated technology for cruise-efficient short takeoff and landing aircraft. NASA's primary interest is in the dual use technology and its potential application to future airliners. NASA contributed computational tool, wind tunnel, simulator and aerodynamic expertise at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. and Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif. Researchers tested several concepts in NASA Langley's National Transonic Facility and 14 by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel. They also used NASA Ames' Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate flying qualities and control schemes for an advanced transport.   Image Credit: NASA Langley/George Homich   Socialism!!

As snow and ice melt atop the glaciers, the water flows in channels and streams and collects in depressions on the surface that are sometimes visible from space. These melt ponds and lakes sometimes disappear quickly - a phenomenon that scientists have observed firsthand in recent years.  The natural-color image above was acquired on July 4, 2010, by the Advanced Land Imager on NASAs Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite.

Snow has covered much of the desert since a storm blew through the area on Dec. 26. The day after the storm, Chinese Central Television (CNTV) reported that the Xinjian Uygyr autonomous region was one of the areas hardest hit.  The Taklimakan is one of the worlds largestand hottestsandy deserts. Water flowing into the Tarim Basin has no outlet, so over the years, sediments have steadily accumulated. In parts of the desert, sand can pile up to 300 meters (roughly 1,000 feet) high. The mountains that enclose the sea of sandthe Tien Shan in the north and the Kunlun Shan in the southwere also covered with what appeared to be a significantly thicker layer of snow in January 2013.

The mosaic shows the rover at "Rocknest," the spot in Gale Crater where the mission's first scoop sampling took place. Four scoop scars can be seen in the regolith in front of the rover. A fifth scoop was collected later.   Self-portraits like this one document the state of the rover and allow mission engineers to track changes over time, such as dust accumulation and wheel wear. Due to its location on the end of the robotic arm, only MAHLI (among the rover's 17 cameras) is able to image some parts of the craft, including the port-side wheels.   Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS   Caption: Ion Thruster Sets World Record  While the Dawn spacecraft is visiting the asteroids Vesta and Ceres, NASA Glenn has been developing the next generation of ion thrusters for future missions. NASA's Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) Project has developed a 7-kilowatt ion thruster that can provide the capabilities needed in the future.   An ion thruster produces small levels of thrust relative to chemical thrusters, but does so at higher specific impulse (or higher exhaust velocities), which means that an ion thruster has a fuel efficiency of 10-12 times greater than a chemical thruster. The higher the rocket's specific impulse (fuel efficiency), the farther the spacecraft can go with a given amount of fuel. Given that an ion thruster produces small levels of thrust relative to chemical thrusters, it needs to operate in excess of 10,000 hours to slowly accelerate the spacecraft to speeds necessary to reach the asteroid belt or beyond.   The NEXT ion thruster has been operated for over 43,000 hours, which for rocket scientists means that the thruster has processed over 770 kilograms of xenon propellant and can provide 30 million-newton-seconds of total impulse to the spacecraft. This demonstrated performance permits future science spacecraft to travel to varied destinations, such as extended tours of multi-asteroids, comets, and outer planets and their moons.

Image Credit: NASA   Caption: Orion Spacecraft  Technicians prepare to fit a special fixture around an Orion capsule inside the high bay of the Operations   Checkout Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The fixture is designed to enable precise pre-launch processing of the Orion spacecraft.   Orion will be the most advanced spacecraft ever designed and carry astronauts farther into space than ever before. It will sustain astronauts during space travel and provide safe re-entry from deep space and emergency abort capability. Orion will be launched by NASA's Space Launch System (SLS), a heavy-lift rocket that will provide an entirely new capability for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Designed to be flexible for launching spacecraft for crew and cargo missions, SLS will enable new missions of exploration and expand human presence across the solar system.

This new data was then mapped over existing Blue Marble imagery of Earth to provide a realistic view of the planet.  The image was made possible by the satellite's "day-night band" of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, which detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses filtering techniques to observe dim signals such as city lights, gas flares, auroras, wildfires and reflected moonlight.

For scale, the scoop is 1.8 inches (4.5 centimeters) wide, 2.8 inches (7 centimeters) long.

The mirrors are going through receiving and inspection and will then be stored in the Goddard clean room until engineers are ready to assemble them onto the telescope's backplane structure that will support them.  One of the Webbs science goals is to look back through time to when galaxies were young. To see such far-off and faint objects, Webb needs a large mirror. A telescopes sensitivity, or how much detail it can see, is directly related to the size of the mirror area that collects light from the objects being observed. A larger area collects more light, just like a larger bucket collects more water in a rain shower than a small one.

Caption: President's Signature On Board Curiosity This view of Curiosity's deck shows a plaque bearing several signatures of US officials, including that of President Obama and Vice President Biden. The image was taken by the rover's Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) during the rover's 44th Martian day, or sol, on Mars (Sept. 19, 2012). The plaque is located on the front left side of the rover's deck.   The rectangular plaque is made of anodized aluminum and measures 3.94 inches (100 millimeters) tall by 3.23 inches (82 millimeters) wide. The plaque was affixed to the rover's deck with four bolts.   Similar plaques with signatures - including those of the sitting president and vice-president -- adorn the lander platforms for NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers, which landed on Mars in January of 2004. An image from Spirit's plaque can be found at: http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05034   The main purpose of Curiosity's MAHLI camera is to acquire close-up, high-resolution views of rocks and soil at the rover's Gale Crater field site. The camera is capable of focusing on any target at distances of about 0.8 inch (2.1 centimeters) to infinity, providing versatility for other uses, such as views of the rover itself from different angles.     I agree, though the article is more about calling out the national media than it is about Romney's high school bullying.

The manufacturer of those mirrors, Ball Aerospace   Technologies Corp. of Boulder, Colo., recently celebrated their successful efforts as mirror segments were packed up in special shipping canisters (cans) for shipping to NASA.  The Webb telescope has 21 mirrors, with 18 primary mirror segments working together as one large 21.3-foot (6.5-meter) primary mirror. The mirror segments are made of beryllium, which was selected for its stiffness, light weight and stability at cryogenic temperatures. Bare beryllium is not very reflective of near-infrared light, so each mirror is coated with about 0.12 ounce of gold.

Curiosity's front Hazard-Avoidance cameras appear as a set of four blue eyes at the top center of the portrait. Fine-grain Martian dust can be seen adhering to the wheels, which are about 16 inches (40 centimeters) wide and 20 inches (50 centimeters) in diameter. The bottom of the rover is about 26 inches (66 centimeters) above the ground. On the horizon at the right is a portion of Mount Sharp, with dark dunes at its base.   The camera is in the turret of tools at the end of Curiosity's robotic arm. The Sol 34 imaging by MAHLI was part of a week-long set of activities for characterizing the movement of the arm in Mars conditions. As this was a test to gain new information about operation of the instrument, the MAHLI team noted that two of the nine images acquired for this mosaic were not in focus.   The main purpose of Curiosity's MAHLI camera is to acquire close-up, high-resolution views of rocks and soil at the rover's Gale Crater field site. The camera is capable of focusing on any target at distances of about 0.8 inch (2.1 centimeters) to infinity, providing versatility for other uses, such as views of the rover itself from different angles.

It was taken on Aug. 23, 2012, and looks south-southwest from the rover's landing site.  The 100-millimeter Mastcam has three times better resolution than Curiosity's 34-millimeter Mastcam, though it has a narrower field of view.  The gravelly area around Curiosity's landing site is visible in the foreground. Farther away, about a third of the way up from the bottom of the image, the terrain falls off into a depression (a swale). Beyond the swale, in the middle of the image, is the boulder-strewn, red-brown rim of a moderately-sized impact crater. Farther off in the distance, there are dark dunes and then the layered rock at the base of Mount Sharp. Some haze obscures the view, but the top ridge, depicted in this image, is 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) away.  Scientists enhanced the color in one version to show the Martian scene under the lighting conditions we have on Earth, which helps in analyzing the terrain. A raw version is also available.  An annotated version of the image indicates the distances to different features. They were calculated using a computer program that analyzes data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

Swing drop testing began last summer at Langley's Hydro Impact Basin to certify the Orion spacecraft for water landings. In this series of tests, Orion is being dropped vertically into the pool for the first time, which will help fine-tune the way NASA predicts Orion's landing loads.   The Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS), NASAs next crew capsule and heavy-lift rocket, will provide an entirely new capability for human exploration. Designed to be flexible for launching spacecraft for crew and cargo missions, SLS and Orion will expand human presence beyond low Earth orbit and enable new missions of exploration across the solar system.

During the five-hour, 51-minute spacewalk on August 20, 2012, Padalka and Malenchenko moved the Strela-2 cargo boom from the Pirs docking compartment to the Zarya module to prepare Pirs for its eventual replacement with a new Russian multipurpose laboratory module. The two spacewalking cosmonauts also installed micrometeoroid debris shields on the exterior of the Zvezda service module and deployed a small science satellite.   Image Credit: NASA   Caption: Curiosity in Exaggerated Color  This color-enhanced view of NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars was taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as the satellite flew overhead. Colors have been enhanced to show the subtle color variations near the rover, which result from different types of materials.   The descent stage blast pattern around the rover is clearly seen as relatively blue colors (true colors would be more gray).   Curiosity landed within Gale Crater, a portion of which is pictured here. The mountain at the center of the crater, called Mount Sharp, is located out of frame to the southeast. North is up.   This image was acquired at an angle of 30 degrees from straight down, looking west. Another image looking more directly down will be acquired in five days, completing a stereo pair along with this image.   The scale of this image cutout is about 12 inches (31 centimeters) per pixel.   HiRISE is one of six instruments on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The University of Arizona, Tucson, operates the orbiter's HiRISE camera, which was built by Ball Aerospace   Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colo.

The Orion CPAS team joined the Exploration Flight Test 1 recovery team and representatives of the U.S. Navy to test recovery procedures for the Orion parachutes.  The NBL is 202 feet in length, 102 feet in width, and 40 feet in depth (20 feet above ground level and 20 ft below) and holds 6.2 million gallons of water. In addition to the current parachute recovery test the facility has been used by the Orion program to test the Crew Module Uprighting system on a full size Orion mockup known as PORT.

The panorama was made from thumbnail versions of images taken by the Mast Camera.  Scientists will take a closer look at several splotches in the foreground that appear gray. These areas show the effects of the descent stage's rocket engines blasting the ground. What appeared as a dark strip of dunes in previous, black-and-white pictures from Curiosity can be seen along the top of this mosaic, but the color images also reveal additional shades of reddish brown around the dunes, likely indicating different textures or materials.  The images were taken on Aug. 9, 2012, by the 34-millimeter Mast Camera. This panorama mosaic was made of 130 images of 144 by 144 pixels each. Selected full frames from this panorama, which are 1,200 by 1,200 pixels each, are expected to be transmitted to Earth later. The images in this panorama were brightened in the processing. Mars only receives half the sunlight Earth does and this image was taken in the late Martian afternoon.

 Which was my point, a website cannot go down, or people go somewhere else.  Hopefully it can be reliable now, so I can start posting there and learn some python :)   It's the most interesting story related to a history of a forum.  Most are just like, "Dude, I just created a forum for such and such, go post there."  Lol.   cool, you got the flair working!!!   also metulburr, i might add, that currently only fill_array() and display_array() functions work, the swap() function is only used in the sort_array() function which i have commented out at the bottom so the function is never called.  I still have to figure that part out.   How weird is that, I didn't read Mekire's thread before posting mine, but it mentions about sorting methods which coincidentally are the same things I'm reading about in my textbook right now.  Taking a peek at: https://github.com/Mekire/pysort/blob/master/pysort.py   Ok so you guys probably know my little brother, metulburr, I am train_subject3168. I am pretty new to python and just learning. I'm a computer science major in college at the moment.  Anyway, in a programming structure and logic class I'm in (intro level) in our textbook, the chapter I just read described the bubble sorting algorithm for sorting data, it has flowcharts and pseudocode and I thought I'd try to translate it to python (I'm using python 3.3.4 right now) I have functions for filling an array and sorting the array and then displaying the array, the filling and displaying work now, I still gotta fix the sorting one, but the real question is, my brother was noting that it shoudn't work at all because I have global variables and I use them in my functions, well look at the code:          array_size = 5     scores_array = []     comparisons = array_size - 1     x = 0     y = 0     temp = 0          def fill_array():         x = 0         while (x  array_size):             userinput = input("Enter a score:\n")             userinput = int(userinput)             #for i in range(5):             scores_array.append(userinput)             x = x + 1               def sort_array():         y = 0         while (y  comparisons):             x = 0             while (x  comparisons):                 while (scores_array[x]  scores_array[x + 1]):                     swap()                 x = x + 1             y = y + 1          def swap():         temp = scores_array[x + 1]         scores_array[x + 1] = scores_array[x]         scores_array[x] = temp          def display_array():         x = 0         while (x  array_size):             print(scores_array[x])             x = x + 1          fill_array()          print("\n")          #sort_array()          display_array()  now what is interesting is my brother pointed out to me that the code above runs with no errors, yet the code below throws an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment" in this code:          var = 0          def addone():         var += 1          print(var)     addone()     print(var)  Why is this? Does anyone know why the latter code throws the error but the first doesn't?    I don't know the guy currently running the python forums website, as I'm pretty new around the forums, but it seems to be down an unacceptable amount of time, rendering the whole forum useless.  	7

 Worked for North Korea.    to add to my other comment: intelligence isnt anything we do. we do not give it to ourselves. we are born with whatever intelligence we have. so we cant legitimately take any credit or blame for it. none. no matter what anyone else says.    yeah im nervous too. we havent been able to control big games. we havent been able to dominate the end of games. we lose a lot of games we could win. doesnt instill confidence in me for the playofs. we have the talent, but....   well that fructose has has an effect on your brain.   keep eating all that fruit, if you really do. right, all fruit is the same, it is the same as all the vegetables. you are not a fool.      intelligence is of no value. the dumb is just as valuable as the smart. like the book of Ecclesiates says, the rain falls on everyone's heads and death awaits us all. it is a myth and delusion put forth mostly by academia that smart is better (in any real way) than dumb. dont buy in to their self-serving game. this would actually be an unintelligent thing to do - as following the herd generally is. further, most truly intellingent people never get recognized. and they also usually realize that real intelligence doest give a flip about recognition from the masses.    So there is no such thing as a conspiracy theory?    Eat a pound of pineapple everyday for a month. Open your eyes. Note the weight gain.    Obama said something? Great. Why do I care?   You are full of it. Bananas arent the only fruit, fyi. So you are already following my advice and paying attention to sugar content in fruit, and distinguishing between them. Sure call it fructose, but that doesnt change the point. Try eating pineapple every day for a month. You will gain quite a bit more than if you ate a typical vegetable. Whether it makes you fat like people at the supermarket isnt the freaking point. Either way, to say all fruits can be eaten as much a vegetables can be, and there is no danger from the fructose/sugar content in some fruits is goddamn ignorance.   so it goes without saying that people should pay their taxes? that taxation laws and enforcement are legitimate? does that apply under other regimes as well, or only in the US?   I'm traveling now, but will try to give this a sufficient response when I get settled.  Cheers.   Most of them are Lakers fans.    You have to pay attention to the amount of sugar in fruit. Not all fruit is that good for you. You can easily eat it and get fat. VERY different than vegetables.   Save.   Read Irwin Schiff's pdf, "How an Economy Grows...."   Im with you there 100%. Nietzsche def had attitude rare in philosophy.    the existentialists are quite enjoyable: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger (difficult). i recommend the first two. these guys might grab you more in that they are about your existence, etc., not just ideas and abstractions.    I love SK, but have come to wonder what the leap is toward/to, if one *really* doesn't know. If God isnt manifest and things arent rational, we might as well take a leap toward the Great Wall of China. I have come to believe that SK was more about faith in faith itself.    You might check out Larry Brown. Father and Son, Joe, and Fay to name three to start with.     I dont find them interesting at all. Different? Sure, a little. For one, though the structure at the exterior wall is somewhat novel, it severely limits the amount of glazing, and thus blocks the incredible views way too much. Truly good architecture wouldnt do this.     Jesus Christ, the paradoxical God-man, who is both Atonement and Prototype. (For Kierkegaard, following Luther, faith must needs give rise to works.)  Then who/what was the object of Abraham's faith?  Weren't the objects of SK's and Abraham's faith the same thing?   Revelation through the Word of God, the witness of the Holy Spirit, and the Spirits gift of faith (see, e.g., For Self-Examination, pp. 25ff., 77, 81-82).  These are indirect manifestations, if they are manifestations at all.  Words are hardly manifestation, unless they are audibly spoken and heard directly.  The "witness of the Holy Spirit" is an inside baseball term used mostly by Catholics; I don't know what it means.  And if the Spirit gives us faith, then what is there to worry about?  Does it only give faith to the good and pure?  If so, it's not much of a gift.  Indirect manifestations are easily doubted, challenged, confused and conflated.  Why would a self-proclaimed loving father *only* manifest himself in indirect, mysterious ways?  Especially, when he has power to do it literally any other way you can imagine (even retroactively) and with no negative side effects?     Epistemologically, because the manifestation does not provide apodictic certainty  Sure, but this is subjecting God to the limitations of man.  He supposedly can and does transcend our limitations all the time, just not in ways that we really need it, ways that aren't disputed, conflated, etc.  I mean, he supposedly made/makes the rules.  If he wants a relationship with us, he should make himself known.  He should love us like he asks us to love others.  I'll check out Ferreira's piece ASAP.  Thanks.       The Book of Chuang Tzu.   Like drinking a glass of cold water on a hot day.    except that i don't find homosexuality natural.    ok now we are getting somewhere. i dont really disagree with you here.    yes. im with you there to a point. but non aggression only asks one to govern one's own self. no laws required. there may be a law in place that determines what happens when aggression takes place. but that is only secondary, and doesnt prevent the harm from occurring. if i had my way, i'd say that when you steal or hurt someone, all bets are off. no laws necessary.   and to me, anarchy is balance.    the tao is just the way of nature.    just read lao tzu and chiang tzu. maybe listen to alan watts and read his taoist books.    this is exactly it. stop trying. stop asking what SHOULD i do.    or yoga, taking a walk, or running long distance   regarding your last paragraph: incidentally, or maybe not, that is what libertarians and some anarchists call the NAP (non-aggression principle). "don't hurt me and don't take my stuff." basically the only "rule" they have. fyi.    good idea.    if it is a race, nothing is more important than winning. life is full of teamwork all over the place. it is odd to expect it in a triathalon.    If everything is Taoist then you have no point at all. And what are you even saying? You're certainly not disagreeing with me. Did you read what I said about you not understanding paradox? The paradox here is using words to explain that words are the problem, that words are anti-Tao - since it needs to be spelled out for you. Read the first sentences in the TTC - for starters.   You began by saying I have a limited view of the way. Then you go in to say that nothing is 'more' or 'less' Taoist.   For instance, using the most simple example possible: if the tao that can be described is not the true tao, one would have to say that the tao that is described is not the true tao. You, contrary to this, are saying that the tao that is described is just as true as the tao that cannot be described. You are dead WRONG about THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL ASPECT OF THE TAO.   So you are either a fool or a liar or both, as your very statements make clear. You aren't fucking honest with yourself. Stop playing semantic games while claiming that words and artificial distinctions are just as Taoist as anything else. You are wasting our time.      You are welcome. It is actually online here too:  http://www.wwoz.org/new-orleans-community/livewire-music-calendar         Listen to WWOZ online. It the excellent Nola commercial-free radio station. They broadcast events every 2 hours. I think at the top of each odd hour. It will give you a great idea of what is happening and where.    Further, the law is all about words and arbitrary distinctions, written by a self-selected few (lawyers) who, by virtue of their education are different than the rest of us. Couldn't be less Taoist.   Could you tell us what, in your view, are things contrary, anti, or un-Tao?   To me, that seems more like a faith in faith itself.    Assuming you are one of the smart ones. :)   "Try to be more positive."   No.    You are getting hung up on words. You don't understand paradox. The Tao can't even be described - so you should say this entire subreddit is anti-Tao. You are defining the Way as "whatever", and that is simply false. I don't disagree with many of the statements you make, but that just underscores the extent to which you misunderstood me. To say that disharmony with the Way is somehow the ying to the Tao's yang is a fallacy.    Yes, Im doing the exact same thing in reverse order.    Laws are artificial and very much anathema to the Way. They involve coercion, force, punishment, hierarchy, etc. - the very opposite of the Way. Taoism is essentially anarchist.    What was the object of Kierkegaard's faith?  How was that object manifest, if at all?  If it was manifest, why was faith needed?  If it wasn't manifest, why is it assumed to be the object?  Do we choose what we believe?  Or are our beliefs more like realizations of what we already hold to be true?   You sound like you would definitely like Kierkegaard. Perhaps also Taoism.    Not sure what you mean by that. Could you explain a bit please?   So if he doesn't write enough tickets, he doesn't get paid? Do you really think that has occurred even *once* in the history of mankind?   You really think that explanation applies to governments and their goons with guns (police) too?   Besides, you're saying they steal, therefore they must have needed to steal. You're not saying they need money therefore they might steal.       So they only do it when they need money? Do you steal from others whenever you need money?   yeah: Governments, central banks, wall street.    Pick Frank Gehry and do Bilbao.  Edit: or Corbu - Ronchamp    Start with Huckleberry Finn if you havent read that yet.          This isnt just Ferguson. It is every major city in the US and most other cities as well. It is the rule, not the exception.    The one by Benjamin Bratton. Happens that it is also very INTJ.    Are attempted murderers born or made?   As with any verbal statement, the hearer believes it at his or her own risk. No matter how horny they are.    "The Way of Zen", Alan Watts.    you may or may not. and may or may not want to. we must realize that meanings and qualities are subjective. they arent inherrent in life. though life is indeed precious and fragile.   from his 'philosophy of taoism' series.    Thanks. Got it from one of Alan Watts' lectures on Taoism.   The West also sees the world as artifact. Forgot that part.    meaningless life isnt necessarily a bad thing. life is life. we can give it a meaning that is entirely subjective and internal. doesnt need to be found. nor should it. i would recommend checking out taoism. read 'the watercourse way" for starters. it is not a philosophy or religion, but the way of reality. most problems arise with language and concepts and "learning".    no. one guy fabricated what he said. at least he said later that he had fabricated it.  there were at least two others though. and Fine's wife saying she knew about his behavior all along was probably the most damning.    "By the light shining out of chaos, the sage is guided; he does not make use of distinctions but is led by the light." ~Chuang Tzu   Yes, and he said the world needs a dead man, referring to himself.    But that shouldn't be an option.  The team will be crappy until they get out of that stadium, and Oakland has proven they won't build a better one there.   Boeheim should have lost his job when his pervert assistant coach, Bernie Fine, was let go in 2011 for sexual abuse.  No way Boeheim didn't know about that.   Generally, the East sees the world as a living, growing organism; the West sees the world as a creation or mechanism.    they could keep doing this one more year stuff forever. move to LA already.       yeah they did. i think it was iraq. and they did something similar to syria too, more recently.      im not even going to read all that. and regret having even responded to you to begin with. you are clearly not honest with yourself and/ or your view of the world is subject to your twisted view of your own sexuality.  i mean, you dont really think im talking about gay pride parades. your comments are so layered with contradiction upon contradiction upon false premise - for starters. you, like many non-heterosexuals, do yourself and your supposed "cause" a disservice by talking. shut up and have sex with whatever you want. we dont care.       right.  if they are trends, then we don't need to be told.  if they are trends, we already know about them, as you do.  and if they are trends, they aren't really something that should be validated, emphasized, or perpetuated, per se.  tired of all this reductionism, and formula.  and description as proscription a la rem koolhaas.  this is all one gets in 99.9% of academia.  what about non-trend architects and architecture?  they should report on that.  they should lead, not follow.           Trends.  Yea.    In a perfect world it wouldn't matter, but in today's society social visibility goes a long way toward determining what people determine is the "norm". More public figures that are not-heterosexual there are, the less people will see non-heterosexual people as strange or not normal.  Instead of trying to make something "normal" by getting it out there and making people think more people are into it, try to encourage people to be themselves and do what is right *regardless of whether is is accepted by popular opinion, or regarded as normal, etc.*  Because we all know that "normal" has nothing to do with popular or accepted, and even less to do with whether this or that individual *should* behave a certain way.  The road is narrow, right?  Sure, it might encourage them by knowing it is accepted, but that doesn't mean anything.  It puts the cart before the horse and actually is counter-productive in that it turns people inside out.  You tell them that what matters are appearances, not what you choose to do privately and by *your own* conscience.  So much of the gay movement doesn't get this.  They want acceptance, including self-acceptance, so they act out.  They turn the most private thing into everyone else's business.  Then they defend themselves on the grounds of a right to privacy.  So there is this reflexive disposition among gay people to cheer on anyone in the public arena who is gay or bi or lesbian and comes out.  Like Ra Ra Ra someone is gay and they tell everyone about it.  Most people don't have a problem with gay or bi people practicing their sexuality.  It is this overt "look at me, I'm gay" thing that betrays a deep artificiality to it all.  It appears too forced and external and even political to be natural.      Well, I can definitely tell you that I didn't choose it.  Maybe you didn't choose it.  But if you look at gay males, for example, you'll find that they didn't have a bond with their fathers and/or were extremely over-feminized by their mothers.  This makes them want a male bond, makes them act like women, etc.  Not a choice?  Maybe.  But certainly not genetics or biology either.   Um, it isn't your place to determine people's sexuality, so why are you even asking this?  I'm not saying it's my place to determine people's sexuality.  I'm saying I shouldn't even be able to know what it is, right?  Because it is so private, as homo's and bi's themselves argue.  But you are implicitly advocating that homosexuals or bi people let everyone know - so that it can look like a lot of people are into it and therefore it is then somehow regarded as a norm.  Why is this even in the public sphere?  Instead of advocating for gay marriage, those on your side (I'm not sure about you, specifically) should be advocating for getting government out of all marriage altogether - especially if you're an anarchist.      the first part:  for instance, is homo/bi-sexuality a choice, or is it an acquired taste, or is it biology?    the second:  the OP was cheering on a bisexual governor.  if you regard that as just someone, who happens to be an anarchist, saying something nice about someone (based on sexual preference, and the fact that they're a governor) in what happens to be an anarchist forum, then....you have no point at all.  still: i'd like to hear it explained why/how i even can or should know someone's sexual preferences.  aren't they private, not my business, difficult to determine without being given signs/mannerisms/queues, etc.?     i once opened a bank account right behind a couple who opened an account before me.  the banker put their $9000 in my account.  i told them about it the next day when i discovered it.  they gave me a free book of checks.     then there are all the unspoken assumption which must be true for bisexuality to have legitimacy.....  nevermind how this is *anything* for an anarchist to be doing.   tell us, why/how are we supposed to even know someone's sexual preference? isn't it quite a private matter? and hard to ascertain by observing nonsexual behavior?   yeah power should be as local and decentralized as possible. and that was the way the founders of the US intended.    look up james files online. he plausibly claims to have killed jfk. check it out before you dismiss. his story is riveting either way. there is a pdf and book you can get too.   was a hitman for the chicago mob. charles nicoletti's right hand man.    so you found it defined on the internet.  ok.   have you ever heard the word used in your life outside this post? what about "biphobia"? is this a fear of bicycles, bipeds, binoculars, bison.....anything bi, or what?   further, the actions it refers to as monosexual would include heterosexuality. good luck with that.   what lunacy this is.    try googling "bill o'reilly jfk lie" (without the quotes). that will show you all the evidence you'll need - and won't be able to deny.    How do you explain O'Reilly's JFK/De Mohrenschildt falsehood?   How do you explain O'Reilly's JFK/De Mohrenschildt falsehood?   With evidence that is recorded. Was recorded in real time contemporaneously. Some from O'Reilly's own hand and mouth, his book, the audio tape with Gaeton Fonzi, etc.        i knew of a guy named k.c. starr growing up. does "dale's dairy" mean anything to you?   1.  I never signed a goddamn thing. Because it doesn't exist.    i dont think so. because now we can recognize harmony or disharmony, etc. before i didnt just let it be. always needed answers that werent there.    im never for messing with a good/great thing, but i would like to see the raiders helmet in matte black with a very shiney silver logo (pretty much like chrome). or the opposite - shiney silver helmet with matte black logo. get nike to make some prototypes.    BE **REAL**.    INTJs are actually extremely sensitive.    kierkegaard. the existentialists. then later, taoism.    yeah right. monosexualism isnt really even a word.    arent anarchists against governors? why are we even supposed to know their sexual preference?   good god. anything with "measles" in the title gets automatic upvotes from all you namby-pamby hipster progressives. oh dont you care so much.    i would say that is true.                Then there was this other [lie](http://jfkfacts.org/assassination/news/reporters-tape-exposes-bill-oreillys-jfk-fib/) told by Bill O'Reilly. No wonder he went so easy on Brian Williams.    So licenses are sacred now?     yapping dogs   liars and fraudsters and criminal policemen.       Well the author for you then is Peter Hathaway Capstick. Start with "Death in the Long Grass", "Death in the Silent Places", "Death on the Dark Continent". Page-turners, all. Totally incredible, true stories. Excellent writing.    Woody Allen   In other words, you're still searching for meaning?   yes, you are right. i over-responded to your comment, and was venting a little to the readers as a whole. and i appreciate your thoughtfulness.   yet:  the best writing is by authors who remove themselves from the story, and are completely a medium. they are transparent and not injecting hints of themselves. it detracts and is distracting. it is not about them.  it is immensely distracting and counter-productive to not use quotes.   i strongly believe he is perhaps the most over-rated author of our time. good grief, how much is he going to descibe a sunset with "thin" and "like blood"? try to find another word, cormac. and this punctuation thing is just over-the-top. Pretentious BS in my opinion.    yeah i was thinking that exact same thing. didnt need tuco. he isnt a good actor or that strong of a character.   edit: by "strong", I mean nuanced and interesting.    I hope not.  This show should introduce new characters.  No value to replay the Breaking Bad characters, except for novelty's sake.      his audience shouldn't be decided by who likes less punctuation and who likes more. I mean does anyone ever complain about too much punctuation? Never.   Mark twain? Too many commas. Leo Tolstoy? Too many apostrophes.  otherwise they would've been great writers.   if you're talking about Cormac McCarthy's audience as those who will like him no matter what, and anything he does or doesn't do is marveled at by them - that isn't so much an audience as it is a cult following.    i'd recommend "man and nature", "myth of myself",and "limits of language". they are on YouTube, About 45 minutes or an hour long each.   Instead of less punctuation, how about less pretension.    join the club. it is the same everywhere. except north dakota.    That was his lesser known, but just as ill-conceived, "Raw Deal" plan.    check hillary's biography   you must be pulling that bogus slave trade line out all the time.    functioning democracies = minority rule.      lacma is trying way too hard.    people think im being serious when im being funny or humorous.    i said WTF about half way through.    she isnt a good writer. period.   waaaay too much useless needless detail. read john galt's long speech, if anything. otherwise save yourself a lot of time and fling it out the window. good philosophical ideas do not necessarily make for good fiction novels.   edit: just noticed my previous very similar post here.    instead of "use mispelled words", you could have just said "mispell words". though i realize the former sounds more blatant and careless, the latter sounds like a trivial mistake.    yes, i have found that alan watts' writings and speeches on taoism and on the "self" or non-self are quite illuminating. there might be some recordings on youtube if ur interested.    who we are and how we behave has less to do with our willpower and intentions (how great we make ourselves) than with chance.   for example, smart people dont become smart by reading books and going to school. how were they smart enough to know that reading and schooling would be good for them?  they already had something in them that wasnt taught or found. (socrates for the win.)  further, what is the self? mostly an illusion.    before the meltdown we were 5th.   who knows how great things would be if the draconian regulatory shackles were lifted. or how bad things would be if the weather changed and the ocean dried up.    All the Neil DeGrasse Tyson worshippers should read this.   That's true.  :)  (Well said.)   Yeah, I find that too - that I've held viewpoints all over the board during my life.  And will probably change them again too.  And yes, it's best not to ascribe everything to this or that category or label.  Just to be, to get through the day, to be real and practical and functional, etc.  But the fact that different, even contradictory, views can be held underscores the subjective nature of "truth", that it comes from within and not from without.  For now.   I'd like that too.      what made you less of a subjectivist? i became very subjectivist too, though i think i still am.    seahawks or lions   ill check it out. thanks.    the only philosophy that ever grabbed me and deeply resonated with me was/is existentialism. particularly kierkegaard. and by extension, nihilism. nietzsche, sartre, baudelaire....  but recently i discovered taoism. it shares much with existentialism and is in some ways more simple and profound.    it means your first comment was bogus. WSJ/reason actually quotes Warren directly. that is going to be hard for you to dismiss.  easier to ignore.    eyes dont comprehend things anyway. brains do.                                     I know that Li is organic order, as opposed to mechanical or artificial order.  What I really want to know is if this is a subcategory of wu wei, or could be regarded as its own separate principle of Taoism.    I am writing a paper and that is why I ask, and have to organize it and articulate it somehow.  I realize that really Taoism doesn't have principles and can't be reduced, or formulated, etc.    Right now, the categories in my paper are 1. Yin yang 2. Wu Wei 3. Te.  Would Li be a subcategory of one of these or its own category?  I welcome any tips or advice on this matter, and on Li in general.  Thanks.   Anyone know where the full text might be?  Edit: here it is.   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBQunE_aMaFYBZB1edXifkN6qbILSu316xXifPfrWIo/mobilebasic?pli=1         How does Taoism reconcile mental illness?  Is it natural, is it a type of disease?  What about mental illness that is brought on by trauma?  Also, mental illness can severely complicate one's relationships.  If we are to live in harmony with each other, how can that be achieved if one is so involuntarily out of harmony with themselves?  I would appreciate any and all thoughts on the matter.  Thanks.         This is a more theoretical piece on aspects of a certain architect's work. I think it is quite good, if I say so myself. And I would like to get it published somewhere - somewhere that gets a lot of readership - either online or print or both.  Where do you suggest, and why? Thanks.  	164

Don't give give any views, as you'd just be encouraging him.   Yeah I heard he's pretty cool. You should hit him up sometime. He's like *really* awesome, even though he has posted "shitposts" before.    yeah his posts are even shittier than that "Magoo" guy's posts. lol   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHfY6VTRUFk   Grow some fucking balls.    Ok, obviously no matter what I say, you're going to find some excuse to not have confidence in yourself. Whatever. I tried.   You're over-thinking this, dude. You said you're new to Facebook (which explains the lack of many friends), and they probably aren't going to check who's on your friends list, unless they're really obsessed with you.    They're coworkers who have the hots for you. Of course you should do it!   Wait... He didn't really die? Nice!   My Son... Calm down.    what   ok I have to admit I loled   Step 1: stop posting here and go to r/fitness   [hands on hips] Well that's just not very nice! *hmph!*   1200-1400???????? You pig! your diet is not extreme enough. I went on a permacut last year and went from obese to 106 lbs. (M/5'7") and was hospitalized for anorexia. I was eating a maximum of 1400 calories on a ketogenic diet and started eating less and less until I wasn't eating anything at all. (yeah I was joking when I called you a pig; you really shouldn't go down the same path as me, but if you have bellyfat and boobs, you should keep cutting, as it is much healthier to be underweight than overweight)   What's good Youtube? You know who it is. CHRIS JONES!!!! represent Physiques of Greatness. Today I'm havin' a cheat meal... 'CAUSE SHIT JUST GOT REAL. POG army up in this bitch   Trying to get tons of link karma AND comment karma? Don't be greedy...   Huh, I didn't know Stevie had a Youtube channel   idk, but I'm pretty sure their combined IQ is less than 80...   ok   They killed off the Joker. What the fuck? Why the fuck did they kill off the best Batman character? smh   You didn't fuck anything up. It's good that you got yourself out there, man. Even if they don't have the hots for you (if you want to provide examples, go ahead, but it's not really necessary), it doesn't matter, as what you said really wasn't obnoxious as you just started a friendly conversation. Don't worry about it.   I mean, it is kind of funny.    I just cracked jokes with the other patients all day.    but I already have ODST   missing Witcher 3, Wolfenstein and Arkham Knight   No, but that's what I said so that I would get admitted. I needed to find a place where my psychotic brother wouldn't kill me. lol      Is it worth getting the ultimate edition? I noticed Forza 6 is up for pre-order on the Xbox store.   I'm not trolling here, I am honestly curious. What is the point? I recently started cutting, and I keep doing it. I am for some odd reason allured to harming myself. I almost feel suicidal right now. Fml   How are the Forza games? I haven't played any yet.   SHIT YEAH!   nice      I'm not serious. I sometimes pretend to be this character I created (I'm working on a novel), but I'm not trying to offend anyone.    yeah sometimes I just get in the mood to play this Father Magoo character I created lol   Well that just wasn't very friendly. [hands on hips] Hmph!    My Son, bodybuilding is very good for you. I highly recommend that you begin lifting to attract my Daughters. Just don't cut so hard that you stunt your growth, and don't be a numbcunt by taking gear.      I mean just fuck her mind out very passionately. I think then she'll understand that you're straight.   lolwhut   Thank you for spreading the word, my Son. The Brothers Karamazov is required reading for any Magoo.   Do you know why the song "Pug" is called "Pug"? It has nothing to do with pugs!   What is the album called?   How does that compare to Adore? I haven't listened to everything by Smashing Pumpkins yet.   I really like the songs on this album, and I would like to know of some songs with a similar sound.   The Brothers Karamazov    Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame.   Well... I can't anymore   What do you call a crossdressing elf?   Triss   I got mine at like 3 am last night   Ok if I give you $60 for Fallout 4 will you give me your pug?      Magoo Senior      Magoo Senior   Magoo Senior   Magoo Senior   Magoo Senior      Imlerith from Witcher 3 on Death March... I hate teleporting elves...   thank you   except poor Father Magoo :(   I don't want to unnecessarily hit my bandwidth cap.    Gears of War Judgment   this makes me hard   "Mom! I got an achievement! My life finally means something!"  "Shut the fak up Jambo. I've been trying to sneak 20-year-old guys in this house (my own fakkin' house) for 20 fakkin' years, and all ya do is play dat Fun-box or wateva it's called. I 'ave needs too ya know. Please get da fak out for realsies this time, Jambo."  "Momma... I just realized that it is a completely meaningless achievement, and I really need a place to stay."  "I fucking hate you, son."   Good. Do you play Xbox, Playstation or PC? I play Xbox. My gamertag is Magoo Senior.   Spirited Away is finally being released on Blu-ray in 2 days. Thank you for reminding me. I am pre-ordering it now. What a coincidence for us to have this conversation right before the release of the film. [Here is the link so you can pre-order it too.](http://www.amazon.com/Spirited-Away-2-Disc-Blu-ray-Combo/dp/B00V3QQF6I/ref=pd_sim_74_5?ie=UTF8 refRID=0Z7F9YDNFS313BE8B2E7)     Spirited Away is not a kids' movie. There is a difference between works of art and dumb Pixar movies.   Spirted Away is *not* a kids' movie. It is a great film. Do not bring Miyazaki films into this discussion!   it's not brilliant. hop off Pixar's dick   IT'S OK BRO, I'M BULKING!!!!!!!!   slash got fat   Changing the title of a film doesn't affect its story, it just causes the title to be misleading.   It's fine if they watch it with their children.   should I also buy a ps3?   Will the God of War trilogy be remastered?    dammit, you stole my post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [smashes monitor]   I bought an Xbox One because I love Halo and Gears of War. Are the PS4 exclusives good enough to warrant a purchase of the console?   then why the fuck is there a fucking post about fucking obama????????????????????????????   No, for me, jokes have to contain humor.   it's still fucking childish   I fucking love Refn's films.      wtf is up with all these shitty Roach posts   "inward hard-on"  lolwhut   I'm being serious. I really want to know what movies fit the tone of this song.   I always played Mature-rated games when I was under 17. Now that I'm over 17, I get irritated when people under 17 play M-rated games.    Not gonna lie, I'm a little hard right now.      stop rubbing it in my face that I can't afford a gaming PC   "Last Caress" by Misfits   The Witcher    I believe it is not as big.   Nobody fucking celebrated my birthday two weeks ago. Not even a "happy birthday."   so I can plug in any old earbuds?   no   You're welcome. I hate my father too. Just thinking about him fills me with rage.    kind of deducted that on my own but thanks   what   and they better not include judgment    you need to hit the gym and bulk up. also take some martial arts classes. then if he hits you, you can kick his ass.  or you can call the cops on him for domestic assault  either way, lift weights and learn martial arts. there's nothing wrong with gaming, but it shouldn't be your only hobby. I also like inline skating, reading novels, and trying to get laid at bars.   the problem is that you're playing Lego Jurassic World and you're not a little kid   source?   human Obama is bad enough. we don't need an elven version of him too   Get Hard sucks. I hate Kevin Hart. I hate [censored].   I never said the target audience isn't the defining factor of quality. Stop putting words in my mouth. The target audience for a movie is the audience who should be watching the movie. I never said that there are not well made movies for kids.   Grown Ups is a kids movie   it's outside of his pants, and it clearly states that it is a rifle.    no, I'm selfish   it's not a reboot unless it is based off of that game. it is not, so no, it is not a fucking reboot.   storytelling is a word. no hyphen required.   A Gears of War game that is anything like Judgment.    ok let's get this over with. my gamertag is Magoo Senior. I need this shirt because I love pugs and if I express my love of pugs I will most definitely get laid. I'm kind of broke so I can't buy it myself. A pug shirt would be a great conversation starter, and I am a very charismatic guy. I am quite handsome, but I need to work on my body. I used to be fat, so I have some loose skin. I probably need loose skin surgery, and I should start lifting again to look aesthetically pleasing to the ladies. I don't imagine that chicks like looking at underweight guys with tits.    I would not. It's a kids' movie.   well you're not a kid now, so stop trying to get closure on a fucking kids' movie, mate.      wait are you a troll or just stupid    who cares about the fucking Incredibles? it's a goddamn kids' movie   [Do it! Today!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvVUBZy_MHE)   The only real DOA games are 2, 3 and 4. Please do not remind me of the DOA 5 atrocity.    lolwhut   The Witcher would be a good movie (or HBO show). Kill Bill would be a good game.  	132
 What, do they think Tea is naturally sweet and they "un-sweeten" it to make Tea?  Cause if thats the case... They are retarded.   Saw part of the trailer and nope, just nope... Not even going to bother pirating it either.   "Give 'em the razor; sell 'em the blades"   You mean Tea right?   User name had Cage in it... Where were the sunglasses and Johnny Cages splits nutpunch!?   Explains why everyone in Perth is an absolute fucken cunt.   Well, the victim probably had a cool face?

Don't feel the need for a remake or reimagining or whatever the current buzz word is.    You have the colour contrast/saturation way too high man, damn near eye burning.    The PSPGO was awesome,  I had all the games I wanted without having to change umds, I had the TV out dock so when I got home I could throw it on my TV and continue playing with a SATURDAY controller.  Sure not not all games were available, but the selection they did have wasn't exactly subpar either.  If you didn't like the PSPGO you either didn't have one or never took advantage of all its features.    Sister: Mom, /u/lachryma is bleeding worms all over the table through his head hole...  Mother: That's ok honey, at least he bought potato salad this year. Lets eat?   3DS is just as bad, everyone owns the same 3 or 4 games and the rest is garbage.    Eh, I bought it at launch based on what they were advertising / hyping and that was a handheld that plays games that rival that on the PS3.  Games like Uncharted, Wipeout, Gravity Rush. As well as the announcement of titles like Bioshock, Warriors Lair etc. And showing the tech demo of MGS4 touting how easy they could scale back games to port across... which was pure hype to garner sales and line their pockets.   These are hardly anime/jprg titles that plague the handheld market... But they are what we now have because Sony fucken bailed shortly after release and did nothing to push western developers to continue working on the Vita and burning bridges with the ones that wanted to.    HE CHOPS HIS OWN HORSES HEAD OFF AND USES IT AS A WEAPON!?   *Gon rolls into the room*   You're right,  an omelet does sound good about now.   Fuck that noise, that may be fine for some / you. I play my PS4 when I'm at home and I can wait 5-10 minutes to go take a shit  without the need to pick up a Vita to continue my gaming session on the throne.  Myself and allot of other people bought the Vita because it was sold to us as a "portable console". Ya know, to play games on the go, not at home.  But where are those portable console quality games now? Far and few between.   Where are the shovelware / indie titles?  Fucken everywhere... Not too mention they have already been on every device. I dont want to spend $15 on a game I played 2 years ago on my toaster. I'd rather spend $40 for a portable Resident Evil, Infamous or a new damn IP...   My Vita has been gathering dust for some time and thats even after risking purchases on the slew of Anime/JPRG schlock thats prevalent on the Vita just for something new to play.  But hey I guess I should be grateful that Sony allows me to play PS4 games remotely all the while passing them off as Vita exclusives right?  /angryrant  Edit: Spelling   Something something drink your Ovaltine.

Different DLC, that was the Left Behind DLC. Which was well worth it.  But was not the Grounded mode DLC.   Yeah it came part of a bundle, but not the Left Behind DLC.   It was The Grounded Bundle and it was for multiplayer maps, perks and weapons, not single player related at all.   They also sold it stand alone at $4.99 USD. (Seems like the price went up, it's now $7.55)  I mean cool, It's nice they sorta threw it in along with multiplayer DLC and gave other people the option if they want it or not...   But again they are charging for a level of difficulty, something they could just patch in.    Let the circle jerk continue I guess?  Edit: clarified a bit.

Serious question, what the hell is up with the current trend of releasing "teasers" for a trailer of an upcoming movie?   "Oh hey, you know that movie you know is coming out? Well here's a teaser trailer that the actual trailer will be out soon..."  What's next? They're going to do a press conference to announce an upcoming teaser of a teaser of the trailer for their movie... Why not just skip the bullshit and just release the trailer...?  It seems people care more about the hype and publicity surrounding movies / entertainment than the final product these days.    The same reason Batman doesn't get absolutely destroyed with one blow from most of the super powered villains he faces.   It doesn't serve the plot at hand.   Rectum, damn near killed him.

    http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tea-party-supporters-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/         Movement conservatives are increasingly old, white, male and cranky. Why don't we call the Tea Party what it is: the "Get the Hell Off My Lawn Party"?   Journalism is at its worthless laziest when falling back on false equivalency, airing "both points of view" on a non-debatable topic. Sure, it fills extra page space or airtime, and it allows media owners to escape taking a position, but it is the worst kind of chicken shit.          Forget water stocks and other commodity plays. Human ingenuity consistently finds ways around materials shortages of nearly any kind, and you definitely are not the first investor to read popular stories about future water shortages.   Instead, I invest in technologies and systems that will endure, making money now as well as in the future. Renewable energy is one of those industries, by the way; especially solar (read up on "Swan's Law"). Others include railroads, insurance, consumer staples, technology, health care, urban real estate and energy efficient buildings.   To a large degree, it's not a question of what you invest in as much as what you *don't*. For example, you'll do well with a broad basket of stocks that just avoids fossil fuels, so you could get into a sector ETF focused on something else like consumer stocks, healthcare stocks, insurance, tech, etc..  But beware of fad sectors. Look for reasonable PEG ratios, good ROE, strong competitive moats, durable product lines and good management. That usually means larger companies.                      Well, Greenpeace, if you really care so much about solving the climate mess, why do you continue to oppose the nuclear power that can help us do it?   What's with the giant hot spot in the middle of Russia?   Don't expect it to happen overnight, but I think we'll learn to overcome more of our violent, selfish, simian nature over time--provided that we can cooperate to more fairly distribute the benefits of prosperity, and to avoid destroying the environment that makes that prosperity possible. Challenges, but feasible ones.   It depends on two things: 1) how easily labor is displaced by technology, 2) who owns the technology systems and their output.  This is the "elasticity of substitution" debate that is such a hot economic topic now. I'm not optimistic about labor's value in a world bent on replacing workers with machines, and I'm even less optimistic about owners of those machine systems sharing a penny of their profits with their fellow citizens. Instead, we're seeing a retreat of the rich behind various kinds of moats: guarded, elite residential buildings in a few wealthy cities like London, Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong; wealthy tax havens like Switzerland and Singapore; gated compounds and neighborhoods; remote, expensive resort towns, etc..    Around 20-25 percent the cost of a nuclear plant.   Iraq has been in the grips of a three-way civil war for generations. Saddam represented just one of those three factions and brutally repressed the others. So, when we destroyed Saddam and dispossessed his Sunni Baath followers, we naturally heard some limited gratitude from their enemies. But that wasn't enough to prevent many Sunnis from continuing the war, linking up with Syrian Sunnis, creating ISIS, etc..   To be clear, there was probably no way to prevent this escalation of chaos and fanaticism once we had invaded Iraq. Keeping Baathists employed and in some degree of power many have helped, but it is doubtful. The horrific regional drought was also a trigger that would have been hard to overcome.   After being installed and cultivated by the US for decades, Saddam Hussein broke with the West in the late 1980s after he (and we) learned that the Reagan and Bush administrations had been secretly selling arms to Iran during his bloody war with that country. He then become the Middle East's worst bad boy, invading Kuwait, launching missile attacks against Israel and Saudi Arabia, brutally killing his own domestic enemies in an ongoing civil war, etc..   After his defeat by the US and allies in the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam turned to spouting Islamic religious rhetoric and threats against Israel in a ploy to unite Iraq's warring Muslim factions behind him, which further alarmed the West. He also threatened to sell his country's oil only in Euros, undermining the US Dollar. And, to deter attacks from his neighbors, he also hinted that he manufactured chemical weapons and was building a nuke, which, although untrue, gave GW Bush a flimsy excuse to push the US into invading Iraq.    By Paul O'Neill's very credible account, Bush was so intent on finding any pretense to invade Iraq *before* 9/11 that he and his neocon circle jumped at the chance afterwards, and barely gave a thought to the consequences. Once in, of course, they discovered that there was no easy exit.   Too much, I agree, but don't forget that nearly all opposition to the Iraq invasion came from Dems.  http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107 session=2 vote=00237   Either very stupid or very cynical. http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/01/10/oneill.bush/   Not to grab Iraqi oil; to ensure cheaper *global* oil prices.  Look at the [2003 Brent crude price chart](http://classic.tradingcharts.com/historical/BC/2002/0/continuous.html). Can you spot the month when we invaded Iraq?    You'll have to ask Tony Blair about specifics, but I do recall that British support was rather key.    This was definitely my sentiment at the time but not that of many others.   Cheap oil from SA, Kuwait, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar...   Not "run by"; "protected by". Also "consumed by" (for example, the US Navy is the world's largest single oil guzzler).   Not for Iraqi oil. For Saudi, UAE and Kuwaiti oil. For low WTI and Brent prices.    Not where it matters, they didn't.   I'm just not as sweet as I seem.   Not a bit.   Different world back then. The US fracking boom hadn't yet happened.  Also, the desire to protect ME oil wasn't predicated on the desire to ship it to the US so much as to our allies, to keep the global economy ticking.   And then we had them sandwiched.    Don't be that guy.   Al Maliki? "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." There could be no other reason to support him.  However, the litany of Bush botches in Iraq is endless, so who knows?   Well, it cost several hundred thousand lives and at least $2 trillion, and it spawned ISIS. How did all that benefit us again?   Yeah, but the US at the time was in the act of retaliating against actual Al Qaeda and Taliban strongholds in Afghanistan, where bin Laden and company were hiding out in Tora Bora. We broke off that attack in order to invade Iraq, which Bush well knew had nothing to do with 9/11.   Iraq was in a state of civil war kept in check by a dictator. Saddam did not gas his own Sunni people; he gassed Kurds and Shia.    Indeed it did, although not through our mere presence so much as through our unforgivable blunders with de-Baathification, etc..   I'll look up a vid.   I doubt that the intention was to grab Iraqi oil. Most accounts of the conversation, such as O'Neill's, indicate that plans called for Iraqi oil primarily to pay for reconstruction. However, the greater oil objective was to eliminate the threat that Saddam posed to the oil business across the region, as well as to Israel.   So did some Shias. But that was a far cry from any kind of general welcome, no?    Well, thanks...I think. Your reference piqued my curiosity enough to drive me to read one of his articles, and he seems interesting. However, I'm definitely not overly concerned with Marx and Hegel, as he seems to be.   The US and NATO have Russia surrounded as it is, including air bases, naval bases and missiles much closer to Russian borders than Iraq is. Pressuring Russian client Syria may have contributed to the Iraq decision, but I doubt that anyone was trying to piss off Russia itself. Just my inexpert quick take, however.   The Middle East oil patch has been politically unstable since its discovery. The 1990s saw widespread warfare there.   Just summarizing the article, with only a little editorializing.   Maybe, although one cannot dismiss deeper, oily motives.   Nope. Presbyterian.   I couldn't agree more. I merely pointed out what some *expected* to happen. Needless to say, they were blind to some key realities.    Depends on the cutoff date you choose, as well. If you mean just during and immediately after the invasion, 100,000-200,000. If you include the 12 years of bloody, escalating chaos that the US invasion unleashed, many, many more and still counting. ISIS is a direct result.       "Why would we want to reassure Saudi Arabia?!"  I dunno. Maybe a well-equipped, belligerent rogue nation spanning most of their northern border, just a few hours' drive from Ghawar and Riyadh? A rogue nation that had already demonstrated its ambitions by seizing Kuwait and spraying missiles all over the region, including more than a few at SA itself?  "Iran wasn't the target, it was Saudi Arabia."   Tell that to the American and British conservatives who crowed during the Iraq invasion, ["Boys go to Baghdad but real men go to Tehran"](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/04/21/war-without-end).  "you've defined the situation without truly knowing all the facts...you can't fundamentally know what's really going on."  Enlighten me, then. Share your insights rather than just claiming to know secrets.   Let's just complete that headline:  "The biggest threat to Americas future is  American conservatives bent on wrecking the Federal government and fracturing Americans into angry tribes, while ignoring all foreigners unless they sell us cheap oil."    This article asks exactly that real-adult question.   Stabilize the Persian Gulf oil industry and political landscape, reassuring the Saudis, Israelis, Emirates and so on, while creating a staging area for military pressure on Iran. Behind it all, an overarching desire to consolidate Anglo-American control, ensuring the continued flow of Middle Eastern oil and deeper military partnerships with key allies there. Basically, a greedfest for an American-run military-petroleum complex.  Much also has to do with the American conservative hard-on for World War Two, which led to the ignorant delusion that Iraqis would "greet us as liberators", and that the occupation would go as smoothly as in postwar Japan and Germany.     the person with the highest production values in their commercials and campaign will probably get the disinterested voters.  They already do, don't they?   [Half of Americans](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119358) do not have computers or broadband. That share is far higher among black and Hispanic households, as well as in poor states and counties, on Indian reservations, etc.. What about them?   Sometimes apathy, but often just very busy, hardworking people who forget to take time to vote before or after work, and who can't get paid time to do it. It's no surprise that 70-somethings vote three times as often as the young; younger adults are juggling school, work, childcare, military service, moving for jobs, and much else. So we have a government of the old, by the old, and for the old.   Let me know when you repeal gravity, and I'll move there for the flying cars.   Maybe *you* thought the idea behind basic income is to destroy the rest of the social safety net, but I call that a right-wing fantasy--just like the notion that we can have a functioning society in which all the rewards go to the rich.   Not if you think the purpose of basic income is to reverse rising inequality and to reduce the need for a police state.   Almost. To be durable, a UBI must indeed be *in addition to* basic human services such as education, healthcare and childcare. However,  the myth that all of the poor will blow every other spare dime on hookers, heroin and horse racing just doesn't bear out.   Meanwhile, the alternative is inequality rising to intolerable extremes, with a massive police state growing in tandem.   Most of these systems are mounted in police cars, and static cameras are already becoming too ubiquitous to avoid. Next it'll be drones recording vehicle locations. Meanwhile, the vehicles themselves are becoming rife with location-revealing gadgets.  All your credit purchases already locate you as well. So do the RFID chips on the products you buy with credit cards. Then there's facial recognition software, which will soon tie into surveillance cameras in every store, every parking lot, every public square, every ATM. And so on.  By the time self-driving cars become cheap and practical, their records of your location will be the least of your privacy worries.         Tort reform = Eliminating the right of patients to sue for careless treatment. [Like these poor bastards.](http://listverse.com/2013/05/29/10-horrible-cases-of-medical-malpractice/)     And Oregon is a vote-by-mail state as well. This couldn't possibly have anything to do with Oregon having some of the [country's highest voter turnout](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Elections/2012/1106/Voter-turnout-the-6-states-that-rank-highest-and-why/Oregon), could it?   Not necessary if you vote by mail, as every voter in my state does.   This. Every US city has flat corridors that should include dedicated bike infrastructure, but generally don't.     Washington benefitted a lot from attracting higher middle class people  Cite? I would argue that Washington income averages are skewed by its incredibly wealthy elite and relatively small population. The state also has a fortunate mix of hot companies in tech, biotech, aerospace, healthcare and consumer services, as well as the largest export economic share in the country.  Still, poverty rates have risen over time and inequality is extreme. Once you get beyond the glow of Seattle, there's a lot of life on the skids.   Is there really any difference between economics and politics? Nothing is more political than the distribution of money.   The WA B O tax rate for service businesses is quite high at .015%, and these are the businesses that employ the most minimum wage workers.   Unfortunately not. Human drivers will disrupt and endanger an otherwise smoothly coordinated traffic system. The idea is to do away with traffic lights, traffic jams and even traffic laws.   Countless ways. Here's [just one small example.](http://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/products/software-applications/public-sector-applications/automatic-license-plate-recognition.html)   How true. The trouble with dedicating oneself to constantly repeating a big lie is that, at a certain point, one can never reverse course.   These days I think of the Republican Party as a philandering husband caught in bed with his wife's best friend, endlessly saying, "what woman? I see no woman here...".   5 feet is a beautiful standard, if only for the fact that it's so much easier to publicize and enforce than the widely ignored 3-foot laws in some states. Most drivers probably won't yield the full five feet, but they'll yield *something*.   Think of where tech will be, not where it is. Dealing with unmapped roads won't pose a problem for long. Meanwhile, the privacy of one's movements is already nearly gone, for a number of reasons beyond your phone, and such privacy will soon be even rarer.    How would automated cars take away your freedom to go where you want? And records of your movements are already kept.    This is why the fossil fuel industry gives [90% of its campaign money to Republicans](http://grist.org/politics/heres-why-the-gop-just-loves-fossil-fuels/). They're for sale.   Out of sight, out of mind.   Article is behind registration wall.   Gut bank regulation and defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? What could possibly go wrong?   Tax-exempt bonds are supposed to be for state and local infrastructure and not private business."  Bingo.    Same here. Buddies and I rode to school most days, and early teen summers were dedicated to maximizing distance between our Schwinns and our parents. That just doesn't exist now.   That and the 1970s energy crisis, both of which spurred the Dutch and Danes to prioritize cycling infrastructure along with wind energy and much else. [Here](http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/10/brief-history-cycling-denmark-netherlands/) is a good piece on it.      That and the [other reasons](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/10/newport_surfer_on_great_white.html).   The author seems unaware of the fact that fossil fueled Republicans *want* ordinary people to feel pain from EPA regulations, to generate fiercer opposition to them.   No   Not being a sys admin, I can't comment on the skills you'd learn in a larger enterprise, but I will say that large corporate names bring prestige to almost any resume, in any business field.         Been there as well at minus tide. On acid. Which may be the only way to make the natural colors actually seem that vivid.      Given their apparent phallic fixation, shouldn't they be going after the Washington Monument rather than the White House?   Advertisers *do* pay you. They provide you with television networks, radio stations, magazines, newspapers, and an incredibly wide range of websites, games and apps--all for the small price of trying to lure you with appealing messages. That isn't such a bad exchange.   38 inches in Seattle, and almost none of it in the summer. Get ready to fork out millions for larger reservoirs.                         Another attack on climate science from a paid oil industry minion.  Get used to this. It won't be the fossil fuel industry's last attempt to defund NASA's climate work.   It *is* global warming. The slowing, wobbling polar jet is being driven far north off the West Coast by a warm NE Pacific; the jet picks up cold Arctic air before lurching southward into New England. Result: the entire US West Coast has a record-warmest winter and ongoing drought even as Boston freezes.  The world just had another record-warmest year. This won't be the last time we see wild swings like this. In fact, this may be a recurring pattern.   A more likely possibility: Seattle has always been a boom/bust town, and property prices are currently booming, meaning that many restaurants are facing more costly lease renewals.   The minimum wage boost is still years away for the vast majority of them. This story is just a local magazine's way to spin controversy.   Seattle Mag is a slick monthly, but I take your point. And the fact that very few of these restaurants will have to raise wages for years to come suggests that recent closures are for other reasons entirely--such as the fact that Seattle is positively crawling with restaurants.   Solar's cost is primarily in panels, infrastructure and transmission; not in land. It's also relative to electricity cost, which is generally highest in most populated areas. So simply providing land for solar in pipeline country, like the middle of Oklahoma, North Dakota or Alberta, doesn't make it worth anyone's while to buy the panels or to pay for transmission to distant cities.   "Thus, although CR do not contribute measurably to the 20th-century global warming trend, they do appear as a nontraditional forcing in the climate system on short interannual timescales".   They actually hired Timothy McVeigh's defense attorney for this? The clueless haven't a clue.         [Here is the link](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov) to the petition, for anyone who cares to sign. There are 271,450 signatures at this writing.               Based on all the downvotes, it looks as if the anti-science brigade is in full lurk.   First, the recent oil price crash may not be a slump so much as the beginning of a long liquidation. The sheiks are not revealing their motives, but they know that oil will be outlawed as a fuel within a few decades.  Second, the primary beneficiaries of a price uptick would be the nationalized companies that comprise 80% of the oil industry, and which have the world's lowest production costs.      The study seems to clearly show that the rate of change is not constant at all; it is accelerating.   Joining Citizen's Climate Lobby is a good place to start. They're one of the most focused and effective groups, and they're dedicated to passing a fee-and-dividend carbon tax.         Your posts here just explained why solutions to this must be broad and systemic. Leaving the matter up to individuals who are locked into high-polluting life investments simply doesn't work; we need to help one another move to something better.   It's never too late to stop making the problem worse.   It's a press release. There is no such language in the actual abstract: http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2552.html   One could also call it The Confederate States of America.   All that, *and* lower earners pay [far more](http://www.ibtimes.com/poor-families-pay-double-state-local-tax-rate-rich-study-1782956) of their income in state and local taxes as well.   Technicalities. I'm among the Chosen, so I get a free pass! Mom always said I was special.     We don't need the GOP? You mean the party that controls Congress, the Supreme Court, 31 governorships and 29 state legislatures?  Yes, we need Republicans.      Says the left-leaning Guardian. They're right, but I still chuckle at the irony.      Pensions can be portable.    Mine, too. However, neither of us sound like the throng of low-paid, nonunion blue-collar workers in my area whose life savings couldn't buy a new Kia.     For those hyperventilating over the headline hype, it's helpful to know that this comes from The Stranger, Seattle's edgier alt weekly, and this is their typical tone. However, the message is a good one: a port commission that claims environmental leadership, yet is dropping trou for Arctic drillers, needs to be held to account.   Social Security and Medicare predated the loss of American pensions, while IRAs and 401(k)s were only intended to supplement traditional pensions, not to replace them. As replacements, they have been miserable failures, as this article and many others point out.      A very weak one, so far.   The fossil fuels industry and its business allies are behind most organized climate science denial, and they don't hate anyone. For these coldly calculating bastards, business is business, Mann is in the way, and riling up the peasants against him is simply an effective tactic.    The Republican Party sells out to the oil industry once again.   Yet pensions created and sustained a middle class, and they still do in the rest of the developed world, loosely speaking. Americans alone have abandoned them, largely to fund incredibly costly health insurance instead, yet we have replaced pensions with...nothing.   More evidence that voluntary savings will never provide enough for retirement. Hell, [half of American workers have saved nothing](http://www.providencejournal.com/news/economy/20141122-how-will-you-retire-half-of-us-have-nothing-saved-and-many-others-far-too-little-interactive.ece). They think they'll just keep working until they drop, as if any employer wants a creaky octogenarian tottering around. In many industries it's now nearly impossible to find a job after age 45, let alone in one's failing twilight years. Even Walmart employs few of its ancient greeters any more.  This is why the vast majority of employee benefits *outside* the United States are *pensions*, and, in rich countries, those are generally in addition to public safety nets more generous than those in the US. Let's face it: the American abandonment of pensions, with nothing sensible to replace them, has become an unmitigated disaster.                        Yes, but there is no shortage of plans for what to do with carbon taxes, yet this author doesn't mention a word about them, nor about the fact that absolute carbon pollution caps will ultimately be needed as well. It all seemed very short on saying anything other than, "l'm a conservative concerned about climate!".   From the article: But I think weve tried to explain that the connection from an extraordinary climate event to conflict is complex and certainly involves other factors.               A very vague piece, as expected. Would be nice to know why minimizing the tax burden is such an important goal, and exactly whose tax burden would be minimized.    Tough. Fossil fueled whores have been harassing dozens of legitimate climatologists for decades, issuing hundreds of FOIA demands and dozens of lawsuits, attacking the word's best researchers in every way possible in order to delay evidence of the obvious--delays which will cost humanity millions of lives and trillions of dollars. Now they're whining? Well, fuck them very much.   Where did you get the idea that civilization will be gone in fifty years?  Yes, climate change is a severe threat, but few serious scientists forecast anything as dire as what you believe. It's a very long-tail probability.    Wherever the aims of capitalism and religion meet, watch out.    First, they think the American public is more conservative than it is.  Second, as true believers, they are blindly focused on destroying government.  Third, they know that the young don't vote and the old vote Republican, and that the old are the fastest-growing demographic segment, so fuck everyone else.              This has been underway for many decades in the more desirable corporate marketing departments and their ad agencies, where many senior employees once literally started in the mailroom, with no more than high school educations, then worked their way up into great upper-middle class positions, with plenty of company-paid training and mentoring along the way. Now the path to those great jobs is through selective graduate schools that cater to the privileged.  The result is a growing wall between less educated people and opportunity, with the scales tipping heavily towards those who can afford the high price of entry.   Read skepticalscience.com. Especially the list of scientific responses to denier claims.   The social cost of carbon is very likely much higher than $50/ton. It's been repeatedly revised upward, and the longer we dither the higher it goes. [This recent Stanford study](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/january/emissions-social-costs-011215.html) estimates the cost to be $220/ton.  I know that economists generally prefer carbon taxes to caps, but it's a false choice. The intense need to completely quit carbon within our lifetime means that we will have both taxes and caps, on graduated scales over time, with taxes rising while caps clamp down from above.    Good question. As far as I can tell, the answer appears to be: [we're arguing about it.](http://americablog.com/2014/06/climate-news-arctic-seafloor-methane-release-double-previous-estimates-matters.html)   [Chicken is pretty low carbon.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/vegetarian-or-omnivore-the-environmental-implications-of-diet/2014/03/10/648fdbe8-a495-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html) About 7 lbs of carbon emissions per pound of food. In contrast, it takes 27 lbs of carbon pollution to produce a pound of beef. That's versus about 3 lbs for rice or potatoes.          Absolutely. However, those most able to change are those young enough to face lots of material life choices, who can easily decide to live in a city, in an efficient building close to work and transit, to invest in carbon-alternative stocks like solar and railroads, etc..     It's all about the oceans. If any temperature data would falsify the climate change consensus, it would be extensive evidence of prolonged cooling at all depths in the oceans, which we could only get from a huge network of deep sea thermometers that we don't have. However, we *do* now have a pretty good network of ARGO floats measuring temps in the upper half of the oceans, and they show definite long-term warming proceeding from the top down.   The PDO is only recently confirmed and remains poorly understood, but that appears to be the key to understanding long-interval warming cycles.    "The reason a carbon tax is popular is because it is easy to implement (people can pollute as much as they want, they just have to pay the unit price)"  That's why carbon taxation won't be enough. Sure, the dividend scheme solves the regressive nature of carbon taxes, but, ultimately, carbon pollution must end altogether within a few decades. Yes, fee-and-dividend taxation will be helpful and popular. However, in the end, the need here isn't to *reduce* fossil fuel burning but to *eliminate* it.   "Cameron busts a budget"   "Linklater was a kid"   "Keaton is morose again"  "Nicholas Cage Will Work For Beer".    I always felt that the religious right should be environmentalists  Except for that "have dominion over the earth and subdue it" part.    You'll have to persuade your fellow conservatives first.  http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Politics/story?id=2344929 page=1#.Ua_7sEAWJr8   The main benefit of this is that it solves the regressive nature of carbon taxation.   However, carbon taxes will never be enough because, ultimately, carbon pollution must stop altogether. That means a cap on it that declines over time until fossil fuel burning is outlawed entirely, probably around fifty years from now. Carbon taxes help, but they can't replace the need for that coming ban.      Half measures. Fee-and-dividend is all well and good, but only if the fee is high enough to actually deter polluters, and that will be high indeed.   We need carbon caps as well. And, ultimately, before this century is out, our grandkids must ban any and all burning of fossil fuels worldwide. Those are the simple facts if we are to keep the Earth peaceful and prosperous.   Merchants of Doubt, for sure. Also Desmogblog.com and Skepticalscience.com.   Of course, most of the public relations strategies used by the energy industry today were pioneered by PR firms working for the tobacco industry fifty years ago. [Here](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Tobacco_industry_public_relations_strategies) is a good page on that from Sourcewatch. And the tobacco companies adopted those tactics from the master propagandists of the 1930s, especially Joseph Goebbels.      Why not blame the developers? They effectively run most county governments, which is why the codes are so weak in the first place.   As for buyers, they simply don't know what they're missing. Yet.   Right after you check your bias towards ruinous carbon pollution.   By the way, I don't care if we kill carbon with solar, nuclear, wind or oyster farts, as long as we kill it soon.   And the worst free marketeers of all: suburban tract developers!   Everyone in Idaho: give away all your property, forgive trespassers, hand over your guns, then take in every drifter, bum and prostitute you can find, and don't forget to wash their feet with your hair.         Damn, that's three times now that we've botched our chance to get rid of Texas.   This. Most builders build energy efficiency only to the degree that code requires, so the key is to upgrade building codes to something like "passive house" standards. Airtight construction with heavy insulation and sophisticated ventilation. The beauty of it is that this doesn't cost a dime more than ordinary construction, due to eliminating big HVAC systems. It generally makes a better building, too; very quiet and durable, with much cleaner indoor air.  As for this article, I was disappointed that the author didn't really address insulation and temperature efficiency much at all. That, not electrical management, is most of the efficiency story.    No one expects rooftop solar to power the entire country. However, quitting fossil fueled power as soon as possible may be the greatest need that humanity now faces, so *all* economically viable alternatives need immediate development. Most economic estimates put the net cost of decarbonization at around 1-2% of GDP, but it won't be free. But erecting price barriers to distributed solar in order to shelter life-threatening polluters is unconscionable.   Fossil fueled energy is indeed far more highly subsidized than rooftop solar is, and that's without considering pollution and health externalities, which add several multiples to that cost.   Granted, the taxpayer buildout of the national grid was decades ago, but it remains one of the costliest national projects ever undertaken. It wasn't merely the BPA and TVA, either. It was the Rural Electrification Act, the construction of mammoth projects like Grand Coulee and Hoover dams, and much more. I have no idea what the total value of all that is in today's dollars, but it's probably in the trillions. And then utilities were given monopoly control of these market areas, which has enormous value in itself. It's no stretch to say that utilities are way out of line extorting fees from taxpayers who do the right thing in net metering.         A few questions:   Quitting fossil fuels is an urgent priority, and switching to solar provides a low-cost means to do that, so why erect barriers to solar that preserve the fossil fuels monopsony?   Fossil fueled electricity is much more highly subsidized than solar is, so why compound those subsidies by erecting cost barriers to distributed solar?   Much, if not most, of core grid infrastructure was built at taxpayer expense, and ongoing maintenance by utilities has already been compensated by granting those utilities market monopolies, so why are they due anything more?     Note: quality vineyards take decades to come into their own, so rapid warming makes *any* vineyard investment risky. Prime terroir is now a quickly moving target, so the window of profitable production in any region will shrink. Still, it seems clear that the Columbia Valley and northwestern Europe will be among the best bets.  Still, for every new wine region opening there will be another closing, losing massive investments in infrastructure and old vines. This is likely to be a net loss to wine producers and consumers.     	200

 Wow 90%? That's really amazing how far we've come on this. Just a few years ago a doctor friend of mine said Hep C was just as bad as HIV because there weren't very many good treatment options.   That's awesome, I love the idea of Siberia as a setting. Like if global warming fries the world and Alaska/Siberia/Canada become home for the mega cities.   I think this just kind of happens to everyone as you grow up. I'm still in my 20's but my wife and I mostly just hang out with each other, and when we do go out, it's usually just with other couples for dinner.

From Wikipedia:  In the United States, thousands of wildlife crossings have been built in the past 30 years, including culverts, bridges, and overpasses.

I always find that if I can get off to a good start in the morning, the rest of the day takes care of itself.  I also think it's a good idea to get as much done the night before to make the morning easier. I always make my lunch, pack my bag, and lay my clothes out at night. That way in the morning I'm not rushing to get everything ready. I just grab my stuff and go.    I totally second this. If I don't stick to a routine every time I work from home, it just falls apart pretty quickly. "Just 15 minutes" of video games/reddit/distractions quickly turns into hours.  So just like u/arrant_pedantry said, I just automatically wake up, run, shower, and then sit down with my computer in a room without a TV and start cranking out work.    Hey right by Bobby and Steve's...I used to get personal pizzas there all the time.   She's pretty   That's so awesome. I love the idea of going to flea markets/yard sales and swapping things for old games.   Bummer. Thanks for the response!   Sorry if this has already been asked, but can you download the HD collection with all 3 games for the Xbox 360?   I've seen the physical copy that has all three games (2, 3, and 4) but when I go to the Xbox site or get on Xbox live, it only has an option with two games (and Peace Walker as a separate game):   http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/MGS-2-AND-3/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024b4e0840     I wonder what the Germans would have thought on D-Day if they saw a fleet of Miata's approaching...   This your bush?    A warm bed, tasty food, and good company.    Just moved up a weight in my dumbbell bench. Now I'm doing 140lbs for reps. Not huge for most people, but the most I've ever been able to do!    I would guess jobs related to entertainment and creative ventures, things that appeal to the human side of us. Like machines may totally design and build the gaming console of the future, and may even program the games, I think a human will still have to provide the story, characters, and relationships that make those games so appealing to us.    This really is the most damaging effect of all of this, in my opinion. A strong scientific and technical culture is what gave the U.S. such an edge for so long, and now we're pissing it away over politics.    This is really great to see.    Congrats bro!   Damn, where do I sign up?      Anyone tried the Chipotle tofu? I've heard good things but I live on the east coast.   Wow...that guy sucks at his job.   Just to play devil's advocate here, these companies have to spend billions in R D costs to make these drugs. If they don't charge money to recoup their costs the drugs would never get made in the first place.   My only advice on a schedule is to do the important stuff, like job hunting and housework, early right when you wake up.  If you start off with "just an hour of games to get me going", I guarantee that it will turn into an entire day on the computer.   Say what you will about her, but "Save the Best for Last" is a great song.   No picture?   Burn      They are pretty shabby. Same goes for any of those "all-in-one" gadgets you find from Chinese/Hong Kong sellers. I bought an MP3/MP4 video/music player. The video function never worked and it would only let you listen to tracks straight through. If you tried to skip ahead or shuffle it would reboot itself. Total crap.    Yeah actually. FFVII when I was in 8th grade and I've loved it ever since. My 2nd favorite is also the 2nd one I played: FFVIII.         Congrats and welcome!   Nice job! And with my favorite trio to boot :)   Cats really are great. Sorry for your loss.  	68

I just found a method to run from RocketDock/Desktop  #YOU NEED TO SAVE BOTH LAYOUTS FIRST   TO MAKE THE JOB EASIER FOR YOU UNHIDE APPDATA. if you don't know how to do so look it up.

After you copy and paste.   PS: you can convert to .exe. With online program. When compiling to exe check invisible Program. Now cmd will not show while running script.    This happened to me too. I run a laptop with a second monitor. Everything on the second screen ends up disorganized on my monitor when disconnected.   My last resort, after hours of trial and error, was to create two layouts. One for single monitor on the move and another for dual monitor. Tested and it works well. As for now this is the only solution. I am still looking for a method to load the layouts from the desktop/rocket dock  (too lazy to enter the program everyone at school.)  I'll keep you up to date.    Right click on visbubble and click (first option) __VisBubble__ (bold).   Settings.ini should be right the.

Don't judge me, but I have found it to be remarkably good, as it supports auto-correct, touchpad zoom and smooth scrolling which I absolutely love using. I use a mouse while producing music and therefore the smooth scroll comes in handy.  I do know that there are plugins for this on the chrome store, and at chrome://flags. But these controls are often wonky and I'd like them natively and stable in chrome. I do prefer IE over chrome at the moment as there are certain sites which format wrongly on IE. IE also does not completely support HTML5.  For now I'll stick to IE having chrome installed as alternative, for the sole reason that IE is easier to use for the laptop. I'd be happy to switch to chrome in an instance, if they integrate smooth scroll and tp zoom natively.  I do know that this is not the perfect place to portray my opinions, but frankly IDGAF. sorry guys   So I've noticed that the ie plugin page only has a small amount of plugins listed there. Unlike the chrome store or the Mozilla store most plugins are on independent sites. Anyone who uses IE11 frequently post your favorite plugins and links.

       Bottled water.   I mean, everyone was like who the heck would want to buy water at the price of softdrinks? Look at them now.      That's sad to hear :( how can I widen my skillset then?   Thanks for the input, could you provide more details please?   It's an Australian degree for the bachelors in engineering and masters in engineering. Right now I could switch over to either civil, structural or environmental but i'm not too sure about it.   It was actually called Geomatics Engineering but my university renamed it for some reason. It is accredited by Engineers Australia, EUR-ACE and RICS and material we cover include:  Using SQL to program (also learnt C, C++, Java and Python), SDI, GIS, GNSS, Geodesy, Standard math (calc+lin. algebra), land administration, ER Modelling, relational algebra, remote sensing.    Sometimes on first dates I like to just stare into the other person's eyes, hold their hand and tell them:    "Did you know Ho Chi Minh used to work as a baker in London"?   I take out the white cream in Oreos and fill them with white toothpaste and leave them on the counter.   You can for a while then your body gives in. Try refraining from thirst and hunger.      Sounds like.... *drumroll* ... BONERMAN!   Just to give an overview of what courses we have to take:  Using SQL to program (also learnt C, C++, Java and Python), SDI, GIS, GNSS, Geodesy, Standard math (calc+lin. algebra), land administration, ER Modelling, relational algebra, remote sensing and some geology courses like applications of geophysics, tectonics   geodynamics, field mapping and sedimentary geology.    Are GIS careers really my only option?   Hey all, just planning for a not-to-serious performance for my residential college and picked some pieces out that are somewhat entertaining both for classical and non-classical audiences which are as follows:   1) Palmgren - Snowflakes (Fitting, it's almost winter right now!)  2) Bartok - Allegro Babaro   3) Schubert Sonata no.14 - Movement I or III  4) Liszt Legende no.2  5) Prokofiev - Suggestion Diabolique  6) Aaron Copland - Cat and Mouse   What do you guys think? Too many "short" pieces? I'm open to any suggestions and advice :)                           OP UPDATE PLEASE.   Better safe than sorry!  	25
 Anything captured on camera that makes your head turn   Blockbuster.......watching a movie online is nothing compared to the great feeling of seeing one last copy of that new release.  Plus is was down the street from my house, so there's that.   Zim   Whenever I'm at a friend's house that is near train tracks I fear that the train will derail and come straight through the house and kill everybody.  	4
 RHCP Blood Sugar Sex Magic   Congrats to the top of the board.  Your friend Michael from Dallas, then Mesa AZ, and, unfortunately back to Dallas soon here to wish you Congrats on the whole trip.   Would be awesome in /r/unexpected   No lie, I immediately saw your pic and went "Hey, Bill Nye" then hung my head in my own wrong shameful ness   I'm sorry I can only up vote that once   All I get when I try to load Bacon Reader is an error that says 410 UnAuthorized..  Anyone else having these problems.  Also, about 60% if not more of the time gif's don't work.  Does anyone know of any solutions?   Why the hell is every dessert "pudding"?   BRILLIANT      Well, that explains why Gemma is always...  Living on the edge   Seen your bike here and love it.  Just a personal opinion, take it for whatever you want.  A front turn signal replication kit would move your signals down to the front forks and clean up those nice ape hangers a lot  Edit: but seriously, I love your street bob   Jim Vs Dwight   I'm actually afraid to click the link, I don't want to be one of the last things I hear before bed         My story is a little odd but fitting.  I apparently had a sleep walking problem I never knew about until one particular night my junior year (maybe senior I can't remember) of high school.    I woke up, shaving, in the shower.  I normally shaved in the shower to save time.  Half of my face was cleanly shaven, no Knicks or, finished my shower and dried off.  I realized I had no idea what time it was so I hurried.  I saw that it was 1:00 and freaked out thinking I over slept by hours and was afraid of getting in trouble.  I jumped into my clothes, grabbed my back pack and ran out the door.  It was dark out.  1am.  But hey, at least I was already dressed and shaved for the day.   I agree, grooved concrete is bad enough on a bike.  But a quick stop, downhill, possible wet, over a drain?  I'll find a different route on a bike   Were there any clues in the final season to Tommy's identity before the reveal in the final scene?  Did I miss them?   How so?  I've been in Harley sales.  When it comes down to it, your going to do one of 3 things after you buy the bike.  1) Your going to ride it and maintain it damning the cost 2) your going to ride it, not maintain it, not respect your machine and let it go to Shit, or 3) let it sit and rot in your garage.  Any hobby worth doing is going to get more expensive as you immerse yourself further into it.  Fact of life.   All in all, if you do your own maintenance, expect to pay between 8-10k for the bike and expect  the same in parts   Really I don't intend any disrespect in my response.  But if you're the type to ask "Is it worth the cost of  maintenance?" I suggest a different hobby.  Woodworking:  oh wait.  Saws have to be maintained and lumber isn't cheap.  Oh, and safety gear.  Maybe try hiking: but then you have trail fees, safety gear, books to buy, camping equipment if you get really into it.  Plus all the time you have to take off of work for trips.  Maybe canoeing or kayaking.  Your initial up front cost is a $1200 kayak if you want something new and versital.  Oh and the carrying rack on your car, stuff for day trips, fees to get into national parks.  Oh yeah and safety equipment like beacon lights and life preservers.  Don't forget paddles, they cost too.  Shit that's expensive too.  Everything you do is going to cost money.  Every easy to get your ass out and experience something is going to cost you.  Get educated, get prepared, then say fuck it and enjoy your self.    But don't forget to but a helmet.    Good eye.  You do have to add in quite a bit for the 3imch BDL primary drive, that'll run you up.  If your not doing the work your self estimate a min. Of $60 an hour for labor.  Might get a better labor deal from a local bike shop than a Harley shop.   Could be retitled /r/momsofoldschoolcoolsubscribers   Da FUCK did I just read?   I feel like he's replacing a list of talented pop Shit with talentless pop Shit   Favorite MFC girl   Probably the most hauntingly addictive random sub I've seen so far   Still cute though      He looks better as a Tranny, is that weird?   Worlds hottest 5 head   I'd believe it.  I went to Plano Senior High School.  When I graduated in 2002 we had 22 soda vending machines in the school cafeteria   Not cool dpenton, you shouldn't "Tug" on somebody's emotions like that   Bit Torrent it is then Walberg   Have a good link to watch the shield online?   Jax and Opie getting into some serious trouble as kids   I concure, I've discovered some serious foreshadowing in a couple Monologs   How do you think Wendy will go out?   I don't really think Sutter would have a problem writing her off in the last episode.  He's given her such av spotlight for so long what an epic ending for a character   Jax, Nero and Juice took the whole episode, but Juice took it the most   An eye for balancing books like Bobby...?  I see what you did there.   What ever I can do to help ;)   He's from Houton, they do that down there  EDIT: My bad, thought your comment was from a different post I had made earlier, that's what I get for day drinking while on reddit on my day off.   I have no actual knowledge whether or not this kid is from Houston.  But.... Seriously...  Houston Sucks, fuck those guys   Your the kind if weirdo I want to be working next to in a kitchen all day   A red neck kid pretending to be even more red neck.....  And he's way to young to have a belt hanging out from under his shirt...  He'll make for an awesome redditor one day   Why would Nero know the whole truth about JT?   How about the basement of the Alamo?   Poopflinger  That is all   Yeah, looks more like JT   Pretty sure they had an old episode of Rescue 911 about this same scenario   I really didn't intend it to be that.  I grew up Catholic and my dad's step mother had that same type of voice just not as strong.  Everyone I hear Katy Sagal sing it just take me to that memory   That's what I thought, but I feel like there was more buzz on here about Tig being the rat than anyone else   We've all be discussing who the rat is over the last several weeks.  At first I was annoyed at this topic being dominated by nothing but a bunch of fan theory, but I soon fell privy to it as well.  I've seen almost no discussion on the reveal of Borosky being the rat and anyone's opinion.  Anyone feel cheated at a weak reveal or let down it wasn't a member?    "Trust me, in here, all I am is somebody's asshole"   Wouldn't be surprised if it was just Sutter's way of being funny while extending the table   Agreed about the 4th wall.  I think that's my biggest problem with it.    I also have stylistic issues.  Her sound is very mid 80's gospel country (that's not a shot, I promise). It doesn't really seem to fit the show.    If she were the lady in the pew behind me at Sunday church I'd be amazed.   That's the only thing that makes sense to me   No idea   The only thing I can guess is 1) people were offended at George RR Martin whipping it out in front of Butters and Scott Malcinson, and constantly taking to two other boys about penises 2). George RR Martin hearten to sue, or 3) crazy government conspiracy and the Fedb didn't want people seeing the biggest shopping day of the year portrayed in such a horrible light   I get most of these, I see why.  But Casa Bonita, why the hell would they remove that one   The part where you say the man beating another human about the had with a Knight stick was unarmed   There is no Gemma, only Zuul   Best line in the whole damn show   Just not how to clean   Seen this on I think 4 sub's now, 2 days till it hits face book.  I think more people will see the one dude's ass more than the Kardashian.  Think these guys may have really broken the internet.  And possibly one of my ribs from laughing.   Would be an awesome repost in /r/unexpected   In a big fan of the basics.  18/10 stainless steel.  Get your pan hot (never rip on full high). Once your pan is hot, add a small amount of fat (clarified butter is best) wait it that to get hot, then sear   But can he make a decent cup of coffee?   Its time to stop.... Now...  Mike?   She is the former wife of 2 founding members, but at the end of the day she is just an old lady, a very scary, (shudders) scary old lady   But it would be pretty gratifying seeing her alone   Yes, yes you are   Zoom in, there's a pasty.  You know, not that I looked or anything....   That never occurred to me.  Good observation, fits in with a lot of the theme of this episode   First time I thought it was since he (Venus) wasn't in make up and hair his masculine features shows and it freaked Tig out.  Getting through the episode and seeing their interaction changed that for me.  I think it was dealing with the guilt of Bobby and nerves over the show down at the AB compound.  Venus asks Tig if (s)he'll see him later and he replies, "yeah, maybe"  I think he was nervous about heading to a shoot out ambush where he knew he could have been killed.  Tig knows first hand (pardon the Bobby pun) Mark's guys aren't scrubs.   In which case Jax goes to the Mayans club House and Alvarez is in a paper box fort, "You know ese, your authority is not recognized in Fort Kick Ass"   I've been thinking the same thing.  Juice wants back in, sons need an insider.  This is Juicey Boy's home now.   It was such a bad ass shot   It's pretty sad that you're being downvoted for being clever and using real quotes.  Someone quotes "Shenanigans" for the thousandth time in Reddit, and everyone loves it, but apparently there are dumbasses here who don't grasp the concept of repeater.   4 peaks brewery for a pretty bad ass brunch on the weekends   It had plugins, toolbars and what not, but also a ton of viruses and malware   Probably the only intense scene in the film   I was going to say the Oakland Raider's fans buuuuuuut.....   Yeah, but, the only reason he helps Gemma out and isn't involved with her on any deeper level is because it's unrequited on Gemma's end.   It would be 5 years since the show started given Abel's age   The more in certain Ratboy is a fed plant.  Maybe not the rat, but FBI.   I can't upvote this enough   They were able to tell right away he was lying about the cutting.  The delivery at the end of the episode was very innocent. Jax knows Abel wants grandma to get in trouble, he'll put 2 and 2 together      Same issue, right there with you   I was with you until "or there will ever be one" tonight was a good example of why not to expect anything or assume what will happen   Yeah but the mirrored response was still pretty damn gratifying   Fuck yeah it was   Would be a good submission for /r/woahdude   If they are operating under a brewpub license they can sell, if not, if they are licensed as a self distributed or have a distributer such as favorite brands, BEK, or Andrews they are not allowed to sell for off premise consumption   Brewery or brewpub?   Was it purchased or free?    YES^   But for it comes with the refrigerator ?   Also, if the are opening a straight production brewery, it is illegal to sell for off premise consumption.  Breweries cannot sell six packs or growler fills in the state of TX.  I just doesn't two years working at one.  And day they only let those who "donated" get growler fills, it'll be s customer service nightmare explaining to their regulars who didn't pitch in that they can't have growlers.  This just had bad idea written all over it.   Any increase in your visibility?   I recommended this to another redditors a few days ago and they like the idea.  Look up ChopperSwapper on Instagram,  give that a try.   I know, as an  amateur with access to a cable television show, I'm certain I could do better in writing a 7 season series with developed characters and deep plots  EDIT: Wow either a lot of redditors didn't get the sarcasm or got it and didn't appreciate it   Yeah I'm trying to save up for a build project, its given me a lot of ideas   Also a non reddit area: check out chopperswapper on Instagram.   The jizz of their enemies   I'm not putting too much stock into this, and when I initially had the idea it was to just troll and insight a you in this sub.  Then I started thinking, and my idea became plausible.  What if Jax is the rat.  He's deep in hated for day the club has become and what is cost him.   No one had more knowledge of what goes on in the club and what will happen other than Jax.  Jax is so buried in the guilt of Tara's death, the death of members of his club, and the legacy of Clay's gun running he wants out.  He decides it'd be best for charming and his family to dissolve the club.  He goes out in a blaze of glory, stemming to kill the man who he think murdered his wife.  Mark's bring an Overijssel is just a convenient way to pay the club down so far it falls apart.  After the murder of Jury, no other charters will support SAMCRO.  Then once everything falls apart under Mark's wrath, the club dies forcing members into nomad or other charters.  We all know after season 3 Jax can play the long con.  Dissolving SAMCRO from the inside gives Jax a way to protect his family, his town, and keep other club members from violence or prison.  EDIT: Plus this would be one of the most unexpected things Kurt Sutter could do.  I don't think any one is expecting Jax to be an intentional down fall of the club.  Pulling this out of left field would take everyone for a ride.   Jax was the one who offered the patch over though.  The orient of the Grim Bastards was the one who was reluctant.   I still am holding out that it's with Borosky or Ratboy though.  I do have a very unpopular third theory that I may or may not post on here   Crazy   If Tig actually is the rat (I've both stores guessing AND caring) this is actually the only sound argument over heard on this sub in regards to the theory.   You know... Most of the time people post pics of their family, and I support it cuz is family even though it might really not be, "old school cool". But that is actually a very cool photo   Rat or not (it very well could be) I hope they're is a plant.  That's the one adversary SAMCRO have been up against yet.  Fed plants are something true MC's have dealt with.   There's been instances IRL of feds going under cover though and don't things far beyond wrong to keep their cover.  Donnie Brasco is probably one of the more known cases, but also Victoria Steele, is plausible  	113
 Junior year because that's when I really got the hang of how things worked in life.  So, I made the best of it and by Senior year I was exactly where I wanted to be.   Work hard and you'll do well.

There's nothing I want to watch now, let alone in in 30 years.   The Last Resort - an American military drama television series, that aired on ABC from September 27, 2012 to January 24, 2013.  This series had great potential and I was really looking forward to it.  It started out great but quickly devolved into something I wouldn't change the channel for.  They had the chance to take it into modern, relevant territory but took it in an inane direction.  They blew it.   I came from the Earth and I'll return to the Earth.

Al Sharpton is a racist and an opportunist, we agree about that.  But it isn't his fault there aren't people standing up for the crimes committed against whites, or any other group.  This is a big money issue and there's money in it for those that exploit it.  But the fact remains, there exists racists of every color.

God has already told us how things are and I can pray anywhere, not just in a church.  I think people from every kind of church I've ever been to gave me some kind of insight, but so do relatives and coworkers and some posters on reddit.  We can gain knowledge or wisdom from anywhere if we're open to it.   Sure I can be a Christian, there were Christians while Jesus walked the Earth before the religion existed.  A Christian should be follower of Jesus.  I do not follow any of those specific requirements, beliefs or approaches because God didn't design them or say He condoned them.  He told us what to do and how to handle things in the Bible and that's all we need.  Not specific messages or anything that come from men.   God said all, I think He means all.  I don't think God hates anyone.  Jesus said He came for all men, that includes those who cursed Him.  While He was being sacrificed on the cross He even said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do".  Can't be much clearer than that.   I don't think so because a Christian is simply a follower of Jesus.  They were called Christians while Jesus was still alive, before the actual religion began to take shape.   Religion, with it's attached requirements, celebrations, rituals, rules, certain attitudes or beliefs are all specific to the men who founded that particular religious interpretation.  They want to stand out in same way, usually as being the one true religion that has the truth and understanding of God's holy words on their side. .  That isn't what the Bible says, it says it's written for all men, not just the ones who believe like this religion or that one.  God says pray earnestly for understanding and you'll get it.  That book was written for everyone to understand, not just the "special" ones.   They all corrupt, in some way, what it clearly says.   Religions exist, all with their own specific requirements, beliefs. approaches and messages.  I don't support them.   I think mean things about people.   I am a Christian, I read the Bible and I believe in God, but I do not believe in religion.

Most just want to escape very poor economic situations or some type of discrimination and just want to raise their families and live peacefully.   Swan, Drake, Crowe, Finch, Wrenn, Ferrett, Lyon, Fox and Byrd.   Apparently, they believe the poor or stupid cannot always afford an I.D.  I take issue with this because they need an I.D. to purchase, alcohol,  cigarettes, rent or buy a home, receive welfare, food stamps, social security, unemployment and medicaid, get a driver's license, go to school, buy a gun, get a job, get married, have a bank account, buy a car or a plane ticket.  They need an I.D. to rent a hotel room, get a hunting or fishing license, give blood or to even buy certain cough medicines.  Clearly the poor make good use of these programs and purchases.  No one ever raises the income or race issue on these things, but when it comes to voting they're all over it shouting discrimination.  This makes me think that that maybe the reason these liberals don't want to require an I.D. to vote could be because they could either be bringing in illegal voters, underage people and even the names of dead people.  Poor or not, they can and do get I.D.s for all these other needs and an I.D. for voting and proving legal citizenship is not an undue burden and should be required.

It was disappointing, but the benefits of the move far outweighed the bad.   A year after Amanda Berry disappeared in Cleveland, her mother appeared on "The Montel Williams Show" to speak to a psychic about what happened to her daughter.   Psychic Sylvia Browne, who has made a career of televised psychic readings, told Louwanna Miller on a 2004 episode of the show that her daughter was dead, causing Miller to break down in tears on the show's set.  "She's not alive, honey," Browne told Miller on the show.  Miller said that she believed "98 percent" in what Browne told her. Miller died a year later from heart failure.   Amanda Berry is the women who escaped as a hostage from the home of  Ariel Castro and is very much alive.   Amanda Berry.  That psychic helped cause her mother's death and should be prevented legally from ever giving out this kind of bogus information.  That said, people are stupid for putting any stock in these people to begin with.   People who believe horoscopes are some kind of special, hidden knowledge and schedule their lives around them.  People who believe psychics are telling them the truth, especially when they conjure up dead loved ones.   It's my right as a human being.  There is no one who can bestow it on me and  no one has authority to remove it unless I'm in a prison of some kind.   And there are those who do not.  If I'm not mistaken, it refers back to when they used red-colored clay to paint themselves because it kept away the insects and was a sunscreen.  We use stereotypical names for all races.   I don't consider it a racial slur.  "Redskin" is a racial descriptor for Native Americans, not a slur.   Why not?  We have the Yankees, Cowboys, Chiefs, Angels, Vikings, Saints, Giants, Raiders, Pirates, Steelers, Padres and the Indians.  Some people look for issues when none exist.   Judge Lind ruled that the 3 and 1/2 effective "years" Mr. Manning has already served since his 2010 arrest (a total inflated by time in solitary confinement) would count towards the 35-year sentence.  That leaves Mr. Manning with only 31 and 1/2 years left in the sentence.  If he does not win an appeal or get parole, he would be 56 years old when he gets out of federal prison.  However, in all likelihood he will get out long before then.  One possibility, albeit unlikely, is an appeal or a pardon.  Much more likely is the possibility of parole.  Mr. Manning's lawyer said that with military court parole rules, if Mr. Manning continues his good behavior as a prisoner, he could be eligible for parole in 6 and 1/2 years.  In that circumstance he could see freedom by the age of 32.  Being granted parole is by no means guaranteed, particularly in controversial high profile cases, but there's always hope and possibility.  He did expose war crimes to the public, along with leaking 300,000 classified documents.  He's a convicted felon, whether we agree with it or not.  All news stations are shitty news stations.  My news comes from the same places as yours.  They're all corrupt and all have a financial agenda, as well as corrupt intentions.    That depends on who you ask.  I'm not for or against the man, but I believe he's reneged on many promises and expectations he cultivated for himself to get support.  He seems to be more pro-govt. and corporations than he is pro-Americans.  He promised an open presidency and whistleblower protections, among other things, only to have gone back on these promises.  Here's a 6 page list of the broken promises he's made:  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/   That's your problem now for listening to anonymous people on the internet when it comes to your personal affairs.  That said, I guess now you "do porn".   That Pfc. Bradley Manning, who has been convicted of espionage and other charges in connection with a massive leak of classified material, sentenced to 35 years in military prison has stated he wants to be a woman now and wants the US govt., whom he betrayed, to pay for his female hormone treatments.   There aren't a lot of good posts or quality content on reddit.  I let reddit do the searching for me.   Because that's what the news programs said. We can all see now since they posted his picture that he is not black.   Iron clothes.  I had to do it as a kid as my chore.

"You think that I am impoverishing myself withdrawing from men, but in my solitude I have woven for myself a silken web or chrysalis, and, nymph-like, shall ere long burst forth a more perfect creature, fitted for a higher society."

They'll equate "separate but equal" as the stance to take to push a particular point of view. But, it isn't the same.  Anyone who lived through those times knows it isn't the same because in this instance, they'll have what they wanted legally, whereas during the civil rights movement and segregation they did not.  They do not equate since this regards nothing more than a label placed upon it.   Exaggeration isn't a fine point.  Didn't anyone teach you not to lie?  I'll blame Obama.

This is a prime example of what's wrong in the world.     The nature of man is not good.  We have to be taught to be good as children.  Without temperance and love taught by certain religions there would be far more hate and corruption than there is now.     Lets see, we're pro-abortion, pro-gay rights, took God and morals out of schools, left drug addicted parents to raise future generations, use pedobear as a joke, legitimized unhealthy sexual practices, promote degraded sexual values (or not values at all) and consider them conquests, men leave their their babies to be raised by their mommas alone on govt. assistance because they don't want the burden, women mistreat or ignore their babies because they become nothing more than a paycheck, we've forced families to send both parents to work leaving the raising of the kids to strangers, determined the belief in God is now a mental illness and should be quashed at every opportunity, treat our parents and kids with strong depressive drugs, create unattainable personal images for young people so they grow up knowing they aren't good enough, passed all the money to corrupt people running all governments and many businesses, burdened all our people (and especially students) with taxes and fees leaving them near poverty levels, promoted the hive mind of get-in-line-and-don't-think-differently paradigm, spread our unique brand of evilness around the world and we wonder what happened while we weren't looking.

    Going on the down escalator...  and spiders. and bugs that fly.   First thing I noticed were your nails. They look so perfect and perfect.    During my Freshmen year in dorms, I thought it'd be cool to request roommates with this one girl I barely knew but we had a lot in common right? Worst mistake of my life.   She always had her boyfriend over, but they never had sex together, only slept together in bed. Since she was over religious, they never cuddled. It was always awkward when he was in there. You could cut the awkward tension with a knife...  She also liked to have the door open as I slept, bring people over as I slept, and play the guitar as I slept.   She brought friends over at 3 AM and they stayed til 7 AM when I had class at 9 AM.   I was sick my first semester and she got me sick the second semester, and it made me snore, but only rarely. She would constantly complain about it to other hall mates making it seem like I did it all night.   I admit to being a messy person, but I always contained my mess to being a small amount of mess, but she was self-diagnosed with OCD and could not handle it, thus she continued to talk about me behind my back.   I was too nice to say "Please stop, you're being a b-".    I'm so jealous that I think I hate you. :( I've been trying to get my Filly to S Rank for so long....   It was Berkeley. [it all makes sense now!!!] -Someone from Oakland.    I got Chosen Master Yi after the Pulsefire Ez, so I kinda just rage quit. I promised myself to never have a single Yi skin. D: I miss AP Yi...

My wallet is empty because mystery giftssssss so purdyyyy. Like, what if I gift someone SGU!? I know I got myself Pulsefire when I gifted myself.    He doesn't even like me giving him mystery gifts unless he can give me one too :(   Mystery gifting is too addicting... I have books I should buy, or skins I can get people...  	9
 Well i didn't know it was about money they should be paid equally. But  is everything weighted in like popularity, age, good or bad agency, what actor the director prefers and stuff like that? I do have to say Bradley cooper is one of the most wanted actors right now but Jennifer Lawrence also so it is a legit point you are making here.   About the dresses i'm not on the same level. That's just less then 50% of the people who are interested in that maybe even less. If you are not a fashion reporter I can accept it that you won't ask about it.  In general there were really allot of political statements at the Oscars what seemed to me just like getting up-votes.     (Don't know what sub to post it in) Not a native english, so if there are grammar or spelling mistakes let me know!  First off John Legend is comparing the amount of black people that are in correctional control to the amount of black people that where in correctional control/prison during the slavery. What is the point he is trying to make here? Racism?  By all means i'm against racism!  But comparing slavery to prison is absolutely disgusting, prison is a result because you committed a CRIME, slavery however is terrible because you had no choice, just because you where black you where a slave. In general i'm so sick off the whole racism thing it's just a word what is used way to easy and way to often. This is in my words is racism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBeeZVd6urI But not getting a job based on your RESUME or WORK EXPERIENCE is just the way this world works. Don't scream off the roof it's racism when you don't get the job based on facts.   It's hard for everybody to find a new job in this economy.  Another example: a black men is waiting for the bus and the bus driver is white and doesn't stop at the busstop conclusion: racism. A black men is waiting for the bus and the bus driver is black and doesn't stop: bad luck. A white men waiting for the bus and the bus drive is white and doesn't stop: bad luck. A white men waiting for the bus and the bus driver is black and doesn't stop: Bad luck Just start to except it has nothing to do with your skin color.  Personally I think the word gets misused so much that people eventually will get angry because it's not fair to call somebody a racist when he/she isn't and it's quiet a statement you are making then.  So why do I disgust the Patricia Arquette speech also? It's a bit the same as the racist story it is used WAY to easy.  So some people said she did this because of journalist where sexist at the red carpet? And men are sexist when girls/woman dress up really nice? Well what kind of reaction are you thinking you will get when you wear something like [this](https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/462219980.jpg?w=635) or  [this](http://uk.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2015122/rs_634x1024-150222165857-634-jennifer-lopez-oscars.jpg)? It's nature that a men gets turned on by the curves of a woman. It's also the same the other way around.  Don't you believe Brad Pitt(in his good days) or the One Direction boys gets sexist woman all over them?  Believe it or not my mother is a woman also! She has a really good job and she never has being mistreated.   This whole racism/feminism thing is so getting misused at so many levels that is has to stop because this is damaging the people who are really being treated unequally.   TL;DR Racism and feminism get misused way to much.  **EDIT**: I see that people are down voting everything that I post and maybe it has something to do with this post. Let me clarify (not that I want allot of upvotes but i get the idea some people see me as a racist or a bad person.) So like to clarify a bit:  First of all true racism is something i'm really disgusted by. Maybe i'm pointing out the wrong examples but I still find that what some actors did at the Grammys wrong. If you truly want to do something about the problem you need to do something structurally over a long term. Let's take Emma Watson she fights the whole year for equal rights for woman this is something to admire and be respectful about. Screaming one time at a grammy that women need equal pay is something to score points with and contributes nothing to the whole problem. And that problem is based on Jennifer Lawrence getting paid 7% where Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale got 9%. This are some differences that I would think have something to do with amount of time on set, time on screen and popularity of the actor.  The whole thing just looks really shady, first they walk in there $1000+ suits for men and $1000+ dresses or suits for women on the red carpet and brag about all there expensive houses/yachts/jets/Salary/Jewelry and an hour later they are screaming we need equal pay, thats insane.  I do admit that there is a problem in the amount of woman in the management functions and also Board of directors and the higher paid functions. Should it be 50%? No it fully depends if somebody suits the position. This also comes from the fact that women didn't go to school back in the days and where the "house woman" and didn't go to school but luckily that has changed now and women are accepted to all schools and there are allot of alternatives to take care of kids instead of the always a parent at home way(think about daycare) What by the way isn't a hell for children i have been to daycare allot and i made allot of friends there in fact, even more and better friends then on my regular school where i got bullied allot. Maybe it has also something to do with the amount of hours people are working in the USA. Here it's normal to work 40 hours a week but in the US its easy 60 hours a week and a very few vacation days.   About the racism IF that theory is true about only black people getting jailed for no reason that is terrible and should be investigated straight away and in general innocent people shouldn't be in a jail. One reaction of a fellow redditor included a link to an article what I have read a couple of times.  This is the peace of text where they are aiming at black people:  "Jeffery Schultz: You mentioned specifically implicating a black person. Does your agency target based on race?  Deputy Sheriff: I wouldnt say target based on race but is is, you know, um, it is much easier to do this on a black person because they have no credibility anyways. The charges stick better to blacks than to a rich white guy that can afford a lawyer. That is one school of thought. Then you still have the deputies who like doing it to the rich white guys because they say it removes the smug look from their faces. They get their kicks from the power like its a game. Most cops though, they, um do it to get bad guys off the streets. The last group of deputies do it for personal gain."  What he says about credibility I think we all find disgusting but the sentence later he says its all a money thing because if you can afford a lawyer they won't try it? And yet another sentence later they also get rich white guys. So my conclusion is that there whole system is corrupt instead of a racism thing.   The thing that I found racism in this text is that they call something a black neighborhood that makes no sense.  I'm just sick of referring all the bad things to race, gender or religion where in fact people are just to lazy to work for it or searching for an excuse.   You could try to contact there Twitter/facebook they are quiet active on social media they would be able to give you the correct information. There twitter is @AFCAjax.   Personally would accept a price range from 1 to 2 euros.    I got 19,99 euros a month. No way on earth i'm gonna pay that much.   A friends mom naked, milf lover ever since.

My standards are already pretty low. But I did noticed that you sometimes suddenly you have a winning streak like 10 matches and done couple of weeks nothing and then suddenly again 10 matches in one day. I don't know if I am the only one who has this.   Figured that out that it was on Tinder, but finding someone on that is impossible.   Good enough for me, where can I sign up?   Lol well it's pretty hard to diagnose thru a website because they almost always need a physical exam.    Do you have a GP? They can do some simple test to see where it comes from. Get well soon!   Not a doctor here but is the dizziness position related? Like while lying down no problem but standing up you get dizzy?   You shouldn't feel guilty, if it was your wife who was sick, would you care about half a million dollars or would you spent every single penny of it on maybe becoming better or for just being with her a day longer?  Are you married? Don't you say for better or worse? It's your problem but that doesn't mean you can't ask your wife for support you are sharing a life together!  Also ask some advice in /r/medical or /r/askdocs there are some fantastic and smart doctors there who can give you a bit of advice!  My advice is to seek an outstanding hospital something like Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, John Hopkins or some Academic/University Hospitals or a Specialized hospital in your type of disease. Also it would maybe be smart to ask Lymphoma foundations for advice they are most of the time really up to date and give you an honest opinion.   For now, keep your chin up and start fighting and don't give up!    If there is only a very slightly chance to get better I would go all in with the money even if the chance is 10%. Your wife will find out how to make money. But living without you is the biggest dept she could ever have and wouldn't never be able to pay off. Choose for you health.    john hiatt - have a little faith in me had a really hard time with my health and psychological and lost all trust in the doctors and myself I couldn't get in to tears to get everything out. But then my father played me this song and I totally snapped. The trust came back and I scrambled myself together and got things figured out and i'm doing much better now! Now every time I hear the song it touches me. Beautiful!  Edit: the grammar was all off.      Wow working with him would be nuts, he will LEND the domain name in exchange for a piece of your company. Is he f*cking nuts? who ever does that is insane. For the rest about the domainname business is that I on the one side think he was smart back then but on the other side he is giving people a really hard time getting there business going and that isn't a thing we like to see!    Got extremely hungry after this movie! So much tasty food! And those Cubano's in real life are delicious!   Dit heb ik echt nooit geweten! Bedankt voor het delen!   I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't trolling.    Seriously why is she on Tinder? If she absolutely hates everything and her intentions aren't dating?     This serie is now on Netflix [US] I have seen it before and I highly recommend it! Very interesting serie.      Thanks for responding! Back then the cardiologist told it was an artifact. When I get out of breath more I will definitely call the hospital to ask what is best to do. Thanks!   Thanks for the advice! I will contact them if I get worse thanks for your detailed explanation!   Thanks for such friendly input! Appreciate it!   Being polite and not speaking with some weird ghetto slang.  	33

 I guess it was an unintentional pun ;-)   * Paring knife should def be on the essential list.  * You don't need a million pans. I'd say one large frying pan, a smaller cast iron skillet, stock pot, medium sauce pan, and an enameled dutch oven will get you VERY FAR.  * The one thing you're missing is a lot of small assorted containers\bowls\dishes for  mise en place  * i'd also add a palate knife (like what painters use for spackle) for scraping things around   First by watching mom. Then in college I got to practice when the meal plan sucked and I just craved Turkish food! I made friends with the cafeteria workers and they would give me ingredients from the store room :-) I learned to cook non-Turkish food when I then lived in Turkey and craved thai food and more :-p   I agree with ostones and would add to always focus on making your left hand more stacatto for clarity. Also try playing repeated notes in the melody with different fingers on each one. It's a good habit to get into now for when you start playing super fast later. A great exercise is playing triplets on one note 321 321 321 321 or 123 451 234 512 345   Logic, but i've heard good things about reaper. Maybe it has the best bang for its buck?   sorta reminds me of a CZ1000   I had a friend when I was living abroad who was female and stood out (she was blond). Whenever guys would stare and drool at her on the bus she'd start picking her nose... and then slowly eat it.    Find a place that sells "Hot Bread Kitchen" like RUSS   DAUGHTERS  179 E. Houston Street, DAG HAMMARSKJOLD PLAZA. It's worth it!    In bacon grease!    Can I make bon bons without molds by dipping the ganache in chocolate or dripping the chocolate over it? Can someone walk me through any  common mistakes?    The Smoke Joint in Ft.

 This was all pre-rent control. Remember Murray Rothbard talking about growing up in New York City and everyone was moving on 1 March because it was easy to find an apartment.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A great discussion, not only of the re-unionisation issue but of how the Democratic party had to be socially Conservative until the civil rights era.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice roundup of the arguments that ISIS is filled with opportunists from a long way back and much of its rise is to do with the murkiness of Iraqi politics   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice roundup of the arguments as to why marriage is not the solution to child poverty.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice little essay reminding that there is been in a supply of seemingly mad people in charge of nuclear weapons who were nonetheless deterred by the possibility of a second strike.   This is to review of the first volume of the three volume biography of Stalin. The first volume is 1000 pages long.   Clearly, this guy is trying to give Robert Caro and his biography of LBJ a run for his money in terms of comprehensiveness and quality.   I like his analogy of involuntary employment means the same thing as being involuntarily married. Both are matching problems. Adding the word involuntary is just confused to the search and matching problem at hand.     There was a massive trial with the polio vaccine before it was introduced in the whole community. The trial involved hundreds of thousands of children.   Measles is the most contagious disease that is known. It is therefore not possible to use tort liability to sue the specific person who infected you because it is not possible to trace the infection to a specific child.  The classic example was polio. 90 to 95% of people infected with polio were asymptomatic but infectious to others. It was spread by failing to wash your hands properly after going to the toilet. Small children tend to do that.   1. Babies are too young to vaccinate. 2. The vaccine is only 95% effective. 3. People with compromised immunity system such undergoing chemotherapy are also vulnerable and of a high risk of dying. 4. Community of about 92% of the community creates herd immunity    1. Babies are too young to vaccinate. 2. The vaccine is only 95% effective. 3. People with compromised immunity system such undergoing chemotherapy are also vulnerable and of a high risk of dying. 4. Community of about 92% of the community creates herd immunity   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A thorough round up of both the causes and solutions to issues regarding women's economic opportunities with the solutions addressing well proven causes.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  An excellent roundup of how the religious exemptions constitutional jurisprudence moved from the courts from making balancing decisions on a case-by-case basis to the Scalia majority opinion of 1990 that the Constitution only outlaws intentional religious discrimination.   After that, under the 1990 Scalia majority opinion, religions have to take their chances in democratic politics like the rest of us if they want special exemptions from laws.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  An excellent interview with a brave woman who has bodyguards 24/7 because of what she says   I would like to add that I do not agree with this particular article, but it is an excellent statement of the case for rent control which others can then pick holes in   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  This article is probably one of the best summaries of the Piketty debate I have seen.   I didn't post directly to the PDF. I couldn't work out how to do that on my browser, but the PDF if you click on it is a wealth of information, I've never seen anywhere else   Unmarried women haved out earned Unmarried men for some time according to Tom Sowell   The paper is silly, but represents a large number of people   I did notice anywhere in the article them pointing to a country that managed to get out of the extreme poverty by increasing the minimum wage. The only evidence the author of the article pointed to was from the United States on the effects of the minimum wage.   Good place to take assignment problems for economics 101   No justice, you get 6 Karma and I get none. Point of link was to show type of thinking out there and for others, a chance to rebut it.   The alcohol consumption figures are interesting, given all the stories you see about teenagers drinking themselves stupid and sometimes to the point of alcohol poisoning   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice discussion of why marriage is not a solution to poverty and the teen pregnancy problem   yes, some has to be trusted somewhere along the line.   I think that pretty much happened in that Egyptian plane, but I think the captain got back into the cabin towards the end, but couldn't pull the plane up because the suicidal pilot is pushing down   The vaccine and drugs market in general really run as prizes markets because all the prizes are handed out by government if and when they buy your new drug    they do for cabin crew to go in in case of crew incapacitation, but there is another lock inside to prevent terrorist takeovers.   SUBMISSION STATE.  Nice roundup of the politics and economics of federalism on the extent to which there should be free trade between the states and whether one state can regulate how another state produces its exports to that state.   ADMISSION STATEMENT.  Another nice little roundup showing that the number of false positives in research is disturbingly large. The incentive to uncover these are small because the rewards of reinvestigating other people's data is generally small in a world of publishing or perish   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  This book is a defence of attack ads and negativity in politics. It includes the best, worst, and most counter-productive attack ads broadcast all time to illustrate its points brilliantly.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice little roundup from the Guardian on scientific fraud, which is far wider than previously thought. The key driver of this fraud is the publish or perish motivations of academics before and after they get tenure.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice little summary of the history of diplomatic spying, much of it which is for economic advantage.    At the 2009 G20 meetings in London, the British intelligence agency GCHQ set up fake internet cafes for delegates to use in order to log their keystrokes. If you are dumb enough to use an Internet cafe for official business, you deserve to be spied on.   There is a massive difference between rowdy protest at a public meeting, and ambushing a politician while dining with his family.   Then why does Pres Obama supports charter schools?   yes both Being found guilty on appeal against the not guilty verdict as well as being found not guilty appeal against a guilty verdict can happen in the civil law systems   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  The discussion of the complex way in which personality traits interact with political dispositions. Questions not asked include:  1. People become more conservative in their voting as they get older that their personalities stabilise at 30;  2. Women change their vote more often than men, depending on whether their married divorce, single parents or have children because of the demand for social insurance. How was this connected to personality traits?   Guilty at trial,  won 1st appeal,  lost final appeal   Who said that   SUBMISSION STATEMENT   a nice little article pointing out how ignorant the media are of the law.   Our intrepid reporters do not understand the concept of on bail pending further appeal.   she is on bail pending appeal   she is on bail pending appeal   The flaw in the reasoning about administrative costs been at driver of higher costs in America is competition.  Leaving to one side the Federal prohibition against interstate competition in health care plans, and any state mandates as to what must be in ill health care plan, two considerable asides, all the is saying is there is an entrepreneurial opportunity to win business in health insurance by offering simple plans that are cheap to administer.  The extent that administratively complex plan survive in competition rather than because of mandates, suggest that consumers are willing to pay for whatever they buy.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice summary of the reasons for higher health costs in the USA by the most experienced health economist around.   Very true. It still has a craps website. Few know of it.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice op-ed by Robert Aumann explaining how the blackmailers paradox bedevils Middle East peace negotiations as well as a path to get out of it.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice interview with Robert Aumann about his views on how those who want peace must prepare for war and be patient and willing to walk away from the negotiating table.   The conman had access to the official plates   Mine was a New Zealand mobile   When was that?   I did not face a paywall   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Nice summary by Bryan Caplan of his writings on his theory of voting as rational irrationality   Are you aware of the far more extreme views of some of his coalition partners such as the those made up of emigres from Russia   Read somewhere that 74% of government employees in Canada are unionised as compared to about 15% of private employees. That makes a big difference to headline comparisons that do not make this distinction   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Part of a series in the Guardian on science and the green moment.  This entry makes it a good case in my mind that the green movement is somewhat selective in its use of science   Isn't that the point. a national single-payer system still involves denial of service and people dying in the queue.   I read somewhere that the 8% success rate is similar to sitting down with a good friend and having a discussion over the fact that you drink a bit too much and that is really harming your friends and family   Interesting, I didn't know that the public sector was so unionised in Canada. That is ignored in the international comparison.  Indeed any international comparison of unionisation should always split out the public sector in the private sector to have any use whatsoever   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A new study looks at the peaks of different types of cognitive abilities over a lifespan.  Apparently, them young whippersnappers got a good memory for information, but we oldies have a better vocabulary, and superior judgement   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice article about the extent to which lazy statistics intrude into public policy.   More than a few statistics published by breathless journalists run into the problem that more people in the community have been a victim of a crime or some other more misfortune than there are actual people in that community with the relevant demographic characteristics be it by age or whatever.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  No one doubts the sincerity of Alcoholics Anonymous and those who participate and organise that movement. This article argues that its treatment programme has simply been overtaken by events and more effective options are available.  This is important both in terms of coping with alcoholism and the fact that some people are required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous as part of sentences imposed by courts.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Nice little myth buster explaining that although gerrymanders has a bit of a role, there are many other reasons why the American electorate is so polarised.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  This is a nice roundup of the law and economics as well is the politics of financial market regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis   The peltzman effect is well established. Originally,  safety equipment allow you to do what otherwise would not be attemped at all rather than marginal increase in risk taking.    Eurozone countries spend more on food too than USA   yes, can't compete on costs   The test was administered to a range of Harvard students. None of them completed it in 10 minutes see http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2831095/Harvard-students-sit-1964-Louisiana-Literacy-Test-black-voters-pass-allowed-polls-single-person-FAILED.html   I thought state by state popular referendums had a lot to do with the decriminalisation of marijuana medical and other purposes   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Great roundup by great sociologists of the current position of the inner city black men   hard enough to even understand all the questions, much less answer them   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  An instructive wargame played at the Pentagon in 2004 rather ably demonstrated the folly of war with Iran.   They have no trouble finding volunteers from firing squads   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice essay by Matthew Ridley on the case for fossil fuels and how is not going anywhere any time soon   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice reminder of about how D-Day was a rather close run thing   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  An excellent case for the transpacific partnership by fine labour economist, David Autor   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A marvellous roundup of trends in oil prices over the last hundred more years with great graphics and excellent analysis   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  This is a brilliant review by Brad Delong of a biography of Milton Friedman published some years ago   20% of population is undatable   Good point   True, but the essay itself was a good  summary of the case for disinvesting.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT   a nice little essay on the latest way in which small countries can trade on their sovereignty. Quite surprised that some of these passports for sale can get you visa-free access to 132 countries   Sounds like Seinfeld's law   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A good list of replies to criticisms of fossil fuel disinvestment. It can't seem to make up its mind that about what it's trying to do.  In the end, the purpose is to bring moral pressure against self-interest, which is a real stayer in human affairs. You can always rely upon self-interest to keep on trying right to the end of the race.   yes, In 2008, Clinton showed she was a bit of a battered old warhorse who had accumulated a lot of enemies, battle scars and was rather slippery with the truth and what she actually stood for.   Peace treaties usually bring an end to matters such as reparations and draw a line under all claims, be they public and private   Germany paid war reparations to Greece in about 1960. Naturally, Greek politicians stole it and hardly anything filtered down to ordinary people   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice discussion about how ISIS is more a rabble that happens to survive because of the lack of unity among its enemies which include the Iraqi government government and its army that runaway, but there has many other enemies as well.   A friend found that acupuncture help with his knee pain as well   The control group would be taking actual medicine   Marijuana has active ingredients in it.   Homoeopathic tablets etc have no active ingredients   Yes, there's only so much you can capture in a title   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  This is a fine summary of the work on the Dunning Kruger effect by Dunning himself explaining that people lack the ability to recognise their own limitations, principally through overconfidence.   To recognise you lack skills such as in the rules of grammar, you must have extensive knowledge of the rules of grammar to realise you don't know the rules of grammar.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Deirdre McCloskey, in this great book review, argues that Industrial Revolution just got along just fine, despite quite endemic government corruption. Something to ponder.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Fair Trade-certified coffee is growing in consumer familiarity and sales, but strict certification requirements are resulting in uneven economic advantages for coffee growers and lower quality coffee for consumers.   By failing to address these problems, industry confidence in Fair Trade coffee is slipping.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice summary of Robert Putman's latest thinking. I don't agree with him but have some great data and interesting arguments   Yes, the guy who wrote this diatribe forgot to check all the studies of the voting habits of economists   A long discussion of Irish politics during the Troubles.   Some of the tactics of the British intelligence were quite clever such as running a discount dry-cleaning service to detect bomb-making residue on clothes.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Another contribution to a complicated debate about sources of distrust of science across the political spectrum   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice Roundup of reviews on a hot button issue   Political management. Clinton is known for running a pretty chaotic show  what did she gained from setting herself up for criticism like this?  she has a habit of scoring too many own goals   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A delightful little essay for constitutional pedants, legal pedants and those who want to know what the Logan Act when it is mentioned, which is frequently. A law honoured in the breach   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice summary of the case against performance reviews, and in particular how they are often badly run by people who focus on the negative rather than act as cheerleaders.  Peter Drucker argued that the task of a manager is to make strengths productive. I find the performance reviews focuses are not what you're good at, but what your bad at.   Rupert Murdoch's shifts with the political winds and is always sure to be the new best friend of the next Prime Minister.   I agree. I'm not a morning person. Let the morning, people drive to work in the dark. Might put a damper on that horrible cheerfulness they have at the breakfast table   see https://acesflyinghigh.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/intercepting-the-bear/ for file you want   By the way, the author is a transsexual Libertarian   The demand for most cars above that of a small medium sedan could be explained by people wanting to drive and seen to be driving a big expensive car. They are status vehicles.  Male midlife crises would have no meaning if you couldn't buy an expensive sports car and drive it around   A hell of a lot of people of all ages like driving their cars. Also, driverless sports cars are a contradiction in terms.  For men, investing in a shiny red sports car or some other status display has advantages to them in the marriage and dating market   Explained about 30 years ago by Jacob mincer  the rate of depreciation on human capital during career interruptions is much higher in some careers rather than others.  For example, an IT scientist will be completely out of date, If they take four years off. If your specialty is history or literature, nothing much changes.    Do you mean to say that the insurance companies are not charging the profit maximising insurance price at the moment in these other lines of business?   Put bluntly, STEM is a poor occupational choice given the skill sets of men and women as they go to college   yes, they do seem to be flying target practice   What about metal fatigue after 90 years of flying   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice piece of myth busting about daylight saving, which happens to be very popular where I live.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice summary of the contemporary relevance of Machiavelli   know any unbiased sources?   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Another great essay by Christine Hohh Sommers on gender politics and child rearing   Karl Popper observed that the motives of researcher don't matter. What matters is the quality of the critical discussion of what they have said.  Knowledge grows through critical discussion, not studying the biographies of the speakers.    SUBMISSION STATEMENT  Nice essay about how Boys are now being left behind are becoming the second sex    no progress at all!!   very true, especially during elections   Very interesting essay on the rise of women to the top of the corporate ladder.  The underlying research quoted in the paper shows that if you control for background (i.e. skills and talent) and exit (i.e. women staying in the workforce) women earn more than men and get more aggressively promoted than men in corporate ladders.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Very interesting essay on the rise of women to the top of the corporate ladder.   The underlying research quoted in the paper shows that if you control for background (i.e. skills and talent) and exit (i.e. women staying in the workforce) women earn more than men and get more aggressively promoted than men in corporate ladders.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  Great essay discussing when colonisation was a private enterprise   Yes, food riots within a couple years was a rather demanding   My first job was working in a bank. Serving the public back when everyone came into the bank because it was before ATMs, was I was quite shocked by the lack of manners and morals of some people   There are a number of economic journal articles on acting white And on oppositional identities   Agreed   Fryer leads literature on economics of oppositional identities   I find these arguments about education in inequality rather puzzling considering I'm old enough to have gone to university with plenty of people who are the first member of their family to get passed high school   Compensating differentials lives!   Indian curries are now the most popular foods in Britain so that was a gap in the article that was not mentioned. Also, that undermines your point about vegetarianism a bit   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  The latest oppressed minority is coming forward. Apparently a wage premium of 5-10% for full beauty in the labour market is not enough compensation.   Quite correct. There are some fanatics in it but a considerable number of opportunists too, apparently the majority fall into this category.   Thanks, perhaps the biggest worry is the political parties seem to be outbidding themselves into how hire the contribution rate can go.  There is no recognition that the maximum contribution you could possibly need for your retirement may have already been reached.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  A nice reminder of the 1960s and that the Apollo program was incredibly expensive for its time. Something that is forgotten in retrospect, especially when it's put forward as a rationale for further public investment in incredibly expensive science projects.   I actually disagree with the Australian system which I used to be subject to.   First, people save far too much for their retirement. So much so, that they'll be wealthier in their retirement, if they make it that far, than they were during their working lives.  Secondly, there are required to save for their retirement before they have bought other basic things such as a car and a house deposit.  The practical upshot of the Australian system is that low paid workers save for their own retirement rather than rely on an means tested old age pension that would be funded by taxes on the middle-class. These low paid workers are in the peculiar position of having retirement savings but not enough savings to buy a house.   There is no pay wall when I read it   SUBMISSION STATEMENT  A nice discussion of recent issues of capital taxation, including that the optimal rate of taxation on income from capital is zero   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  This is a great roundup of the pros and cons of cities and states entering the global subsidy market and a race to the bottom   SUMMARY STATEMENT.  There is a plan behind this accumulation of enemies.   This is actually excellent news. People in developing countries are more likely to die diseases of developed countries rather than diseases that are unknown in developed countries.   I think wireless charging will just be a major boom for the market for tinfoil for the tinfoil hat brigade   Merv Hughes was one of the funniest cricketers of his time and that was back when cricketers had big personalities and weight problems too.   Pluto had so many supporters that a separate category was invented called planetoid as I recall when it was downgraded so that their opposition would be tempered.   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.  More science research grants for proving the bleeding obvious.   Anyone who has some capacity for emotional insight into family, friends and read the odd novel would have worked this out long long time ago   good one   Many libertarians support the death penalty   SUBMISSION STATEMENT.

 I doubt if the frontline doc included Thomas Drake's (et al.) letter--it was released January 2014 or so...  So, in addition to NSA Insiders' claiming the NSA obstructed the 9/11 Commission--we also have the Co-Chairs of the 9/11 Commision who claimed their investigation was obstructed by the White House and the CIA...Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in 2008: http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/  In fact, when former 9/11 Commission member Max Cleland was asked if there should be another 9/11 Commission, he said: "There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!"  http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html      there's nothing wrong with working at an apple store...but Thomas Drake was a legitimate whistleblower who was forced to incur huge legal bills while being stripped of his lifetime profession as an intelligence analyst...Thomas Drake is most likely making a fraction of the income/benefits that he was making inside the pentagon. In the end, if I remember correctly, Thomas Drake was forced to plead guilty to a lesser charge--just to make the case go away and take the stress and financial pressure of endless legal bills off....   Thomas Drake was still FUCKED by the system--he is now working at an apple store (after a lifetime in u.s. intelligence)...so don't sugarcoat that shit they threw at him...  -------  Full Letter: http://consortiumnews.com/2014/01/07/nsa-insiders-reveal-what-went-wrong/  ------------------  "The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...  ...My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....  ...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.  Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...  ...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.  When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."  -----  Also see...

It has shifted my thinking a bit towards Larry Silverstein being more of a victim than a planner. More importantly, by seeing the WTC as a CIA asset and creation--the questions about access to the WTC to pre-install explosives fades away. It inherently implies the WTC was a financial center for the CIA since the early 70's when the towers opened up, and that the destruction of the WTC complex may have been an intentional good-bye to financial records of the CIA from the 1970's on. We also know Enron had CIA connections and benefitted from the destruction of the WTC complex (which included the SEC office). Was Enron just the tip of the iceberg?

So it has to be a very, very precise application of firepower against an enemy that has no regard for the population and will indiscriminately use violence to hold on. Theres no way the Iraqi Security Forces will be ready for this kind of fighting.      I used to buy the NYT--but now I realize how often they OMIT stories and how many NYT writers have moved on...Chris Hedges, Tim Weiner, Stephen Kinzer...the NYT held up James Risen's big scoop on the wrireless overreaches of the Bush administration for over a year before Risen went out and got a book contract--then the NYT finally published his story (which won a Pulitzer...finally)...now I see the NYT as a dolled up disinformation campaign with nice fashion, antiques, and auction updates...   guardian article:  http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/25/chicago-homan-square-former-justice-officials-call-for-investigation      "It is every citizen's first responsibility to question the government."  --Ben Franklin, *Conspiracist*   good...after years of not having cable tv--my mind has finally erased those evil fucking bastards!!!   of course I wasn't implying the mayoral election isn't news--but I could literally scream from the number of times the front page has been infiltrated with Wrigley Field rehab updates instead of, say, how the Pentagon has Never submitted to an AUDIT...the Trib, the NYT, cnn, cbs, abc, nbc--they have all FAiLED to investigate and question--and given a Free Pass all too often...the "news" papers/media now resort to asking the DOJ before printing an article on Edward Snowden or the Patriot Act...the scariest thing is that Americans believe this vacuous reporting--at least in Russia the citizens know they are being lied to  and, YES, I would be happy to see the Chicago Tribune go OUT OF BUSINESS--the editors and publishers FAILED to protect the public interest long ago...   I grew up reading the Chicago Tribune...in 2nd or 3rd grade my school began a reading program where we read the paper twice a week...I have studied the de-evolution of the Tribune, how it has become a vacuous chatterbox for corporate interests and become nothing but an unofficial Propaganda Wurlitzer for the Pentagon.   Sports is an entertainment that has become elevated to distract citizens from what is really important--the Tribune has regularly taken the top portion of their front page (which used to be devoted to "hard news") and used it to promote these vacuous "news" stories (mostly sports, sports, tv, movies and...sports)....  i would challenge you to take a sheet of paper and write down every Chicago athlete you know--MLB, NFL, NBA, etc...now write down every Chicago local, state or federal politician you know...which list is much, much longer?   i would urge you to quit giving the msm your business--even watching, viewing or reading them continues the cycle of disinformation which the msm has become accustomed to feeding its readers...even by watching cnn, msnbc, abc, cbs (etc.) you are paying them to misinform you (the cable companies pay every channel a portion of your bill, the companies also gain ad revenue offf of their number of viewers)...the corporate msm has failed to be the 4th estate, they have failed to seek the truth and bowed to their corporate masters...the Trillions of dollars of the Iraq-Afghanistan Wars have become more important than reporting actual facts...     the guardian--all the way from England...(they have NYC office, too)  someone kindly posted a link below...   First of all, the "news" has become limited to issues which do not question the government. Take for example, the Iraq War and the "Free Pass" the u.s. press gave Bush-Cheney. The publishers and editors have decided they will not upset the readers with stories which make the readers Think...the Chicago Tribune, on a daily basis, updates its readers with sports, tv, movies ON THE FRONT PAGE...I would bet the Tribune has more sports writers than it has writers covering national security...what is REALLY news?  The Tribune has become just an unofficial u.s. state department-pentagon Chatterbox which simply regurgitates the latest press release and fails to investigate to uncover Real facts...  link to today's front page of the Chicago Tribune:   http://www1.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=IL_CT ref_pge=gal b_pge=5   news is comprised of articles which affect the lives of the readers--political, economic, legal issues...  the Chicago Tribune, for the last decade, has devoted part of its front page to sports, movies, food, tv...its no wonder they didn't break this important story--the Tribune is too busy with sports and entertainment to have noticed...I would even bet that the Tribune has more sports reporters than it does Chicago news reporters...in any case, this story is just another example of how corporate u.s. media FAILS to seek the Truth and expose it...   pretty sure it was.....the guardian   WOW...nice job by the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune on this story...HaHaHa...

[Q: Do you think there should be another 9/11 Commission?   -----  (former commisioner) Max Cleland: There should be fifteen 9/11 Commissions!!!](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/911-commissions-forum-shows-dc-works-4.html)   [ America Has Been At War 93% of the Time - 222 Out of 239 Years ](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2015/02/america-war-93-time-222-239-years-since-1776.html)   (page 206)  After completing the new manual, Patreus gets picked to return to Iraq to put his revamped theory to the test. He asks for twenty thousand more troops and gets them, increasing the overall number of forces  in Iraq to a hundred and fifty thousand, or a 15 percent increase. What follows is eighteen months of brutal fighting, at the cost of over one thousand American lives and over ten thousand Iraqis killed. Behind the scenes, McChrystal, operating his own Phoenix-like Special Ops program, wipes out "thousands," according to McChrystal's deputy, Major General Bill Mayville, noting that "jSOC was a killing machine." Violence does, however, eventually decline, and Patreus--and counterinsurgency--is able to take credit for creating the conditions for a face-saving withdrawal. COIN, it appears, is fully vindicated. The surge becomes a modern military myth, one eagerly embraced in Washington by those in the media and political world who'd been complicit in starting the Iraq War.  A closer inspection of the surge myth reveals a murkier set of factors. One of the major turning points in the war is in Anbar province, when local tribal leaders decide to turn against Al Qaeda. This starts happening a year before Patreus returns to command and has little to do with American military strategy. Analysis crediting the turnaround in Anbar usually ignores the reason why Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was able to establish a foothold there in the first place: American bungling for the first three years of the war. The tribal leaders welcomed Al-Qaeda to fight the American occupiers, but then realized they'd made a significant tactical error. Al Qaeda in Iraq eclipsed the American occupation in brutality and stupidity--as one tribal leader would say, he would have "worked with the devil" to beat Al Qaeda. The tribal leaders realized that they weren't just fighting the Americans--the new Shiite-led government in Baghdad was also keen to wipe them out. Faced with the brutality of AQI, coupled with a sectarian cleansing campaign originating from the highest levels of the new government in Baghdad, the tribal leaders, mainly Sunnis, make a desperate play: They tell the Americans that for the right price, they'd partner with them. American soldiers start to hand out bags of cash to insurgents--about $360 million spent in just one year. Overnight, former enemies who had killed Americans for three years became "freedom fighters." ("They are true Iraqi patriots," as one American general will describe his former enemies.) We find a way to buy off the enemies we'd created by invading--the strategy is akin to digging a hole in the desert, then filling the hole with cash and dead bodies and calling it a victory.   ------ (page 64)  Jake came up to me. "We'll hunt you down and kill you if we don't like what you write," he said. "C. will hunt you down and kill you."  [note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal's top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal's West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]  -----  (page 88)  "Sorry about threatening to kill you," Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night.   "Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job," McChrystal said.   "No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you're probably the highest rank to do so," I said.  I laughed, and they didn't.  ----  (page 73-74)  Over the past year, journalists had regularly been given intimate access to McChrystal and his staff.  A reporter for the New York Times spent a few days in Kabul with him, producing a profile that found McChrystal's only fault was that he worked so hard, "he sometimes affords little tolerance for those who do not."  He described his running habits: "eight miles a clip, usually with an audiobook at his ears."  A writer for the Atlantic had enjoyed a good stay, writing an article titled "Man Versus Afghanistan."  He asked if McChrystal was Afghanistan's only hope. He found reason to believe: "eight miles a day, eating only one meal a day, and sleeping four hours a night--itself expresses an unyielding, almost cultic, determination."  Time magazine had put him as runner-up for Person of the Year, opening with an anecdote about a competitive "eight to ten mile" run he had with General Patreus. 60 Minutes spent the most personal time with him: He allowed them to film while he was jogging around the base. They'd all told the same story:McChrystal as a modern combination of saint and ninja, a "Jedi Knight," as Newsweek called him.   -------  (page 75)  As a country, we'd changed since Vietnam--the ghost McChrystal and his generation of military leaders desperately wanted to exorcize. The fear that their wars, too, could end in disgrace: "It's not going to look like a win, smell like a win, or taste like a win," Major General Bill Mayville, McChrystal's director of operations, would tell me. "This is going to end in an argument." An argument they were determined to win. One of the first books McChrystal read after arriving in Kabul was Stanley Karnow's "Vietnam: A History."  McChrystal called the author to ask if there were any lessons that would apply to Afghanistan.  "The main thing I learned is that we never should have been there in the first place," Karnow reportedly told him. It wasn't what the general wanted to hear.  -----  (page 76)  The lesson our leaders took from Vietnam was not, it turns out, how to avoid another Vietnam.  It was how to seal off the horror: to ensure that only a small group felt and saw it. An all volunteer military, and a further reliance on the most elite, specialized soldiers to do the nation's work we prefer to ignore.  Entering houses at midnight and shooting unarmed men while they sleep. A widespread acceptance of drone strikes, killings committed by remote control--McChrystal watched a man on a videofeed in his headquarters for 17 days before he ordered the strike on a compound to kill Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He went to see the dead man's body: the pictures of the corpse were displayed at a press conference, a modern day version of putting a man's head on a spike.  ------  (page 110)  I had downtime to digest the reporting. A question persisted: What was the motivation behind McChrystal's decision to have me tag along? Was it that Rolling Stone would reach a demographic of young officers and recruits they wanted to impress? Would it confirm the view that the team held of McChrystal--that he was a "rock star," as they regularly called him? Dave explained that Special Forces operators had a healthy disrespect for authority; Rolling Stone fit this self-styled image perfectly. They were building Brand McChrystal--ballsy, envelope-pushing, risk taking. New York Times Magazine cover? Done. Time cover? Done. Atlantic cover? Too easy. 60 Minutes profile? No worries. Rolling Stone? Boom. It was a natural evolution of a very aggressive media strategy to establish McChrystal as a contender for the greatest general of his generation, on a par with Patreus.  ----  (pages 142-143)  Insurgents are Afghans. What is essential for success is not to kill the insurgents, because they are the Afghan people. If you kill the insurgency, you kill the Afghan people you came to protect, and there's nobody left to win over.   If you kill two out of ten insurgents, you don't end up with eight insurgents. You might end up multiplying the number of fighters aligned against you. McChrystal calls it "Insurgent Math." If you kill two, he said, "more likely you're going to have something like twenty. Those two that were killed, their relatives don't understand that they're doing bad things. Okay, they think. a foreigner just killed my brother--I got to fight them."  Afghan Math: 10  - 2= 8 (wrong)...10 - 2= 20 (right)  -------  (page 205)  The manual performs a rather impressive sleight of hand: tying counterinsurgency to the War on Terror. The vast majority of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan is not against any combatant who poses a threat to the United States homeland. But to justify the tremendous outlay of resources and lives it requires to enact a counterinsurgency plan, the theories claim that COIN, somehow, is an effective way to deal with transnational terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda. That this is patently false does not give the movement much pause. A RAND study "How Terrorists Groups End," commissioned in 2008, explicitly points out that the best way to defeat terrorist networks is not through military force, but through law enforcement. The authors looked at 648 terrorist groups that were active from 1968 to 2006. In 40 percent of the cases, policing is "the most effective strategy," with local intelligence and police agencies able to penetrate and disrupt the terror groups, while 43 percent reached a political accommodation with the government. The study states: "Military force led to the end of terrorist groups in 7 percent of the cases," and that military force has not "significantly undermined (Al-Qaeda's) abilities."    I really enjoyed those protestors last fall yelling "Fuck cnn" while their "reporter" was in NYC...other protestors in atlanta went to the cnn propaganda headquarters and chanted "Fuck cnn"  I just wish everyone would cancel their fucking cable and put these lying fucking sychophants out of business!!!   So, what ever happened to the bbcs program about 9/11 that was going to use ALL satellite images??? the bbc announced it last year--but havent seen it posted...   the link went bad, then wikileaks put it back up...i'm guessing they will fix it soon--what else does julian assange have to do?!? until then you might try reading **@war** (by Shane Harris, number 3 on list)   The Guantanamo Bay lease is fucking ILLEGAL--any fucking judge in the USA would throw that lease out of court because it is a PERPETUAL lease (it has **NO END DATE**)...   YES...I do have a problem with allowing the CIA/U.S. military forces to be judge, jury and executioner for the people of the world.  YES I do have a problem when the CIA-US military KILL and KILL and KILL so corporations can PROFIT   Obama is responsible for the hundreds of drone strikes he has ordered around the globe..(each drone strike IS an act of war)   So what do you call it when the USA steals Guantanamo Bay from Cuba?  What do you call it when the USA overthrows the Queen of Hawaii and takes Hawaii?  What do you call it when the CIA pumps in millions of dollars to back political parties in Italy?  What do you call it when the USA bombs and bombs and bombs other smaller countries around the world?  http://www.reddit.com/r/TSBD/   will most definitely check it out--thanks for taking the time to write the insightful comment...i've actually wanted to see that movie for quite a while...     Was the NYC World Trade Center created by the CIA back in the 1960's???  I recently purchased a copy of "On the Trail of the Assassins" by Jim Garrison (1988 edition, paperback).  I knew the Oliver Stone movie was based on this book--so I was glad to part with the 25 cents the book was priced at.  I'm pretty familiar with the JFK whack job, so there wasn't anything too surprising until I got to page 100--the last paragraph reads:   According to these articles, the CIA--which apparently had been conducting its own foreign policy for some time--had begun a project in Italy as far back as the early 1960's. The organization, named the Centro Mondiale Commerciale (the World Trade Center), had initially been formed in Montreal, then moved to Rome in 1961. Among the members of its board of directors, we learned, was one Clay Shaw from New Orleans.  So, the CIA seemed to be actively creating "World Trade Centers" around the globe so the CIA could conduct under the radar financial transactions. This money was going to back political parties in Italy--what other types of tranactions were being conducted? Very likely the CIA wanted these "World Trade Centers" for their ever-expanding series of front companies which often dealt with black market money from drug sales and arms dealing. Those of us who have read Peter Dale Scott (or some Michael Ruppert) are quite familiar with the accusations that the OSS/CIA have long-standing drug and mafia links going back to WWII. Possibly, the CIA very early on began to realize the illegal monies gained in the black markets were the easiest way to fund all of their other subversive activities--with the added bonus of NOT having any oversight by those pesky politicians (who don't need to know CIA business anyways).   Interesting to note that the NYC WTC used eminent domain to take over the grounds on which the WTC would be built on--this could be assured with CIA backing. We know Rockerfeller had deep CIA connections. Agency man Phillip Agee claimed his first task in the CIA was to do background checks on employees of Rockerfeller's Standard Oil. Rockerfeller also had much to do with the planning of the WTC in NYC. Was the NYC WTC, from the beginning, designed as a CIA front?   The biggest reason Jim Garrison lost the Clay Shaw trial was because he counldn't definitively link Clay Shaw and the CIA. We now know that Clay Shaw was, in fact, heavily involved with the CIA. After Clay Shaw's death in 1974, Richard Helms was called before the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations and testified that Clay Shaw was involved with the CIA. "On the Trail of the Assassins" also goes on to show the CIA creating Centro Mondiale Commerciales around the globe in the early 60's--I can just imagine Allen Dulles traveling and contacting his endless supply of men like George De Mohrenschildt and Clay Shaw...the book also notes how Clay Shaw's operation was shut down in Italy for "espionage activities" in 1962. So, the CIA knew these fronts were risky and must be considered expendable at a moments notice.   also see: http://scottlazarowitz.org/blog/2010/09/the-twin-towers-and-their-evil-eminent-domain-roots/  You may also be able to view pages 100-104 of Jim Garrison's book on google--it does give some more background...I would type the pages in but i am on my ipad travelling...    just read his book "crossing the Rubicon"...from what I recall it was a note he wrote before 9/11 and stated something like "let one happen, but stop the rest"...actual note was published in the book--you can view the entire book at archive.org   https://archive.org/details/fe_Crossing_the_Rubicon-Decline_of_the_American_Empire_at_the_end_of_the_Age_of_Oil  there are two chapters on Vreeland--I think the note is in the 2nd chapter or in the appendix     amazing that Ruppert wrote this in 2001-2002 (over 100 points)...most likely the Putin interview has been erased from the record...   most likely the interview has been erased from the record...amazing that Ruppert wrote this back in 2001-2002         The Pentagon spends BILLIONS of dollars every year on Public Relations...  So, it is certainly within reason that the Pentagon-CIA would make some distractions.  (Check Michael Hastings article where he states the Pentagon spends $5 billion per year on PR...it was in Rolling Stone...on my phone--otherwise i'd post link)   **CONTAGION**  That one word speaks volumes for how the Pentagon views any individual or group which does not support the political, economic and military goals inside the Pentagon/CIA.   Anyone who has not yet read Tim Weiner's *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CiA* or Stephen Kinzer's *Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq* should do so immediately.      May as well put a FOR SALE sign on the Statue of Liberty, too.   Good question--the CIA has an Inspector General who investigates within...In 2004 the IG CIA released a report--but its been such a long, convoluted, twisting story I have no idea if that report is the same as the 6,300 page 2009 Report...the 6,300 page report needed to be whittled down--so the Senate Select Cmte on Intelligence (SSCI) decided to pay CIA-approved attorneys $40 million to splice, dice and redact the report so it could be released to the SERFS of America. As a bonus, the SSCI gave the CIA-approved attorneys 4 years to do so.   http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/torture_archive/index_ig.htm  In any case, this has been dragging on for over a decade. The first articles looking into systemic torture by the CIA-US military came out in 2002. [Washington Post 12/26/2002](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901356.html) also [the guardian 3/12/2002](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/12/september11.usa)  ------------------  This is a timeline of the events under Obamas presidency: https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/torture-report  Timeline under GW Bush: http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/timeline-collection/torture-tape-timeline/   [We dont torture people...We dont torture people--listen to me--we dont torture people...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkKwbovcHoU)  --former CIA Director George Tenet while promoting his fucking book  (awarded Presidential Medal of Freedom by GW Bush)    I highly doubt that the all too complicit pack of Puppets which calls itself the US press allowed GW Bush just 4 questions and under 3 minutes of time in which to question the president on a regular basis.   It certainly could be that GWB was just a puppet put in place so Cheney could run his evil operations while GWB played it like a bumbling, innocent FOOL.   Even more frightening is the *executive power* which VP Dick Cheney carved out under the POTUS--the extreme secrecy and wide range of illegal actions was (partially) exposed in Barton Gellmans book *ANGLER: The Cheney Vice Presidency*.   But, yes, I would definitely agree that it is insulting to Americans how much Bush/Cheney were able to keep hidden. Seems to be one of the larger ironies: 9/11 was the standard answer to everything, yet they couldnt stand in front of the public and answer questions under oath to the 9/11 Commission.    Pretty sure I saw the Crown or Pritzker (sp?) names caught up in the TAX HAVEN stories which broke out last year (and were overwhelmingly IGNORED by the establishment media).   http://www.icij.org/blog/2012/11/offshore-world-allows-some-play-outside-rules   Opening Statement: The Vice President and I just finished a...a, um--a good conversation with the 9-1-1 Commission.

Uh, it was, uh, it was just a good discussion and I really, I appreciate the members, um...I want to thank the chairman and the vice-chairman for bringing the commission here...and, uh, giving us a chance to share views on different subjects...and they had a lot of good questions...and, uh, Im glad I did it, Im glad I took the time. Its an important commission, and its important that, uh, they ask the questions they ask so they can help make recommendations necessary to better protect our homeland. It was a--I enjoyed it. Let me ask--answer--a few questions...  -----------------  Interesting that GW Bush couldnt even complete his FIRST sentence: after he says the vice president and I just finished a... Bush pauses before he can find the right word. Bush can only use a very broad word to describe  the conversation because Bush and Cheney were not placed under oath during the conversation.   Interesting that Bush comes out by HIMSELF, without Cheney--is this designed to fool everyone?   The other interesting bit of Bushs opening statement is that he shakes his head side-to-side (which means NO) before he says the words better protect our homeland.  GW Bush then goes on to answer 3 questions and rudely tell a 4th reporter that he already answered his question yesterday.  If the 9/11 Commission was so important--why did it take Bush so long to, Not Testify--but have a conversation" with them? Why is the press conference last only 5 minutes afterwards? Why are only 4 questions asked?  There are more interesting moments during the 4 Question Press Conference--what can you find?  ----------  While I was trying to find the full press conference, I checked C-Span. First I searched for video Bush 9/11 Commission...here is what pops up: http://www.c-span.org/search/?searchtype=Videos query=bush+9%2F11+commission+  I then made my search more specific and searched for video Bush 4/29/2004--still NO GW Bush press conference!!!  WHY are they REMOVING this EVIDENCE from the record? (its available on youtube thanks to researchers like Jon Gold)...You can literally find thousands of GW Bush videos--but anything to do with 9/11 Commission seems to be missing INTENTIONALLY from the record...Isnt that what CRIMINALS do--remove or destroy evidence??? Anyone who has looked into this can see a much longer pattern of the Vice President and the President attempting to obstruct or disrupt the investigations looking into 9/11...  In addition to UNDERFUNDING the 9/11 Commission, the Bush-Cheney war criminals also acted quickly to Cover Up the evidence and impede any meaningful investigation...  + The government shipped much of the WTC steel (aka the evidence) to China and India to be recycled ASAP (isnt that what criminals do--destroy evidence?)...  + Within 10 days, the government was looking to pay off the victims relatives and forcing them to sign confidentiality agreements in order to receive money from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund...the families were also given a strict deadline in which to make their decision.  + Dick Cheney asked Sen. Tom Daschle NOT to investigate 9/11 on several occasions. (Sen. Daschle was on the Joint Intelligence Inquiry into 9/11).  + GW Bush wouldnt testify to the 9/11 Commission UNDER OATH and BEFORE THE PUBLIC (hes just the President--what did you expect?)...  + The 9/11 Commission Co-Chairmen wrote an editorial in the *New York Times* claiming the investigation was obstructed by the CIA and the White House.          I heard some guys brag about TORTURING people...do you want their names, too?  Dick Cheney seemed to be leading the pack...   GREAT point...The Gary Webb allegations have to be re-analyzed.  Never really thought about this before, but didnt the laws against marijuana come into play in 1937...2 years after alcohol was legalized.  The War on Drugs made our prisons madhouses and had extremely negative effects on many other countries as well...   Thanks--glad so many here in r/conspiracy liked it...it was my first use of imgur--have some kinks to work out, but will go to sleep with a smile on my face.   YES, the war profiteers couldnt figure out how to go back to a peace time economy--it seemed much easier to spread some fear to get the war machines turning again. The 6 paragraphs that Andrew Cockburn wrote were pretty shocking to read when I first came across them (linked above).   McClatchy (sic?) News reported these last spring--article was quickly taken down and an investigation into leaks ensued...somone copy/pasted to document cloud before the article was expunged...   Very sound argument, although I would go back a bit further--back to the 1947 National Security Act which renamed the War Department, centralized the military and created the CIA. There is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was played like a drum by the Pentagon and sent over the CIAs Wurlitzer...  http://redd.it/2fnykt  Antony C.

Thanks for the great AMA!!!   I was shocked by the 2nd part of the quote...  One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.      I guess there used to be 8 Congressional Committees who handled different aspects of the oversight--it was cut back to just 2 Committees around 1980 I think--supposedly due to committee members leaking info. As for Congress doing its job--I came across this shocking quote:  -----------  Another senior intelligence official noted that oversight had deteriorated so much during his career that I dont even know what good oversight looks like anymore.[12] Overseers agreed. One legislator who served on a congressional intelligence committee called oversight horrible and said that improving even the intelligence budget process would mean that somebody in Congress would have to die.

Zegart (2011): The Roots of Weak Congressional Intelligence Oversight   http://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/futurechallenges_zegart.pdf  -----------------    Any thoughts on the seemingly complete loss of Congressional Oversight of the intelligence agencies? (Runaway NSA, CIA spying on SSCI, FBI-NSA spying on Senator Frank Church, Barton Gellman reported in his book that Cheney receives NSA printouts on State Dept. officials, Russ Tice allegations, etc.)     I wouldnt doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...  Of course this isnt happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with.   Articles questioning authority (Pentagon, CIA) seem to be stricken from the record. I feel this is dangerous--imagine if the MSM had allowed more voices of dissent in the run up to the Iraq invasion in 2003.   Thanks for the info--Im just making my way thru Alfred McCoys *A Question of Torture* which reviews the history of the CIAs interrogation/torture experiments. I dont ever remember hearing about the Capitol building incident from 1983...WOW.  I read Beverly Gages book *The Day Wall Street Exploded* last year. She included Notes on Sources which is quite detailed and clear in that she was Shut Down in her attempt for new info the US government had on the 1920 Wall Street bombing. Gage did recently strike some GOLD though--a few weeks ago the *NYT* published her article on how she found the UNREDACTED FBI-MLK Suicide Letter. (She found it at the National Archives while doing research on J. Edgar Hoover)   Sprey was right about nations walking away from the F-35...last week, the UK just placed another huge" order--for FOUR more F-35s (Ill bet they would order LESS of them if they could)...

Voices which criticize the US military-NSA-CIA seem to have been left out. If we had listened to more of these voices of dissent maybe, just maybe, the US would have never invaded Iraq in 2003.   is there a way to analyze r/news or r/worldnews submissions? itd be interesting to see the growth of larger media after the Snowden story broke...  at one point last year I made a post in r/conspiracy about the frontpage of r/worldnews being filled with over 1/2 of their submissions from the guardian and the bbc...  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2arx5o/congratulations_rworldnewsyou_are_becoming/   Buckley was on the debate team at Yale, so YES he's formidable. I definitely found some of his statements to be wild--youre 100% right about the I dont care who killed Kennedy statement.   It appears to me that Buckley used his into of Mark Lane to paint him with the Left Liberal corner. Buckley then asks his first question:   -------------  WB: Id like to begin by asking Mr. Lane this: it is widely alleged that sinister forces who have a vested interest in suppressing the real truth as to the identity of the assassin have been here and they are killing off crucial people--former strippers at Rubys joint in Dallas, a truck driver, roommates of Oswalds--that kind of thing. How come if you were the man who has changed history, these forces havent bumped you off?  ---------------  *have been here*   HERE seems very out of place.  Buckley is obviously working with notes--this seems an outlandish question to open the interview with. I think Buckley was trying to knock Mark Lane off balance from the start. Didnt work!!   Ive watched this 4 or 5 times now--each time through I notice more. Youre definitely spot on about Buckleys darting eyes--it looks like he intends physical harm to Mark Lane at some points (on the split screen).   Not familiar with the NLP reference--but surely it makes an impression when Buckley mentions the Soviets, then physically acts out pressing a button--then goes on to mention Oswald and he (Buckley) holds out his hands as if he was shooting a rifle.   There are also points where Buckleys EARS move--I think this may be from tightening the jaw...is this a sign of anger?  Never knew about Mark Lane getting caught up in the Jonestown mess.  Havent watched the Baldwin-Buckley debate yet. It is worth mentioning that the U.S. painted communism/socialism as an Evil Menace in a much more pronounced and effective manner than in England. Many of the labor strikes of the early 20th century blamed the violence on socialists. There was also the [Wall Street bombing of 1920](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing) which was blamed on socialists--with very little hard evidence. In fact, in 2009 a Yale American History professor, Beverly Gage, wrote a book about the incident--and was unable to get any additional files released for her book--almost 90 years later.     [William F.Buckley, Jr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Buckley,_Jr.): Skull   Bones at Yale--where he was also an informer for the FBI...in 1951 Buckley was recruited by the CIA and worked with E.

[GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; WEB HOST INDUSTRY REVIEW, 9/10/2001] Three days after the initial raid, the task force is still busy inside the building, reportedly copying every hard disc they could find. It is not clear how long these websites remain shut down. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001] InfoCom began to be seriously investigated by the FBI in late 1998 when the name of an employee was discovered in the address book of bin Ladens former personal secretary. There also was evidence of a financial link between InfoCom and a top Hamas leader (see October 1994-2001). InfoCom is closely connected to the Holy Land Foundation. Not only are the two organizations across the road from each other in Richardson, Texas, a number of employees work at both organizations. For instance, Ghassan Elashi is both the vice president of InfoCom and chairman of Holy Land. [GUARDIAN, 9/10/2001; NEW YORK TIMES, 12/20/2002] A local bank closes Holy Lands checking accounts totaling about $13 million around the same time as the raid on InfoCom, but Holy Lands assets are not officially frozen by the government. [DALLAS BUSINESS JOURNAL, 9/7/2001] The US will shut down Holy Land and freeze their assets two months later (see December 4, 2001) for suspected ties to Hamas. Holy Land is represented by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer   Feld, a Washington, D.C., law firm with unusually close ties to the Bush White House.

McCoy, 2006) goes much further into the issue, beginning with research the CIA funded in the 50s--much of it conducted in U.S. universities and hospitals. The doctors even published their research in medical journals afterwords. At one point in the 1960s, the CIA made their rookies be subjected to these methods and a large portion of them couldnt finish the treatment (I think it was a week long).  What most people dont understand is that the U.S. military trained Iraqi police/militia forces in torture methods after the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003. [The guardian made a documentary](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/06/pentagon-iraqi-torture-centres-link) last year centered around a U.S. officer named James Steele and his direct ties to Donald Rumsfeld. One has to question if teaching torture methods to Iraqis helped fuel the extremely horrifying headlines we saw from Iraq about large numbers of bodies being found beheaded. Most likely this was a back-and-forth, but I think that training, funding and feeding this type of torture program likely has much to do with the growth of ISIS and their brutal methods. The U.S. didn't just commit torture--the U.S. outsourced torture which may have helped feed the extremely vicious cycle of bloodbath after bloodbath.

I have also come to realize that the U.S. media has negatively effected my perception of people from the Middle East. As a child the media coverage of the Iran Hostage crisis greatly impacted my views about Iranians. Its only been more recently that I have been able to understand that the hostage crisis was actually blowback from the CIA 1953 coup detat in Iran. Not sure when the CIA files actually began to come out--but Im pretty sure that was never mentioned on *Nightline* (which began airing to give late night coverage of the hostage crisis).   I guess the movie about Gary Webb is experiencing turbulence--I saw an online petition to pressure the studio (either they have shelved it or are cutting out parts). Even though its just a movie, I hope it gets released...I read in James Risens book *State of War* that NSA director Hayden actually watched *Enemy of the State* (with Will Smith)...(for some reason cryptome took the first page of chapter 2 out) http://cryptome.org/nsa-program.htm              the editor of consortium news worked for the AP and helped expose Iran-Contra...  As one of the reporters who helped expose the Iran-Contra scandal for the Associated Press in the mid-1980s, I was distressed by the silliness and propaganda that had come to pervade American journalism. I feared, too, that the decline of the U.S. press corps foreshadowed disasters that would come when journalists failed to alert the public about impending dangers.  Also by 1995, documents were emerging that put the history of the 1980s in a new  and more troubling  light. Yet, there were fewer and fewer media outlets interested in that history.  http://consortiumnews.com/about/    I would like to volunteer to be a mod...I would definitely like to help get some AMAs going and just started [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/) (the Texas School Book Depository--a collection of conspiracy related books available in FREE pdf format)   You can read a FREE pdf copy at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)--its #15  in the comments are directions on how to find a copy of his next book as a free pdf as well.  if you do buy it--it should be available used from ONE CENT + $3.99 delivery in U.S. (I have a [list of cheap books at r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2hw8i0/list_of_cheap_dirty_conspiracy_booksmany_for_one/) as well)    ---------------  E. Snowden: I take the threat of terrorism seriously, and I think we all do. And I think its really disingenuous for the government to invoke and sort of scandalize our memories, to sort of exploit the national trauma that we all suffered together and worked so hard to come through to justify programs that have never been shown to keep us safe, but cost us liberties and freedoms that we dont need to give up and our Constitution says we should not give up.  B. Williams: But you can see how it happened. Guys with box cutters spent $200 using our own aviation system to take down our own buildings and smash into the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. What are we going to do? Its a non-traditional enemy  the expression is, an enemy we cant see. What are we going to do?  E. Snowden: You know, and this is a key question that the 9/11 Commission considered. And what they found, in the post-mortem, when they looked at all of the classified intelligence from all of the different intelligence agencies, they found that we had all of the information we needed as an intelligence community, as a classified sector, as the national defense of the United States to detect this plot. We actually had records of the phone calls from the United States and out. The CIA knew who these guys were. The problem was not that we werent collecting information, it wasnt that we didnt have enough dots, it wasnt that we didnt have a haystack, it was that we did not understand the haystack that we have.  The problem with mass surveillance is that were piling more hay on a haystack we already dont understand, and this is the haystack of the human lives of every American citizen in our country. If these programs arent keeping us safe, and theyre making us miss connections  vital connections  on information we already have, if were taking resources away from traditional methods of investigation, from law enforcement operations that we know work, if were missing things like the Boston Marathon bombings where all of these mass surveillance systems, every domestic dragnet in the world didnt reveal guys that the Russian intelligence service told us about by name, is that really the best way to protect our country? Or are we  are we trying to throw money at a magic solution thats actually not just costing us our safety, but our rights and our way of life?  http://thedesk.matthewkeys.net/2014/05/edward-snowden-unaired-nbc-clips/  --------------------  Former NSA Officers Thomas Drake, William Binney (et al.)

I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....  ...Thats where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.  Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...  ...In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSAs senior leaders took me off the task because they realized  belatedly, for some reason  that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.  When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.

 Here's the abstract from the [original paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515002079) "Relatively recent cometary impacts at the Moon could leave unique traces of their origins: high impact velocities and volatile abundances, combined with the presence of a dust- and ice-laden coma, may thermally and mechanically process the lunar surface in ways distinct from the impact of an asteroid. Here we analytically and numerically assess the consequences of a cometary impact at the Moon by considering the combined effects of a collision by the nucleus and inner coma. Our results show that cometary impacts entrain the finest fraction of lunar soil grains (10 m) over regional scales (1001000 km), produce large masses of vaporized material, and likely generate transient magnetic fields that could exceed the Earths surface field strength by a factor of 104. This combination of processes is consistent with a mechanism to generate lunar swirls: the diffuse, meandering disturbances in brightness and regolith texture that curl across much of the lunar far-side and are also commonly (but not exclusively) associated with magnetic anomalies. Previous observations of swirl features indicate that bright regions also possess a peculiar, altered regolith structure, which can be produced by the removal of fine soil grains. Regional scouring by an impacting comet explains both the structure and albedo variations: large dynamic pressures entrain the smallest grains within a near-surface flow of dusty plasma, disrupting the backscattering, fairy-castle structure of lunar soils in equilibrium with the airless environment. The resulting surface is brightened by compaction of the previously open, porous macrostructure. Darker lanes observed within swirl regions are interpreted as possible melt and/or vapor deposits. Finally, the intense magnetic fields generated during high-speed cometary impacts provide an explanation for correlations between swirl locations and magnetic anomalies."            Never trust people who do yoga.   ...and they've believed no studies since then. I'm not optimistic either.   Here's the [original study](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2275444) published today in JAMA. Excerpt: "A retrospective cohort study using an administrative claims database associated with a large commercial health plan. Participants included children continuously enrolled in the health plan from birth to at least 5 years of age during 2001-2012 who also had an older sibling continuously enrolled for at least 6 months between 1997 and 2012...In this large sample of privately insured children with older siblings, receipt of the MMR vaccine was not associated with increased risk of ASD, regardless of whether older siblings had ASD. These findings indicate no harmful association between MMR vaccine receipt and ASD even among children already at higher risk for ASD."         Original Source: "Case 1: An Amputation Cover-Up. The Treatment: A new stem cell therapy that promises to restore blood flow in damaged legs. The Claim: All 26 patients in the study reported no significant clinical changes in either of their legs, beyond those caused by the stem cell treatment. The Fraud: FDA documents show that one of the patients had an entire foot amputated two weeks into the study. Thats a pretty serious omission, and it definitely constitutes a significant clinical change in the leg. No one bothered to correct or retract the faulty study, and the trial was considered a success.  [Stem Cell Trial](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22079876): "This phase II clinical trial shows that the use of a combination cell therapy is safe and effective in increasing blood flow in the ischemic legs of patients with limb ischemia."    Sort of. But not entirely.   Our results demonstrate that the GNSS and INS navigational sensors built into consumer devices such as smartphones are capable of detecting surface displacements from moderate and larger earthquakes.  ...what we generally call "cell phone GPS" is really a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS...one type GNSS is GPS) plus Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). So the thing that most people think of as "GPS" include INS. In your cell phone, INS gets its position and velocity from the GPS satellite receiver and then calculates its own position based on motion sensors.   TL;DR: "Smartphone GPS"= GPS + INS.    Here's the abstract from the [original study](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/science/early-earthquake-warnings-smartphones-gps/): Earthquake early warning (EEW) can reduce harm to people and infrastructure from earthquakes and tsunamis, but it has not been implemented in most high earthquake-risk regions because of prohibitive cost. Common consumer devices such as smartphones contain low-cost versions of the sensors used in EEW. Although less accurate than scientific-grade instruments, these sensors are globally ubiquitous. Through controlled tests of consumer devices, simulation of an Mw (moment magnitude) 7 earthquake on Californias Hayward fault, and real data from the Mw 9 Tohoku-oki earthquake, we demonstrate that EEW could be achieved via crowdsourcing.

 I swear to god they do that shit on purpose. Oh let's wait to run shit through until hey you're overdrawn!  bank of america pulled that shit so many times I finally closed my account   aw, man! I was guessing you were going to find out the tights were really for him. lol   soooo pretty!!    jesus christ, what all did she order?    Agreed. House ring    My abusive ex had her pick out my ring before and she actually fussed at me for ending the relationship after he assaulted me sexually badly enough to warrant an ER visit. She said I was "ruining the ring" and I didn't deserve it. Lol.     PLEASE tell me you cut contact with her after that. jesus christ.   honestly I like the first ring better lol  also a female electrician? that is awesome.  And finally your mother needs to mind her own damn business.   I didn't really like anything this month so I skipped. AGAIN.    lol my grandmother was half Lakota Sioux and SHE had facial hair ! My mother and I have to pluck our chin hairs.   My husband claims that 100% "pure blood" Native Americans have no facial hair. I've tried arguing that almost no one is "100%" anything but I digress. It appears to be a common stereotype, just one I never heard before him.   I have not heard of any blood moon lore. They did believe in skinwalkers however, which is pretty cool.   Some cultures have multiple husbands as well.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyandry   kinky   That's a really good idea. I wish my husband would do this!   I would rather my husband jerk off to my picture than porn anyday!   then there are the girls who flirt with the gm for gear.....   Dammit I need one of these for cats   how long does it take them to ship?   Agree, if he truly loved you he would be able to deal with you no matter how fucked up emotionally you are.  I have some really shitty depression/anger issues and my husband could have decided he was in over his head and I would have understood but I guess the good outweighs the bad for him and he is able to deal with it.   CALL HR. That is not acceptable.   I think it was more like usps probably tossed it around. We ate the pieces so I wasn't worried about it but probably not going to subscribe again   that's what she said   Or you know the child could get stuck and you'd have to call 911 and get an ambulance and fire dept out there to save your kid for letting them do something stupid and possibly harmful.   jesus christ   I cancelled mine after the first box because everything was broken :(  The candy and pocky were in a million pieces   I don't know if I'm about to start my period or if my body just hates me   goddammit! mine is throbbing and I didn't even have sex :(   "Be a good boy"  What the fuck does she think you're a dog?! That's infuriating   poor chicks   or the police. we have a lost child!    And bears, I hope :)   Ok well as a woman I can say with some measure of expertise that most women I know need at least 20 minutes to get off.  But you are correct there is a majority of women who can't get off from PIV   "I've never made her cum from sex and last ~7 minutes every time, at the longest"  That's your problem right there. Obviously there's nothing in it for her so why would she want to have sex?   holy crap these are a work of art!   most important thing- does it have a dungeon?   To protect yourself from... cows?   I went with minimum required coverage. To save money. BAM uninsured motorist hit my parked car. Because I didn't pay the uninsured motorist coverage there was nothing I could do.  The worst part is we called the guy's insurance company and they said he WAS covered only to find out two days later he wasn't. His insurance company wouldn't do shit, my insurance company wouldn't do shit, and it was too late to call the cops.  The good news is the guy is in jail now for a string of like 12 burglaries in the area.      Assuming they are too poor to move.   First of all, this was not a stranger. It was her ex-boyfriend who had already sent her to the hospital. At that point I would file a restraining order and buy a gun or call a women's shelter/move so he couldn't find me in the first place.   That's so horrible :(   That is crazy! I thought American doctors were money hungry but this is like 1000x worse!   damn I want to hire him to make my wedding invitations   can I just get the good ones?   .... so it's basically a prescription racket?   ok I call bullshit, are those even letters?   my obgyn is horrible at this. cvs had to call the nurse to figure out what the hell the rx was for....   Thanks so much! Great seller- Glad I could help you raise money for a great cause! Love my items!   Texans and New Yorkers are tied imo....   oh wow, she is gorgeous! with or without makeup!   lol what is that exactly white clown makeup + blood?   Absolutely they either need to fire her or call the police because blocking up your store phone is not acceptable.   I'd be afraid to sit down in those.   some asshole tried to sign their name on our credit card machine with an actual pen. *facepalm*   see I see everyone else get amazing boxes and I always end up with punishment boxes ! that's why I keep cancelling and then resubscribing only to be disappointed again :(   oh wow you got a REALLY good box! I've been wanting the paula's choice and the balm apples.    yea I can't imagine wearing these long term   I've seen panties with pearl thongs going up your ass crack but never in the front...   Yea, birchbox is having major shipping issues as well   I'm actually on it for pcos. I don't get normal periods unless I'm on birth control. If I got pregnant at this point it would be a miracle and I'd be happy lol.   this is called lane skiing and I used to see it every day on 635   typical texas driver.... I've seen people make a right hand turn from the left lane.   wanted to mention that I had no "purge" with the 2% bha gel but YMMV   I have been using the 2% bha gel with good results. The liquid burned my sensitive skin too much, and I haven't tried the lotion   benzoyl peroxide and birth control are the only things that work for my hormonal acne :(   It may be a fetish. I like gangbang stuff, tentacles, etc. To others it may be fucked up but whatever, it gets me off.   not at all.   Some women tend to do it a lot, others don't. I would try g spot stimulation and a hitachi magic wand.   gahhh this is too much work   Lol I thought he was supposed to be in exile from human society...   lol my cat likes to play with wadded up receipts.    I'm going to go with feminists for $5000, Alex   how about $20 plus s h? BTW the eyeliner is empty, it broke :(   Any idea what the shipping rate would be? I've never shipped to canada before lol   Caramel apple   Fill up on vegetables/fruits. Drink a lot of water and have healthy snacks prepared that way when you snack you have a better substitute on hand. Don't buy junk food/keep it in the house  Of course at work it's harder, especially when everyone is ordering fast food/take out.     I love when kids come in the store. 99% of the time they make my day   oh wow, even better! *high fives*   Yes your sil is a horrible person to say that. she has no idea what you've gone through/are still going through. :(   mmmmm you guys have good donuts   We have kids that run behind our counter. Their parents say they're going to leave them there and we threaten to put them to work. One day a mom threatened to lock her son in a storage unit. I wasn't sure if she was joking lol   yea this is a joke   holy crap dude I would buy that.   yea too much paperwork lol   Snow is the name in the north for bastards Like "Flowers" is the name for bastards in highgarden there are a few others but I can't remember right now   let me guess, gluten free bs?   "Well you better call an ambulance, because I have high blood pressure!"  Oh I would have called them. She was obviously being a drama queen. I bet she would have freaked out and peed her pants once she realized you were actually dialing 911.   lol do not test on animals   Especially when I need you to pay attention to and answer important questions regarding payment, insurance, phone numbers, etc.   And I know he would have been pissed off at OP if his order had been messed up because he wasn't paying attention because he was too busy talking on the phone to tell OP what toppings/condiments he wanted. I actually thought that was what was going to happen.    hmmm this post makes me want a cherry limeade....   My money is on the overweight one. I knew this girl in 5th grade that smelled like onions. She was large. I still don't know why she smelled that way.   fuck your snacks GIVE ME MONEY   This old dude with  lung cancer came in and started flirting with me (not too creepy, he was winking and stuff lol). I was so sad when he started talking about his cancer, he was a really nice old man   for fuck's sake. buy both cat toys. take them home. ask the cat. return the one he doesn't like.  so simple   lol I wouldn't shop at a store that SOLD STALE FOOD   I do this too. I will wait for you to hang the hell up then pretend I suddenly just noticed your presence.   "I look at the coupon, look at him, then take my pen and underline, circle, and draw arrows pointing to the "not valid on" disclaimer"   Should have highlighted it. For emphasis :)   So she wanted her hair "did" but then decided she wanted ice cream too?   It wasn't even valuable medicine, it was medication for Alzheimer's, no painkillers or Adderall or anything.   WHY   how about the Kiss Nail Dress - Floral print ?  Thanks :)   we got a complaint on our review site for "theft of services"  Dude didn't pay his storage bill and his stuff got auctioned. of course that's our fault.   Hey I am interested in the Juara Candlenut body cream - sample  the Angel bare escentuals  and Be A Bombshell lip crayon - Hot Damn Thanks!   OMG WHERE IS PART 3   every time I am nauseous my husband goes "Well maybe you're pregnant!"    Not funny.   awwww the alot is so cute  	104
 His manager walked into the F1 paddock in Spain, was asked a respectful question, and answered it.   How is that hassling the family on any level?   Pretty damning indictment of old Ferrari isn't it? I thought he had been kicked out, but I guess this changes my opinion.   That's usually how it works, they don't give it away for free, there is a payment of some kind involved but its often a promotional trade off.       The last tyre war wasn't very good for the drivers or the sport, so I'm not convinced thats a solution to a problem the sport has.   Pirelli were asked to get us to three stop races, and they've done a pretty good job of meeting that target. Speeds always increase through time as the teams find engineering solutions to the constraints of the rules.      Higher than you'd think, its actually a relatively common occurrence - Brundle said something along the lines of 'we've all experienced that and learned the hard way to throw them clear of the car' toward the end of the Sky coverage.    Pretty amazing work from Merc save for Hamilton's balance issues.  Ferrari seem to have completely fluffed the upgrade cycle, left themselves with no idea what works and what doesn't, and not made the expected gains as result.   They were the first to press, its a direct quote from the manager rather than the paper, and you can find the same story with the same quote in dozens of other publications right now.   Read about any of the top driver deals over the last couple of decades, those are the common terms. Price range will be with the confines of the Vettel and Alonso deals, give or take performance bonuses etc.  Jenson was able to keep the BGP car because it was in his contract for example.   Increased wear = heat = expansion. They're bound to be using a material that keeps any expansion to a minimum but even a small amount could affect the seating of the gun on the wheel fastening.   Somewhere in the 120 - 140 million over three years range including performance bonuses, keep the trophies, keep any WDC winning car, media and sponsor work to a minimum - typical stuff for top drivers.   Looking at the media speculation Hamilton's team are seeking a deal similar to Alonso and Vettel, the Mercedes board seems to be choking on it a little bit.   And you won't, because both of those things are extremely unlikely given the type and severity of the injury.  Looking at the media stories there haven't been any similar quotes from her since December.          She said  "There are small improvements, but the road is still very long."  This a woman who is extremely close to the family and who has spent each day since the accident fending off almost any media speculation or stories about Schumacher. So for her to actually comment and say something positive (however small) is really good news.  With the type of injuries suffered by both Schumacher and Bianchi all you can really expect are (very) small improvements. A member of my family, sadly a child, suffered serious brain trauma and it took four years for any real progress to manifest itself.            Try deleting the app downloading it again and restoring the subscription. This worked for me.   What kind of device do you have it on - are you relying on wifi or cellular data?   You have a source for that? I thought I'd seen his post drive chat with Button - was there an interview I've missed?         Ted K mentioned this in his [notebook](https://youtu.be/yufbj7NWojA?t=13m35s).    Since the potential field only includes people with 6 - 10 billion to spend I'm not confident there is a good solution.   IMO testing liveries don't count!            They were all pretty huge, although the angle of the photo accentuates the size. I believe that at the time you had more choice of [rim size](http://www.smcars.net/attachments/formulas-png.81696/) because there does appear to be a wide vairiation amongst the cars of that era.  The innovation was the mounting of the engine at 3.5 degrees to assist ground effect - something [copied more sucessfully by the Ferrari F10](http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/f1-the-striking-1979-arrows-a2-that-inspired-the-2010-ferrari-f10?artid=115830).   He does, and he's had career long bad luck!   But he's amazingly quick - the other guys at the front of the grid hadn't even hit puberty when Kimi got his first F1 drive.                        6th   You've missed the point of the entire discussion that was taking place.   True, but more recently the wind-tunnel issues demonstrated where their real problems lay.   The engineers said we need a new 60% scale wind tunnel, management said make do with what you have. Basically the next four years were a write off! Management simply didn't understand the needs of the team - using alternative facilities whilst fixing their own basically cost five times as much.  It's one example, but it highlights the problem. The decision makers just didn't get it.   The whole reason that Schui was trying to bully his way past Wurz was that he wanted to chase Mika, he certainly thought he was in with a shot! Hakkinen made mistakes and had brake problems, if Schui could have put him under pressure then he might have forced an error.  Schui had start problems for years - it was one of the biggest problems in his early career and something he worked very hard on, especially after 1995.    Absolutely! For the first time in 30 odd years of watching I actually like the team.   They seem to have finally addressed the internal power structure problems that have dogged them since the 90s - all it took was the racing team sinking the flotation. I guess these issues were easy to ignore when they were winning with Schumacher.   Well, it's killed a few engine components and had a credible attempt at munching on Maldonado.   6 points is almost half the deficit! That Ferrari also wasn't as good as the McLaren in fast corners and was hard on its tyres. He could have won Monaco had he shown more patience.  You also forget Schumacher stalled it on the grid in Japan before the puncture. As I said, if he and the Ferrari had performed better he would have sealed it, but the car let him down and he made too many unforced errors. The DC crash hurt, but he had plenty of chances.   You are correct on the points. But reliability really cost him, he had the championship in his own hands that year.   He finished the season ~~24~~ 14 points down. Arguably his over aggressive attempts to get past Wurtz at Monaco, two mechanical retirements, three thirds and a fifth cost him the WDC rather than anything DC did.  He and Ferrari had the championship in their own hands.               I think the feeling was mutual, much like the antipathy between [Schumacher and Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/). But taking Damon Hill out etc - he had an angry streak for a very long time.   Even as late in his carrer in 2010 he almost put [Barrichello](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8875352.stm) into the wall.   He was far from cool as ice in his younger days. Quite the hothead for a few years.                     Considering Ferrari fired Aldo Costa because Alonso lost the 2010 championship, and he went on to be the Engineering Director responsible for the W05 and W06, Mercedes might discover a sudden need for catering staff!         It is, but choosing a new engine, and having one blow up are quite different.      Fascinating read, thanks for that link!     Several reasons:-  - Voting for this may allow them to make a deal on something they want now, or in the future.  - The extra engine might be helpful to Mercedes.  - Sporting considerations - everyone wants a competitive series.  - Having several teams able to test new engines (which may have upgraded components compared to race engines) allows Mercedes plenty of room for development and curing reliability issues.    I doubt Ferrari are a serious factor in Mercedes decisions on this one because they seem to have good reliability, and Merc want/need the competition for the sake of the show.   Its more likely that Mercedes would be influenced by their customer teams needs. Down grid, RBR and McLaren are a potential threat to Lotus and Williams - both teams where money plays a more significant role and data gathering is helpful (though not dramatically so).            Thanks. I was beginning to wonder about him!   That's wide of the mark. His results look more like Alonso's than anyone else's - 2nd in the WDC four times, 3rd three times.  He was a *brilliant* driver just without that tiny little extra margin, and he hit his peak at the same time as Fangio which didn't help.     James Allison tried his damndest to keep Alonso  He and Alonso have a relationship going back to Renault, but [I always thought that](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula-one/22470411) it was Alonso that wanted Allison rather than the other way around.  James Allison starting at Ferrari on Sept 1 as chassis tech direc will likely help pacify a certain Spaniard today, bet the phone's been hot - Martin Brundle  Of course Vettel had a stated preference for Kimi.  Id prefer Kimi. I need to be careful now. Nothing against Fernando, I respect him a lot as a driver but I think I respect Kimi on track and off track because hes always been very straight with me and from that point of view it might be a bit easier.   Seb's always talked of being a Ferrari driver, even when he was in the German BMW formula, there is an interview somewhere but I can't lay my hands on the link.  Interesting though, I'd long suspected that Ferrari had an informal deal with Vettel [because of his relationship with Schumacher, and Schumacher's dislike for Alonso] that when he was ready to move they would open the door. This also confirms that Ferrari left Alonso rather than the other way around.    Ah, no worries!   Rabid?! I'm very fair and balanced when it comes to Rosberg ;o)  Although if you severed me in two I'm pretty sure that underneath Formula 1 it would read Senna - Mansell - Hill - Hamilton - Button, then England Rugby.   Stevenage is mostly a *very* middle class post war new-town (concrete and unpleasant). Its actually about an hour and a half away from London by road or rail.   Jeez what a mess!         That BMW's next test driver would be a 4 time WDC, and Alonso wouldn't win the championship in the next 8 years.   Haven't NASCAR implemented a similarly weird system now - only x number of races count towards the championship?      I only bothered to downvote because you were being an ass.   GM School Bus Yellow is a shade of orange, not yellow, so you were wrong about that too.   Ferrari just seem to have pursued a completely different car concept.   If I understand RBR correctly they relied on the short nose solution to deal with the turbulent air over the front wheels, couldn't get it through the crash tests, and the car is a dog without it. Hence their thinking that they will see major gains now they have it working.   Ferrari appear to have focussed on unleashing last years aero-compromised engine, improving the suspension geometry, and getting the cooling right, rather than expending staff time and money on the nose.            Nice work editing the original comment and then deleting and reposting your reply. As is obvious to you now the context wasn't clear, hence my response.  In actual fact one owner was told by a former McLaren mechanic to use ['GM School Bus Yellow'](http://paintref.com/cgi-bin/colorcodedisplay.cgi?style=print type=paint paint=79904 ditzler=2785 syear=1975 smanuf=GM smodel= sname=School%20Bus%20Yellow cols=simple rows=150) on his M6A - as you can see from the link it is the correct colour.      To Torro Rosso - CASIO, and Pepe Jeans to Red Bull but the links are all on the site that cannot be named!  His first team was BMW Sauber. He had a slightly unusual route into F1 through several German series, but I believe it was actually BMW that funded his test driver seat because they wanted a German driver for their own F1 team. Of course by the time he was ready they were pulling out.      Thing is I don't see that Hamilton is putting himself in the spotlight in the way you suggest. You can't have a relationship with a major celebrity and not be in the spotlight no matter how hard you try. If you look at what he puts on instagram or twitter its pretty standard fair   It was Ron's second F2 team, Project 4, that took over McLaren rather than the other way around. The MP4 designation [originally meant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) 'Marlboro Project 4', and was later changed to mean 'McLaren Project 4'. This only goes to show how deep the relationship with Philip Morris was.  Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.   I was surprised! I knew Damon, Eddie Jordan (and I think DC) used to play pub rock together in bars after the races but I didn't know he'd recorded anything.   I think they only had two cameras and shared them around at each race - the damn things were so expensive back then.   Sorry. I was referring to his first F2 outfit Rondel Racing and the context wasn't clear - but you're correct, I got his age wrong, he was 26 at the time.   No problem - my context wasn't clear in any case.  My partner is Black as is my closest friend and as a result I've become more aware of the subtleties of racism, or what could better be described as racially motivated criticism, than I otherwise might have been.   Much of the commentary directed at Hamilton carries a tone of 'otherness' with it - its seeking to highlight aspects of his character, tone, style, and personal behavior that are different than what is perceived to be the 'norm' if you see what I mean. If you want to undermine something you raise questions of validity and highlight things that are seen as outside the mainstream of opinion.  For example. You could say that 'Schumacher was a great driver, but not a great sportsman' - if you wanted to acknowledge the greatness but undermine the validity of his considerable achievements by attacking his character.   My example wasn't specific to Moss's comments - I had meant in general, sorry if that didn't come across.   I'm also not labelling *any* criticism directed at Hamilton racist, much of it clearly isn't and I share your feelings on this. But, there is quite a lot flak sent in his direction over the gold chain he likes to wear, certain celebrity friends, flat peaked baseball cap, 'hip hop' (i.e. not specifically music but black music), etcetera. I do feel has a racial motivation behind it because, broadly, its highlighting behavior or ways of dressing that are common in the black community but not in others, and the tone of such commentary is always critical.  Equally when you compare the media and fan treatment of Mansell, Hill and Button (basically national treasures in this country) with the way Hamilton is spoken about the contrast is quite stark. Hamilton is arguably the most successful British racing driver ever to have hit an F1 track, yet the validity of his achievements is constantly questioned in a way that other recent British champion's haven't been.   Umm, the owners were Bruce McLaren and Bruce McLaren. In fact the first McLaren cars to appear in orange were their CanAm series cars, although they did make some customer cars for the series.      The point is that such things are used as a form of criticism of Hamilton, as /u/jimbodeeny demonstrated above when he said:  Probably something more like a racing driver Dan Blizerian than #blessed hip hop star Hamilton.  This kind of thing wouldn't be said in the same way about a white driver, its being used as a 'dog whistle' for less pleasant language and is clearly racially motivated.   Damon Hill, for example, played guitar with George Harrison and Def Leopard while he was driving, in fact he appeared on the opening track of Def Leopard's 'Demolition Man' album. He and Eddie Jordan regularly played music together at post race events - this was never used as criticism at the time or since.   Schumacher [did not like Alonso](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2010/03/alonso-and-schumacher-renew-hostilities/) but respected him as a competitor.   Completely agree.   Yeah, it was interesting to learn Ferrari took a new engine for Bahrain. I don't think Mercedes are holding back, they're still learning the tyres and there is only so much power you can use at high temperature/humidity tracks without creating deficits elsewhere. RBR won with a relatively underpowered engine.   Yep. Its not good, and it makes me very sad.   My grandparents lived into their mid-nineties and didn't say or believe things like this. Age doesn't make it acceptable to be sexist or racist - in my experience people who were remain so in old age.   Its good PR, makes some noise and collects a few column inches.   Nasr already has two junior championships a 2nd and two 3rds under his belt - those are better junior results than Rosberg (2 championships and one 2nd), and only one junior championship adrift of Schumacher (3 championships, one 2nd, one 3rd) at the same stage.  Yet he gets branded a pay driver?   Its the 'it's ok for old people to be a bit racist' argument.   But it isn't.   He's not dumb and he knows what he's saying is a long way out of touch with modern Britain.   In sheer terms of the number of F1 driver records held, the only people ahead of Hamilton (52) are Schumacher (100) and Vettel (72).   He's already eclipsed Clark (36), Senna (37), Lauda (16), Prost (42), Mansell (29), Stewart (14), Fangio (37), Ascari (20), Hill (5), Hkkinen (17), Alonso (46) and many more.   If that doesn't make him one of the great drivers of the sport then I don't know what does.    Yep. To be honest I'm disappointed in him, every time Moss opens his mouth on Lewis or women in motor racing something crass comes out.   When people like the English Defence League are putting your quotes on T-Shirts you should wonder if your views aren't a little out of touch.    "In those days we were proud to be English. It's different now, there's probably only about ten million of us Englishmen left. All the others have come in here from God knows where....."  On women in motorsport:  "We've got some very strong and robust ladies, but, when your life is at risk, I think the strain of that in a competitive situation will tell when you're trying to win. The mental stress I think would be pretty difficult for a lady to deal with in a practical fashion. I just don't think they have aptitude to win a Formula 1 race."    That happened [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/34szhw/arrivabene_why_do_i_need_hamilton_when_i_have/)   Being in a development program doesn't relieve young drivers of the need to bring sponsors with them into the program, or into teams at higher levels in the sport.    Lauda did the same thing!            I agree. Team principal of his own F2 outfit at 26, and the most experienced team leader in the sport today. Always interesting to listen to what he has to say on matters.   22 years. Interestingly it was Emerson Fittipaldi that bought his personal sponsor Philip Morris to the the team and thats what led to the Marlboro McLaren livery and all that history.      Amazingly McLaren only used this livery for [four seasons](http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/blog/alan-henry/changing-face-mclaren-f1-car-liveries/) - yet its stuck in the fan consciousness.  The colour scheme was shortlived: McLaren only ran in orange F1 livery between 1968 and 1971, incorporated a notional orange streak into its Yardley-liveried cars of 72 and 73 and phased it out completely when Emerson Fittipaldi brought the full red-and-white might of Philip Morris Tobacco onboard when he joined for 1974.       I thought he'd just lost the back on the straight, maybe hit some oil or a less grippy part of the track. As you say, odd.  Stunningly lucky marshall.      The more people know, the less happy they are. The curse of the information age.   Alcohol. Actually very common at the time, but has some [extreme downsides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku7TdLeEGsQ)   You get that you're actually costing the teams money, not Bernie? He only has a 5% share, even the controlling interest amounts to less than 35% profit share.  60% of all FOM revenue goes to the teams, which last year amounted to around $1.2 billion net.   Cost 20, since I'm already paying 200 a year to watch the races, i threw down. I'm pleased with the results, its far from perfect, but a lot better than anything else Sky has to offer.   If you subscribed then it works on your tablet and phone, just hit restore subscription on your other device.   No, both driver and marshall survived. Bloody lucky the pair of them.   I seem to have created a monster.       I feel the same way about Bottas as I do about Magnussen, I just don't see them as contenders, their results on track don't seem to justify the hype.   Anyone want to fill me on the cause of all the fandom?   The [video isn't any less terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1pJo3sLpVk) than the photos.  Only yesterday I was pointing out that of the 29 regular drivers that started the 1968 season alongside Jacky Ickx, 13 died racing or testing in the 7 or 8 years that followed (though only a few in F1). Driving was a brutal career in those days.  They were: McLaren, Rindt, Clark, Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.  In May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, when he lost control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered an S-turn when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It impacted a light pole and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, gasoline leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the gas tank exploded after Bandini had been pulled away from the Ferrari.  Bandini's burns were extensive, with third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body. The worst burns were on his arms and legs with slight burns on his face. Doctors were forced to wait for twenty-four to forty-eight hours before resolving to move Bandini to a hospital in Lyon, France, which specialized in the treatment of burns. Other options considered, by the doctors, were flying in skin grafts from Italy or a specialist burns unit team from East Grinstead in England. The burns caused severe lesions. He also sustained a chest wound and ten chest fractures.  Three days later, Bandini succumbed to his injuries. He died at Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. There were concerns about the promptness of Bandini's rescue. However, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May "that the security operation had functioned properly." The straw bales, having been banned from all Formula 1 races in response to the accident, were replaced by an extended guard-rail the following year.  Bandini was buried in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended the funeral.   Thank you, I've fixed that!    Mercedes dropping away, or other teams catching up on their development depending on how you view it, in general thats the long term effect of the rule changes on the engineering side. There is basically one or two good ways to get the best out of x rule inside x car concept, and the competition is to see who can find and balance that against the rest of the car more quickly.  According to legend Hamilton was convinced by the factory tour, just as Alonso was by the same thing at Honda. Both appear have felt the engineering commitment sufficient to put them in contention for wins.  30 odd years watching says you can never count Ferrari out (for the first time in those years I have a positive view of Ferrari), and they appear to be on track for a good 2016. Personally I don't take the potential move seriously - but you never know.   Schumacher, Hamilton, Alonso, Button and a whole lot more all went to teams less successful than their previous one. Its not about the current season its about the next 3 - 5 years.  Also its Ferrari, even Hamilton said that only a fool wouldn't consider driving for the most successful team in F1 history, no matter the circumstances.  - Schumacher to Ferrari (Ferrari 3rd, Benetton 2nd in 1995) - Hamilton to Mercedes ~~(Mercedes 4th, McLaren 2nd in 2011)~~ (Mercedes 5th, McLaren 3rd in 2012) - Alonso to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Renault 1st in 2006) - Button to McLaren (McLaren 3rd, Brawn 1st in 2009)   Tell that to Seb, and Schumacher. But you're missing the point of what I said.   Neither is more important than the other. If you want to watch a spec series, there are plenty to choose from.      I'm really looking forward to this race, especially as its around the corner. Nice price too.   I don't know. I wonder if they need to go back to the car concept drawing board, 2014 seems to have wrong footed them, its easy to blame the power unit, but their problems are self evidently more than skin deep.   The engine installation seems to be off, mapping, brakes, balance, the car seems to be a dog. I also have to say that IMO the attitude of the team management is helping their cause at all, and it may be time for a change.  I do hope that you're right though.   Absolutely, but it appears to me that its the power delivery rather than than the bhp that is the real difference. Merc had by far the best power unit in the two years preceding 2014, but didn't have the chassis to match it. But they were focussing on 2014 and little else.  I'm not counting RBR out in the slightest and I believe they'll get a lot out of the B spec car, but I don't think they'll be racing at the front because of it. Will certainly enjoy finding out though.   I disagree. Even now, after 14 years driving, Kimi is one of the fastest drivers in the business, and has driven 40+ of the fastest laps ever achieved in F1 races - he deserves his seat.   One year of bad performance doesn't erase his career. Especially when you consider he's racing three drivers who hadn't even hit puberty when he first got into F1.   I've sat through the same [expletive deleted] arguments about Hill/Schumacher, Mansell/Hill, Hill/Coulthard, Prost/Senna and dozens of other driver competitions and team pairings.   You don't get to be a four time WDC winner and beat Webber consistently by accident.  Seb is a great driver, and I'm having a lot of fun watching he and Kimi race.    Indeed - that's what I mean - it appears that Ferrari chose to invest their time and money in other parts of the car rather than chase the short nose. You'd have to say that decision paid off for them.    According to your underlying theory Seb couldn't handle a bad car and his results suffered (which was still 5th in the WDC, not shabby at all by anyone's standards), but Riccardo could drive the same bad car to success because he's the better driver.  Hows that theory working out for you this season?    I'll bet Ferrari are holding their updates until after Monaco - the package they have right now seems well optimised for the hotter races and could do very well there, especially with their excellent cooling setup.   Interestingly Ferrari don't seem [bothered by the short nose](http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/story/_/id/12622228/james-allison-explains-ferrari-nose-design). Red Bull were having issues with the crash tests and, I guess, built the car with that kind of nose in mind. Perhaps that's why they're expecting such large gains from it. Ferrari seem to created have a different car concept entirely, rather than investing a lot of staff time into a crash tests and such.  I do wonder if there wasn't a price elsewhere on the RBR car for getting the short nose done.               Livery change confirmed. Hello Jennifer.            I'd left Hulme out only because he lived to an age, even though he died racing, he survived his era so-to-speak.   Obviously you're correct. I'd tried to phrase it so it was clear-ish (i.e. racing or testing without qualifying the series) that relatively few died in F1 cars but didn't succeed! It was commonplace, even expected, in that era to drive in multiple series though.   Its an awful list, and that was just one season's drivers, almost all were dead before 1975. Sad.   I bet it's ultra contemporary , non cluttered  [Nope](http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/ron-dennis-house/view/bing/) more castle like.   That's because SAP is a team sponsor, but they're one of a shrinking number, and only three of 10 teams on the grid have a title sponsor right now (Sahara don't count as they own 40% of the team).  What SAP specifically get is proof their cloud solution works in one of the worlds most data intensive professions, and their competitors in that field, Microsoft, also sponsor F1 extensively. But SAP's real involvement is with McLaren Technology group and their F1 and road car computer systems.  However none of that is what we're talking about at all. Sponsors are increasingly funding younger drivers as a low cost, high value, route into the sport. Santander for example funded young Alonso - he took their personal sponsorship to McLaren (and left them there, where they picked up Button), and to Ferrari, where he again left them. Maldonado bought in PDVSA who are major sponsors of his old team and new one. Teams very often give slots on the car to drivers management to place, and increasingly so.   Most of the drivers that competed alongside him died that way, in that era you had less than 40% shot at surviving your racing career. Many successful drivers walked away after a WDC win, not wanting to chance their luck any further.  Ickx, started in F1 1968. Of the 29 drivers that completed more than one race in that season 13 died racing or testing in the years that followed - 46% of them. They were McLaren, Rindt, Clark, ~~Hill,~~ Solana, Schlesser, Rodrguez, Spence, Scarfiotti, Bianchi, Siffert, Bonnier, Courage, and Moser.   Edit: As /u/meowlong points out, not all of these drivers were killed in F1, but its worth saying that this is because it was commonplace at the time to race in multiple series. This isn't a comment on F1 safety specifically.   Yeah. Its tricky to find pictures because most of the race photos are black and white or so grainy the grey/silver looks white. But I beleive thats him!   Here's a shot of [Fangio driving the Mercedes W196](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One#/media/File:Gro%C3%9Fer_Preis_von_Europa_-1954_N%C3%BCrburgring,_Juan_Manuel_Fangio,_Mercedes_(3)x.JPG) in the 1954 German Grand Prix. Fangio won two drivers championships with the team.  The 'Silver Arrows' name came from their domination of the old Grand Prix series in the 1930s, and they entered F1 in 1954 with Fangio switching from Maserati to join the team and immediately dominated the 54' and 55' seasons winning everything in sight. Sterling Moss partnered Fangio in 1955.  This should also sound familiar, past is prologue for Mercedes!  Sadly it was the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that [went airborne and killed 79](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMoh5hZAaZk) people after hitting the back of Lance Macklin's Austin-Healey at the 1955 Le Mans, their Magnesium Alloy body work increasing the severity of the post accident fire. The crash wasn't their fault, but they took the hit for it, and withdrew from all motorsport afterwards.   He can, but most vary rather than change.   If you think that drivers have nothing to do with sponsors then you simply haven't been paying attention to how the sport actually works in this era. The whole point of sponsoring young drivers is to gain entry along with them to the top level of motorsport.   Yes you can. Changing liveries is connected to sponsors, which funds more and better development, ergo liveries do have an impact on performance.   I highly doubt it. Project 4 bought the McLaren team rather than the other way around, plus when you look back at the logos through the years its clear where the chevron came from   [This car](http://www.historyofmotorsport.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/lemans-1966.jpg)    Who owns the Hill helmet config?  Damon Hill - which is the point. The sport needs to improve driver branding, because that's the main method by which sponsors are coming to the sport these days.  It's ridiculous no matter what excuse you use.  Only if you have no idea how marketing actually works and how sponsors are coming to the sport.    More people does not equal better work or more productivity, in fact the adding more people just delays projects further. See the [The Mythical Man-Month](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month).   It does today, but not [originally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery).   They [altered the meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery) after Malboro left the team to McLaren Project Four, but it originally meant Marlboro Project Four (I beleive Marlboro funded the chasis development).  Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg)   Nope, that's failing to understand what Ron actually said.  Why would the team go *back* to a livery that they have barely used in the modern era, in fact a livery that they only used for two years, and has little association with the team for most fans - what would it get them?   Even now their current logo is a [stylised version of the Marlboro Chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg) - because that's what they're most remembered for.  However, most people now associate the team with the silver/grey livery so they made a decision to stick with it and add in some Honda branding, the black appears to have been part of a deal with Johnnie Walker or SAP that fell through looking at their previous sponsor branding. But really the whole thing was a message to Honda and to sponsors - we're willing to change it, but you need to get on board and pay us in order to do so.  FYI the silver colour is for Mercedes, West's branding always appears on a white background.   Nope. They want drivers to have the same helmets because the drivers are the driving force behind team sponsorship these days (Alonso brought Santander in, Maldonado PDVSA, Hamilton got Bombardier and IWC in the door, Will Stevens has the sponsor slots at Manor).   Basically the driver's 'brands' have become more important to the sport than the team brands and one thing F1 can do to support that is increase the association between drivers and their helmets thus strengthening their brands. Fixed driver numbers is a tilt at the same thing.   I find the commentary a bit difficult, always seems so casual to me compared to F1.   Can you give me the 101 on what a superspeedway is exactly - I've never really understood the track types.   If you like big numbers then this is the way to go, but it won't solve any of the problems that the sport actually has - only make them worse.   At no point in F1's history has that ever been true. 137 official constructors since 1950, and only 10 remain. The vast majority of F1 teams are there surviving. The median average F1 team competes in 20 races for three seasons, uses 5 drivers, wins no races and scores no points.   That livery was really the result of the Marlboro sponsorship - even the MP4 designation meant Marlboro Project Four at the time.  Project Four was Ron Dennis's old team, he did a reverse takeover of McLaren.  Edit: Downvoters, [you're wrong about this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren#Sponsorship.2C_naming_and_livery), the meaning was altered after Marlboro left the team. Even today the Mclaren logo is a stylised version of the [Marlboro chevron](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--usxchzXG--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18z0w45eftossjpg.jpg)         Love the attitude from Claire - every inch her father's daughter.               We came close to doing that in 1994 - banned all of the traction and driver aids that 'purist' fans said were ruining the racing, and had little in the way of meaningful aero - look what happened.   Sincerely, the cars were simply too quick and powerful to be controllable in general, and even modestly safe when something went wrong. Senna's death disguises a [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSI27en56tg) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yUxMLIbtIk) [terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xumw9c5j-3A) [accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd-nSWjdpHI) and on track [incidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxMtYyNZ6Q) during 1994 that are rarely talked of anymore. The pit lane speed limits, and downforce reduction measures we see today all came from that season's racing.  "Its going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesnt happen." - Ayrton Senna, during the 94' pre-season.  The 94' season left two drivers dead, one in a coma, one seriously injured marshall, five injured spectators, and a seriously injured ferrari mechanic.   There never has been a period in F1's history where anything resembling unlimited racing occurred.      Button to Mercedes confirmed ;o)               Frankly I'm not the one being a dick about it and straight downvoting other people's posts every day. If you have a problem with what I'm posting or the way I'm posting it then contact the mods, otherwise just move along and read someone else's content.  But personally I'm very tired of hearing from you, you're *not* the content police.   Its only a repost if you don't actually *read* the article, which you routinely don't.    But apparently I'm going through another /u/musef1 bitching phase. Nevermind, I can't be arsed with bitches today.  /get off my lawn   There were 4 other 180 mph crashes at Tamburello in the years leading up to Senna's crash - all drivers survived with the worst injury being a severe concussion. Its a flat out corner with a river behind it, hence the concrete wall. Arguably the severity of Bergers crash foreshadowed Senna's but all of the crashes involved some kind of technical failure, and all look very similar.  - [Piquet 87'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLyAKkeA25Q);  - [Patrese 92'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCcf_aTuldY) ;  - [Berger 89'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVxnkaqqO2c);  - [Alboreto 91'](http://flatoutcombr.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/alboretocrash.jpg).   Which is all by way of saying that Senna crash led to F1 managing downforce and thereby speed, but all of that was really a consequence of the driver aids ban. In many important respects the FW14B remains the most technically advanced F1 car ever created.  Both deaths led to the HANS device as they were both on a [long list of drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HANS_device#History) that sustained basilar skull fractures. Senna's death wasn't caused by the skull fracture though.  	197
 We have to use the damn red ones with ovals. But I make circles anyways.   Good luck getting a scantron on an Algebra 2 test. No where to show your work.   So there is no HB #3 pencil?    Ultimate. I don't *really* know what I'm doing so I just stand in our goal and wait til my team throws it at me. Then I catch it.  Thanks~ I really surprised myself with it!   I was thinking (instead of catching frisbees) about support. From others. I started to relate it to a bed of nails. Have you ever laid on one? It's painless (unless your hair gets caught!). Why? Because there are so many nails to rely on. Think of your supports, whether drawing, or a friend, or a sibling, destroying bubblewrap, painting, whatever those supports are that stop you from self harming at that moment, as the nails in the nail bed. It REALLY hurts to lay on just one nail alone, and if the bed of nails is just in the sky, you will fall without support. The more you have, the better and easier it is. I'm getting somewhere with this. And where I'm going is, find something. Some type of support for yourself. You can talk to someone, draw, sing, listen to music, or do something silly like wear as many shoes as possible then make noises, it doesn't matter! If it stops you from hurting yourself or others, do it! I'd like to find someone who went to the ER for drawing their cat as the Mona Lisa.   * **TL;DR:** The more nails (supports) you have, the less it hurts.    1: I think they wear clothes underneath them, like a skirt or pants and a dress shirt.  2: I've always thought they open in front, but then again it's right and left with robes and cloaks with me.  3: I think the plain robes are a requirement for first years, as your crest and colors get added once you're sorted.  4: Maybe the hoods attach? I think it might be the cloaks that have a hood.    I actually agree with this a ton. Harry was quite the asshole in the last book. Ron and Hermione were *constantly* trying to help and instead of contributing to the suggestions they gave him, he decided to do what he wanted and argued with them about why they were wrong. We get it Harry, you have no family. No need to start all of the angst so soon. Leave it in the fanfiction please.   I spent the past 15 or so trying to click on it.    Today I realized I missed the signups for ALL of the secret santas!   Other than that I've spent the past fifteen minutes trying to catch the snitch, I actually ended up seeing Dumbledore in a new light going for round two of the books. I was completely with Snape when he said Dumbledore had practically raised Harry like a pig for slaughter. I don't know if I didn't see it the first time because of all of that Dumbledore sparkle or what, but it took a second reading of the whole series and some movie watching to see how that worked.      This is an exquisite list. Shall definitely use some of these!   If the people that email your kids get an email notification that you receive a copy of the messages, she could have been fully aware of this, and secretly seeking adult help. Going incognito like this is one of the easier and quieter ways of screaming for help.    He's a bit of an ass about it, but for some people, the guilt trip works. If a celebrity went and made a video like this, the world would be all over it. Some people have a tough form of caring, and I think this guy has that. But it doesn't work to 'just stop'. Just stop smoking. Hell, just stop breathing. Forever. Not that easy, is it?   Thanks; I try not to listen to him. He's never been one to 'understand' what's going on with his kids until it directly affects him, and even then it's  more understanding that things aren't happy for him.    Craft stores. Dat smell.    Snape was an asshat to Harry because he was an asshat to everybody. It would be odd if suddenly Snape bowed down to the Gryffindor King. Snape's character is just pretty damn bitter towards life I guess, and I can see why.   I got it for free more as a "if I like this shit I'll buy the game" type of thing. I don't want to spend $25 on a game I don't like or  is only mildly interesting. I'm too lazy to print it too.   That's my plan.   I've been told that by my dad when I tried to tell my parents I was depressed. All I got out of it was that I was a 'self centered attention seeking fuck'. It definitely doesn't help the situation.    A blood bomb is when you period decides to do a surprise attack and BAM. Red hurricane.   Personally, I don't like how everything that was easily accessible in the sidebar previously is now moved to an almost hidden location.   I'll give them a try! I've been trying to read more than just posts on the internet anyways~    It is well written, I just can't get into it; it's not my genre. I prefer science-fiction and action.   18-20. This won't be a fun night.   Study for a math test, a TON of worksheets, 3 chapters of To Kill A Mockingbird, a worksheet on Stalin, and a lab report. Yay. On the bright side, I've still got twelve hours or so.    I've started studying and ended up drawing all over a page of my textbook-luckily it was in pencil.    This was wonderful. I may not be able to relate to the bloody chair, but blood bombs, most definitely. And the worst is when they happen on the ONE day you don't wear a liner.    Only protection I have is Atheism. But all these religious people in my house are going to screw me over some how.    My bathroom has one on every wall. So in order to turn on the light you see at least 3. Fuck.    Now...how in the hell do I tell more people than there are in r/nosleep? GONEWILD.   Davey. Wavey. He is an expert in all things gay-yes. Eyes is the best way. OOR you could stalk them. I find that a fun method~   I had a [horrible] friend that was homeschooled. She entered public school in 7th grade. Bad move. Her social skills were HORRIBLE. As in, she had her own cell phone, but left it at home (which was across the street from school) so she would use one of our cell phones. I'm fine letting my friends use my phone if their's is dead, they don't have one, or they forgot it that day. But she does it intentionally. She also had a bad habit of being...stuck up? Nosy? Acted like she was better and knew more because she skipped a grade. Not to mention, all of the times I have invited her over, she never slept over. Once she had a mattress to herself, a lamp on, all the pillows and blankets necessary, and then insisted on turning a fan on (in October!). Two of us were already sharing a mattress and one was on a pile of blankets, so we were ticked. Then she left at about 11 to which we were all happy. Sorry if this seemed more like a rant, and I could go on, but from my experiences, many of the homeschool (even private school) students I've met have not been pleasant. I have met a total of one homeschool student that was nice, but she also has been in sports, therefore, interacting.   4. Feelin awesome. This test knows what it's doing.   I actually have a black one of these. It's fun to walk around town with my phone stuffed in my pocket and talking on this.       Emma changed the most.   Slamming it shut is another great solution.   I believe it! I'm not grossed out easily, but sometimes the smell of what we're working with is just horrid.    My sister announces her shit status to her boyfriend rather openly. They have been together for well over a year so I think things are going well.    I don't know if it's the brush or what, but the last one looks awesome. Glad you found a good outlet!   The hour before lunch is always the longest. And I have Biology before lunch, so if we do a particularly gross lab that day, appetite gone until *right* after lunch.   GRELL! Would not have minded for a second had Grell sat on me~   [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS1uDnIPTvo) Is always fucking hilarious.   I don't recite the Pledge. I can't remember the last time I did. I don't like pledging my 'allegiance' to a country that I'll probably end up moving out of when I'm older. When we analyzed the Pledge in US History, I realized that it's a bit odd to be having kindergartners learning that.    Thank you~   Thanks~! I do love Transformers~   I like the new logo...wish I'd hovered over it earlier!   What I love about it is thinking of what you could do in a Cyberpunk society. It's so much more fun.    No problem~! I can't keep these awesome pictures to myself when I find them!   The download button on DA gives the highest resolution available.    What is the point of going to one of these events?      I'm in high school taking Principles of Engineering (Project Lead The Way) and the big semester project that we're doing is an interview of an engineer in the field. I don't know any engineers personally, so if anyone is willing to help, that would be awesome! There aren't too many questions, just about engineering. All of them are on the sheet (pictures). Anyone who volunteers, no personal information will be shared (except my teacher of course)!

Just gonna have to wait things out! (Too bad we can't start our own LGBT colony!)   Okay, thanks!   How does this 'everything free' work? I don't see anything about it on the site. Am I lost?   What if the straps were to snap?   Grazie!   Know what else is weird? Bible fanfiction. I'm not so much shocked that it exists as that there's so much of it...   You're not alone. I might be a bit more skilled if it actually snowed soon...   I think I'll just stick to bitching at people with words...to stay on the safe side.   Thanks! And I'm good with any gender~   Thanks~!      And people say Reddit is a waste of time..   I'm American and didn't realize how much I loved Twinkies until I had a meltdown at in the store at the empty shelf with the announcement taped on.    Sup.      I've been sick with that cold/flu mutant too, and I know those feels. But I've been at home...thank you for brightening my day though~   If this has turned into a game, then yes. I am in as well.   I remember watching the first movie with fascination with my mom. My friend and I went to the theater to watch the last one and it took every atom in my body not to let the feels out.    Oh...SuFin is so sweet! It's good to know I'm not the only Hetalian here! And this comic is awesome even to people who don't know anything about Hetalia...has an awesome message.    That's okay. I accidentally smacked my friend's kitten in the face. I tend to talk with my hands a bit. It cuddled in forgiveness though~    You copied and pasted every single one? Thank you for saving me (and the rest of us) the time and frustration. Too bad they went so fast though.    I love this theory...but sadly, it cannot be.    You sir, deserve a trophy.   XD Hitler vagina! I can sadly relate to a TON of these. As do most females. Now we get to see how many admit it. This is what happens when women get their own thread...   I keep  HUGE supply of tampons and liners in my backpack and sometimes a random girl (or one I hate) will ask me for one in the locker room. I've got plenty to share and I know that feel.    I thought of that position too..         Ching Chime-Serj Tankian   You may want to block your name out of the corner.    A local Sendiks. They were going on about Leroy Butler burgers and such for the year anniversary.    Yes, they are quite good burgers. But I was still shocked that she stood in line for an hour when she could have made them probably better in less time. I then realized just how American my parents were when my dad proceeded to explain how they're related to football.   The only thing I can think of when I hear Special K is Disco Bloodbath.   	89

Please correct me if I'm wrong (and I'm sure I probably have miscalculated!) but just going off some basic info I found in a swift google search the mass of the sun is so much greater than the mass of the orbiting planets that it is still possible to say 'the planets orbit the sun' as the '*barycentre*' would have to be at some slightly off centre point in the sun itself.   Its on youtube!   The popular theory that Hitler snubbed Owens isn't strictly true. Hitler only congratulated German athletes but reportedly admired Owens.   Source: QI   [Irony!](http://imgur.com/ma1ZVvT.gif)   "what are you doing in my house?!" Nosey bastards!   I actually have fictional breasts!    This entire Wiki page has 3 references, 2 of which are from IMDb!! Hitler being such a significant historical figure, the amount of conjecture and fairy-tales about him is naturally huge.   I am going to call this as untrue as it is simply too fanciful, unlikely given Hitlers continued mobility and reported sound health until his death in 1945, and due to insufficient evidence.    I have a similar story. I travelled solo around the world when I was 18 and spend 3 months travelling around South East Asia. I completely randomly met the same two guys (who were travelling together) in three different countries: first in Hanoi, Vietnam then Vang Vieng in Laos and finally I randomly bumped into them on the Khao San Road in Bangkok! True story!!   Sounds brilliant until gradually people start disappearing one by one. Haven't you even seen Ghost Rig?!   As you are exploring the bowls of the ship your flashlight picks something up at the end of the corridor. You do a double take and shine your light on it and you see a young girl dressed in Victorian clothing, just standing at the end of the corridor. You call out but no response. Suddenly, into the silence, the bulkhead door slams deafeningly shut behind you! You spin around to see what happens. From a short distance away you hear a child's laugh, echoing eerily in the damp ship. You point your flashlight back down the corridor.   The girl is gone.   I did History GCSE and A level, pretty sure the Revolutionary War was only discussed a couple of times. Frankly the American Revolution, though I fully understand its significance to Americans, just isn't that significant when put in perspective of the rest of British history. I mean think about it, Britain was *the* super-power for a lot of recent history with an empire that covered a quarter of the globe. There is a lot of history there! Losing India was far more historically significant than the American War.       I can understand the nope. Personally I would say "[FUCK YEAH](http://imgur.com/RiEsEUI)!!"   "I thought I could smell tuna-fish around her...O SHIT ITS A TRAP!!"   Bloody Asian-Americans   Onions?! It's 4:30am in France, go to bed!!!   This sounds like a poor excuse. All the previous Popes for centuries did the job until death, ergo they were all in poor health eventually! When you think along those lines poor health is a very pitiful excuse so I think there is a larger game afoot here   It sounds like a cool title, but it was basically just another Pope who wanted some of the existing popes power. It was basically the first schism church. A big deal at the time but now there a millions as theres more money and influence to be made in starting your own church than joining one   Might be considered pedantic, but it wasn't just boys. He helped to cover up the systematic sexual abuse, rape and torture of children and successfully protected the scum that committed the crimes   Surely the whole point of being religious is you are too afraid to say YOLO?   [This meme has never been more appropriate!](http://imgur.com/WelcGBk.jpg)   [This is probably the only time I will ever be able to use this meme!](http://imgur.com/WelcGBk)   I think the question you meant to ask is 'Which song is the best, THE BEST, THE BEST, THE BEST, THE BEST, THE BEST THE BEST, THE BEST...'   Hi there Dave!  First off, thanks for doing this AMA! My question is when are you guys going to come back to Auckland?? Would kick ass to see you guys at the Town Hall again!  Also, can we expect any more drum collaborations coming up? Can't wait to hear the new Queens album!  Keep kicking ass!   How's your day going?   You're right, it not Monty Python. I believe it will be called '*The Peoples Popular Front of Pythons by and of The Name of Monty and/or Montgomery.*'   Monty Python... bloody splitters!   Robin Williams to replace Graham Chapman? Interesting idea although I'm amazed its even being considered! As I understand it Cleese refused to consider Python returning after Chapman died, quite rightly in my opinion! Maybe they think Williams is up for the job, watch this space!   Just for the record, they did built Hobbiton for real, to human scale (obviously) and after finishing filming for 'The Hobbit' they have left it all there. Its near Matamata, New Zealand. You can visit but I'm pretty sure you cant buy Bag End.   I also learned right handed, partly for this reason. The buggeration is it makes playing rhythmic patters more difficult as the right hand has to do all the rhythmic work which is just wrong for a lefty. Thats why I can't play 'All My Life' and sing at the same time.   I assume this was before you were with her? Did she tell you or did you find out later?   I quite enjoy my unholy embrace with satan! Free underfloor heating!   I am a lefty and a musician. It is *very* irritating that for a decent guitar a lefty has to pay at least twice the normal price.   More accurately, the Quran (and pretty much all other holy books) is extremely ambiguous and open to many different interperitations. Some choose to be dogmatic, some chose to enterperate their text litterally, and even then there are litteral variations due to arabic being a highly ambiguious written language.  People of all faiths vary in how dogmatic they choose to be. Islam is no different and certainly no more creditable. This particular example recalls to me the old debates of the length of angels wings or how many such mythical creatures could dance on the head of a pin. It is pure drivel, it is an example of how totalitarian religion tries to fill every aspect of an individuals life. Is it so difficult to think on these issues objectively, without the crutch of religion?   Did he ever get that horse?   Wondered why that link was already blue, then I realised its linked to my Imgur account. Cheeky bastard!   Someone was pedantic on the internet?! Fetch my cup of RAGE!!!   I assume you are not of that opinion, as it is so mind-blowingly stupid.   I hesitate to even respond as that is some of the stupidest words I have even seen written down. I assume you are being sarcastic. Healthcare is unconstitutional  Seriously? Free healthcare for all is unconstitutional? You realise how stupid that is? Obama has had to be fighting idiots like you every step of the way with getting his healthcare system sorted, I don't think its political. Maybe its because anyone with half a brain cell realises that something is quite disgustingly broken when a family can't afford to heal, when a fatal illness like cancer might just cost you your house as well as your loved one.   cost  Lets just lump that altogether shall we. You are more concerned about how much your government pays on healthcare than how much your family pays? How much would it cost if, heaven forbid, your sister got cancer, or your father was in a car crash. It could bankrupt you, for services that actually cost those providing them pennies. They charge so much simply because they can, because you privatised your medical healthcare. Even in England, where we have a choice between public or private, private healthcare costs a bare fraction of what you pay (our private healthcare system is called BUPA) You are extorted simply because years ago your entire healthcare was privatised and the drug companies have had carte blanche ever since. You are literally being made an offer you can't refuse, if you have seen The Godfather.  You're last point is so stupid I'm not going to address it, basically you are saying "government bad, grrr!" whatever.   Sarcasm best works when its not written down genius!   ...Or any western country that isn't America.   You clearly are American and have no concept of freedom, as Americans have measurably less personal freedoms than any other western country yet go on about it the most.   As a gentleman of the Queens realm: I concur!!   It is funny how American and Canadian women fall in love instantly with my accent!   I still don't understand why Americans actually fight against universal healthcare. It is just another level of stupid to not see that the US's medical system is utterly fucked. I think you chaps need some perspective.

For the record this is a mother and calf Humpback, I have some experience of these beautiful and intelligent creatures but nothing like this! Truly awesome!   The wind can move very fast.   I answered a few other questions about money, have a browse of this thread, it should be useful if you're planning some travels!   1. All told the trip cost about 7000 GBP, I worked from the moment I was 16 until I was 18 to save up enough.   2. Finding a cheap flight is just a matter of looking, try flight comparison websites or apps like Skyscanner etc. The cheapest places to travel are out of the western world. South East Asia and South America are good, India and Africa are very cheap but absolutely not for everyone, you may not like it.  3. The best places I went were Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Nepal and Mount Everest Base Camp.   4. See question 1.   "My Kingdom for a horse!"   Bits of that are true, but not all. Edward VIII did abdicate so he could marry Wallace Simpson, however he couldn't marry her as king more because of the scandal it would cause rather than actually breaking any rules. That and he was a Nazi sympathiser. Remember the Church of England was basically created so that Henry VIII could divorce his wife, the entire Church is founded on the family values of Henry VIII.  Either way, the reason for his abdication don't really matter, the fact is that the abdication forced George VI to take the throne making Elizabeth the Heir Apparent at the age of 10.   The fact that barely anyone in Britain knows any of this shows just how much no one gives a toss.   Not true. Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to make his younger brother, George VI (Elizabeth's father) king. By the breakout of war in Europe in 1939 Elizabeth was the heir apparent to the throne. She never left England during the war.    I'm not sure the elephants might have the dexterity for some of the reaches in the piece!

[Wait, What the fumble-fucks am I seeing here?](http://imgur.com/lNrcxRP)   Mekong Whiskey. Seriously bad idea to drink it, it is made exclusively for tourists so they don't care what goes in it, they can be highly toxic. If you drank it recently, go throw up. I am not kidding.  Disclaimer: I worked in SE Asia for a time, [here is a picture I took of Mekong Whiskey.](http://imgur.com/6A78txp)   I remember that. I believe the sign now above the gate is a replica isn't it? I went in 2007, it was disturbing to see that thing in real life, knowing how many poor souls had marched under it and how cruel those words would seem   I feel you are being a little over fair here. Judging by that article (that article being my only sauce of information on this) this organisation did a great deal for these people, such as already paying down $700,000 and building infrastructure on the island to help them gain more income for themselves, with the plan to keep paying these payments in chuncks, if that article is accurate. These are not cave-people and I don't think they would thank you for the comparison. They live in the modern world where capitol is important and communication with the rest of the world is prevalent.   And yet if you lived your life off deer and someone told you to stop hunting...  Deer are not the equivalent of dolphins. Deer are relatively very unintelligent and are a natural prey animal to most carnivorous species, including humans. Despite this they are plentiful and breed well. Dolphins have demographic language, social groups, use tools and hunt in packs, they are exceptionally intelligent and their brain to body ratio estimates them to be very close to human intelligence. They suffer acutely if attacked and are not nearly as abundant as deer. I am not saying one animal is more valuable than the other, however one is natural pray and is probably too unintelligent to suffer acutely, the other is rare and highly intelligent and suffers acutely.  As I say, we are not dealing with a time warp, these are not cave people who must hunt to save their families. They are members of the modern world who can produce their own food without hunting dolphins, as this organisation has been helping them doing. The slaughter of all these creatures, for the sake of a financial dispute is disgusting and despicable and should not be defended. There is no excuse.   That was my TIL! I feel internet famous! My life has validity again!   Granted, these people had obviously been taken for a ride by this charity whom must shoulder at least some of the blame. This is a disgusting and infantile reaction though, and should be met with retribution. I hate to use the word '*savage*' but is exactly what these people have proven to be. If this organisation pays them now, after this, then is an utter failure in logic and stupid. This is nothing more than a toddler smashing a beautiful and precious gift in a tantrum, and should not be met with anything but condemnation. They have forfeited their right to any price or property they were promised, and justly so. If they are punished by lack of funds or whatever was agreed upon for this barbaric act, so be it.   "Defend" being the usual pathetic euphemism used by all modern military. Wouldn't it be a funny world if euphemisms couldn't be used by officials, this headline would be '**Kim vows powerful measures to fuck shit up on behalf of North Korea**'   Fascists, not Communists. Lets call a spade a spade shall we?   Agreed. I have been to Portugal, it kicks ass.   Thats the difference between '*de facto*' and '*du Jure*' legality. Portugal still has some prohibitions, like selling it, that are still punishable. North Korea is the only country that has no restrictions at all.   I say it is '*du jure*' in North Korea as it is the only country that does not prohibit Cannabis possession. There are other countries such as Cambodia and Iran where it is permissible '*de facto*', but still legally punishable      You already posted this with the exact same title several times in the last few months. Reddit remembers. Stop it.   I say it is '*du jure*' in North Korea as it is the only country that does not prohibit Cannabis possession. There are other countries such as Cambodia and Iran where it is permissible '*de facto*', but still legally punishable.   I DONT LIKE CHANGE!!!   Thanks Sickipedia   Thank you!

It's okay to litter because Wombles will clean up after you.      "Back, and to the left."   I knew an old sailor once. He told me he went overboard, tangled in the sails. They pulled him out, but it took him five minutes to cough. He said it was like...going home.  Edit: I once told you about a sailor who described drowning to me. I was lying. He said it was agony.   Slightly interesting that Churchill, though holding high military rank, never grew a moustache. Trivial though it may seem, this would have been highly irregular at the time and probably caused a minor stir.      ...why are you downvoting me? I was attempting to help. If you play an E on a piano, and you play and E on a guitar, and you play an E on a Ukulele you will find they are all the same notes. Yes the Uke is different, that is why its a different instrument. It still uses the same scale of notes as any other instrument.   Fair enough, these are the chords for the guitar, probably a sensible assumption as the song is played on guitar. And the Ukulele is tuned differently, although that makes no difference on what chords go with what song. Think about it.   Good on you! The bike is the least useful though, try rowing! Obviously everything is good, but like I say you need to push yourself hard, especially if you have a lot of weight to lose! If you have shin trouble then all the more reason to get good trainers for the gym!   The chords are completely wrong here. Correct chords:  | E / C#m / G# / A :||  The E is the normal open chord, the other three should all be Barre Chords. I can't be bothered to write down the riff, I shall if reddit insists.   Nice try officer!   It sounds like a total cliche I know, but get a gym pass and force yourself to go at least 3 times a week, 4 if you can. When you are there you need to keep your heart rate high, it depends on your level of general fitness how you do this but it is important to really push yourself to get results. Get yourself a pair of decent trainers for running/walking and make sure you eat correctly, which doesn't mean only eating nasty green things! The important thing is to positively encourage this, so if you go to the gym reward yourself with something you like, although preferably not food. I have also just dropped a load of weight, so have just done all this myself!   You find a way to talk to her face to face and let her know you have feelings for her. If she laughs at you, burn her house down.   I commend your instance on accuracy, so I will attempt to clarify some of these points. The US did bomb a great deal of land in Cambodia which caused obvious disruption to farming, however the real problem was and is land mines. Cambodia and Laos still have an enormous problem with land mines because the US covered huge areas of rural land with them which are still active and still represent an enormous threat to this day. About 1000 people are killed or severely maimed by land mines every year in Cambodia and Laos, I am not exaggerating, a visit to either of these otherwise beautiful countries is enough to impact just how big the problem is. And the US is doing absolutely nothing to help clean up the mess they caused, or prevent the deaths all these people. Only last year did the US start a clean up operation of all the Agent Orange used, if you don't know what it is google it. Kissinger was lucky to escape without a war crimes trial.  As for the execution of prisoners, the Khmer Rouge converted a school in Phnom Penh into the S21 jail. This is were the documented every prisoner held there and on what grounds they were arrested, almost all were 'political prisoners'. There are records and photographs of over a million people. S21 was were many died but most were horrifically tortured, however the 'Killing Fields' as it became know was an area outside Phnom Penh where most were executed. There are enormous mass graves, a room filled with the skulls of victims and a tree is signposted as where small children were thrown against in order to kill them. It is hard to overstate the extent of the evil performed by the Khmer Rouge, but it is certain that they knowingly and deliberately put millions of innocent people to death.   I have also been there, you will probably recall there is a room in Birkenau camp similar to what I described; thousands of pictures of those who died. In that case they were just normal photographs taken of happy, smiling people or couples or whole families with no idea what was in store for them, all of whom perished in the camp. I have never spoken aloud of either of these horrible places I have been, it is simply too painful.   That is the sort of drivel that only the indoctrinated would resort to in a debate, so this shall probably be my last entry. You just confirmed it, the church pushes us mere mortals to be beyond 'human nature'. What a despicable thing to say, surely you can see the faulty logic for yourself? I will repeat my argument, if you believe in the Catholic God you believe in a deity that created us sick, and *commanded* us to be well. Condoms will not cure the virus, nor will they heal those afflicted, but they will prevent millions of otherwise healthy, normal people from contracting the condition and the virus today would a fraction of the epidemic that it is. These are not statistics we are arguing about, these are human lives. Millions of fully aware, fully sentient human beings have died a humiliating, painful death because of the stigma placed on condoms by religious bodies. How can this be the lesser of two evils?   Please, consider the problem for yourself and do your own thinking before regurgitation the garbage you have been dictated in church. You can make your own mind up on these matters, to think for yourself makes us human, to blindly agree makes us cattle. Make your choices.   As someone who has been to Cambodia and the S21 Jail and the mass graves of the killing fields just outside Phnom Penh, I find this extremely moving. It was a horrible experience to visit such evil places, many of the instruments of torture have been left in the jail and most are simply too awful to describe or recall. What is strange and deeply disturbing is the Khmer Rouge documented and photographed every prisoner who lived and died in the S21 Jail, and there is now a room in which all wall space is taken up by pictures of the poor souls who perished. All with this expression of knowing what lay in store for them, all gazing out from every angle. Though the pictures are old and faded, witnessing that much human suffering is truly disturbing and brings a lump to my throat even now, recalling it   I am not refuting that the Catholic church does help those in need, they do spend a great deal on charity as anyone can see. However, it is very easy to argue that the greatest damage to public health in Africa and the responsibility for the miserable and wretched deaths of *millions* of human beings lies squarely at the feet of the Catholic Church's stand on condoms and birth control. It is not a matter of religious vs secularist opinion at all; any rational, objective and moral person in full view of the facts would be appalled by the contraband placed on condoms. Sure, if people did not engage in pre-marital sex the virus would not be such a terrible affliction in the world, but that is not human nature: if any divine creator wished this to be the case he/it/they should have taken time to create a different creature. It is the classic case of mankind being created sick and commanded to be well.  Disclaimer: Please do not assume I am some neck-beard Atheist from /r/atheism having a rant. I am an objective adult and have seen the damage rout by these issues first hand.   I think the Church's stand on Condoms and AIDs in Africa is enough to illustrate the moral bankruptcy and total hypocrisy of this spending. There are many aid organisations that spend great deals of money, often given voluntarily by those who can, on helping those in need. The Church is the only aid organisation that demands anything from those they help, and what they demand is truly adherent, as is any policy that excepts the death of millions to a terrible affliction such as AIDs as the lesser evil. No, The Vatican is no source for good in this world.   Its like someone turned mid-life-crisis into a picture!   You may not, humanity may still have a chance.

    And it doesn't actually work. Torture is not a solution.   Killing Blaine = huge power vacuum. Simple murder is not the solution here.   Maybe he just think it's cooler that way.   Torture doesn't really work. I mean, at least in this scenario they really know he's the one who is doing the bad things, and they have a good idea what those bad things are, but when you torture people they say whatever they can to make you stop and you're stuck with the difficult job of determining which, if any of it, is true.   That's not really the consequences of her cowardice, more like the consequences of Lowell's impetuous stupidity.                                        LOL, no worries. Turns out the actor has a role on a new series, so the odds of him being alive are dropping to zilch. Booo. It's not even a series I'm particularly interested in watching, to add insult to injury here.   Stop ruining my hopes and dreams.   True enough, I suppose.   That's because she didn't know him that well. She had been planning to *marry* Major.   If nothing else, she and Ravi need to sit down and discuss the issue of disclosure, with Ravi pointing out that keeping Major in the dark is putting him in danger.   Thus making the producers the most diabolical supervillains ever.   How do we really know he kept his promise not to tell his sister?  Barry's real problem here is that he gave up his side of the bargain first. If he'd said "I've destroyed the physical evidence, but I won't destroy the digital evidence until after they're in the new place" then things might have turned out differently.   Maybe Cisco has been transgender this whole time. Which would be a remarkable move for a TV show. Really, I'd remark upon it.   Apparently, the only way a test pilot could ever go missing is if he's Hal Jordan, who is the Green Lantern. (Did I get that right?)   No, most likely this is part of his diabolical plan.   He took the train.    Either sex or more money than Barry's got in his account.   Also, the more I think of it - if they can't destroy the future device, can't they blow up the particle accelerator, make the future device useless that way?   Maybe he's not sure either.   True, very true. But look at Ravi. He supports her - and he's known her for much less time than Major has.   We didn't see if it was a headshot.   No. Nobody else noticed that.   Geez, thank goodness I have you guys to go "OMG GREEN LANTERN!" because I would have never known. I mean, I guessed it was a reference to *something*, but I thought it was Arrow-y.   Oh, Major. You're sweet, but so very, very stupid.   Completely lost track of time, watching it now.  1. Poor Eddie looks broken. Aw! Eddie! *hugs*  2. Was that whole convo with the DA just so we could be told "Yup, we know that the prison thing is dubiously ethical *at best*"? (Even with the movie nights.) Because it seems like it was shoehorned in.  3. Maybe I shouldn't, but I really like Snart. I mean, *really*.  4. My goodness, what was it Barry couldn't agree to? Large sums of cash? Weapons? A three day free-for-all? A date with Lisa? A date with *Leonard*? ARGH! I WANNA KNOW!  5. Actually, Snart/Barry would be kinda hot. I mean cool. I mean... you know what I mean. I'll be in my bunk.  6. And you guys all say that *Iris* is pointlessly emotional. Mind, I'd be pretty upset by that revelation myself.  7. WHY THE HELL DON'T THEY LOCK THE DOOR??? Or put up some surveillance or *something*? Geez!  8. Now Barry's having a meltdown. And you all say... oh, never mind. I suppose anybody would be upset by current events.  9. Caitlin, I was wondering the same thing. Barry never resists a chance to yank off that stupid thing, reveal his identity to the world but now he keeps it on? What, is he afraid of somebody walking in? THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN IF YOU WOULD LOCK THE DOORS!  10. Geez, Barry was right to roll his eyes, Caitlin *is* really uptight. Is now the right time to be worried about who kissed whom?  11. Did they... not even warn these folks in advance about what was going to happen? Cisco! You have movie nights and disco with these guys! Joe! You want to rehabilitate them! Barry! You're irrationally concerned about saving their lives even as you violate each and every one of their basic freedoms and human rights! Geez, guys, pretend to be upstanding citizens already!  12. FFS, and they didn't restrain these guys at all in the truck? Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I thought these people were supposed to be smart, all of them.  13. Well, Snart was smart. Man, I probably shouldn't, but I *really* like him.  14. Ah, the big showdown!  15. Ollie, Barry IS moving!  16. God, I love a good fight scene.  Now I just need to watch next week's previews.   Because humans have a steady supply of more humans from the Federation. Talaxians in an asteroid don't... except when they literally do in the form of Neelix.   I admit, I giggled when I caught the joke.   It wouldn't have worked, not really.  If she had shot him, then all the zombies relying on his brain service would have had to fend for themselves. Some of them - particularly his muscle - would have tried to go into business for themselves. More zombies would have been created. More people would have been outright murdered. Sooner or later, there'd be a horde chomping its way down the streets of Seattle.  Blaine is evil, no doubt about it, but he represents order and stability for Team Z. Take him down without a plan to handle his little kingdom and your little problems rapidly become BIG problems.   Sorry about that, by the way. I just feel *really* strongly about this. I won't so much as buy a particular brand of potato chips because they donate a portion of their proceeds to you-know-who.   I can think of exactly one thing. This year, during the measles outbreak, they came out and said people should vaccinate their kids. Ta-da!  Ten years I've been reading articles about them, and this is the only one that didn't make me want to cry and/or vomit.   Gee, what a surprise.   I'm in NYC, so I don't know much about Alabama specific charities. A quick glance at their website didn't show that they're aligned with that particular super evil organization (I feel really strongly about this) so they're probably all right :)   Hallelujah.    It'd be one thing if they were ignorant, but given that they've been doing this for ten years I think they know darn well what they're doing and just don't care.   Please don't. Set it up so that the money goes to the Autism Society of America or the Autism Self Advocacy Network instead.   Only 4% of the funds AS takes in go on services to help autistics and their families. Their board members have salaries higher than the norm for comparable organizations. The flyer posted upthread gives a good rundown of some of their issues, but believe me, it's just the tip of the iceberg.  http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Autism_Speaks_Flyer.pdf   Because they are evil. I do not throw that word around lightly.  Let me tell you a funny anecdote. Two years ago I read an article about a woman who had gotten a new job. It was a great job, and she just had one small issue. She asked - asked, not demanded - if she could leave work a few hours early one day a week so she could meet her autistic son on his early dismissal day. She wanted to work from home in the afternoon that day, or perhaps come in a couple of hours earlier and make up the time that way. For simply *asking* if this was a possibility, they rescinded the job offer.  I posted this story on my blog and asked some real life friends this question: Which not-for-profit is involved here?  Obviously you know, because I wouldn't tell this story without a point, but they didn't have the hints you did, I just dropped this subject in out of nowhere. Would you believe that out of the twentyfive people I asked, *every single one of them* got it right on the first try?  Do you know why? Because it's always freaking Autism Speaks! When you hear that a kindergarten teacher led the class in voting out an autistic student, do you know which is the sole autism organization not to condemn this behavior? Autism Speaks! When you hear that a facility in the US has been condemned by the UN for shocking its residents, do you know which is the sole autism organization to recommend this facility to parents? Autism Speaks! When you hear that one organization gives its board members a higher salary than comparable organizations, and in fact gave them a *raise* in the middle of a recession, when similar organizations were cutting their costs, which organization is that? Autism Speaks!   I'm not even mentioning the Autism Every Day debacle. (http://www.veoh.com/watch/e133765ejW4nXnh?h1=Autism+Everyday) In the wake of that little film, two autistic children were murdered by their parents in the US, Christopher DeGroot and Katie McCarron. Christopher's parents *locked him in his room* and set the house on fire. They didn't serve any prison time. Given that the film shows a mother stating *in front of her verbal autistic daughter* that the only thing that has kept her from killing herself and that daughter is thoughts of what it would do to her NT daughter (which is tacky, if nothing else), the whole situation was a public relations disaster. And do you know what their response was? "Every parent of a child with autism secretly wants their child dead."  Bullshit.   I have been following news stories about Autism Speaks since they arrived on the scene. Not once in ten years have they not been utterly and totally in the wrong. That's an impressive track record. I'm dead serious, I'd sooner give all my money to the Scientologists and go live as a clown than let one penny of mine enter Autism Speaks' grubby little pockets.  If you want to donate to an autism related organization, I suggest either the Autism Self Advocacy Network or the Autism Society of America.   Oh, it's a *total* copout. Among other things, aren't they a good 40 years from Talaxian space at that point? How the heck did the Talaxians get there so fast? (And isn't that tiny colony worried about having a profound genetic bottleneck?)   Ow.   Aren't there two or three VM books by now?   Well, here's the thing.  1. His home planet was utterly nuked in the war, along with all his family and childhood friends.  2. His species and all or most of their official planets are occupied territory.  3. He had spent a lengthy period of time on Voyager by the time Kes left and formed friendly bonds with most of the crew.   So no, he didn't have anything better to do with his life than be a crewman on Voyager.   Yeah, Blaine definitely makes a great villain.    No more than he was before.   Damn, I hope Lowell isn't really dead. They didn't show the body either this time or in the previews, so maybe not.  AND FFS, LOOP MAJOR IN ON THE ZOMBIE THING! I'm *so* sick of major characters not being told crucial information - and yes, I'm looking at you, Flash! Ignorance doesn't keep people safe.   Better than being the "Kes is so adorable and perfect!" show. Blech.   Spooooooky.         YES. They're freaking adorable, that's why.   My goodness, they really do. In *all* the subs.   I made the same mistake at first.   Maybe she has a closed circuit monitor in there.   Like the time Harry blew up Aunt Marge?   Well....   Every time people link to the Daily Fail, I feel like pointing out that's the newspaper *Vernon Dursley* reads.   My god, it's really everywhere. You cannot escape it. You say "Okay, I just won't read /r/flashtv for a little while, let everybody get it all out of their systems" and them - bam, here it is in /r/news!   Wow. I remember the first season. I watched it, thought it was an interesting enough premise, figured there was no way they'd be a success if they tried it a second time.   This is why I don't play the stock market.   That'd be a great argument if ignorance could keep her safe.   And it's the only wizarding school, period. Scared your kid might reveal all to the muggles? Your only other option is homeschooling. Do we really believe Crabbe and Goyle were given anything like a decent education prior to Hogwarts? Maybe if they'd been in a *school* somebody would have flagged them for special education and they'd be doing better by adolescence! Muggle home educators in the UK at least know that testing and evaluation are options. Wizards often seem a little behind the times, socially. Do they have any idea how to treat learning disabilities and the like?   The Wizarding World isn't really big enough for healthy competition in the business world. There's one "reputable" daily paper, and perhaps only a small handful of people with the skills and inclination to write for it.   Every freaking week I go "Aaaaaaah, now I have to wait a few months for the next one!" and every week I'm wrong.                     Did they? I didn't see it, thanks.                         This is how some people enjoy themselves. If you don't like it, move on. "Relax", as you say.   Didn't sound like it from the joke.   Yes, and just like Duncan I utterly forgot about him when posing that question.         Okay, so who's Duncan in this scenario?      Except they didn't. They've been steadily rolling back reproductive freedom over the past few decades.      No, abortion isn't murder - abortion being murder is generally held as  a *right wing position*,  btw, not a left wing one, and so has nothing to do with "social justice warriors" - but, again, those countries which ban it *cannot* allow it in the case of rape without revealing their own hypocrisy, as the only reason they have for such a ban is "well, it's murder".  They can allow it to protect the life of the mother without looking terribly hypocritical, but that's it.   Seems a little inconsistent.  If you're anti-abortion because you think it's murder - and many do think that, even at very early stages where there's no brain stem, much less brain *activity* - it's not suddenly less murder because the mother was raped.   Either elective abortion (that is, abortion not because the fetus has a condition incompatible with life or is already dead and not because the mother's life is at risk) at various points during pregnancy should be legal or it should not. Those who are anti-abortion can't *afford* to cede on the rape front because that shows their position as hypocritical.   Until the more-or-less "Federation" ex-drones decided, in the name of peace and cooperation, to forcibly drag all the other ex-drones back into their little makeshift collective-of-sorts and we're left wondering how independent the individuals will *really* be in the long run.   Consider the Ferengi, though - three out of four onscreen mirror Ferengi are nice and reasonably charitable.                      https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/603515.The_Hound_of_Rowan   But usually they have make-up and become an alien. Or a different alien.   Yes, definitely. Those are the exact details from the movie.      If he gets a cure, how is he gonna get new customers? His muscle isn't bright enough to pick the right clientele.   Some of us didn't grow up with cable television.    It makes me want to turn my back on the place in disgust and not come back sometimes in point of fact.  Sometimes a nice long break is just what you need.   Oregon is in its fourth straight year of drought. They can't be shipping water to other people.  http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2015/03/how_oregons_drought_got_starte.html   Mercola is a nitwit, not a researcher.  And autism *isn't* on the rise, ffs. I've already addressed this, and I'm pretty sure I did it in response to you. If you use the current diagnostic standards and sift through a randomly chosen group of adults, you will find the same rate of autism as you will in children.  Come to think, I'm pretty sure I addressed the Amish myth to you as well. The Amish have just as much autism as anybody else - and they get vaccinated at the same rates as the rest of the population, and their food is NOT organic. They use GMOs and conventional farming techniques, the same amount of pesticides and herbicides as anybody else.    Man, Quark gets some good speeches.   That never happened.   Paradoxically, it's the only show which IS canon (well, assuming that the temporal cold war thingy doesn't change) with the new movies.   Phlox, I think. Like the plant.   Are any of us the same people we were when we were teens?   So you can't use him as an example of clinicians overdiagnosing autism. I am glad that your grandson is not experiencing any problems :)                                                            You must be sure to start at smile.amazon.com. There used to be a bot that automatically altered amazon.com links to smile.amazon.com links...  At any rate, it's a *tiny* percentage, like, .5%.                        All Karen Cushman books are too late for this window. She didn't start publishing until the mid-90s.

Suffice to say, the guy selling the gun may not even have been breaking the law if he makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. He just does these sales in alleys for kicks.   Oh, man. Be sure to post here on the most recent episode thread when you figure out who the main villain is. I wanna hear your reaction!   : )                              Yeah, but Wells and Barry aren't the only ones they need to concern themselves with.   Anything with seeds is a fruit, except strawberries. Strawberries are not a fruit. They are pseudocarps. (Because the seeds are not contained in the ripened ovary of the plant, that's why.)   How does that relate to my comment?    Except, oddly, it didn't really mean that even then. I strongly suggest you read some of Kanner's work. I found the experience illuminating.   The idea for inclusion is that it's beneficial for all students in the classroom - not just the ones with disabilities - and that it helps the children *academically*. It's not just so people "don't feel different or bad about themselves".    Autism is generally apparent by 18 months - and they're working on screening that can catch it earlier. So, no.   What researchers? Can you name them?   Okay. And where are you getting your stats that high functioning autistics are less common than low functioning?   In my experience, most schools have bullying, for all they say otherwise. And most schools don't handle inclusion the way they ought to. However, because most parents and children are stuck with schools and don't have the option to do something else, inclusion is the better option for many of them.   Given your other comments, I'm not certain you know what the diagnostic criteria said in the DSM-IV, much less what it says now, nor that you have much idea of what the implications of the new criteria might be.   So you believe "some article" over the actual DSM?   The word is "inclusion"... and while I do think that inclusion is generally the way to go, I *also* believe firmly that if a child is being maltreated that being educated at home and having socialization outside of school may be the better approach.  Bullying during childhood can have lifelong effects.   But he never received an autism diagnosis?   Exactly how are you defining "especially high functioning"?   While I'm inclined to agree in principle, "a suit from a ring" is one of the cute little things that shows up when you upvote comments. It can't be that much of a surprise.   Bananas split! Bananas unite! Banana to the left, banana to the right!   I keep reading that as "nasty in the pasta". Never gonna eat rigatoni again.   Terriers *kill* rats.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrier#History   So over in /r/flashtv people are talking about iZombie, and over *here* we've got folks talking about The Flash.  I can't tell where I am anymore. I should probably be more worried about this.    I know Blaine is a big bad but I'm kiiinda into the whole look it's probably Spike related.  Yup.   No! Barry/Cisco otp 4eva!   Do people in your part of the country not have lube?   Well, all people grow and learn, including autistics. However, it is important to remember a few things, most of all that autism is not solely about socializing and that socializing "normally" is not always the goal.    Oh, I see. Well, it's pretty common among autistics, especially those of us with gross motor issues. I don't know what else could cause it, but I'm sure there could be any number of things. It's *really* common for people who are interested in the subject and think they might be on the spectrum to start attributing anything and everything to autism - but it's equally common for people who don't know about it or who are in denial to strenuously insist on any other explanation, no matter how far-fetched, for anything that looks "autistic". (This paragraph is mostly pedantry, do not assume I'm saying you do any of this!)   what can I do about it other than develop compensating habits  If this is something that impacts your ability to work, you may be able to qualify for specific accommodations with a diagnosis. However, not everybody finds that necessary or useful.   For a fun, anecdotal version of this: http://www.backfromnature.org/2015/03/i-gave-my-child-autism.html  Notice it took her several years to put the pieces together, and even then, somebody had to outright suggest it to her. She was open to the suggestion. Many parents of autistic children are in strong denial about their own place on the spectrum.  From my own life, after I started pursuing a diagnosis I started having a lot of conversations with my mother that went like this:   Me: This article, bah, it talks about this autistic kid and it says he 'doesn't play with his toys, just lines them up', which is ridiculous because -   Mom: Yeah, it is. That's how children play!  Me: Um, sure. If they're autistic.  Mom: Well, that's how I played as a child, and my brother did too, and so did you!  Me: Uh-huh. Well, we've established that *I* am autistic....  (In point of fact, my mother had established that in my infancy. Nobody bothered to inform me of this, despite actively seeking a diagnosis during my childhood. It was very character-building to sort it all out on my own as a teenager. I never want my character built ever again.)   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083102/   Not really. The assortative mating theory of autism... well, I disagree with the essential premise that actual incidence rates of autism are increasing, however, it's backed on sound evidence.  Autism does have a strong genetic component. It is common for autistics and members of the broader autistic phenotype to self-select friends and spouses who are also on the spectrum. (Anecdotally, that's how I got here. Hi.) That's all.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2083102/    I think the general consensus is that forced socialization of ASD kids is to the benefit of both ASD kids and regular kids.   Does that consensus come with the input of autistic adults...?   It is known that men who have children later in life are more likely to have autistic children and grandchildren, yes.   It is known that men who father children later in life are more likely to have autistic children and grandchildren. However, to my knowledge we have not yet determined if this is because the sperm changes or because people with autistic traits simply have children later in life than NTs, or both.   There is no evidence that the actual incidence of autism is increasing. That's what this article is about.   Evolution in long-lifed species such as humans simply does not work that quickly.    For a terrorist.  For an anybody. Also, I think the preferred term is "freedom fighter".    In Trek timeline corrections are pursued to repair a broken universe, such as in "City On The Edge Of Forever" and "Yesterday's Enterprise", or the characters wouldn't go through the bother of trying to fix what went wrong.  Or perhaps they just want to go home to their own universe where they understand everything, or simply aren't 100% certain of how this whole time travel universe changing works. (And that does NOT mean that Janeway is being reckless. Admiral Janeway has more information than we do, because she's lived longer.) We don't know that these "wrong" universes cease to exist when "fixed", you're just assuming that.   It makes sense to most people. Of course, it's entirely possible that both factors are true.   I think we're saying the same thing differently. My comment was more "autistics start fitting into the same bell curve as NTs when tested differently".   You are the one stating that "they are diagnosing kids too much", and then stating "if they're doing that, it's just lazy". You're assuming the premise. That's what's really lazy.   That's nowhere in the diagnostic criteria.   You might try asking in /r/aspergers.    Damn, it's been years since I've heard about the Amish. Where do I start?  Well, let's start with the fact that if you know what you're looking at, the Amish have autism rates about the same as everybody else. They simply don't diagnose as much.  Even if they DID have a low rate of autism, they also have one of the highest rates of polydactyly in the world. Why? The founder effect. So that could also explain it - a founder effect that leads to reduced cases in autism. (But doesn't, because they don't have less autism than the rest of us.)  	200

 She didn't get the memo.female assassins are too hard to animate, therefore they don't exist.   I've always looked at fashion boards as an extended group of friends.  If you are around a certain group long enough you begin to act, dress, and like the things the group as a whole likes.  Every board had their select few individualists, sometimes they are the creative's, or industry people, or even just the ones with the most money and they tend to spark trends in the community.the only way to get "beyond"the group is to leave that specific group. I'm a hypebeast person from 06, when I joined wdywt consisted of evisu, and red monkey jeans, bape hoodies, and dunks.  User/blogger Neek was the first to start posting fits of 501stf,wtaps/cukkas, and solid colored tshirts.  at first it wasn't well regarded "too sufu" a month later and it was the biggest entire forum paradigm shift I ever remember seeing.    idk. god of carts..  or cart of war.

Thanks for all your work!   Sorry if this is a dumb question, anyhow. My first credit card was a CapitalOne Platinum card, It was just about the only card I could get with very little credit history.  After a year or so my credit score is ~700, and I was pre-approved for the Cap quicksilver card. If I have 2 cards in my wallet, one with a higher APR and no rewards and the other the opposite I don't see myself using the platinum card any more.  I don't want to close my platinum card, and lose all the history I built with it.  I also don't want to keep it unused and have that go against my credit score, as little as it may actually effect it.  I'm also planning on applying for the Discover it card, and don't really care to keep track of 3 credit cards.  I'm very responsible with credit, and 90% of the time I don't carry a balance from month to month unless I'm hit with a last minute emergency in which I clear it off as quickly as possible.  I'm just not the most organized person in the world, so the thought of carrying around 3 cards scares me.  Thanks in advance.   Getting more money for mk vs dcu than for bf3 it's bonkers, nobody could be looking for that game.   "George Bush doesn't care about black people"   I am planning on buying a condo in the next month, I will be taking a 30-year mortgage and am not sure whether to go with an adjustable or fixed rate. I'm accounting for my finances with no over-time at work, and I will be fine making payments with either loan.  I'm planning on paying the loan back within 10 years.  For the moment going with an ARM would save me on monthly payments for when I am not getting over-time.  (its slow season now)  For 2/3rds of the year I am planning on making double/triple payments. Would I be wise to stick with the best % fixed rate mortgage?  I have about enough finances saved up to pay it off in full if things get bad, but I would rather build more credit.  I also don't want to buy a cheap condo in full and have no just-in-case money left.  PS. thanks to everyone who helped me out in my rent vs buy topic from a couple days ago.     Dracut, lowell, haverhill. Depending what you consider around. 25-35 minutes away is close enough for me. I work out of Chelmsford ma. The cheapest I've found near the city proper is Malden, but the cheap cheap end was like 130k   Thanks a lot, I'm going to have to look into a buying agent and see what I come up with.  Glad to hear you made out well on your condo!!   Absolutely atleast 5 years. The place I have my eye on currently, well one of many.  The one I'm waiting to hear back from has been on the market for about half a year, and has already lowered their price about 10k.  It isn't a very convenient area, it just happens to be very very convenient to the place I work.  I do need to have it seriously checked out though, if I get serious on this one.  Because that length of time tends to make me nervous. Thanks for the advice!   Thanks a lot, I would have absolutely overlooked that.   I promised my mom I would before she moves to Florida, I'm staying in the Boston area.  The last thing I need is for her to be worrying about me, when she needs to be worrying about herself. Figure there is no harm in meeting with the guy once and seeing how I feel.     Thanks, I will have to look into that. At the moment I'm looking for a one bedroom, in hopes that my girlfriend will move in when she is ready.  For now I want to prove i can be fully independent, and if she moves in we would be making about 100k in total together and could pay it of quick, and or live like king/queen. I went into more detail why she can't at the moment a little further up, but ya after dealing with roomates for years I don't know if i can go back to it.   Thanks, average in my area is only about $150.  A few im looking at are around $250 with gas heat included.  When I was renting, during the winter my gas bills were around $250 alone.  So at that price it seems to even out.   Me and my girlfriend are pretty serious, but at the moment I need to do whats best for me.  Since moving back home I have an hour commute to her, and a 45 minute commute to work.  The places I am looking to live would be within 25 minutes from her, and 10-odd minutes to work. ~200 a month in gas in my civic is getting old. She doesn't have a car, She moved to the states when she was 16 and has had Boston public transportation ever since.  Wherever I look at I anticipate bringing her, and value her opinion.  But for the moment I want to prove that I can be completely independent by myself, and hopefully she will move in with me eventually.  I can't afford to live walking distance from the subway by myself, and need to be safe if anything happens between us. Just to clarify, she makes more money than me.  She doesn't drive because she never needed to drive, but she's working on it. (I don't want anyone thinking poorly of my lady ;))    I don't want land, I grew up in suburban NH and have plenty of land.  I hated every minute of any yard work, and shoveling I've ever had to do.  I would love to get a townhouse maybe, but its out of my budget at this moment, and will likely be for the next 5-10 years.   Thanks for the input. I have 65k is saved up.so even after a dp I have some wiggle room.have an appointment next week with a financial advisor.is there anything you would recommend asking or telling an advisor?   I'm 28 years old and was renting for a few years.  My father passed away last year and I moved back in with my mother. (not trolling for sympathy, just giving context). My childhood house is going on the market, and I need to come up with something to do soon/within the next few months.  Condo's in my area are in the 75-100k range, and I have enough money saved where I could comfortably put in a 30% dp.  If anything goes completely awry I have enough saved where I could probably buy it outright.   I make about 40k, and am happy at my job and don't intend on leaving it or my area any time soon.  It also works out with the loan I'd be taking plus average hoa fees in my area that I could live in a nicer condo for cheaper than renting.  I strongly oppose going back to having roomates, and I don't want a house (after maintaining my current home over the past year).  edit: also I know this isn't the reality sub, but if anyhow knows about how firm condo prices are it would be appreciated.  I don't want to offer 65k on an 80k condo, planning to settle between 70-75 and have my offer seem like a slap in the face only to not hear back.  (I don't know if condo's are like houses, and owners expect an offer, or if they expect to get the asking price.)  Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated, hopefully y'all can help me from giving myself more headaches.

Try soaking them more often.they will fade slower, but the denim will stay more healthy and less prone to crotch blowout.

Similar to how street wear used to be exclusive to small boutiques, and now its available at zumies.   5 years ago you saw Raw denim at high-end stores/some boutiques, now you can get it at urban outfitters and macy's.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  The niche market likes it, the famous people start wearing it, the rest of the world wants it.

Just last week I upgraded my service to a triple play deal, because it worked out to be cheaper than my current tv and internet separate bill.  along with upgrading my internet from performance (25MBps) to 50*. Today I go outside and find a box from comcast, inside was a technicolor TC8305C MONSTROSITY.  I called comcast to say I did not want it, only to find out I had a tech coming to my house in 2 days, I had no idea about this. Currently I have a asus RT-AC68R, and a Motorola SB6121.  Am I going to need this outrageous technicolor box to add digital voice to my package?  Or is there an inline solution they can do.  I dont want another 2.4GHz device mucking up my signal (I have a pretty large house, and have a few devices stuck on 2.4 still) Is my best bet to pay comcast for a phone line that I don't use, and continue paying AT T for my phone service?

                         Good. Maybe this will make companies think twice before using our private communications to mine them and sell ads against that private information.   Theme engine. 2 major OS version updates + 1 year of security updates for a total of 3 years support, as rumored. But I'd like that for *all* phones not just Nexus.   Isn't the GPS automatically enabled on iOS, too?                  You invest in the companies most likely to win (usually, but not always, the leaders/first movers).   Unfortunately the companies likely to succeed in VR are also already massive companies where investing in them won't give you a huge ROI over the next few years.  It would've been much better if Oculus had stayed independent from that point of view.   I only really care about Sense ID (if it is as good as it sounds in theory, at least).

I don't know about that but there is a lot of Microsoft fanboism on r/Android lately, that's for sure.                                 Yeah, I've seen "I, Robot", too. That one doesn't end well, either.         I really like that rumored 2+ years of OS updates (so 2 major versions in this case) + another year of security updates after that.  That seems quite optimal and I hope other OEMs follow that. Unfortunately even if they do it, it will only be for high-end devices. That's why Google still needs to push a plan to update *all* devices, at the very least for security updates if not features.                     But I thought he was already "winding down" the program and such.   So...no then?                                 So if Microsoft quietely admitting Windows Phone is dead? Why doesn't it just come out and say it, rather than play this "oh WP is totally alive, we're just going to put 10x more resources on the other 2 platforms - that's all".  WP users should be the most upset about that, as they'll be lied for years more by Microsoft that the company will totally continue to support the platform, while in reality it will focus more on Android and iOS and starve Windows Phone/Mobile of development resources, until it goes out with a whimper rather than a bang.  I just feel it's very dishonest and unfair to do that to current *and future* Windows mobile users by misleading them this way.   Yeah, can you imagine how many people would be sent to prison?   This is certainly not happening because they *can't* do that (strong encryption). They just refused to do it, possibly because they don't think the Belgian law applies to that.   Intel still has a lot of "x86 baggage". You know how we can find that out? It's easy.  ARM chips:  1) cost less per die area  2) same performance or better (usually better) at high-end for instance, or mid-range or whatever level you want to compare  3) yet they are like 1-2 process nodes *behind* Intel's process nodes.  How is it possible for ARM chips to cost significantly less, have at least as much performance at a given level, and yet do all that on a 1-2 generations old process node? It's possible because Intel's chips are bloated.   If Intel would put the latest high-end ARM core on its own 14nm process and compare it with latest Atom, at the same power envelope, it wouldn't even be close. The ARM core would be like 2x faster, while still costing half as much.   Not really. Intel is not competitive on a "performance per price" metric. Not even close. The only way it has been able to *look* like it's competitive on that metric so far is because it would heavily subsidize its chips with profits from the PC chip business.  Now they've said they won't do that anymore, but it will be hard to verify since they've just unified the 2 divisions (mobile and PC). However, there was already an announcement that for the next version or something of the Zenfone 2, Asus would use a *lower performance* Snapdragon 615.   Why? Because Intel is not selling that Atom or its successor at the *same price level as the Snapdragon 615* as it's doing now. So if Intel raises its prices, Asus can't sell a "mid-range phone with a high-end chip" for $250 anymore. It will have to buy a mid-range chip for a *real* price, not a subsidized one.  And if Intel has to compete with other high-end chips in high-end phones with real prices, it loses, because high-end Arm chips like the Snapdragon 820 for instance will have better performance for *half the price* of a high-end Atom (Cherrywell or whatever they are calling the new one).   What's with the Microsoft circlejerk on r/Android lately?   They could still pass a last-minute renewal this Sunday.  Remind your Senators not to do it:  http://fight215.org/            Tegra X1 should be pretty sweet. Hopefully it's not still on a 28nm process...in summer.   It would be a smart choice not just from a battery perspective (if it's an efficient modern panel that is, not a 1080p panel from 3 years ago which probably uses 50% more power than the current 1440p one) but also from a cost perspective, as that will probably be the $350 variant, and I'd rather they put a better camera in there than a higher resolution screen anyway.      Except for the part where it's not open source, like the Gallery is.  Either way, hopefully Google doesn't constantly nag you about "signing into it" or worse, automatically sync all of your photos online.

This is exactly why *unaccountable* spying is so dangerous. The government can start using "secret evidence" against you or they can twist that evidence however they want to charge you with stuff. The more this is allowed to happen, the more it will corrupt judges as well (not necessarily in a direct sense, but in the sense that judges will start getting used to it, too, and allow secret evidence to exist "to protect methods of investigation" or some other bullshit reason).

Coming later in September, Skylake-H will roll out, which will address high-performance notebooks and some Xeon segments  Lol, I like how the H-series is now "high-performance". Up until IVB and until Intel decided to *lower* mainstream notebook performance with the ULV/U chips, the H-series (then called the M-series) was in all "mainstream" laptops, even the $500 ones. Now they're pushing the low-performance U chips and the *even lower performance* Y/Core M chips in mainstream laptops.   Except they haven't cut the funding yet. Also, weren't the Snowden documents saying there is like a $50 billion "black budget" (across NSA, CIA and others)?  Even without that, they could just ask for a "bigger budget" for some *other programs* in the future (without actually telling the whole Congress what they are - after all even the Intelligence Committee doesn't know about most of them, as per Dianne Feinstein) and then use that budget to restart it under some other name and authorization.   How many times have they "closed" programs in the past, only to rename them to something else and not only keep doing it, but *expanding* it.  Room 641a (AT T cable tapping) comes to mind where they got "caught", promised to shutter it, and yet the Snowden revelations show us that they have *cable access* to *all* traffic in the US.  Anyway, this isn't even their largest program - not even close. The Patriot Act accounts to less than 5% of their mass spying. The rest is done through the FISA Amendments Act Section 702 (bound for renewal in 2018 I think) and the Executive Order 12333.  The Patriot Act Section 215 was *mainly* about phone records (although they probably interpreted it to mean Internet records too in some cases), but the FAA 702 and EO1233 allows them to capture *all web traffic*, including content, which also includes your Skype calls, emails, SMS, chats and so on. Those are far my dangerous than the Patriot Act 215.   Well the UK doesn't even have a Constitution..so yeah.   If *it is* because something like this, they probably wouldn't want to tell us anyway, because that would show how reckless and incompetent the airline companies were to connect the entertainment systems to the critical systems, even if there is a "firewall" between them (because hackers have never bypassed those before...).  This is precisely what worries me *greatly* about "smart" cars and self-driving cars. If the companies don't *completely* separate the two types of systems through an air gap, and give *absolutely no network connection* to the critical system, we could see a lot of hacks happening, even mid-driving.   The "no network access" part probably won't happen, though, as with self-driving cars they will be pushing V2V technology, which means for it to be effective the critical system that includes breaks and engine and whatnot will need to communicate with that network. But at least I hope they put the two systems on *different chips*.   Make no mistake, though, the vast majority of "self-driving car accidents" won't happen because the self-driving AI is not good enough. They'll happen because of hacks into people's cars.   Combine that with virtually unaccountable spy agencies (not just US, but everywhere) and that future is quite terrifying indeed, considering we only know about most of their hacks from a whistleblower, not because they were *detected* after the fact.   What are the most likely battery technologies to succeed in the next 5-10 years, though?  From what I've read there are [quite](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/01/28/your-smartphone-battery-sucks-this-mit-startup-could-change-that/) a few [startups](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/secretive-company-claims-battery-breakthrough/) that promise to "commercialize solid state batteries" by 2018. Both [Apple](http://revolution-green.com/solid-state-batteries-apple-and-toyotas-next-big-thing/) and [Google](http://www.slashgear.com/google-is-working-on-solid-state-batteries-that-last-longer-than-typical-batteries-12378543/) also seem to be researching them and Apple wants to launch its electric car in 2020 or so.   Solid state batteries also seem to have 50-100% higher density (up to 1200Wh/liter) than regular li-ion batteries, higher life cycles, and they are safer too (due to lack of liquid electrolyte), which could be great for electric cars.  I can't find the link now but there was some li-ion Nobel prize winner or something also working on solid state batteries.      My guess? Using the technology for space mining (mostly) as Google could get trillions in revenue from that, but perhaps also for manufacturing and other more mundane stuff.   I'm just hoping they will keep their promise from last year and won't become a Defense contractor. I'd rather the robots that will inevitably be sent to kill people in the Middle East or Africa in the future won't have the Google brand on them, the way the Stark brand was on the missiles in the Iron Man movies.   It's for the same reason I don't put much trust in face or iris unlocking of phones or computers. It's just a matter of time before they get the biometric "code" out of your online photos or from CCTVs.   Hopefully it's 3 years or at least 2.5 years. Most people use their phones more than 2 years. They should be supported accordingly. The carrier contract time-line is irrelevant (people also leave their old phones to family or sell them to others who use them a couple of years more) and Google should not bound itself to it.                     That was kind of the point of the article. The US is too focused to pass a law for itself instead of working within an international body to set space mining standards.  The US has no plans to mine the moon currently for instance, and this new law doesn't even apply to the moon, only asteroids. China has already announced that it plans to go to the moon soon, and as the article says it could say "that whole land where water is on the moon is OURS".      I wonder if the government will just interpret that as "we can continue collecting data for everyone on which we have data since before 2005" - which could be most people.  After all they already seem to consider the data of 3-hop Americans (millions of people) as "relevant" to a terrorist investigation.            Until they pass a mandatory minimum 10 year sentence for anyone shooting "one of the government's drones" down, or some similar law. Then what?   I'm inclining more and more to believe that Tor needs to become P2P where everyone is an exit node.  That seems to have worked pretty well for torrenting/piracy. Imagine if torrents didn't work the way they do now and only a few "special" nodes would upload the content to others. That would make those targets much more appealing to law enforcement and seeders wouldn't be able to "hide within the masses" as they do now.  This has turned out to be such an insurmountable probable for the anti-piracy guys that they just prefer to focus on other *centralized* places such as websites that keep the torrents.  So we already have proof that such a P2P strategy "works", despite the fear of many that they don't want "all the illegal stuff" to go through their computers.   Also, perhaps the client could make everyone an exit node by default, but somewhere deep in the settings it could still allow people to disable their client from being an exit node and make it only a relay node. Then those who are really terrified about the prospect of being an exit node can just turn that off. Win-win right?  The current strategy of having a few thousand nodes will never work, and it's only going to become worse as NSA increases its budget and capabilities. Those thousand nodes will be overwhelmed by NSA's own nodes.  Even if we turn millions of relay nodes into exit nodes I'd still worry the NSA has the capability to mess with that, but at least it would be a much smaller chance. Also, if Tor ever gets to something like 100 million users (you never know, especially with more oppressive countries going online in the next decade) that should make it almost impossible for any agency to cryptanalize the Tor traffic - but only if we make everyone an exit node.                                          Whoops, it seems that the records for 95% of our targets have gone under water in a pipe leak.      You called?  [Security Analysis of Estonia's Internet Voting System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY_pHvhE4os)      Reminds me of the "debate" on climate change:  "I'm no scientist - but all those 99.9% scientists have no idea what they're talking about!"                           Glad to see they are thinking about more transparency...at their secret summit in their secret mansion.                        Hopefully next time many here on Reddit won't be so quick to accuse companies or people who disclose bugs publicly.  I remember the shitstorm Google got when it made public a Windows bug "only" 90 days after it had told Microsoft about it.            No. Privacy Badger is weaker than Disconnect and others, too. But it might be better for "first-timers" and computer newbies as it may break fewer things and even if it does break something, you can easily  configure it.  Otherwise I'd use ublock origin's privacy settings.   Not quite. Everyone does a lot of stuff on the web on a daily basis for which they want privacy. Buying stuff (you wouldn't want your neighbor to know what you bought, why would you want the government?), watching porn, searching for embarrassing health related issues, and so on.  I'd wager Tor should be used for *most* of your browsing activity, and only use something else when you log-in to Facebook, Twitter and other places where you're identity is completely tied to the service.                                          I'm saying support for obsolete protocols should be *dropped* at some point (in this case by browser vendors, but it could be OpenSSH maintainers, and so on). Those who drop it should announce ahead of time, but after that it's everyone else's responsibility.  If as you say the problem is some incompetent IT admin configured the security to use an old protocol and didn't pay attention to the latest security news, then eventually he should notice that his sites just stop working. However that *didn't happen*, for example in the case of 512-bit DHE, which should've been dropped a *long time ago*.   People in charge of security at browser vendors decided to "be easy" on the incompetent IT admins and leave 512-bit DHE in there for another 10 years, even if it could be broken with a few PCs.   Rand Paul and Ron Wyden have some good amendments they want to pass for the USA Freedom Act, however unless they really convinced the others to pass the amendments in order to not kill the USA Freedom Act as well, those amendments will have a very slim to none chance of passing.   And which has end-to-end encryption like iMessage but without automatic backup to Google's servers (unlike iMessage).   What bothers me most about decisions such as "Well, we can't dump this protocol yet because 30% of the servers still use it" is that they don't also present a deadline for when they'll stop supporting that protocol.  Fine, keep 1024-bit DHE support now. But where's the deadline for when you'll drop it? Maybe they didn't want to rush such a decision and perhaps we'll still see Google announce a plan like they did for SHA1.  However, I really do believe that's how the security industry needs to think from now on. Will a protocol start to look weak in 5 years? Prepare a 3 year plan to get everyone off it. Is the protocol *already too weak* to be considered very secure? Create an even more aggressive plan to phase it out.   This kind of mentality needs to permeate everything security related on the web from now on. No more using 2 decades old broken crypto because it just happened to remain in the software and nobody bothered to push it out "because it might break some things". That excuse would not be valid if the security industry was a little more pro-active.   Holla if you Jolla!   Uh huh. Sure. Hey everyone, that's it. NSA ended ALL OF ITS SPYING.  Not.   Yeah, because we're just going to build 100,000 robots, send them to a war zone and say..."Uh...so do what you guys do best...alert us when you're done. "  Or option 2) we're still going to control the robots by giving them the algorithms which they're supposed to use to kill people (kind of like how the CIA kills people now with drones based on NSA's metadata/SIM card location information).  Which do you think is more likely?  Also another side of this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMYYx_im5QI   And it's happening under the right-wing control in UK and Canada. It doesn't matter much when it comes to spying on your own people.   Not if UK can get there first!  It's ok, Canada - you can still be the runner-up.   "Nuclear is perfectly safe technology!" - except for all of those times humans can completely screw it up and cause global catastrophes.   And just like Napster, Popcorn Time will end up inspiring a whole industry (this time Hollywood).   Where's your "thank you, and may I have some more?", MPAA?   Hybrid cars give you tiny sub-10KWh batteries. There's not much you can do with them, especially in the U.S. where many people have to commute tens of miles a day.  At *best* they are a transitional technology that won't last more than a decade before fully electric cars take over. Personally, I think they are not even worth the money today.   Think of the children!   Protecting dat freedom.   Games will run less efficiently since ARM native code has to be emulated under x86 and it may kill the battery faster, too.   You might want to take a look at:  https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet  https://pond.imperialviolet.org/  Both work only over Tor, but they are still experimental. Otherwise see if you can find something you like here:  https://www.privacytools.io/  And you might want to give Peerio a try. It uses https://minilock.io/ to encrypt everything on the client side, and keeps the data for easy access on Peerio's servers (kind of like Spideroak in that regard, except it's a messaging/email-like client).  On mobile Signal/TextSecure is your best bet.   Not just big corporations but under the control of their own governments too.   Internet.org is essentially the **Great Firewall on steroids**, and that's how people should be referring to it. China could only dream at such a "curated" Internet for its own citizens.   Intel really is pushing this phone. They've been sending out the press releases themselves for the Zenfone (rather than Asus).   Is it worth mining with a laptop?   [ublock origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)'s privacy features are quite nice, too.   It's why all countries are trying to control the Internet now and spy on everyone everywhere. They want to try and "contain" that frustration before it builds up (not by actually fixing the issues, but by "eliminating" the trouble makers).   NIST has a budget of a [billion dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) a year, and *somehow* it still ends up recommending *shit crypto*. I wonder why that is.   Or just a type-C USB port.   Or just a type-C USB port.   The same could be said about the solar/battery combo.   "They *can* talk about it - we're just going to destroy their lives if they do. Simples, really."  	200
 Star Wars jedi power battles? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Jedi_Power_Battles   man,  if only she had been in Showgirls instead of Elizabeth Berkley.   As a kid my family had vhs copies of the karate kid and Adventures in babysitting and I was in love with Elisabeth Shue.      Titus. Best sitcom Fox ever had.   I miss Atton Rand and Mira :(      true that   who doesn't hate it?   Me too, I always sing it Time After Time   a movie, book, tv show, clothing trend, whatever.         stories, some sci-fi and fantasy. I'm not making money or anything, it's more of a hobby. I always wrote good stories and speeches in my English classes so that's where I started.   Its premise might sound weird, but it really is good. Some kind of plague wipes out every male mammal on Earth, except for this guy and his monkey. And they have to travel alongside this government agent and this scientist to find out why the plague happened and how to fix it. I think it's pretty good because it doesn't just focus on the characters, it shows you what the world would be like without men, the good and the bad. It's well written, well drawn, and since it was planned with only 60 issues in mind it doesn't feel dragged on, and by the end all plot threads are tied up. The only thing bad I can say is that the ending might not be what you want, but it's ending that leaves you satisfied.   Final Fantasy 9. It showed me how powerful fictional characters can have on you and that helped inspire me to start writing.   Its ok, I was touched by Airborne and Encino Man.   Y: the last man  Even if you don't like comic books you need to read this. Buy it, torrent it, whatever.   gadgets, movies, people, ideas.....   i'll help you out   I think it's attractive when they show self-respect. For me it's a major turn-off when girls complain that they are fat, unintelligent, or too skinny.      thanks :)   source...         well now they have that new show coming out, Hannibal. But the guy playing Lecter is the bad guy from Casino Royale so I don't know if it's gonna be good.   I think Harry Potter could have been a tv show, maybe not better but still. I don't know how long kids in the United Kingdom have off for summer break, but in america its 3 months, so i'm guessing a Hogwarts school year is about 9 months. That's a lot of time to sum up in about 2 hours.   like?   even though some will call this a cop-out, you can answer with what you think would be better as a mini-series, too.   I want to see Catcher in the Rye as a movie, but at the same time I don't. The reason why is that I can't think of a good actor for Holden. If only they could have made a movie in the 80's, I think Anthony Michael Hall could have been a good pick.   this and Kids next door were the reason I always watched cartoon network.   I've had a similar experience, when I was a kid my older brother used to always come back from his friends house smelling funny. And I always wondered when his friends came over why he wouldn't let me hang out with them.   I was just playing Star Wars: Shadows of the empire the other day. I was surprised how much I found it difficult compared to when I played it years ago as a kid.   *childhood, goddamn I need to proofread more.  	35
 Sinister has moments of genuine cleverness  - like the premise, and some of the 'films' you see. The lawnmower one for example.  It just fails to really capitalise on it's own potential. Both scare-wise, but especially thematically.  Great horror films play on people's insecurities and fears truly well. 'The Thing' revolves around paranoia and trusting others. 'Cure' - a Japanese thriller/horror I can't recommend enough - does the same and also makes the viewer believe even they might be capable of terrible things and not know it. 'The Exorcist' plays on a parents fear of helplessness in the face of physical/mental illness as well as ones doubts of faith in God or the nature of the world. There's probably even more than that - it's a heck of a film and it's been a while since I watched it.  All of those fears/insecurities are enough to make people stay up at night just on their own. This is a big part of what makes the characters struggles in horror films so relatable - even though none of us will experience anything they go through.  'Sinister' toys with the notion of the main characters ego getting infront of his families safety, but it does little with it.  Take 'The Babadook' -a recent Australian horror film that's on Netflix and has received massive critical acclaim (86 on Metacritic, 98 on Rotten Tomatoes, took home best film and direction at the Aussie equivalent of the Oscars). The Babadook totally drives home it's themes. Without giving anything away, it's almost impossible to come out of the film and not understand what The Babadook was 'really' about. Hence, it ended up resonating with a lot of people in ways I haven't seen Sinister resonate with anyone.  I feel like that's the reason Sinister won't be remembered as anything more than a pretty good idea, that didn't pan out like it may have deserved.   That was great. Thanks for sharing that.  	2

    Hi again,  Well now that I take a closer look I don't think it's an issue of space between the copper place and that copper tubing, but here are photos of the unit assembled, the GPU uncovered, and a side shot so you can see the space (or lackthereof) between that plate and tube.  http://imgur.com/a/cj4yy  Thanks for any help.   A small step for pope, a giant ... Aww fuck it, this is such horseshit from someone with a private jet who sits on golden chairs of opulence.    You are correct, sir.   I'll take a photo tomorrow, I really appreciate the help.   When I had it on earlier and the case open, the metal plate on the GPU was hot (as in cook flesh in 1 second) and the heat sink by the fan was relatively cool. So possibly heat isn't transferring to that copper tube thingy.    Positive I did the GPU and not the CPU.   The thermal paste was placed between the GPU and a copper plate. There is a plastic piece that surrounds the GPU on all sides that I wasn't expecting (note that it was not on top of the GPU though).   I'm a little hesitant to get a picture because it means taking it apart again. How helpful would it be?  It seems very strange to me that it would even get that hot when not running something demanding. I even started windows in safe mode and ended up turning it off it got so hot.    A conversation first. One thing I'm learning, which I couldn't do in my marriage which lead to it ending, was effectively speak my feelings and stand up for myself without knocking my wife down. It's difficult managing a relationship. Sometimes I just think I'm not cut out for it.   That's sad, I feel for you. I'm recently divorced and know how bad things can feel. If you don't think she will say something nice to you it sounds like there are issues that need to be addressed.    close. but really, can't we guess most films before seeing them?   It was a joke because of your use of "or".   Do we get to choose or is it like Let's Make a Deal?   Wow, that poor girl! Someone should move her out.   Well, thermal paste added and heat sinks cleaned up. The GPU still gets to 117c then shuts down, but I bought maybe 5-10 additional seconds before it reaches that temp.   Any other ideas?   Yeah it's running. I have the case open so I can see it.    Thanks for the advice. I'll give that a shot.    Hi Reddit techsupport,  I have a 2 year old Sager laptop with a GeForce 460m graphics card. About 2 weeks ago it started acting strange and automatically shutting off. This started when I was playing L4D2 - when there was a big horde and lots of action it would start to stutter and then just shut off. At first I thought it was due to the similarly timed Steam update, that maybe it was more RAM demanding.   Then I noticed how hot the machine was getting and downloaded speedfan to monitor temps while playing. The GPU would get to about 110c and then the stuttering starts and the laptop would shut down.   Now I turn on my laptop and turn on speedfan and nothing else. In well under a minute (30 seconds maybe) the temp of the GPU gets to 117c and shuts down - and that's with having the laptop on its side with the bottom casing off for better ventilation.   Obviously I don't have enough time to even download new drivers.   Is this a thing with this GPU? What should I do? Given my recent divorce (not looking for sympathy) I can't afford to swap the chip.   Typing on my phone so sorry for any typos.   Any help is appreciated.   train_subject4065    Moviepass  moviepass.com    moviepass  check out moviepass.com, if your theater takes Discover then moviepass should work.

It's not that the U.S. isn't brutal enough, it's that the military is no longer needed to take another country. Capitalism and corporations do it for us.   Going through a divorce now myself. Your statement sounds like you're describing me.   Good luck with everything, and sorry about your marriage.    You need to look up Dean Radin if you haven't already. He is a scientist seriously studying psychic phenomena. He has a few books.    Not me.    You aren't. I've asked people in-game and a couple others said the same.     Similar here but not that bad. I had to adjust video settings down to improve lag. Graphics don't look as good as they could but still very playable. Hopefully they'll fix. Contact their support on twitter.    It's down.

In all seriousness though, anal is grande.    Glad you can enjoy it. Just not for me, too dark and sounds bad to me.    it's a cam rip, hence the utterly unwatachabilitynessesque of it.

 I'm no gun expert but done a little pistol shooting.  A shot like that to hit the guy in the window would be incredibly difficult.  Never mind having so one shooting back at you.   Some options I think they should have added this year without too much redesign are a rear view camera, available on Cherokees and Grand Cherokees and the heated steering wheel.  I know some Jeep purists might be annoyed with that suggestion but I test drove the Cherokee and the heated steering wheel was a feature I never knew i needed.   It isn't minor, if you are going to order new, get what makes you happy.     I've been on my phone all weekend and wanted to give you a good answer typed out on my computer, since you took such a keen interest in my business.  1. You would bring stuff boxed or packaged the way you wanted your self.    1. You would have to determine that ahead of the time with the person you were renting from.  Each owner would have different comfort levels, some might be ok with daily access, some might want to be there when you are there.  Some might give you a key, others might not.  Expectations need to be set ahead of time to ensure the storage area is a good fit for both host and tenant.  1. Well prices will be set by the host so they can rent it for what they deem is worth their time and energy.  The other thing that I really want to tout is the flexibility of this service.  So say you have something you need to store, but you don't need or want to rent an entire storage unit for it.  Such as seasons things.  Some examples that come to mind are snow tires, or summer tires, or a Jeep hard top.  While storing say 4 tires for a winter might not make you much money, lets say 50 bucks for 5 months.  You could store 10 sets of tires in your garage for those five months earning $500 bucks.  Because you might live in an apartment and not want to store your tires in your apartment but also not rent a storage unit for 50 bucks a month just for tires.  Does that make sense?  1. You obviously can't store things that are illegal, simple as that.  I don't have the exact terms and conditions figured out.  But I imagine self storage units already have terms and conditions regarding that and I could probably copy that for my company.  Let me know if you have other questions.   We can't compete or rather won't compete with them on wages.  They are overpaying him on wages.  It is too bad because I thought he'd be a good addition to the squad but hardly end of the world.   What up fellow Turbo X Sport Combi brother   It's the punchline you dolt    My buddy said that on the boat today so that really cracked me up   It reminds me of the Adirondacks at sunset from the Vermont side of Lake Champlain.  Whatever it looks like it looks awesome.  How long did it take and how hard is it to do?  I'm thinking this would be awesome for my home.   1. I don't understand what you mean by how you hold it? 1. Well that is a gray area i am working out.  Sorta the same deal that is going on with Airbnb if say someone slipped on my driveway and broke my arm and sued me I could be liable.  Currently homeowners insurance in some cases will carry over to a certain amount to your possessions stored elsewhere but not the full amount.  I would probably have to offer some sort of 1 million dollar guarantee like what Airbnb does. 1. Yes, just like airbnb, this isn't for everyone but just go on craiglist and see that people are seeking places to rent and store things.  I had 4 fake craiglist posts up for different types of properties going for about a month and half.  I had about 88 e-mails inquiring about the space. 1. Again I point to Airbnb, because these things can happen in that scenario as well.  However what Airbnb has as a huge selling point is the background verification and review system that incentives people to be honest.  I am a huge airbnb host and make a lot of money doing that.  I could go in and steal my guests camera or computer and sell it for a few hundred bucks.  But I won't 1. because I am an honest person but 2. even if I wasn't I can make $2,985 max each week renting out properties.  So even if I did steal and make a couple of hundred bucks off of it, a bad review where they mentioned theft in my home could cost me way more in the long run.  I imagine the same would be true of storage and trust.   physical storage like self storage but at peoples homes.     Storage, at least ~~taunts~~ that's my hope.  I'm building a storage p2p site as we speak.  Hope to have the basic site launched in two weeks.  Physical storage  	12
    You must be a hit with the ladies.   They're still just [r/onetruegod](http://www.reddit.com/r/onetruegod)   [Lose Yourself.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmXumtgwtak)   They can't be that paranoid.  ..   ..*can they?*      He never said that..   I SWEAR, UK. IF YOU SAY A GODDAMN WORD ABOUT IT I WON'T TALK TO YOU EVER AGAIN.   What about [There Will Be Blood](http://static.rogerebert.com/uploads/movie/movie_poster/there-will-be-blood-2008/large_gULACAZnPnyauix3mgMKG63UkXt.jpg) and [No Country for Old Men](https://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/images/info/80/2008_01_picture_nocountry_big.jpg)?   For anyone that's interested, this is the full track that plays when Simba meets Rafiki and [has one last talk with Mufasa as father and son.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE_1NGhMwHQ) It comes from an unreleased extended version of the Lion King soundtrack.   A few people have brought up the notion that the score heard in the trailer doesn't seem as memorable or as melodic to them as the original Superman theme by John Williams. There was widespread praise, but every good work is subject to critique.  Sorry, I worded my thoughts wrong on the title by saying "complaining". For the record, I can't stop replaying that trailer. It's incredible just for the music.   You're right. I think I worded it wrong in the title. I meant to refer to the notion that his music has more recently become music that we typically can't find ourselves "humming" along with. At most times, especially with The Dark Knight, his music ends up being a perfect complement to the film, even changing the way the industry works at times (see the overuse of *brrraahhh* in movie trailers today, or the emulations of the anxiety and suspense inducing cello string for the Joker's theme); but looking back at it in a musical perspective, it ends up being almost forgettable to someone who wouldn't remember the context of the movie.  I never fail to get a chill down my spine when I listen to "Rise" from the TDKR soundtrack, but it's because I remember that ending scene, and what emotions that moment gave me as a viewer. It's different from when I hear the theme to "Jurassic Park". It's a melody that invokes beauty on its own to such a large audience without having to know any context at all.   I always get frustrated that I can't find a good way to play the theme to The Dark Knight on a piano. Most of the time nobody would be able to recognize it when I play at a bar; but I've had a number of people asking me what I just played when I play the Jurassic Park theme, and tell me it sounded beautiful.  This is just my thoughts from what I've experienced as a musician and filmmaker. I don't mean to state any of it as fact. I put a link to The Lion King up because it invokes that same feeling I get from a John Williams track. People fall in love with the melody of The Lion King, or even "Time" by Zimmer, without necessarily having to remember or know the movie. I wanted to remind people how capable of that he still is.    [This set image of him as Electro was also released a few weeks ago.](http://i.imgur.com/AGDJXzQ.jpg)       The Social Network won best soundtrack that year.   Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?   I see it as the story being told from a different perspective, or through a different lens, when told by Galadriel at the beginning of Fellowship. There's a certian theatricality in the way Sauron was forging the ring and fighting the Last Alliance that made it seem like the story was told in a perceptive way.    The difference in the way Bilbo found the ring in The Hobbit: AUJ can simply be argued as how it looked from Bilbo's perspective. He was telling the story from the beginning, after all.    In a way, it lets the audience decide what was actuality and what was perspective. It's like we're allowed to imagine things out in the movie universe as if it's still a book. That's refreshing to me.   Thanks for doing this. A lot of people are bringing up the the negative points in your career, but I wouldn't worry too much about the people that are just trying to get a reaction out of you.  That being said, I'm an aspiring writer/director, and I wanted to ask about the beef you've had with with people in the industry. How does it affect how you work? How has it affected the direction of your career? Is that sort of publicity something that becomes significant in how it affects you based on what your career's been through?   She'll wait a couple months and she gon see   How you see the film in 2013 is how it looked right down to the bone when it was shot. The increased contrast and saturation was a common thing used in films, and it worked and looked good for the medium.   When they have to digitally convert the entire movie for IMAX and 3D screens, it becomes problematic for two reasons. One is that when blowing the images up, the adjustment in saturation and contrast will result in a grainier look not fit for bigger screens. The other is that the grading of the original wouldn't convert well into 3D at all. Think of the 2013 version as the clearest, normal image they could work with. It's an emulation of how films shot digitally look today.   The color grading is also starting to be used by different directors in this style if they want to make the film look old for their narrative. Ben Affleck does it with Argo by blowing up the picture to make it grainier, along with shooting it in film to give it that exact lush color grading.   That statement itself is an absolute.   You were just so excited to show us your comment that you couldn't wait past 6 minutes to screenshot it.   You guys are the bane of my existence.   DFW here as well. The speed is consistently good the closer I am to the city. However, it starts to teether between EDGE and 3G by the time I get around Richardson or Plano.   Have Echoes, Silence, Patience   Grace. I'm checking out the other.   ...aand I fucked up on the spelling there. Forgive me.       I would have been euphoric myself in that moment.   txt me   The reason they called themselves Lincoln Park in the first place was because they wanted to make sure people don't associate their name with a certain type of music that they play. That the names a name, and they progress how they feel with their music. It's because the domain name for a website was too expensive for them that they changed the spelling to Linkin Park.   In their defense, the song 'Iridescent' was completely fucked over after they remixed it for the movie. It ruins the buildup of an otherwise good song with decent lyrics with the same shitty pop beat layered over the entire thing. [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpt7RJUGpdE) the actual song if anyone wants to try it out.    Mike is the most versatile member, a co-producer of their past three records, and the member who contributes most to the music industry through different business partnerships, but that shouldn't detract him from the rest of the band when it comes to Linkin Park's music itself.   Mike Shinoda had the opportunity to graduate with a college degree, but Chester grew up witnessing a few of his friends die and knowing a few that committed suicide. He had a time when he was addicted to crystal meth shortly before the band found him by luck through a newspaper ad and hired him. He never really ended up venturing beyond that when the band kicked off.   Even then, he's come a long way. He's always the most well spoken person in any interview the band is given.   Put it on top and make sure you have Sarif on.    I'll be updating you as soon as it's ready.    It comes with Sarif! The lock screen alone is worth it.    Sorry about that. The link's up now. I'm going to work on one for the 4 and 4S too, so hopefully I'll have it up by tonight. It's 12 PM here right now. Thanks for the patience! I'll update you as soon as I'm done.    Oh, damn! I'm sorry man. I was up studying at around 3 AM when I wrote that, so I was a bit delirious. Anyway, I edited the link in now so it should work. Hope you like it!   Update: I just got the okay from [Cody Gordon](http://reddit.com/user/WhiteBaron) to go ahead and upload the mod. Here's the package specifically edited generously by him so it's as convenient to install as possible. He told me to let everyone know that they will have to move the lockscreen wallpaper (bg_ip5.png) into Sarif.theme if they want to use it. The mod is also designed only for the iPhone 5.   https://www.dropbox.com/s/whkgyym4uwct9ly/Sarif%20Black.theme.zip   I'll try making one for the iPhone 4 if you guys ask. Hope you all like it.  EDIT: Just wanted to give a shoutout to the developer of Sarif. He's been looking over what I sent him to make sure it's done right so you guys don't have any problems. The guy's awesome. I strongly recommend you buy the theme and support him, even if you don't want the mod I worked on. It's a sick look on the phone, and something anyone can really appreciate.    Good stuff, man. I like the wallpaper.   I'm sent a message to the original developer for permission before I send the mod out. I'll have it posted as soon as I get the okay!   Will do. Just a heads up, I didn't mean icons from outside sources. I was referring to the icons that come with the Sarif package itself, the ones you have to buy. The custom wallpaper and keypad is the only thing I'm giving out.  I altered the theme so that you have to separately buy Sarif in order for it to work. I'll check with him first, though. Thanks for the information!  Edit: He got back to me letting me know it's fine. Thanks for helping me with contacting him again!   Let me get to you in about an hour when I get out of class. I'll edit into this comment with a link to the theme and hopefully be able to help out with the icon packs.   The icons are provided by the creator of the original theme. You can go to the website [here](http://codylg.com/work/iphone/sarif/) and find information on how to get them. They come in packages and get updated pretty often.   I'm really picky on themes, but [Sarif](http://codylg.com/work/iphone/sarif/) was an instant buy for me because of how thorough, professional, and simple it is. I did want it to fit my "all-black-everything" taste, though, so I designed a makeover that essentially replaces the brown wooden look of the theme with a black wooden look instead. It fits in perfectly with the Black UI mod that Sarif comes with.    If you guys like it, I can put up a link for the theme package itself for those who ask. You will need to download Sarif for it to work, but it's completely worth the $2.00 and I highly recommend it.      I didn't think he could pull it off, but I didn't notice Samuel L. Jackson as Samuel L. Jackson at all in Django Unchained. I absolutely hated the man he was playing on screen. Every time he was on screen, I just wanted to beat the shit out of him. And then I realized that this actor is still amazing at what he does: suspending my belief.   The first time I ever saw him in a movie was when I watched The Lost World: Jurassic Park as a kid. Naturally, now I only see him as that guy from Jurassic Park everytime I see him in a romantic comedy.   Also, I can't take The Lost World seriously anymore everytime he shows up in it now.   You... have an iPhone 5...   I'm having trouble downloading and opening the shared.artwork filr in Safari or Dropbox. Can someone help me out with this?    Looking through this thread, I'm seeing that many people don't really know the full story that made Trent Reznor do this, so I'll try filling it in.   The reason Trent found it wrong was because while he was touring with Nine Inch Nails in Australia, he came across a record store that had his album for over $30, while there was an Avril Lavigne from the same respective label being sold for $21.99.   When he called Universal asking him why there's a price difference between the two, their response was, "It's because we know you have a real core audience that will pay whatever it costs when you put something out -- you know, true fans. It's the pop stuff we have to discount to get people to buy."   This is what made Trent do what he did at that concert. He's not another guy saying "Fuck you, establishment!", but he is challenging his label executives on the morality of their business.   It's not about the currency exchange difference.

The Dark Knight Returns. A good rendition of Frank Miller's novel would be incredibly engaging. It'd be good to see that, keeping in mind that it's geared toward an older audience. Batman has become something that people of all ages have come to love. This would be a good one for the more mature population.  I'm always late to these posts. Damn.   I loved it. If you think of The Lion King as a Disney's retelling of Hamlet, like others have pointed out before, then thinking of Simba's Pride as their retelling of Romeo and Juliet is a cool way of appreciating the storylines and themes of the two movies.   *Karm-   Oh.

 I must say though. I quite enjoyed the movie.    Master Chief  Keepin it real like a boss   Savage   Did he live?   Honestly, i'd be so pissed. Idgaf if you're drunk.   Holy shit. Now I'm curious as to what happened to her   Fat = fukno   I've been there. The first impression I got of the place was *wizard*    Wut   I'm thinking something like this (http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/06/04/66/060466c8fa8e39e8784a36df7e56a7a2.jpg)  But bigger and more majestic. It has a rustic, sort of magical architecture style.    I'll say that the new novel coming out written by Frank O'Connor covers this exact topic. The humanity and consciousness of AI.   Cuz her handwriting is that good. Pshh   Holy shit. Beard   This made me laugh.   I feel like that would inhibit gains though :/      That dude in the background lmao   Bro your hair isn't horrible. Just get it shortened on the sides.    Free biscuits?   Jon. Will you be uploading to machinima, or staying on your old channel   Doubt it   Never. Browse. /r/politics. That is the biggest cesspool of Bernie circlejerking and liberal mob mentality I've ever seen.  On topic. Halo 5 plays nothing like other shooters, and the ADS operates nothing like it does in any other game.   Pretty. Keep the dark hair, goes great with your eyes. But going to need more pics in a different pose. 7.5/10   Yeah. But, who gives a shit.    Are you being serious?    Do you know what a straw man fallacy is? That's what I'm referring too. And I never said he doesn't believe what he's saying, or stand by it. But he spouts ridiculous statements about the economy that amount to nothing more then blaming rich people for societies problems.   Usually I get downvoted into oblivion when I share a critical view of what is essentially the mob mentality that Sanders is encouraging. Seriously, it's just populist rhetoric based on socialism. /r/politics is the biggest cesspool of mob mentality and has a clear lack of any critical thinking skills.   I could go on about Sanders but I'm still baffled that this guy can garner so much support without saying a single thing of substance.    People are calling New Blood their favorite. Apparently it was masterfully written.   What a fucking idiot. Seriously, everything this guy says is Straw man.    Ben got absolutely *rekt* by our boy Chips Dubbo.       Absolutely disgusting.   Wait. I thought it was only freshmen that had to live on campus?   Eh. I like Matt Smith   Yes. But there will just be another set of armor underneath that.   Damn. Kinda feel bad for the kid. Doesn't even look like a burgeoning neckbeard   10/10 redhead and Cap   I want Johnson back.    Much has, but much hasn't. I guarantee that unless it's involved in banking or drugs, the money has been earned legitimately. By nature, a business's duty to society is to make a profit. It's the tell tale sign as to whether it's needed and contributing. When profit is made, money has exchanged hands and a mutual exchange of goods or service for money has occurred. That business owner is being rewarded for his contribution. This happens even with the "evil corporations" Sanders wants to stop. So the more competitive the market, the harder it is to game the system.   The issue happens when there is no competition and then prices can gauge. Example, cable and internet companies. In this case, government regulations strangled it. Which Sanders supports. So for a variety of reasons. Capitalism  socialism in pretty much every way.  It's hard to define free flowing economy because technically it already is if it's not government. Then it would only be in other people's accounts but spread out, so it wouldn't be nearly as effective. Bill Gates can invest that money, help his own enterprise, or donate it. Which applies for most rich people and benefits the economy more then redistributing it would.    And super cool shit that's otherwise rare and hard to do.  Like this.   Like I said, neither of them are war mongers. But the economic situation is a lot more complicated then that. Like... *a lot*. Chances are, if that money ended up in someone's bank account, they either:   1.) Had illustrious government help. Bailouts, banking cabals, cable and internet companies, funding etc etc. Basically **crony** capitalism and exempt from market competition.   2.) Benefited society in some way to generate that capital. Take Bill Gates for example, he made his money in a way that helped society advance. He did so with no government help. Look at Elon Musk. Same example, whom without his billions in the bank account, wouldn't have been able to start SpaceX or Tesla. BOTH benefiting society in a way the government never could.   Redistribution of wealth (if that's what you're arguing for) are basically universally bad and have the opposite of the desired effect.   What should be done is ending corporate welfare and creating a competitive field in the market. Which mah boi Rand wants to do. And this nearly universally improves the economy.    He's in a difficult position, but he's more of a libertarian. He has many socially liberal views but has to appeal to a socially conservative base. So his official position on certain issues are to leave it up to the states. Even though he's introduced a bill to legalize marijuana on a federal level, and has been open in his position on ending the drug war.   When the debate happens, Rand v Sanders. It's going to be almost completely economic. In recent years we've had candidates that were extremely similar to each other and only differed when it came to smaller issues.  Now we have candidates that *generally* share the classic American view pertaining to foreign policy and social issues, but couldn't be further apart in regard to the economy.    It was a completely different time. You can't compare the community then to know and still have a legitimate point about the game.   I believe Rand Paul to have the same honesty but with views more aligning with my own. Specifically pertaining to economics; I simply can't support the socialist views. However, if anyone other then Rand wins the Republican primary, then I'd vote Sanders. If it becomes Hillary v Bush/Cruz or whatnot. I'm voting third party.    They've been pretty popular since the 40's. Either way, that's one thing I respect him for. He's consistent and honest about his positions, unlike Hillary or Bush.     Basically. But the Brits like their traditions. I think it would make for an interesting story.   Or both the royal kids. I'd read it and then watch it when it is inevitably made into visual form media.   What a fucking idiot who spouts nothing more than populist rhetoric with no empirical evidence to prove his point. Have fun with your straw man.   Wait. So kids just keep dying? In pattern out of no where?   That's fucking brutal. How was there no criminal prosecution for the rapes?   I believe the response was a good one from what I can tell. Common sense says don't let someone stay that's not supposed too.   Bring back these physics   BERNIEBERNIEBERRRR   What part of OH? I'm from there.    It's not that bad anymore honestly. Occasional dickbag here and there but it's getting better.   Maxi pads. Apparently   You'd feel the same way if you got to hunt the chief   Seriously, this guy has put up with some shit since launch that likely go above and beyond his job description, then he routinely responds to people on Twitter experiencing issues. He also writes some amazing and detailed updates letting us know what is happening along with the thought process that goes into it. I also hear he lurks here and posts occasionally.   Then goes and casts the HCS like a boss.   So bravo, Bravo.  Plus, thank you Josh Holmes for interacting with Beyond. Great stuff over there.  [after glancing at his post history](http://giant.gfycat.com/AncientCarefulAnaconda.gif)   Great update.   Bro. It's been admitted in this form multiple times.

He got so much undeserved shit from Jimmy because Chuck didn't have the balls to tell him himself   I've always wondered how BB had the best character development   Great post.   Honestly, you have a rare natural beauty about you. 9/10   I think the reason you may look young is your height. But you still got it goin on.   Don't have the game mode. Could probably get it though. GT: ZeALoTT   Gamertag is ZeALoTT. Looking to play some customs or even grifball. Just add me and send an invite whenever you'd like to play.   Get the fuck out. Just get. The. Fuck. **OUT**     file browser is a necessity.   343 is denying me a basic halotural right that Bungie would have bestowed upon me as soon as I broke that clear plastic film with a knife and gently slid my disk in to my Xbox one to experience the n**BR**vana.   I could be tagging pictures and maps with g4y, I'd out BR you, bush d1d 9/11, and phagit just like the glory days.    1.) MCC is playable  2.) Halo 5 is shaping up to be great. Tons of info on the *arena* out there. Plus, the lore and story is looking to be pretty good. So some research. But you might not like the way it looks, but you have to play it. I've seen people hate the way out looks and think it's going to suck, only to fall in love when they play it  3.) The halo community is not what it was. But it ***is*** growing.   So just a typical asshole twat.   They are. But I'm at a regional campus at the moment, :/  I'll be in Columbus next year though.   I gotta go with maybe Joe Staten doing the grunts. Nathan Fillion as Buck perhaps.   I saw people talking about it to on Yak so I was wondering.   Is this an English bulldog or an Olde English Bulldogge?    No. On many levels. No. They are easily still in their prime and given GEN2. Could wreck a IV      Will there be corgis?   What dicks.    I don't think chief is going to let innocent people die for the greater good. That's what ONI does   That was a really good analysis. You make good points. I keep thinking this would make a really good political/action drama   I'm curious. They could have stole a pelican. But they wouldn't get far without slipspace capabilities. I'm just wondering how chief is even traveling.   Nah I'd do it.   Damn, super pretty. You have amazing hair and gorgeous eyes the compliment your style. Plus, a *killer* smile.   Would approach and talk.    Like I said. On a good day, it pulls upwards of 21k on average during peak hours.   Yup. Honestly, that game is the shit. It's current competitive settings (MLG V7) are probably the best iteration out of any halo. The custom games community is flourishing because of how customizable forge and games are, the campaign and customization options are great. Plus the file browser makes it easy to find maps, games, and other community creations.   It had so much potential if it had only launched with better maps, and the TU settings.    Fuck no. This guy knows absolutely nothing about economics.    Idk why you got downvoted. It is easily the best version of competitive halo by far.    Good luck to you, Spartan.    No one at the moment.    It'd be a shame if they.... lost all of them   Our impenetrable fortress among the stars...   Bear in mind. I believe that is only the atmosphere that is on fire.

They won't. They want it to be special for lore fans, yet still understandable by casual fans. They are making it with your concern in mind   If we're purely looking at the outcomes, ODSTs don't do suicide missions. And then I'd say SIVs perform, act, and were trained more like ODSTs. SIIIs however, had slightly better augmentations than S4s, plus the advantage of augmentation at puberty and post augment being close to par with IIs, and have been raised since childhood as Spartans.   Give them GEN2 armor and they'll wreck an S4. Not to knock the IVs, but we gotta remember the hierarchy here. I get why you explained it that way though.   I think you got it backwards with the IIIs and IVs.    And that's saying something.   11/10   Jet fuel can't melt dank bemez   So they really are the superior Spartans.

But we never see a blade fall through him. Plus we don't know the surrounding terrain or tech. There is a slim chance he survived, but unlikely. But then again, unlikely things happen in that universe.    His helmet was off and on the ground while he was still alive, that was the POV during the final scene. PLUS he had been kicking elites off of him that entire time. What's to say he didn't kick the one off and sprint his ass away and hitch a ride off planet.   	107

 The theist posits that there is a "God" with some baring on human life, but fails to provide a coherent definition of God or indeed the slightest bit of evidence for its existence. A good skeptic has no time for such baseless assertions, and is therefore not a theist--they are rather a non-theist, an *a*theist, to use the popular prefix. Atheism is nothing more or less than that.   Great video. I'm reminded of how even as a populist entertainer, Chaplin was widely credited with many of the innovations that led early cinema to be recognized as a serious medium of art and expression; seems appropriate that his work should be paired with similarly ambitious games.   I saw this bright-eyed post of optimism, and decided to make a joke about how any second this notoriously bitter and critical subreddit will begin telling you what you're doing wrong.  Little did I know, the top three posts were already discouragement. Jesus, people.   What a stupid world.   That's what I was looking for. Thanks!   presumably he was a non-student? what were the repercussions?   Is there any legal weight behind it? I'm an alumnus, so I'm not worried about holds.   That's silly.   If I ever feel like watching hard core misogynists execute dozens of people without due process because they think God told them to, I'll join al Quaeda. But I won't, because that's fucking crazy.   That little brother thing hurt a lot more when we were consistently losing football games. I think we can safely co-opt it now.   [Nope, just confused.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qHP7VaZE)   hmm... had no idea that subreddit existed. I was just using it as a general term for denizens of r/atheism.   It's okay, this is just a part of his growing up process. Be sure to sure to politely stand by your convictions and consistently go on the record in favor of tolerance... it'll make coming out of the closet that much easier for him.   As an alumnus of your younger sibling University (if you even went to Michigan!), I'm probably a little biased.      You have fixed nothing, Andy51. NOTHING.   Das ist sehr gut! Ja! Glcklich! Ein Dner bitte!      While your friend is oversimplifying things a bit, I do see where he's coming from and largely sympathize: there are huge segments of modern philosophical thought that either ignore or directly attack the scientific method as a useful avenue for obtaining knowledge. I think this stems from  insecurity about sharing or ceding the discipline's historical position as sole harbinger of truth. Philosophy enthusiasts either consciously or unconsciously try to ensure its continued relevance by downplaying science, and in return hard scientists become increasingly hostile toward the discipline of philosophy. In my opinion, this is harmful toward both fields of study.  Unfortunately, it seems that this simplistic liberal arts vs. sciences binary keeps popping up everywhere. r/philosophy is littered with complaints about r/atheism. There's an all-too-common assumption in this subreddit and, in my experience, wider liberal arts academia that one can end a debate by accusing someone of "scientism" or "positivism" or "empiricism," in much the same way that Fox News employs "socialism." It's embarrassing.  None of this is to say that science is beyond question; indeed everything of value should be questioned. But the thing is, science loves to be questioned, *demands* to be questioned, and employs a rigorous system of empiricism *and* rationality to ensure its own accuracy. The pure skeptic could call this a closed loop, but at that point they've argued themselves back inside Descartes's head. That is undoubtedly a crucial point in anyone's philosophical development, but there's so much more to the human experience when we step outside into the "real" world, and use science to further our asymptotic progression toward understanding what "reality" is.  Anyway, your friend and I are hardly alone in feeling this way. I highly recommend [John Searle's U.C. Berkeley course on Philosophy of Mind](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/philosophy-132-001-spring/id438307693), downloadable on iTunes; Searle has a special talent for contextualizing modern scientific developments against the history of philosophy, and, in my opinion, cutting through the bullshit. The future of philosophy *is* married to science, and vice versa.    I'm interested in this too, particularly for Hulu. Anybody know any solutions on that front?   Exactly. That is the moral of drugs in my life.   Are shirts available?   I subscribe to both subreddits, I've seen a lot of interesting content and stimulating discussion in both, but fuck fuckity fuck does it piss me off when r/philosophy goes off the rails into this post-fucking-modern anti-"scientism" bullshit. There are genuinely only two possibilities here:  1) "Foundationalistic, verification empiricist-heavy" research, while imperfect, engages with universal truths that exist independent of human thought to the extent that any contradictory manmade "truths" are inherently false  ***or***  $) Poodle fluke unicorn fuckwad jiggity joop mubble zook. Fuck.   **EDIT**: I thought it might be kind if funny--and, full disclosure, pretty honest--to argue the antithesis of the O.P.'s point with a comparable level of rage and frustration. I have now been downvoted.  Seriously though, if you're arguing for an understanding of truth antithetical to science, then you're arguing for a philosophy with no baring on the the human experience or indeed any other component of the decidedly law-based universe, so you might as well just floobley fuck woopty zoop.   That's what I mean--I used to think of G4 as a solid niche network, something I could flip to and see something fun, something I was actually pretty pumped to have on my cable package when I lived in a college dorm. Now it's fucking Cheaters and Cops.  Seriously, is it worth drawing the half-hourly ratings bump of the crowd that actively seeks out Cheaters if it compromises the network brand so badly? Any network heads misunderstanding their target demographic this badly should be fucking fired.      that's not terribly surprising; did any of the other consoles do that in the jump to HD?   I stopped thinking about any of these people as soon as I graduated from college. Seriously, it was like a light switch.   yup   Yeah, I get a whole lot of "Sorry, I actually hate Ted"s also.   hmm. bummer.   When I was pursuing *my* useless film degree, my first feature script was a deadly serious, deeply personal disaster movie called "The Ground is Lava." It involved a self-centered stand-in for my self-centered self trying to stave off nihilism while futilely trying to engage with other human beings in his world as God and the Devil fought each other until they both disappeared in a fit of pointlessness, and also the ground was literally lava. I knew that it was dumb as soon as I finished it, but that didn't stop it from being any more devastating when my unbacked-up laptop was stolen from *my* disreputable living quarters.  Needless to say, I can relate to Jason Segel's early situation as well.  But you know what? I love film, and I love my own stupid self, and I fully plan on loving the stupid no-budget revision of "The Ground is Lava" that I still intend to shoot sometime in the next year or two, because fuck it.   Yeah, I got a whole lot of "Have you met Ted?"s before ever seeing an episode of the show.         it *is* you! yay!   Ron... Paul, is it? Liberty, you say? *He's* certainly never appeared on Reddit before! God bless you and your heretofore unspoken message, Masterbench.   The game "Tanks" from the [*Wii Play*](http://www.amazon.com/Wii-Play-No-Remote-Nintendo/dp/B0013E9HP6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1325875885 sr=8-1) collection took up many happy hours between my college housemates and I. Works best with a second nunchuck.   "Better" is obviously a subjective word. My point isn't about the number of tracks in their library, but rather the sonic and emotional breadth of it. Whatever stimulation I might want out of music--emotion, melodicism, creative orchestration, sonic experimentalism, nostolgia, rebellion, dance music, heavy music, light music, humor, misery, joy, etc.--there is always a segment of the Beatles' catalog that I can turn to, and mine is hardly a unique experience. The Beatles were capable of and accomplished more than Win Butler, and don't really see a debate to be had there.  Again, you can like whatever you want, but it's silly to say that the suburban-angst-on-loop music of Arcade Fire can stand next to the Fucking Beatles Discography--it isn't even *trying* to accomplish the same thing. I like "Wake Up" and "No Cars Go" as much as the next guy, but come on.   In their ten years of existence, Arcade Fire have written three good to great albums of melancholy baroque pop.  In the Beatles' ten years of existence, they wrote all of the fucking Beatles' music.  Like whatever you want, but your opinion doesn't make their anthologies comparable.   If a song needed a standard rock and roll drum pattern, Ringo would play it.  If it needed a radical departure from all pop/rock drumming heard at the time, he'd play that to.  [Tomorrow Never Knows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a3NcwfOBzQ)  [Come Together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Aa8aKN4jwo)  [Strawberry Fields](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ICzQn_AHc)  [Rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPjDMZiuhbQ)  [A Day in the Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF4oQCG4vOc)   Looks like they changed it now; you can see from the half-time update that if started out as a way different article.      There is a politics to his distaste for Transformers, particularly in the creepy way that the camera ogles commercial products, destruction and women in the same pornographic fashion in what is ostensibly a kid's film. He sums it up nicely in [this showstopping review](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g__bQ-Y7D8Q) of the second one.   When reduced to the quantum level, the laser has no direction. There is a range, yes, but the absolute simply isn't there.  I've always known that quantum particles behave differently, as I'm sure everyone else does, but this video just made the point real to me that it doesn't just appear that way because of an intrinsic limit on our knowledge. There is a threshold over which absolute truth does not exist.      Do you have the slightest bit of evidence?   And how!   Is it okay that I didn't laugh? Like, not because I'm offended, but because overt shock racism on the internet is entirely played out for me?   Aw. That first frame almost makes me want to believe again.   Your interesting point on this complex issue is somewhat undone by  I read a survey recently, I forget where  Lucky for you, I backed up your claim with a quick google search; the survey I believe you're citing is in the "Motivated for Others" section of [this link](http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub179.pdf)--you might consider bookmarking that for future arguments.  Thing is though, it's wrong to assume that soldiers' personal motivations are antithetical to "the right thing," at least in their minds. Most soldiers I know enlist because they receive personal benefits by (to their mind) serving society, much like a doctor makes a ton of money by treating illness. Your implication that the average soldier is fundamentally self-serving is severely undermined by the article I believe you're citing, as the overwhelming majority of soldiers are on the record as valuing their squadmates' lives as much if not more than their own; whether or not you see that as "principle," it is undoubtedly selflessness.  You and I are in almost total agreement on the practical realities of our military's role in the world, but the fact remains that the vast majority of enlisted servicemen and women believe they are doing good. If your worldview and argument are based on a conception of the typical U.S. soldier torturing and killing civilians for personal gain, I invite you to examine the ways in which you yourself may be a victim of ideological indoctrination.   Also, it doesn't follow the new character capitalization rule of screenwriting--it's not a hard law or anything, but the Dark Night script certainly followed it, even going so far as to capitalize emphasized props. I suspect we're looking at a transcript.   All this movie did for me was remind me how much I love Spike Jonze's *Where the Wild Things Are*. When I want a sprawling, visually beautiful representation of childhood emotions at war with an incomprehensible universe, I prefer puppets to be involved.   But lazy is *the greatest news media conspiracy of all!*  I'm not entirely joking.   Regardless of how you or I personally feel, it is a divisive issue in philosophy of mind, as evidenced by my links above. If the subjective experience is a form of knowledge, it is literally the only form of knowledge that is inherently inarticulable, which to my mind does make it worthy of linguistic segregation, or at least specificity.   Well, now that the fantastically silly "science is lying to you" answers are out of the way, what you're talking about is [qualia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), perhaps best summed up in the ["What Mary Knew"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%27s_room) thought experiment. It's my understanding that there's no clear consensus on whether or not qualia constitute a form of knowledge. I personally consider the outsider with research and data to have "more" knowledge on the subject, but that may change as we begin to better understand consciousness.   Ah yes. I remember watching your audition, and thinking "yup, he's a redditor."  How did the process of arranging your own backing tracks work? Did you just give them a track to play, or was there some kind of involvement from their music department?   Whatever your personal journey has been, I'm genuinely happy for you that you've arrived at something you consider happiness and enlightenment--I was raised Catholic, I can relate. My point is that beautiful snowflake that you are, we're all beautiful snowflakes here: it's the philosophy subreddit, we're *all* pretentious assholes who view the world in terms of invisible social influences. Instead of writing like a cult leader and spreading your words across subreddits 'cause you're just that important, try engaging us as fellow thinking people. Don't try to enlighten us, try to relate to us. I suspect we've got more in common than you think, and arrogant pricks that we are, we don't like being talked down to. :)   I don't mean to sound like a dick, but the self-important prose, deliberately obtuse multi-subreddit format, and general air of enlightened superiority revealing heretofore unknown thruths make this post really fucking annoying. Yes, high school sucked, yes, we're aware of vaguely sinister social systems operating on us, yes, everybody hurts sometimes. Welcome to Reddit.   Great pop album, well worth a  [listen.](http://grooveshark.com/#/album/Good+and+Evil/6463716)      Prompted by "fuck basic courtesy." I just give people the argument they seem to want.   Yup, it's proven to be pretty dubious--again, beautiful sentiment, but it seems fairly disingenuous to attribute it to Aurelius. I just believe people should check the toilet for purple ass unicorns, so to speak, so I'm satisfied.   No, It's an example of a falsifiable claim presented as a belief, made without evidence. Try taking some of that effort you're expending trying to be clever, and maybe route it toward actually keeping up with the substance of what we're fucking talking about.   Oh for fuck's sake. This same quote gets voted to the top of the subreddit  every few month, *and every single fucking time* nobody can point to the passage this is allegedly from. The closest passage that invariably comes up conveys a sentement that is *almost entirely entirely at odds with the factual fucking semantics* of the quote above, namely that we needn't fear because gods are undoubtedly real and just. The quote above is a lovely fucking sentiment, but if someone is going to claim they know something about this topic and say "yeah that sounds right," *it's completely fucking reasonable to ask for a citation.*  Also, "opinion" has nothing to do with this. If I say "I believe Star Wars is a good movie" that's an opinion. If I say "I believe purple fucking unicorns are flying out of my ass" that's something else entirely. The second relates to an independent truth or falsehood, and therefore my beliefs are irrelevant to whether or not the statement has value. If I say I have purple fucking unicorns flying out of my ass, and somebody notes that there's not one shred of evidence that purple fucking unicorns are flying out of my ass, and *flying fucking purple ass unicorns get voted to the top of the atheism subreddit multiple times per year without ever giving so much as a purple ass whinny or neigh to prove their existence*, then my belief statement is entirely worthless until I can finger the exact corner of my asshole that shits purple ponies.  Also, speaking of assholes, you are one. I know you're just gonna absorb that into the take-no-prisoners truth teller self perception schema you've got going on here, but seriously, it's not cute. Grow up.   Well, that was a pain in the ass to read.   So to recap: a wishy washy fact is voted toward the top, but because the poster *knows and acknowledges* it's wishy washy, that means that anyone who wants citation is a "dickhead." This is a "truth" that trumps basic courtesy, and it's a "truth" worth defending three replies deep into this stupid thread. Yes?   For us, calling people dickheads without warrant is just not very nice. If you think morality requires citation, I know some theists who have books for you. :)   Citation is needed if the comment is to carry any weight. By including his credentials, he lends the "maybe" statement more credibility than otherwise--it reads as a credible statement of fact, even if he does hedge his bets. That means that it's worth evaluating as a true or false factual statement, and that citation is required for such evaluation. None of which implies any wrongdoing on mrBWB's part, just that his popular comment conveying an unconfirmed fact would be more valuable if cited.  Regardless, no need to call mleeeeeee a dickhead.

In my experience, the humanities have unfortunately been far less open to structured, methodical criticism, largely because major segments of thought seem to be wrapped up in the idea that there is no truth. Try telling someone in my former English department that you're a logical positivist, they'll look at you with pure condescending pity before ignoring everything you say.   this.   Fair enough, though I think that the fact that they had no expertise was pretty much the point. It's one isolated incident, and it's then left to us to critically examine whether or not similar propagation of trendy bullshit is happening elsewhere. My personal distaste for the anti-science strains of postmodernism notwithstanding, I think that it's always worthwhile to be reminded that reason and substance *should* trump authority and fashion, even if that's not always the case in popular thought.      No, actually, fuck everything about this post and the fact that it gets a positive reception here. 1) This is not a gender-specific behavior, and 2) it's fucking ridiculous to address this criticism to *all* women. This is completely fucking sexist, Reddit, and also completely fucking embarrassing.   I was just wondering about the likelihood of ever including solo Beatle performances of Beatles songs as DLC -- Lennon's 1972 ["Come Together,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHJAZZTTXiw) Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh version of ["Something,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSTIg08bguk) McCartney's many excellent live versions of ["Hey Jude,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVJMhnPzhts) ["Helter Skelter,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV18scOsX54) etc. I know they have different licensing then the studio Beatles versions, as they often appear on music sites that don't stream original Beatles songs, and these songs deserve to be played with pro keys parts. Other Lennon and McCartney tracks have appeared before, so why not these? Do you think there's any likelihood, and would anyone else be interested?   Hey now. *Everyone* is better than those people.   Flaming Lips!   damn, you got us.         You know, I've never followed Edge, but that list is right up my alley. I maintain that Rock Band 3 is *the* perfect music game.      This capitalist grading system, much like real capitalism, works perfectly if everyone starts off on equal footing. It would be far more accurate to start every student with their parents' cumulative GPA heavily weighted in.

I think they'd only sue if the person kept re-uploading the video, fully aware of his/her copyright infringement.  But they'd have to send a cease-and-desist before they brought the person to court   It's possible that they were singing songs owned by Universal Music Publishing, which Maker signed a deal with them that allows their partners to use their library of music.  It's also possible that Maker just didn't see those videos where they were singing those songs   I don't know why they haven't yet.

Put a video on private so that no claims can be made against it until the Grumps resolve the issue by either censoring the singing or changing it to a parody of the original song.  Here's something I feel everyone who doesn't understand what a MCN like Maker is or does should read: (it covers all the basics)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-channel_network   To protect the Grumps from legal action from the songs' owners.  Plain and simple. They may have had an insider tip that some people in the industry were litigiously searching for copyright infringements on youtube.  All it takes is three strikes and your channel is shut down permanently. Game Grumps has more than three videos that could be flagged for copyright infringement. And Youtube treats you as guilty until proven innocent.  Exchange of advice for money was *just an example* of the services that MCNs provide. For Game Grumps specifically, they find better brand deals and targeted advertising toward the demographic their audience is categorized as   You can't "display an entire work" if the work is interactive. One person's experience playing a game will be different than another's. Again, watching a video of gameplay is not the same as playing a game.   The LP video is a separate product entirely.  Fair use is a defense for when someone is taken to court over an issue such as this. (Civil laws are also upheld in court, in case you didn't know)  Two of the things a court would use to determine if Fair Use applies are: the nature of the copyrighted work (In LP cases: a platform for the real product, *Commentary* to be provided) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work. (This varies based on the game's quality, but it at least represents an honest portrayal, as opposed to game trailers or reviews)  Last, but certainly most important, **there is no absolute rules as to how much of a copyrighted work may be copied and still be considered a fair use.**  http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Fair_use     I didn't say they were parodying the game, they are providing commentary. Fair use protects parody AND commentary, two different things entirely. Distributing a video of them playing a game, with commentary, doesn't infringe copyright, because the game is not meant to be observed, but interacted with.  The legality of these videos hasn't been established because nobody's ever questioned it, but one day when someone brings a LPer to court (likely Nintendo) it will (hopefully) rule in this industry's favor, because they are not releasing the same product as the game company. Watching gameplay and playing a game are not the same thing.   My point is, it's in a grey area now, legally, but as long as it is a grey area, Nintendo is not entitled to that revenue.   I meant from a legal standpoint. If it's youtube we're talking, the biggest enemy is their policy of "you're guilty until proven innocent. And we won't listen to you when you try to prove your innocence"   The first one with Jon   Nintendo's been the biggest enemy since Let's Plays became a thing.  Truth is, Nintendo isn't entitled to the revenue because the players are providing commentary, which is the purpose of watching them.  This is considered a "transformative" use and is protected by copyright law.  I think the Grumps will just ignore Nintendo's greedy behaviors and play whatever they want   True, but usually deals like this would specify when they'd expire, if they do   lol, yes, i was being silly   Maker studios has signed a deal for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios   Okay, Mr. President, the floor is yours   No! Fuck this job! I don't need to answer phones all day for *your* ass! I QUIT!   Would you like the "All-You-Can-Eat-Teeth" special?   Oh look, a locked bathroom door when my parents are gone for the weekend...    [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4G0bYxuv7M)   just think.... several times a year they'll just keep changing it to something even shittier   **I'll start it off:**  "I'm having a waking nightmare,  I'm seeing colors in the sky...  Everybody wants to know about me,  but they don't know about my........  big ol' penis, flopping around,  it's three big feet of pleasure.  Put it in your mouth and put it in your vagine...  Everyone's having a real good time,  when they're hanging around my big floppy penis.  Can't quite stroke it really fast.  Covering three feet of skin with your hand isn't really easy.  Here's how fast I can jack my whole dick,  "Hah, ah, ah, ah, aaahhh."  That includes the back and forth motion,  let's do it again, "Ah aahhh."  "Ah ah ah ah ah ah aaahhhh..."  That's how fast I can jack my peen.  Everybody thinks that they have seen my penis,  but they haven't,  'cuz if they have...  they'd shit themselves.    Maker does not own his content, so his partnership with them is irrelevant. Youtube is an international platform and they also do not own his content.   Okay, I guess I didn't realize (or care) where he lives, but it seems he currently lives in England.  A quick search of England's definition of Fair Use seems to indicate that their copyright laws are nearly identical to America's.  BUT, I just found a neat little thing during my quick research:  Maker studios has signed a deal (as has Fullscreen) for their partners to be able to monetize and cover for the full library of music that is registered under Universal Music Publishing. http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1538590/universal-music-publishing-inks-deals-with-fullscreen-maker-studios  That's a pretty big conglomerate and is likely where he's getting this music from (I don't know though, I've only seen a video or two of his, and immediately had to click away before I destroyed my laptop)   I didn't miss it, I just felt like rectifying it. Too many people seem to think hearsay = fact   pretty loose with the word "confirmed" aren't you?   Sweden doesn't recognize all of the U.S's copyright laws.  There is also no broad statutory limitation of fair use or fair dealing in Sweden, so he's far more protected in this area than anyone from America, where you literally can't even sing a song without the rights to do so, or a mechanical license and royalty payments.   Not fact. Straight up myth  Edit: I already received a downvote for being factually accurate, so lemme post this here:  Fair use is a defense one can use if taken to court for using a copyrighted work without permission.   In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited (less than 30 seconds) and transformative purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner.  Game Grumps singing random songs (in most of their cases) even people on youtube singing cover songs are NOT covered by this. It's illegal because it is a violation of U.S copyright law   They weren't "assimilated" by them. Too many people fail to understand what a MCN is and what it does. This is what it boils down to; a channel signs with them and they find good brand deals, better CPM rates, advice for growing a fanbase, or production assistance in return for a very small cut of the channel's profits. The end.  Maker doesn't own them, therefore they couldn't have 'assimilated' them. They're still an independent channel. MCNs function like a talent agency.  As for whether they started out **partnering** with Maker, that depends on whether or not Egoraptor and Jon were partnered with them before starting the channel   You may now *kiss the bride*  (under his breath) ......ya filthy animal....   lol, that was really funny!   10 outta 10 would watch.  2 outta 10 might enjoy  :)      Will Jacques and Arin ever finish off the creators of Sonic 06?   man, people will complain about anything   I want you to know that I watched the whole video and didn't learn ONE DAMN THING! :)   Well, Arin originally conceived of the show as a podcast.  I'm curious as to what the format of it was before they decided to include gameplay   Maybe he's just working on something that just hasn't come out yet.  Like more Table Flip or editing Guild Grumps. Or maybe business-y shit. Or some secret, unrevealed projects.   you are correct. He's also in others.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=idiots+always+ask  I also can't count on my hands how many times I've seen this video posted on the subreddit   Because the point of the show is to talk and make jokes.

I hope being dead for three days didn't affect my brain cells   the wit is strong with this one :)   He's had several jobs, but the one he quit after Starbomb sold a lot of copies was at Maker Studios, which he's been pretty private about.    he used the word 'tutelage.'

Warning: Mature Content.  I've been looking to create more improvised content on my youtube channel. I've always ad-libbed here and there in my videos, but this is our first attempt at just straight improvising something from beginning to end and I'm actually quite proud of it, and wanted to share it with fellow improv aficionados.  I need to get my improvisation chops up because I'm conceptualizing a daily improv show/webseries   Why not a monthly Toon Grumps on Grumpout or Arin/Ross's channel?   What if they cancelled Game Grumps on April 1st purely by coincidence?  "Oh, Ross, I didn't even realize it was April Fool's Day... they all think we're joking..."      lol, the end of your comment had my sides hurtin a bit :D XD   There are so many explanations out there, but the gist of it is, it's impossible to put out content on a consistent basis. Therefore, the CPM rates are low (cost of an ad every time it reaches 1,000 people) and when your paycheck is low when you're already only putting out a video every few months, that's impossible to live on.

They missed ALL of the levels I was really looking forward to   Covering songs without paying for the rights is copyright infringement. That's why its an issue   That recent Endless Ocean 2 one-off was phenomenal   why does every rap battle on youtube have to steal the format of ERB?  And why are they so quiet? It's like they were recording the lyrics, but didn't want their mom to hear them. Not to mention that they don't enunciate a lot of those words, and rap in mumbles. Did they think it was okay to not be understandable as long as they include subtitles?  I'm not usually critical, but my god, that was horrible   10/10 Would Bang   Who is Adan?  	93
 A few months ago I stumbled upon a info chart that had a basic breakdown of many of the main strength training programs organized by experience levels. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and could provide a link I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!   i kept picturing tom arnold the whole time.   What is the time elapse between the two pics? Those results could easily be had. With correctives posture, lose of wight, even just water weight. Good lighting and good makeup. Sure.   When it's green both directions and you need to turn left. You wait till it's red then go. In slot of places it two cars on red.   One of these days - pink Floyd   I'm to busy but please will someone compile these into a spotify playlist.   Seriously this pic is like two years old. There's even a pic of this tree on google earth floating around somewhere. Common reddit your better than this.   Yah ask japan about that one   This would make a great short film.    Has anyone tried doing this with ugly faces   A few weeks ago I was doing heavy DLs and on my final lift i felt a strong pinch under my left butt cheek. Now whenever i do any kind of hip thrust movement involving weight i feel the pinch.   My understanding is that it may be my sciatic nerve and that i need to give it time to heal. But this means no deadlift, no squats, no good mornings. what can i do in the meantime to help maintain those lifts and if anyone has had this same problem what can i do to help recovery and how long should i expect to be out game.   I feel like accidentally awsome would make a good subreddit.   Laurence fishburn in Apocalypse Now. He's like 15 in it!   "Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead roll in a cage" - Pink Floyd    Had the beat in my head for months. The song was popular in sets like 2 years ago and it sampled the main bass line from the song CARS. Whenever i heard it i kept expecting the vocals to kick in but they never did. Its was big in the tech-house/funk scene. Any help is appreciated.   what was that stuff he sniffed right before his last lift?    Davis is not "basically part of sacramento" it's a medium sized town that despretly wants to keep its small town feel but get the pearks of a full blown city.

 I've only gone primarily mid lane eve this patch. Her clears are just too painful, and she doesn't really benefit from any other jungle items. (Devourer is nice, but farming the stacks isn't effective on her.)    BOTRK is absolute core on her. It increases her burst significantly, and gives her strong sustained damage and sticking potential. Manamune helps with her mana problems (you can't consistently use your passive in lane), plus it gives a massive damage increase when it's it's completed. You then have a choice between IBG or Triforce next, 90% of the time I go iceborn, as you often need that little extra tankyness to survive teamfights. From there it's more situational, but I usually go banshees, and I often pick up a last whisper as the majority of your damage is physical. Boots are an odd choice, as literally every single boot in the game will work on you. I often go Mercs, but I think sorcerer shoes might be better due to it giving a large damage increase on your R and Q. Take a couple points in Q for easier farming/harass then max E   You need to build her as an assassin now with emphasis with on hit. BOTRK, and muramana (if going lane eve) alone let you 100-0 a squishy in literally under a second. It's actually super strong.    Atm his ult is a fairly useless (in comparison) evolution, so everyone evolves his QWE. The only difference is in the order they evolve them in.   It was confirmed a glitch   Post 6 AP Kog is a really good farmer. A E-R clears the caster minions, and with your W and the attack speed boost it's really easy to get the melees as well.   I find lux hard to farm with. Her E leaves creeps with little slivers of hp left for the longest times.   You have to remember that this is only after you die, and it doesn't regenerate. Minion aggro, poke, etc will delete the shield. That sounds fairly reasonable   They should make it be a shield of 8% or so of your max health, that way it still might be a sub-par mastery, but it scales a lot better.   I've found success with BOTRK, Muramana, IBG/Tri, Banshees, and either last whisper or another tanky item (depending on how you're playing her). The last whisper may sound odd, but the vast majority of her burst will come from her E and the autos after that, so the armor pen makes it a good pick up. Muramana helps with her early mana problems, and gives her the most burst +sustained damage out of any other item in the game, at the cost of a slower ramp-up time.   Doublelift to TSM confirmed.   Everyone knows that Pingu will be incredibly broken though   I've been going pretty standard 21/9, with hybrid pen marks, armor seals, mr glyphs, and AD quints.   Hey man, try solo lane assassin evelynn, I've been stomping with it since last patch. You can go mid for the better roaming, or top for the better matchups. Your main build is BOTRK, Muramana, and IBG (you can go Triforce for more damage if you want). A Ult-E-Auto-Q-Auto will blow up a squishy in under a second. It's actually ridiculous. Take 2-3 points in Q for better farming/harass in lane, and then max E.   Solo lane AD evelynn is actually very strong with the on hit buffs . Core items are BOTRK and muramana and usually a sheen item. (Tri for more damage, iceborn for stickiness and being more tanky). You completely delete squishies in under a second with a ult-E-Q plus a couple autos. You are also a strong splitpusher, (over 2.0 attack speed with BOTRK and maxed E, plus sheen procs and waveclear).   Honestly all of those champions can do well building damage, especially Zyra and Sona.    It's a combination of high damage, and gapclosers/sticking potential. Give two early kills to an akali/riven, and they can just jump on you and 100/0 you anytime you go near them. They can just go around and kill anybody they want. Meanwhile, getting two kills on someone like a orianna or Karthus won't let you snowball as hard as you can't force your advantage like you can on Fiora or Katarina. And champions like rammus or nautilus don't have the same damage output as the aforementioned champions, so even though they can push their advantage, odds are the enemy will be able to make it to their turret, or escape in other ways before you can kill them.   Why do you believe c9 won't finish any higher then third? They had a convincing IEM tournament.    I heard sneaky say two days ago that Runaans is great when ahead, but if he's behind BOTRK is much better.  He said he built BOTRK when he was fed as fuck in scrims, and he couldn't solo carry the game like he could have if he built Runaans, he also said he was behind in scrims, and built Runaans and got even farther behind. It seems like it's situational for him.   To be fair, C9 is by far the favorite at the moment for first. TSM and Liquid are the two teams that seem most likely for second, I don't seem to see the problem with those predictions.   To be fair, hai can tend to get pretty salty at times   AP nunu is actually terrifying to lane against, more so if you're a melee. You sit back and try to farm? Enjoy 275 base damage, 1.0AP Ice balls to the face every few seconds. Try to poke? He has bullshit sustain. Try to all in him? He can just sit there and charge his ult, and one shot you, or just snowball you and blood boil away.   Adc Ahri. Rush Triforce into IE. You have decent auto attack range/speed, insane kiting, crazy mid-game damage, and strong self-peel. You snowball incredibly hard as well. Your damage does fall off late game, but you still end up being very safe.   'Hey let's complain about free gifts!'   Nightblade irelia. It's got one of the most beautiful splashes in the game, good model, and is fairly cheap. For some reason everyone likes frostbutt better though.    On-hit jungle kayle is actually a legit build though. Go Devourers, into nashors, CDR boots, wits end, hurricane and void staff. You'll be doing 750+ dps to 3 targets at a time late game    The problem with your jarvan build is going hydra IMO. With jungle jarvan the only damage you need is warrior enchantment and usually a second brutalizer. The building of a hydra will make you lose a giants belt and a wardens mail of tankyness. You need that to survive diving their carries.   Botrk. Jax scales very hard off of attack speed. Plus the active and passive overall work better with jaxes duelist kit. The only advantage that Gunblade has is that it gives slightly higher burst, but jax is more reliant on sustained damage over burst in most cases.   If your support has a lot of peel they'll just ult your diving top laner, or your zed/Leblanc, etc with no peel. Yeah, I hate poppy.   A good cho won't waste his Q, unless he's playing against someone like xerath. I play a lot of cho mid, mostly against assassins like zed or fizz, and I'll pretty much just sit on my Q until they try to engage, or when they are poked down enough to all-in.    Playing AP bruiser cho into him is pretty fun, as you can disengage easily if tries to fight pre 6, you have strong poke in your W, and post 6 if he ever comes near you you can one-shot him before he even has time to ult. Also late game you have insane waveclear, so it'll be impossible for him to take towers against you easily.   Nightblade best overall.   Odds are you won't be able to bully enemy laners past level 1. Jax is pretty weak until level 11ish.   Blood moon akali   That's the secret to enjoyable games. I can't even think of the last time I had an intentional DC. It's honestly as easy as saying " don't worry man, you're doing fine" to somebody who is starting to tilt. Say Gj when your bot lane gets a kill, or when your jungler has a successful gank.   Nocturne is my champion with the highest win rate (73% over 40 games) and I have had the most success with devourer, BOTRK, Randuins, Banshees, Tabi's/Mercs and a situational last item ( often GA). This build gives you both a strong 1v1, and a strong teamfight. (Due to being near unpeelable with two spell shields)  If you go solo lane noc I replace devourer with ghostblade, and occasionally pick up a hydra as well.   I actually mean to say manamune instead of muramana. My bad.   Hey summonerschool. As you may know, evelynn is getting a buff next patch to have on-hit effects apply on each strike of her E. I have a couple questions on how various items would effect it.  1. Would ravenous hydra's cleave (passive) damage apply to the target hit? Since its not considered a basic attack, I wonder if the target hit would take any damage from the hydra itself.  2. Would muramana proc 4 times? Muramana currently procs twice on her E, due to it being a single target ability with two strikes. With it applying on-hit effects, would it now proc 4 times? or is it restricted somehow?  Thanks!   This is possibly the first time I have ever heard someone call poppies lane safe. She has a horrendous early game.   Rek'sai seems to be what you're looking for.   Ninja tabi's are also a good choice on many tanks, the 10% reduced auto attack damage is huge for their survivabililty. You can get tenacity from elixirs, and even then, you don't need the tenacity as much to be a big sponge.   Kayle is my suggestion. You bring high magic damage dps and strong utility. Your ganks are fairly decent, and your clear is great.   (This is single target build)  Her lvl 18 base AD is 106. With 2.0 attack speed that is 212 dps.  Devourers will be at around 100 stacks by full build. That is another 200 dps.  Wits end gives 42 magic damage on hit. 84 DPS  Her E + nashors gives 75 magic damage on hit before ratios. 150 dps  With rabadons, void staff, and nashors you should be at 351 ap. .4 of that is 140. 280 dps.  212+200+84+280+150= 926 damage per second. Close enough.   With a hurricane you will have even higher attack speed, but you'll do slightly less damage, to multiple targets.  EDIT: forgot to add E base damage beforehand.    If you build jungle kayle right, she has insane damage. Full build, you  will do ~1000single target damage per second, or -600dps to three targets with a hurricane. And this is just with your E alone.    His full combo can be done in under a second. Leblanc is slightly slower if you wait for the chain to proc.    http://i.imgur.com/A8ai7PI.png   He's a strong solo queue pick. He still has high burst, snowballs well, and has possibly the fastest burst of all assassins. His lane is harder now, but mid-late game he is still nearly the same.   Plus it gives sheen procs    If he is in a position where you're going to get silenced, and you know you can't escape, just activate your W (before he silences you) and auto him through his spin. You're going to take his damage anyways, might as well trade him some back. He will win the trade, but it will be still fairly close. You outscale him hard, so if you end up being a little behind in CS it's fine. Also, if you get a hexdrinker, you can completely nullify his ult.   It would be great to see a female streamer that is actually good at the game, and isn't just sexualizing their stream to try to get 13 year olds to watch. The only one I can really think of would be Becca or however you spell it.   My parents would knock me on the side of the head, or twist my ear if I disobeyed. I'm fine with things like that. But punching a 13 year old kid in the face? That's not discipline. That's child abuse.   I have never seen a Janna flame in my life.   Ad casters will still have auto attacks   Trynd could be a exception due to Him having a lot of passive crit chance.   Couldn't you have trundle and aatrox splitpush? If you go 1-3-1 Kayle lulu and urgot could hold off a siege pretty well on their own. Strong waveclear and nearly impossible to dive. Trundle is one of the strongest duelists in the game, and aatrox is still quite strong in a 1v1. It's not perfect, but it could theoretically work.   If you don't level his ult past level 1, you're wasting kassadins #1 feature. His insane mobility. You don't level your ult for the damage. You level it for the cooldown reduction. At level 16 you can basically ult into the enemy team, assassinate someone, Zhonyas, and ult away.     Revive TP Karthus is actually a  legit strategy though.   How does Jax counter riven? As someone who plays a lot of jax it feels like I can't really do much at all until I have Triforce or Botrk and tabi's. She has the mobility to escape jaxes counterstrike, and short enough cooldowns to punish him whenever his E is on cooldown.   Her level 6 spike is so much stronger then Jax's as well. He outscales her in 1v1s, but he won't ever be able to freely take towers against her, and she has a stronger teamfight in most situations.   Her Q cooldown is shorter then the duration. You can't really 'wait for it to go on cooldown'   I would love to read it when it's finished!   Isn't she still fairly strong in sustained fights with her massive attack speed steriod?   I've had some experience as AP bruiser Cho vs gnar, he is fairly annoying due to his mobility and kiting in mini form. However, if you rush double Doran rings, you can harass him very hard with your W. Odds are you aren't going to be able to hit many Q's against him, but at 6 you can occasionally try when he is committing to a cs. He's so squishy in early mini form that you can 70-0 him if you land your Q (You'll most likely have to flash to get on him). Gnar is also not amazing at farming under his tower in mini form, so if you know it's clear you can shove him under and harass him for every cs. Just take care as if a jungler ganks you are basically screwed when you try to waddle away. Admittedly full tank cho would have a much harder lane .   Mundo, Maokai, probably Malphite/Shen. Basically anybody who doesn't have an overly strong lane/weak damage. Poppy just needs a place to farm without being zoned.   RIP team LOMO   Well Ryze is slightly less boring, as you can chain your spells instead of  only pressing 4 buttons and being useless.   That honestly would be sort of fun. The kiting would be real, and it would just be fun to see the enemies health bars drop from the OPness of the kit.   Ryze Q  Kassadin Q  Taric E  Tristana R  Xerath passive  You literally walk up to someone, hover over them and press QWER, then walk away.   Since when does swain build athenes? Every one I've ever seen has gone either rod or tear   He was sitting on around 850 AP at the moment. His ulti does around around 1250 true damage with that much hp.    Not just a decent win rate, the best win rate. After only a few weeks of practise (so things like builds/play styles aren't set in stone yet either)   Shaco and Loki both have the same passive ability, invisibility, clones, and I would assume play stole.   Well it was. Janna was the highest yesterday.      I understand you were exaggerating, but Vel'koz still does have something like a 2.2AP total ratio on his skills. So yes, a Vel'koz with 1k AP does vastly outdamage a Vel with just a lilandries ;).   On-hit kayle is actually pretty strong, but the problem with it is it takes a long time to ramp up. You need three items before you really start doing strong damage, But when you hit late game you absolutely shred teamfights.    Vlad is strong late game due to having high AOE damage, on low cooldowns. He also has an is deceptively tanky due to his passive, and is basically impossible to kill until he gets 3 spell rotations off (REQ-Pool-EQ-Zhonyas-EQ.) His ult also gives a quite large damage increase for his entire team if he lands a good ult. If he can get to the back like, he can blow up the ADC and APC, and still be basically full health.   Except for her taunt   It's actually true. I've never seen an akali player that is toxic. But a fizz/fiora/riven/katarina/any other snowbally assassin main? They are often the most toxic players out there.   People don't get berserkers on Corki as he as a terrible scaling attack speed. Since the bonus attack speed scales multiplicatively off of base attack speed, he'll barely get an increase. This makes sorcerers shoes do more damage comparatively    Adc Ahri. You have a good auto attack range, passable attack speed scaling, and insane kiting/self peel ability. You build much like Corki, with the Triforce rush. You have a crazy good mid-game, and can snowball like crazy. With a sheen you can basically take half an ADC's health with just a Q auto. A hit charm is a guaranteed kill in lane with your ult up. You fall off fairly hard late game damage wise (like all Triforce ADC's though), but you make up for it by being incredibly safe, so while your dps might not be as high, you should be able to actually attack more often.   Well to be fair, 0/6 and 50 cs down isn't losing lane, it's getting stomped.   Especially because how snowbally mirror matchups are. If one person has a slight advantage, the other person is basically screwed.   Hang in there man, about a month ago I was in b4 too. Now I'm in silver 3 and still climbing. Just keep focusing on improving, and find a champion that can A) hard carry games B) Can punish opponents mistakes C) You love playing. All I mean by this criteria is that while someone like Nunu, Lulu, Mundo, etc. might be fun to play, odds are you can't carry a bot lane that gave up 5 kills to a Lucian at the 10 minute mark.  For me those champions were Irelia, Nocturne, and Kassadin (For top, jungle, and mid respectively)    Many top laners can beat him in an all in at level 6. Until then, buy plenty of potions, and sustain as much as you can. Miss any cs that you would take too much damage for. He has a small mana pool, so your goal is to have your hp outlast your mana.   Poppy will continue getting picked more and more, and eventually be considered a meta pick. Morello will follow through on his promise and she will be nerfed into uselessness.   Jax, Nasus, Maokai, Mundo, Poppy,     You're wasting Irelias potential if you play safe and farm at any time past level 4 with her. She is at her peak, and you should use that to your advantage.   Jinx is a hypercarry lane bully, but she has her fair set of weaknesses. That's the only one I can think of.   I can't think of a single champion that can do this. Only some niche lane counter picks can bully a laner hard and then destroy late game without being fed.   The buffs don't fix what made him considered a weak pick just last patch, rather they help his already strong late game. While the dragon and baron buffs help, the odds are the team that has a rumble sitting on a haunting guise, or a gnar with a brutalizer, will win every early dragon fight compared to the team with a Jax with a sheen. The new turrets do make it harder to dive the enemy laner, and the majority of the picks now are safe enough to avoid it in the first place. Jax is one of my favorite champions, and I'm happy to see him back. I just don't see what makes him a priority blind pick now.   I haven't been able to watch any of the competitive games for 4.21, but I have noticed from the game threads that jax seems to be becoming a very popular pick again. I understand he got some slight buffs, but those don't make up for his previous weaknesses that caused him to fall out of favor ( mostly his weak early game). He should be getting bullied by the meta top laners (gnar, lissandra, rumble) plus he is also a late game champ, with a weaker teamfight, in a mid-game teamfight focused meta. Splitpushing is also not as effective a strategy compared back to when he was in his heyday. Could someone explain why he rose again in popularity?   What I've found is that they would get massively fed in lane/mid game, and then as soon as teamfights start they would try 1v5ing, blow up instantly, and then type "/all gg team too heavy" with a  final score of 20/20/0   Just climbed out of bronze, can confirm. He's THE most common pick I saw for top, with Riven being a close second.   He's got to reach the pedal somehow   If you're going to play gangplank, might as well abuse his Q and buy trinity force, shiv, and infinity edge. These three items give you insane damage. From there you can go tanky (safer, let's you get CDR, less trolly), or you can go full on damage (LW, Hydra) for the full cheese one-shot crits.   Talking about 'controversial' scenes that she was filming, and that sort of thing.   It still is pretty damn pervy. Even if she's 17, she looks like she's 14. At least Sophie actually looks her age (arguably slightly older looking)   She's 18 now, and I believe she has hinted about it now in several interviews. Not confirmed, but likely.   Abyssal cho is legit though   No. Fiora scales off of armor pen and flat AD, both of which ghostblade has. The active and the crit chance are nice bonuses, but not the reason you buy the items Phantom dancer however doesn't give you any stats that fiora needs, and the passive (while still nice) isn't necessary on her, (due to her having two dashes anyhow)    Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is that the meta is very mid-game focused. Renekton can bully the laners enough that they won't be effective in these mid game dragon fights, letting his team snowball the game.   Well you definitely seem like you know what you're talking about. Gj, I love seeing off-meta picks that work.  	101

 couldnt care less that he banked it. im just pissed they didnt call the fuckin travel on Butler two possessions earlier. nigga took 4 steps   no it wasnt. falling away off target. lucky he got glass   make up no call for the no travel call   NICE TRAVEL GOOD GOD   lebron to TT lob?   he just cant hold the ball for all 24 seconds of a possession. spot him up in the corner. run some other action   Yo, those two Lebron buckets were so insanely clutch. Props, King.    Doesn't matter of he's hurt. If he's out there, he has to have an impact.    Why isnt shump in the game. I want him in for Kyrie now   ball dont lie.    I want Delly playing the 1, Kyrie and Shump spreadin the floor, and Lebron and Tristan beastin in the paint.    haha 35 game seconds. it's something, i guess   Ball dont lie   A Kevin Love commercial... :'( why? why do this to us?   God I love everyone on this team right now.    No rest   i want delly   Lebron just executed a one-man trap. Wow.    Lebron, you gotta make a layup bruh. No excuses.    Tristans effort just brings a tear to my eye. He needs a gift basket or something   Wake up tomorrow like how the fuck did i get here? last i remember, Bitch ass Noah was talkin some noise and i got pissed off and rose up and....   Let's be real, if Mozgov catches the ball a couple more times, we're up by more and have less TO's. So, he gotta step up.    Catch it high, keep it high, have bouncy feet, lay it up. dont have to power jam every time. get the points.    a virgin who's had sex for the first time.... so he's taking every shot because he's the fuckin man in his head? nah   yo i know Kyrie is hurting, but he needs to tape it up at the half and get goin. we need him   DELLY   he cant go to the rim. refs arent calling shit. cant hit a jumper. fucj   DAMMIT. GET A HANDLE AND DUNK ON PAUS UGLY ASS FACE   yo when he hits a 3, he typically starts to find a groove with his jumper. not always, but most times. hopefully he can find it tonight   not this again lebron   mozgovs in the way   good god mazgov cant catch   Hence, the joke   So Lebron can advance and so CP3 can't. Rose plays worse with one day of rest and CP3 would benefit too much from extra time off. It's all a conspiracy, man   http://imgur.com/33e5gfR   When that first track started, I coulda sworn Make It Rain was about to start blarin   hahahah cardale joinin the FUCK NOAH HYPE TRAIN YEEAAAAHHHHH   TRISTAN "I WANT THE MAX TOO BOSS" THOMPSON   Their best shot with our worst=7 point loss Us just playing aggressive and them not shooting well= complete blowout from start to finish   wish mike woulda faked the swing pass and splashed that one tho   One of the best teammates in the league according to the guys he has played with. Always love having guys like that   Remember that "one day of rest for Rose" stat? Yeah, I'm really excited about that one.    You right!    agreed. missing more than you make isn't efficient, but it's definitely not bad   always   13 for 28? damn. not very efficient but ill take it   play according to what the coach assumes theyre gonna do. watch their plays, how they react. it is what it sounds like. you feel out the game and decide what you need to do   He didnt establish back in bounds. bad no call   He didn't take a game off. It was a "feel-out" game. If you've ever watched him in the playoffs, you know he always feels out what theyre going to do before deciding how he needs to play.    nah bro   CAN MOZGOV CATCH TO SAVE HIS DAMN LIFE GOOD GOD   UUUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! AAAAANNNNDDDDD OOONNNEEEEEEE   I would like to take this opportunity to publicly admit how incredibly wrong i was about Mike Miller. Forgot that, ya know, he's old and slow. Apologies fam. I am dumb.    For real. Have JR come off with that second group instead of Delly.    X-Ray finishing moves, Mortal Kombat style. Just waiting for the Fatality   Beast mode: Activated http://imgur.com/sbPdr0w   HINRICH LITTLE BITCH ASS ISNT WORTHY OF A HARD FOUL ON YOU KING. RAGE, RAGE AGAINST FOULS OF THE BULLS   Attack Mode: Activated    This is the basis of Better Call Saul's opening episode.    haha i'm 19. and i dont give a shit. that movie was the bomb   Bruh, when he tossed Zoey in front of that train hahahaha I was like OH SHIT HE'S MURDEROUS PSYCOPATH HAHAHA   The obvious choice   Still my favorite movie all time.    Yeah, that's how I felt about 3 before I saw it. I'm not gonna go into it with any preconceived notions. It'll probably be the shit.    giggity   The hell is a mother lawyer? the mother of all lawyers? you need a better edumacation   watch the tape boss   lol. didnt know he was gonna be guarding pau fuckin gasol. that's coaching, not him. he has to be in with that TT, Mozgod, Lebron, Kyrie group to spread the floor   Nope, Shump on Butler. He is a better wing defender right now   Contesting shots isn't about your vertical. And you don't contest a shooter like him. You run him off the 3. Hence, the tiredness I spoke about. Not that hard to comprehend   You gotta watch off ball more. They literally have him running off baseline screens and down screens for the entire first quarter.    I would watch the shit outta that movie   of course he can handle him. but he's gonna be worn out from handling him, which is going to reduce his drives. resulting in more chunk up, late clock, flat jump shots.    hahahah take it. you don't question Iron man's past   You put TT in the starting slot and you have Lebron chasing Dunleavy off of screens for the first 8 minutes of the game, which is when he needs to set the tone offensively by getting to the rim with fresh legs. So unless he and Shump are gonna switch, I don't know if TT starting is the answer   We had one good quarter and three shitty ones and only lost by 7 after taking their best shot. We're fine.    ^^^ THIS   Lebron is notorious for playing game 1 as a feel out game. Meaning, he takes their best shot, analyzes it, and makes adjustments to counter it. DONT FREAK OUT EVERYBODY. WE CAN DO THIS. Past few times he's played the Bulls in a series he lost game one and handed em a gentleman's sweep by beating them in 5. So dont worry, we can do this. We're fine.    JUST A REMINDER http://imgur.com/BLNqeFL    6 TO's. Missed 13 shots. That's a bad game for Lebron standards. He has to step up. He has to average 25 10 and 10 for this team to win   Ehhem... http://imgur.com/BLNqeFL   WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK LEBRON   This is the lineup we gotta keep. Playin well on this stretch   Good things happen when Lebron drives to the rim. Always   LEBRON IS BEING A BITCH. GO TO THE RIM HOLY SHIT   indeed   He has to make that one though   I like bully-on-the-block Lebron   MIKE MILLER BABY HELL YEAH   THAT WAS SO NASTY MY GAWD   http://imgur.com/VK7vyHQ   UNCLE DREW IS THE MAN MY LAWD   Offseason to do list: -Get knock-down 3 point shooters -get a solid backup 4/5 who can play similar to Kev    THESE REFS.

The headline says "border infiltration tunnels."  The tunnels ostensibly used for fuel and the like weren't even involved in the current skirmish   yeah, there are different types of tunnels. The tunnels go back a ways, but the newly constructed tunnels Israel is going after were developed by Hamas for one singular purpose -- quick, easy, and subtle access into Israel. Which is why Israel has only gone after tunnels located relatively close to its own borders.  Most of the tunnels ostensibly used for benign purposes are connected on the opposite side of the country via Egypt      Because that's not what they're used for at all. Hardly amusing, it's fundamentally sad and horrific that Hamas leadership has spent tens of millions of dollars to construct tunnels instead of using money earmarked for civilians for, well, civilians.  Take a look at the folks giving Reuters a tour of the tunnel and try and convince anyone that these tunnels have any benign purpose. Amusing indeed.

Editing video is extremely processor intensive, even stupid things like making a section of the video slow motion.  It's like saying that you want to build and design 3d models of houses on your 4" phone.  You might be able to do it, but nobody in the real world will take you seriously about it.   Why in fucking hell would you want to edit movies...on a smartphone?   And we _HAVE_ solar/wind/hydroelectric, etc already.  We need to focus on utilizing those.  What is with the blind pro-nuclear stance that reddit has?   I don't mention the accidents with coal because it's pretty much a given that coal needs to be replaced.  Did the downvote brigade think I was pro-coal or something?!  The fuck?  No.  I believe that renewable sources of energy are our future.  Nuclear isn't renewable.  We're just trading one non-renewable resource for another non-renewable resource. The quantity of nuclear reserves is as finite and limited as that of fossil fuels. Uranium Institute figures estimate the total world recoverable resources of uranium at 3,256,000 tons. Existing power plants operational worldwide require 53,000 tons of uranium a year to produce roughly 12% of the total world power requirements. The total resources will be sufficient to meet current and anticipated demand for only 42 years.   That was exactly my point, and exactly what I said.  I said our governments and corporations do the minimum needed to ensure safety and ultimately we can't trust _THEM_.  Nuclear, if done right, is fine.  But apparently there's a paid-for pro-nuclear brigade on reddit who downvote in droves instead of discussing this simple fact.  Out of 435 Nuclear plants in the world, we've had 3 major disasters.  Nuclear only accounts for 12% of the worlds electricity generation.  Coal has 40%.  So going by our current batting average here, if we were to somehow take Nuclear and bump it up and totally take over coal, so that Nuclear was 52% of the worlds energy generation - statistically we're likely to have about 10 more incidences in the time it takes to bring that energy online.  Obviously, things will get better.  I get that.  But when things go bad, they fuck things up on a global timescale and not a human-generation timescale.  We ruin land, in a practical sense, "forever".   In 50 years, we've had 3 major accidents.  How long until one of those contaminates a large freshwater supply?     and require multiple levels of precaution to fail  And yet they still fail.  Producing disastrous consequences each time.  Consequences that do not last a short timeframe.  When was the last time you heard of a windmill killing thousands of people?  Solar?  Ever?   They SHOULD be hesitant!  Our governments and corporations do the minimum needed to ensure safety, and when these things go it's not "oh, wait 100 years"...it's "oh, wait 2,000,000 years".  Enough of these happen over time, and we're fucked.   Do not get a knockoff.  They are fucking TERRIBLY made.  Seriously.  The extra $20 is worth the hours and hours of bullshit that you'll put up with with a knockoff.  I mean, reifsnyderb even puts out _full schematics!_ and they still can't manage to clone them right...   So, as far as the pick   place bit goes; you can solve the alignment issue by bumping the part up against a flat on the machine.  You should have enough vacuum to keep the part on the placement head, and it will straighten and put the part in the exact same spot every time if you bump it on both axis.

My Dell 4" Windows CE had, by default, an on-screen keyboard in 2005.  And capacitive touch.  And windows machines since 95 have had a on-desktop grid layout of icons.  It was all there...nothing new.  Just put together in a shinier package.  It also had handwriting recognition, T9, etc.   Horse-face.   The brainwash here is so, so terrible.  Steve Jobs didn't create anything.  All of the technologies existed before the iPhone, there were devices previous to it that were very similar.  He was merely good at pretending that he had invented something and marketing it well.  The market was already moving in the direction that the iPhone took it, it was just lumbering along about it.  Steve may have sped up this process, but he sure didn't create it.   Sooo... The Master?   Seriously, html5 "gifs" are awesome.   Why would it need one?  Ever need to back up, you just get out and pull the back end around. :D   Actually yes.  Yes it does.

They stopped updating the IPT2g a long while ago.    some 5V inputs will accept 3.3V as a high  That's exactly what I said... lol   Check to see if your 5v IC supports 3.3v logic levels.  Some do.  All depends on if you need to output _to_ the IC, or input from the IC.   I also have a 2012 Nexus 7 and the thing works spectacularly still.  It's basically Nexus or near-nexus devices for me since the beginning.  My Moto G is even a GPE edition.   So, the Vibrant is basically a Nexus S in an earlier package.  The iDevice I had was an iPod Touch from around the same time, which ended up not being able to download or install anything from the app store whatsoever.   As someone who's owned both within the same generation, I've watched iOS devices slowly become useless (literally, to the point of not being able to run any apps on the app store), while I've got my 4+ year old Galaxy S Vibrant on Android 4.4 and running modern applications.   I was more annoyed at the pronunciation of "Auto".  This guy says it like "Ow toe"   Toll roads.  _every_ fucking road, would be a toll road.  Instead of paying for it upfront, the private sector would build it alright...but they'd make billions and billions more charging people for it and keeping it minimally upkept.  In the beginning, it would be a lot of separate companies.  But slowly, and surely, as capitalism has shown will always happen, the money pools to the top and eventually only 1 company would own the roads.  They'd have free reign to decide who could and couldn't use them, raise prices, and completely destroy your life if you somehow managed to piss them off.  You see this shit over and over and over.  Pure capitalism just simply doesn't work.  You need a balance between things.   As far as languages go, English is always the best to use for titling something that is going to be used worldwide, and especially so regarding anything internet related.

Some units with variable power control will actually PWM the coil in order to change the wattage.   What will this do to other devices that use an antenna, or a coil, like NFC?  Can it induce a charge in them and potentially harm them?  Because I'd really like to see wireless charging and NFC living side by side, and not one or the other.   I mean, it's used in Samsung devices - But seeing as Google has a grip over Samsung right now, I don't think they want to owe them anything.   Yeah, I did a little research on this.  Apparently they do not have a "stable" version yet.  It's still experimental/unstable at this point in time.  (i.e. they're not going to absolutely trust data on it)   None that I know of.  I rent a VPS and my own OpenVPN server off of that.   Looks like the text was loading up, but it's all white on white.   Patents, licenses, etc. F2FS was made by Samsung iirc   Some. People. Are. On. Mobile. (and the sidebar isn't readily visible)    Can't read this at all on mobile.    Could also be debris from your extruder drive depositing old filament into the roll.  That pattern is awfully uniform, I bet it matches the circumference of your drive wheel or some other wheel circumference.   Unlikely to change.  It's going to take an entire blanket of regulation in order to get them to do such things.  Education is the best course of action.  Encrypting more of your data, hiding it, obfuscating it, making packets indistinguishable from others.  Just going to need to roll in the cost of a non-logging VPN to your internet in order to get the full speed out of it.  That seems to be the reality of it right now.   That's exactly the point.  And he didn't shine as a doctor because of it.   Check the travel time of the packets.  Ping sites such as yahoo.com, google, and then something obscure that you use.  If the ping isn't high; try running your connection so it's routed through a VPN.  If the speed jumps up by encrypting your connection, then you've got a pretty good case to say they're throttling you.   It's actually quite on topic.  The normal Windows shell won't allow you to do the things like OP is looking to do (colored characters, etc).  So in addition to OP asking "how would you do that"...I'm simply appending the question "on windows"...because it's easy as hell on Linux with a bash terminal.  Not so easy on the Windows side.   bur (am I doing this right?)   Another, related question: Getting a terminal that's worth a shit in windows?  Without going through a full cygwin install?  Maybe some way of packaging a terminal application in the python executable with busybox?   Can you do that?  Just call dibs like that? [](/woonapounce "If so, I call his PC!")   I think that's an OR thing.  3x the energy density OR reduce size and weight.  (Or some variation in between)  Because if you could do both, then you could obviously scale up to the same size, and get 4x, or 5x the energy density...and there's no reason they wouldn't be saying that if it were the case.   I feel like any respectable tattoo shop would just simply say "No.  I'm not going to do this tattoo."  Sure, it's her body; whatever.  But there should really be some professionalism in just simply refusing shit that is obviously a bad idea.   Honestly, being a fan of the show certainly shines through when a new actor takes the doctors place.  Tennant was a good example of this.  As was eccleston.   That's because David is best pony.[](/whooves)   I must also mention grabcad - It's less for 3D printing and more for _actual_ manufacturing, but occasionally you can find some really cool things to print there.   Not only that, but their parent company - Stratasys - is suing Afinia in court, _right now_.  MakerBot _IS_ Stratasys.  And Stratasys is doing their best to stop others from innovating.  3D printing is not popular due to Stratasys, 3DSystems, etc.  It's popular because of the Reprap movement and the ability for people to 3D print without gigantic inflated, patent guarded profits attached to it.   [Mark Kirk](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00012539 cycle=2014)   I get it now.  What this boils down to is confirmation bias.  The whole makerbot apologist side that you've taken clearly shows that.  It's sad that people take this route now.  "You think any other company is different?"...yeah.  I do.  Have fun defending MakerBot, you get what you deserve on this one.    People need to actually READ that patent they filed  This shows just how ignorant you are of the whole matter.  It's not just 1 patent.  It's close to 20 of them, and growing weekly.  They even had a job opening in their company for a 'patent harvester', and described the position as someone who was able to take ideas from the community and turn them into patentable works.  I'll see if I can find the waybackmachine of it and post it here for reference.  Found it: https://makerbot.applicantstack.com/x/detail/a2m4ro95lbqq   coordinate invention harvesting and invention disclosures for potential patent application filing, including conducting patentability searches    Makerbot, [...] forced some real quality control in the market  ....you're joking, right?  Are you being purposely ignorant, or are you just forgetful?  The rep2 was a terrible machine from the get-go, and most people, the first thing they had to do was print upgrades just to use the machine for any extended period of time.  On top of that, they had like 3-4 generations of complete bullshit, and lack of support.  Plenty of time to ponzi-scheme their way to success.  My guess is that you weren't in "the field" so to speak when the MakerBot cupcake was released.  Ask anyone who's been doing this for more than the past year, what bullshit MakerBot has pulled, how terrible their printers are/were, and about the complete lack of care for their customers (not like that's changed either though!  If you use anything other than MakerBot branded filament in their printers now, your warranty is null and void).   I'll agree on that point, mostly.  That's why I point the general public (in that price bracket) to the UltiMaker or UM2 mostly.  Yes...I point people to the UltiMaker as a DeltaMaker employee.  :D  I don't have any allegiances except for what pushes the 3D printing community forward.  When I feel our machines compete on a level that I can feel good about, then I'll recommend our machines.   Hey, but at least MakerBot isn't stealing their work and attempting to patent it, so there's that.  I'd take a Kickstarter printer over a MakerBot any day.   "Behind Schedule" - Sorry, but when you're doing renovations, there's not really a schedule that you can fall behind.  There's almost always going to be shit you find done incorrectly behind the walls, or something you've forgotten.   Ya know, when I see pictures of women, they have a set of tits.  Not boy-chest.  And you're the one who said she looked better as a boy.   It's almost like you're not even looking at the same picture as everyone else...   Only if you like prepubescent boys with long hair.   **[FEDORA TIPPING INTENSIFIES]**   I say that because the edit doesn't exactly clarify anything, and still makes it seem like we're not OK.  We are.  We're actually in a pretty good position now.    Deltamaker looks like they will complete their Kickstarter campaign but be dead in the water after that unless something crazy happens...*edit They say they are going to keep on going after and continue to deliver printrs.  And again; DeltaMaker is fine.  Thanks for perpetuating this idea that somehow we're not going to make it.  We only have 8 domestic shipments left, and something like 15 international.  And we have enough stock for hundreds more printers...so we're in no danger at all of falling under.  We're working on streamlining the build process, reducing the parts count, and building a bigger printer as a second option.  We've also got some free time now to work on some of our extra features like cloud slicing, etc.   Fucking hell people.  I was on a mobile client, that didn't have a comment save feature.  I didn't want to forget the mention of compton composter.  I run XFCE on an EEE 900A 4G as my daily driver.  Sheesh.   .    Also, if you've ever ate at a hole-in-the-wall chinese place, you've probably also had dog and cat.   Make sure you copper-fill next time.  Etching away that much copper per board is bound to saturate the solution very quickly.   That.........that's a GUY.   He's reviewing Five Guys.   If your ABS has a tendency to curl otherwise, it'll likely peel up the tape.  Blue paint actually has a release agent which is _meant_ to make it peel off of things easily.  Obviously a heated build area will help.   Basically you described nearly any laptop with an SD card slot (pretty much all of them) and a BIOS (also pretty much all of them) - Sooooooo...go get yourself a cheap netbook.  And have fun.   Speed limits do imply certain minimums.  You can get a ticket in a car for doing 15+ mph under the limit.  So I believe that cyclists should not be exempt from this rule either.  Do 30mph on a 45mph road?  You should have a $200 road obstruction ticket.   And they should also get tickets when "driving" 15mph under the speed limit.   Teenage drivers: Keep it up.  Maybe he'll eventually get the fucking message and stop riding on the road.   It's also not fucking nice to ride your bicycle on the road, which happens to be going 30mph in a 45mph.  If a _CAR_ were going 15 under, it's grounds for a ticket.   Honestly, you can give CubeWorld as much crap as you want but there has to be something said for the quality of animations, and the general feel of the game.  It's nice and fluid, it's got the right easing in/out for acceleration, it's very well polished compared to all of these "competitors" that people keep claiming are abound.   /sigh - upvote.  Because of course there is a subreddit for this...   Honestly, the dentist I know uses that machine as little as possible because it's a higher radiation dosage.  They prefer the gigantic square contraption that you bite down on and it ends up cutting up the roof of your mouth.   Nobody prices to cost.  Get over it.    What you are asking for is kind of like being a non-union employee demanding the benefits and negotiating power of the union but not having to pay your dues. It doesn't work like that.  I know you were trying to be serious and all, but it actually often does work like that with unions.  Generally when unions lobby for better wages, etc - non union members also get the same negotiated benefits.  Probably not the best example to try and use. :D    dentists charge too much  You know, they do have to pay their staff, keep the building, etc.  They charge what is sustainable.

 Diamond is the aircraft manufacturer that makes the plane in the picture. They also make one called the Katana, but it's not this one (it's a Twin Star).

Smart like the legal team at Dewey Cheatum   Howe, LLP.  Canoeists have to keep their centre of mass low, so they dont capsize the canoe. Same strategy can be applied to tort law.          How about a picture of a grizzly bear? Or if they specialize in maritime law, how about a picture of a canoe?

There's been quite a few ASE deals on ebay since January. APMEX has had multiple auctions. MCM has had one as well. Also, Silvertowne had a deal on a tube of Buffaloes recently.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember many of these deals last year.  They're popping up like every couple weeks so far this year so seems like no big deal to miss one.   Out of stock.   [ebay auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/141528111687?_trksid=p2060778.m2749.l2649 ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT).   Shit, you're right, it's listed right on the page I ordered from :) Surprised the Wikipedia page doesn't have these mintages.      I plan on buying 1/5th of the remaining gold in the world to make luxury coffee mugs.   I just placed an order.  They're down to 8 as of 12:35pm PST, if you're interested you better act fast. Based on the comments here so far, it looks like 6 of them have sold in the past 20 minutes or so.  Anyone know the supposed mintage on these?  [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Silver_Panda) lists them as ?????.  Do the COAs come numbered in regards to the total? Something like 16,787 of 30,000.   Traditional combustion engines in automobiles are not going away anytime soon.  * Gasoline has the refueling infrastructure set up * Gasoline refueling time is in single digit minutes, not hours, though I think the Tesla can recharge 50% in 30 minutes * Gasoline has the driving range. I think hot/cold weather also compounds driving range with electrics * Hybrids still have the internal combustion engine * China * India      It's naive to say what businesses should do because hey, MS *should* just use V8 and Webkit/Blink/Whatever...This whole Spartan is a waste of time, IE *should* be Chrome under the covers, right?  Have you ever worked in a really big, enterprise/corporate environment?  Choice is not a given. Your job is to support the business, which usually is far from Chrome Experiments.  I'd like to get you in on a conference call with Nike where you can tell them the problem is they're using a terrible browser and they should just install another one.  BTW, there are parts of Nike that are still on IE7. They pay us a metric shit ton of $ every year.   Come on now, that's that saying they claim it's always going to go up in price. Soon. Don't wait or you'll miss it. Buy now. The end is near, repent now. We take paypal.   Some people don't have a choice as to what browser they use, i.e., corporate lock down.

Reminds me of [Scatterbrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbLhHtaVIO4).               Congratulations on earning my future business.         Impressive collection.  For cost he says he's in for everything on a per oz basis of $34.21. I'd be more curious as to what each year cost, not everything averaged out.  Also says total oz is 461.4 so he's all in for **$15,784**.   Is your order under $1k?      I recently placed an order and it was $hipped out UPS, which really sucks for me as it's a 20+ mile trip (one way) to go pick it up. And I live in a major metro area....And of course you don't find out your carrier until you get the tracking number.  I wonder if UPS is their exclusive carrier now. That would definitely be a show stopper for me as saving $20 on an order isn't worth the inconvenience of UPS. I doubt I'd ever save enough to make it worth my while.   If you're young enough to join the military, I'd recommend going that path.  Special forces.  It's definitely more safe than a career in front-end development. Also, you can frag your boss when the going gets tough.   Honestly, I didn't even know Michigan had the internet. Surprised CNN hasn't picked this up yet.   There is no perfect front-end code.  Front-end code is going to be touched by many people, with different levels of skill, under different time constraints, with incomplete requirements, documenting nothing.  Get used to it.   You're right, it's the seat back. I thought it was some sort of bigger separator.  Nice catch.   I can tell you that train is built by Bombadier, I think out of Belgium.  We have these in Portland (they have little manufactured badges inside), but we don't have them with the horizontal metal beam in the foreground.  That guy does look like everyone on the train, though.   Started with these last year, have a tube of 2014 and 2015. I'll most likely pick up a tube each year.      [Here are the worst of mine](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) from a tube via the Silvertowne ebay deal. They don't bother me at all, they're just generic silver rounds.   One thing you need to keep in mind is the percentage change in silver to the percentage change in gold (per metric ton squared), when the latter has a causal influence on the former.  Think of silver spot price given in terms of differential calculus. In other words, it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another, causative variable (silver to gold). Silver has the advantage of being a unitless ratio (excluding the troy ounce), independent of the type of quantities being varied.   In empirical work regarding silver forecasting, you'll find the lows are the estimated coefficient in a linear regression equation where both the dependent variable and the independent variable are in natural logs.  You also need to factor in the percentage change in silver output induced by a percent change in silver input.   I'm glad to see this as my money is on radical Islamic fundamentalists being behind all the local missing cats.      I've been paying just due to the convenience factor. I'll take a look at taxslayer, thanks for the recommendation.    $17.50 each shipped which is still good.  Is it really for culls?   Not to steal your thunder or brag, but I have some quarters from like the late 50s.   But they know 78% of jQuery. 78%!   I've achieved my goal for a bullion position  Does this include gold, platinum and palladium?  If not, why not get a couple ounces of each? Or spend 2015 stacking non-silver? You could also spend this time to learn about silver numismatics.   Thanks, I'll check that out.  Do I need to provide electronic copies of my W2/mortgage interest/1099?   Yeah, I found some on retailmenot.com earlier as well.   Had to have been November 30th.  I bought a tube of the 2014 Libertads as well as a tube of the Canadian Bisons that Sunday night. I believe I ordered @ $14.72   I have pretty simple taxes:  * W2 wages * Mortgage insurance * 1099 misc income (from interest) * No Obamacare * No kids or any other deductions - as I said, pretty simple taxes  I've been going to a local guy for years but I'd like to save some $ and do them myself. He charges me around $100.  TurboTax and H R Block look to be the big players out there.  From my limited research, H R Block seems to get better reviews.  It looks like their Deluxe + State would be the best for me.  Some questions I have for those who have filed your own taxes online:  * Do I need to get electronic copies of my W2, mortgage insurance and 1099 that get sent along with my e-filing? * If I need to print out forms, does something like H R Block Deluxe let you save those out to PDFs for printing? I don't have a printer at home so would want to be able to print it out at work. For example, if I have to pay state taxes, I don't want to pay to e-file that, I'd want to print out and mail my state return.  Any hidden gotchas I should be aware of?  I would have nothing to import from previous years, so this would be brand new tax filing for me.      Might want to invest in a collar there, toots.   What type of companies have you worked for?  i.e., enterprise, large/small agency, small software, etc.            The best way to have $50k in gold and silver in this market in one year is to start with $75k.      Looks a lot more developed/modern than I would have imagined in 1890.  This is 30 years after Oregon became a state and the Civil War.  Looks like there is a street car in the lower left. The early ones were horse-drawn, which fits the time frame here, but there is not a visible horse in the photo, though it could be on the other side. Could also be electric as I think they had those pre-1900.   He was also extremely pro-gold before his Fed days.  **Before** he was the chairman, he heralded gold as being the true currency. **While** he was chairman, he denounced that statement. **After** he retired, he once again spoke about the reality of gold being the true currency. [Most recently that I'm aware of, speaking about gold at the Council on Foreign Relations, October 29, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz4-Tru_30A).   It looks like you need to buy 25 of the 25th anniversary to get the discount. This pricing may change this Wednesday, on the 25th (for the ultimate pricing trifecta), but that is pure speculation on my part.   Typically, dealers have a cost threshold that triggers signatures on shipping.  From my experience, that seems to be $500.   Their shipping charge is $7.77 on any order, lol.   Can confirm, when I add a tube to my cart and try to apply the redemption code it tells me:  This redemption code is linked to another eBay account   They're currently going for $53.28 each  Anyone else think a $10 premium for a [reported mintage of 9k](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertad_%28coin%29#Libertad_Silver_Series_.28Brilliant_Uncirculated.29_Minting_History..5B2.5D) is a bit much?

Most of the time there is no choice.  I've never been able to pick out what I want, so I don't want to get anything too crazy/expensive  Fuck that, go crazy.  I'm sure you have to, or will have to, deal with a lot of bullshit at work.  Might as well have a nice system. Remember, monitors are cheap, don't skimp on your computer.   Can you do my front door if I supply a photo?  I just had a security door installed.   I've found the trick is to just write your css like you always have pre-sass.  There's something really magical about compiling a .scss to .css with zero changes in the input/output file.  I don't know how it all works to be honest, it's just ones and zeros flying around to me.   You could try calling Home Depot or Lowes, they have contractors they use for various installs of stuff they sell.  They might be able to give you a referral.   Would not be so bad if the coins were 5oz each.   **P**roducing **A**nother **M**assive **P**remium item.      I'd contact APMEX and see what they say about how your orders were sent.   http://www.apmex.com/faq  *How is my order shipped? *American Precious Metals Exchange orders are shipped Registered/Insured U.S. Mail,   UPS. Each package is fully insured and may require a signature upon delivery.*  The "may require a signature" is probably determined by your order amount, which they could verify.  You could also be seeing a bug on USPS' tracking display.  If APMEX confirms they were sent with signature confirmation, it sounds like you have a problem with your postal carrier. In which case you'd at least know where the breakdown occurred and where to go to get it resolved in the future.   Only IF convicted.  I'm hoping we can throw in arson AND kidnapping as well. Might as well go for that felony conviction with some style.   You sure it was signature confirmation and not something like delivery confirmation?  Via https://www.usps.com/ship/insurance-extra-services.htm  *Signature Confirmation* *Find out information about the date and time an item was delivered, or when a delivery attempt was made. Add security by requiring a signature.*  If it was sent signature confirmation and you didn't sign for it:  * Claim you didn't get it * When they provide delivery information, ask them for your signature indicating you signed for it * Get insurance $ * Send me 50%   Were you orders under $500? From my experience, this *seems* like the cut off for signatures for the big vendors.  I recently picked up a tube of buffaloes from Silvertowne via ebay and they were just left in my mailbox.  $340 order.      When the next financial crisis occurs (derivatives bubble implodes).   This should be done annually where their track record can be documented clearly and concisely.   Craigslist missed connections.   Needs more Britny Fox.   What's something like that run today? I'm guessing it's a key date and CC is Carson City?  I don't know much about these...      I love this guy, definitely worth your time to explore his site and search for youtube interviews.   I thought it was fairly well known that Silvertowne was run by a sect of the Illuminati in concert with the banking cartel in their quest for a New World Order. We should get this added to the sidebar.  Ever wonder why the Indian is looking toward the right while the buffalo is looking toward the left? Think about it.  Also, APMEX are Freemasons of the Holy Royal Arch of the national Supreme Council, which explains their recent ebay "deal".   My house for date night according to several local women.   I can't help but shake this feeling that I'm overwhelmed...I come to work everyday and just feel completely incompetent...yesterday I ran across a relatively large JS file written by someone else (not commented or documented at all)  **Welcome to front-end development, pal**.

I lost a bet.   I pushed for a redesign of Digg.  Now I post here.   I'm not a big lyric guy but I can usually identify with the subject of a song - the Foo Fighters however, I don't think I can tell you what a single song is about. The lyrics are just jumbled words.  Just me?   Hi frenz.   Insulation has gotta suck on airstreams (walls are probably cold in the winter, hot in the summer).  You could completely gut it and spray foam insulate it, but taking it down to the shell and building it back up would be a sizable project.   I have a large house and, quite frankly, need some doorstops.   These don't do anything for me, but decent deal.         i tipped her $30  A fool and his money...That's a ridiculous tip, IMO. $5 is appropriate.  Also, once you find product you like, but it online (cheaper).   Cheaper for them to give it away for "free" than to go through cost of demo'ing it.  This would be a shit ton of $ to move nearly 110 years of problems.   A snotty attitude about the platform you left behind.   Needs collision detection.   My friend's family history, soon to be obliterated for more of the same pricey apartments in the Division neighborhood.  Did your friend's family sell their house to a developer? If so, you have issue with the developer developing their property?   Works for me. BTW, I have a couple of their hand poured bars, they're great. Their tiered shipping rates blow, though.   This is the correct response when you see parked cars like this.  If you're extremely lucky, someone will pull in head first on the other side.      No, I have a job.   We know it's not taking you to getting laid.   MintDirect is a marketing gimmick, IMO.  They want $22.47 for a MintDirect ASE. I can get you a MagentaDirect  Ultra Premier Platinum Tier ASE for $21.99.  Hurry, supplies are limited, act now.      **I would steer clear of goldmart.**  I've ordered from them once.  **Once**...I really think they sell what they don't have in stock (like Amagi), despite claiming they have it "in stock, ready to ship".  I also think they drop ship orders because when my order finally arrived, it was covered in multi-colored stamps.  [Imagine this, but literally covered in different colorful stamps](http://www.sandafayre.com/stockimages/26343163.jpg).  It really screamed unprofessional to me, but maybe that wouldn't bother anyone else.  I really wish I would have taken a picture of it to post whenever I share my goldmart experience.  Goldmart was the lowest price I found, but I will never do business with them again.  [Silver.com is 40 cents more per coin](http://www.silver.com/2015-1-oz-silver-canadian-maple-leafs/) and I can't recommend them enough.  They're the same folks as JM Bullion.  They're awesome. Silver.com is the cheapest I found doing some quick price comparisons.   That's fucked up if you bought on the 10th like me.  I hit the BIN in the evening as well.   There are a couple with some tiny dings, but I don't really care as they're generic and they were like 10 cents over spot.  The tube ran me $340.01. Hard to say no to that, IMO.   One had what almost looked like a diagonal score line across the back.  I'll try to get some photos up tonight, though sadly my camera isn't the greatest.  They'll go off to the safe deposit box Monday so if I can't get good quality photos tonight, the photos ain't happening :(  They look fine to me, again, generics, don't really care!  [**Photos of by far the worst two**](http://imgur.com/a/orgQl) and it sounds dumb, but they actually look worse in the photos than in person. Being generic as generic gets, doesn't bother me at all.  It's hard to photograph coins with my crappy camera....Subject matter is highly reflective, don't have the best lighting, camera macro isn't the greatest and the auto focus tends to do its own thing, sometimes half is in focus, half a little blurry.   [Looks like this is the auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/2015-1-oz-Silver-American-Eagle-BU-Lot-Roll-Tube-of-20-SKU-86595-/141528111687?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item20f3bb9a47).  The way ebay ASEs are going this year, I'll have a monster box by April, lol.   To be honest, this is how I think of all you guys posting here.   I know Silvertowne doesn't have the best reputation here with some folks in regards to their ebay auctions...I just wanted to post up [my tube of Buffaloes from a recent ebay auction of theirs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2vfkwa/ebay_deal_tube_of_buffaloes_for_34322/cohvcy1?context=3) was delivered today.  Hit the BIN on the 10th, in my mailbox/hands on the 13th.  Was my first Silvertowne purchase as well.     "3% is normal daily fluctuations.."  This seems a little high for normal daily fluctuations, no? I would also think gold would be tied to it a bit more than it currently is today. Maybe it's just me, though...            You could skype him and describe the designs using a puppet show.  I've found this strategy to be pretty effective.  My dog also seems likes the puppet show as well. You can spin that on skype as your dog being your business partner.   Yes sir.  They're my favorite generics and they were like 10 cents over spot.  A tube ran me $340.01, I think it was.   Design masturbation, there are no real security features. If you think the UV light is it, that is not real security.  Some nice illustrations, but design should solve a problem.   My order last night (of said Buffaloes) shipped out tonight from Indiana according to USPS tracking.  *My* ebay transaction seems to be panning out so far.   Did a Silvertowne ebay BIN last night, USPS tracking says it departed IN this evening.      Might be the 2-for-1 sale of Bolthouse Farms juices/smoothies going on at Freddies right now.  I know I doubled down on these last night.      The more you know. Thanks.      Can we link to ebay "deals" from the big vendors?  If so, can you all start linking directly when posting said deals.  If not, can you include the item # in your post so it's easier to find said deals.  Happy hump day.   have grown disillusioned because of the outpacing expectations/demands placed on their job  Yes.  Also, I've always found it incredibly easy to get (and keep) a job, but very, very hard to find interesting work and good project management.   Thanks again for posting this, picked up a tube earlier tonight.   http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BDIY:IND/chart   Thank you. You are an officer and a gentleman.   Can you post the item #? I'm behind a proxy and can't get to ebay now. I might give this a go tonight, though ST doesn't have the greatest rep here for their ebay auctions.   Server-side JS has been around since the mid 90s.  Netscape Livewire I believe it was called. Running on Netscape Enterprise Server...Those were the days.   I used to work at Yahoo and I've seen David Filo many a times in line in the cafeteria (named "urls").  Wasn't the CEO at the time (Jerry Yang), but he co-founded Yahoo with Jerry.   Are the two in back the butchers or the stock?   Did an [ebay BIN on a tube of ASEs Friday eve](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2v1omp/if_you_love_ase_like_i_do/codqf7v).  Just got home from work Monday pm and there was a delivery attempt notification. This was literally coast-to-coast shipping as well. I wasn't expecting anything before like Wednesday, tracked the ebay shipping # to make sure it was the ASEs and the delivery attempt was indeed the ASEs.  I've only purchased from them 2x (both via ebay, both ASEs tube sales) and this purchase is absolutely bananas!  Bananas, I tell you.    I've taken my basic Flash classes  lol.  	200
 Well I've checked out SotA, my problem is with the PvP. I was big into mage PvP. I loved how you could literally have 70 key commands and if you really worked at it, you could beat 10v1. I don't see that with SotA. I also don't like the camera angle which appears less conducive to that sort of gameplay.   Guild Wars seems to really get the closest as to what I would want a "new" UO to look like. But instead of a zoom, scrolled out and above. But the open world aspect of a pre-Trammel UO is not in Guild Wars DNA. UO was fun whether you we're a PKer or a Hunter/Miner/Gatherer etc because of the fear of being outside of the walls of the city. And while the guards could basically insta-hit you, it was a lot more engaging then what a lot of games do by creating "PvP zones" where you have to enter load areas etc.   I wish I had a billion dollars to produce my own hardcore game that was more about a world with realistic boundaries and magic/fantasy sprinkled on top than a whole world that just constantly reminds you it's phony *sighs*   Could this be a sign that EA may be working with Garriott to bring SoTA into UO2. I know it's much later now but months ago I remember him answering that question with yes, it wouldn't be difficult to take what he had and create a UO2 if EA was willing to give all control the Richard.    6 weeks ago my baseball fantasy team was ranked number 6 and I probably wasn't even going to make the playoffs (only 4 teams get in) I added Jeter, haven't lost a game since and I'm winning the championship game by 150 points.    Thank you   Mmmm well then offer 3000, who cares, lol   As long as there is no offers and they are willing to counter, it can't hurt to try to get it at a lower price.   Regardless what you do, if it's a fire sale it will be gone quickly so just get an offer in and receive a counter.   Best day ever.   Also her disappearance is similar to 5-6 other missing people in the last few years.    It started off as a joke but I picked up Derek Jeter. He is absolutely crushing the ball in the last week. I guess pitchers are just throwing fast balls down the cock for him. Should I start him this week? He's facing a lot of less than stellar pitchers.    I was at a recreational baseball park where I had a game later that day when I was around 13, this girl was hovering over my shoulder and when I looked at her she told me I had really clean ears.... about 10 minutes later one of her friends handed me her number.    I know it's in the game but I'm looking for a controller layout for the xbox one in the PDF or text layout that I can print... I'm tired of going back and forth.  Does anyone have a link? Thank you   I would love if you had a site like that as well. I'm in the process of remodeling a bathroom and it would be great to see all the issues that are ahead of me.    I personally roll the dice on Tanaka. The Yankees aren't theoretically out of it so they'll definitely want the win. Will he throw a CG, 100% no way but I think he has the opportunity to throw 6.   As defending champion, ordinary citizens (my friends) begged for me to lose. As I barely made it into the playoffs (didn't make playoffs until last week) people didn't take me serious. Now as I close on my opponent (#1 seed, which was 21-2) and prepare for the championship, I ask ... What should I do with my starting rotation. This is a head to head matchup and it involves total points, not winning categories.   My playoff bullpen: http://imgur.com/Z8C62Nl   I'm personally making a big bet on this stock. I feel like it's near the bottom and I have moved all stock money into just GTAT. I'm also in no need for that money and plan to be waiting for quite some time. (6 months - 1 year)   Title says it all, on Fox Fantasy it shows as yes but reading a few sites says otherwise.   SAMESIES!!    How they started on Tuesday, 5 days later = Sunday? And all games all week, no days off      Why did they push back his next start until the Cardinals? He was one of my double-starters this week, wtf.   wow   I'm in first round playoff, guy I'm playing had Cashner and was sending me shit talking text messages all Tuesday. Haven't heard from him since around the 6th inning of Arrietas CG   Mannnnnnnnnnnn I hope that's the case because I'll need all the help I can get.    I lost McHugh last night too, hopefully he still pitches Saturday or Sunday.    I dominated but it just happened to be my opponent had TRUMBO AND CASHNER.. *begins to weep*   Honestly.. I live near Oceana and we get this on the daily. I guess I'm spoiled but video was eh   Damnit, he's a double starter for me. First round of playoffs.   All I saw was McHugh was pulled for injury delay, WHAT HAPPENED!?!?    I would make a badass video game that's pretty much pre-aos ultima online but a lot cooler.   I can't tell if your comments are encouraging my sexual comments or if everyone is oblivious to all the innuendos.   hahaha shave your wood!  Boxes!! Wood!! Rough wood!! Ok it's out of my system.

 In 3rd grade my friend and I would give each other blowjobs after seeing porn for the first time... We're both males.   WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THIS. GENIUS!!   Hannah Montana   My mom's giving away all my childhood toys to charity. I know I'm way too old to be playing with those toys but I can't help but feel empty... it feels like she's giving my childhood away :(   Look at the bright side of things! Take time to enjoy college life and hang out with friends. Chances are you'll be missing college when you graduate.   I can relate to your social anxiety as sometimes I would have trouble speaking whats on my mind without worrying what other people think of me. It got better for me, however, when I learned to stop giving a shit about what other people think of me and to speak what's on my mind even if I do sound like a fool. Just remember, people aren't very judgemental about what you say and generally they'll forget it in a while. It's better to say what's on your mind then keep it inside. Good luck!   I had sort of a similar situation with one of my friends in high school but it was nowhere as extreme as yours and we weren't as close as you and your friend. It started off similarly, a new girl transfered to my high school and had similar interests (ex: league of legends, anime, manga). We seemed to be pretty close for a while and then things started to fall apart as she met new people. I began to notice it at the beginning of junior year when she didn't invite me to her birthday party. Since then I've talked to her less and less to the point where I can hardly consider her a friend anymore, much rather as an acquaintance or simply a classmate. Like you, I was taken aback by this and I spent a while trying to restore the relationship but it wasn't the same. In your case, I think you should just move on and meet new people and make new friends. If she's that inconsiderate to your opinions and wishes maybe you should reevaluate your friendship with her. It probably hurts to cut ties with her but it's probably for the best. Keep in mind as painful as it is, friendships don't always last forever...   If you can't bring yourself to stop cheating then it would be best to end the relationship right now. It might sound horrible, but it would save you from the eventual drama later on when she does find out. It's not too late though, swear and committ to yourself you won't cheat on your girlfriend or SO ever again. Stay true to your promise and things will get better!   I made a vow to myself that I'll never use the same child rearing tactics my parents had used on me.   I get the same feeling when I finish watching a good anime.   I feel you dude. My mom is exactly like you, except she criticizes me mostly on school or academics. Ever since I was a kid, I've never had a social life. It was always study, study, study.... or practice the violin. Things got exponentially worse when I went into middle school. All of a sudden, it seemed like if I didn't receive an A (90 or higher) I would be a total failure for the rest of my life. In fact in 6th grade she whipped me with my dad's belt and locked *and* blocked the door so I couldn't run. Aside from that, there are multiple instances where they threaten to disown me if I didn't reach their expectations or they would say I would be better off dead so I can't disgrace them further. Honestly I've learned to deal with (mostly my mom's) bullshit. She's also incredibly bipolar, sometimes she'll be in a good mood but when she's in a bad mood, every little thing would piss her off. Something as small as spilling a glass of water would make her scream at you for at least an hour. As for my social life, I'm only allowed to hang out with my friends "occasionally" (once or twice every year). I'm not allowed to play any video games (last time she found out she was hitting me with a chair). I'm not allowed to watch T.V which is impossible anyways because she canceled our cable service back when I was in 7th grade. Luckily for me, she made my father try to monitor what I'm doing on the internet but they both suck at using computers or technology in general so they don't know about incognito. Honestly, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that the future will be better when I can move out. Until then, I have to keep up with this. You're not alone dude :) and I'm sure this is common for A LOT of asians out there. Sometimes it can be hard to keep your emotions inside (in fact I'm letting my anger out right now) but just do well not for the sake of them but for the sake of yourself!   My junior health teacher told me this in high school: "You don't need to have all the answers when you're 16-18, it's perfectly fine if you don't know what you want to do in the future." I wish people would acknowledge this instead of constantly pressuring teens to do well in school, acting like their whole life depends on a couple of numbers. I understand school is important but people overexaggerate the impact high school will have on your life. If people had told me this sooner, maybe I wouldn't have been so depressed and confused.   I have around 51 hours on terraria from a while back when I used to play a lot   HI! I played Terraria a while ago. I'm just getting back into it. If anyone wants to set up a brand new terraria server and create a new character to start fresh! I'd be glad to play with you. My steam name is theguyhiding!   OMG I reacted the same way back when I was 13!!   so the dick and balls penetrated both her eyes and mouth?   Well make a mercedes for the link skill, it's useful :D and mercedes are a fun class nonetheless.   Wind Archer or Mercedes! Wild Hunter is also pretty good and common right now.    Add me xDKnightzx1. I'm not exactly a low level but I'm willing to help you on some boss runs!   Aww that sucks :( I was hoping you guys would actually do a 180 and start dating each other. I like surprise happy endings like that hahaha. But people go their seperate ways and friendships do eventually erode. Nonetheless, I'm glad you seem both of you guys seem to be happy :D   Regardlessly, even if you didn't directly caused his suicide, you should still feel some guilt or at least some remorse for his death. While I understand that he was trying to hit on your girlfriend in front of you, you should've never said "go kill yourself". Those words especially could be the trigger for some people to actually committ suicide. You never know what they're feeling and what they're going through.    I liked the twist at the end :D. I wonder if you guys are friends now? Both of you seem to be on much friendlier terms. It's also cute to see how she developed a crush on you. Maybe you guys should go out sometime :)   I'm going through this right now. I just finished watching HxH 2011 and I don't know what to do with my life right now. The feeling of emptiness and nothingness is the worst part. Now I have to find another enjoyable anime to binge watch to take my mind off of things :(. I hate this endless vicious cycle...   Pitou would probably have to use Terpischora to break free but she can't because that requires Nen. I think Pitou even with her raw strength wouldn't be able break free of it. Youpi is physically strong but is he stronger than Uvogin? Keep in mind in terms of raw physical power Uvogin ranks the highest out of the whole Phantom Troupe and he even he was powerless against the Nen chains Kurapika conjured.   I'm not exactly sure if they would be able to break free of those Nen chains. Kurapika used it on Uvogin and he was struggling greatly and he didn't even manage to loosen the chains one bit. Also the chains I believe inhibits the person trapped from using Nen so that means the Royal Guards would have to use their innate physical strength. I think Kurapika at that point would have a good chance to defeat them. The harder part would actually be getting the chains onto them...      1. I remember watching the very first episode of HxH 2011 a few years ago, I didn't like it all that much so I put it aside. Fast forward to two months ago, I decided to restart it and I LOVED IT! My love for HxH particularly started around episode 3 when they started the actual first phase of the Hunter Exam. 2. The first episode may be a bit "underwhelming" and a bit like the typical shounen cliche especially with how Gon and his dream of becoming a hunter reminded me of Naruto's dream of becoming a Hokage lol. Then when the actual phases of the Hunter Exam started it was awesome and definitely not underwhelming anymore. 3. Shounen is probably my favorite genre or a close second since I also like Romance/Slice of Life animes too. HxH, I feel is an exception from most Shounen animes I've seen. The storytelling for one is much more fluent than the storytelling of other shounens. Also in HxH there isn't one character that seemed incredibly overpowered and strong like Goku in DBZ. (Maybe Mereum but Netero helped balanced it). 4. I found this show simply by scrolling through a list of popular animes on Crunchyroll.    Beautifully well done! I love the details you added to Alluka. Overall excellent sculpture!! May I ask how long sculpting the whole thing took?   Applicable to women: "How much do you weigh?"   Hisoka might be overhyped just a bit tho    LOL Niagara Falls coming out of Hisokas pants   Nice explanation! That's what I was thinking before too :D!   fight her as a team    This is assuming all of them used their full strength.   I'm looking to start fresh on a new server, maybe on Windia, after I level my Dark Knight to 200. We can play together if you'd like :D      You could send me a 10k nx code if you'd like also :D. I could use some extra character slots too!   I really like your example of the Butterfly Effect! It reminded me a lot of the anime, Steins;Gate.    Said no one ever.    I have a few questions. What map in BH do you use as a training area? My Dark Knight is lvl 195, would it still give good exp?   Does Black Heaven really give good exp?         Amidst all the sexual NSFW stories other people posted, your post is the only one that doesn't contain the word "sex" or "masturbate" in it. Good job!!   500 Days of Summer!!!   ITT: Crazy Yuno Gasai girls   The SAT Blue Book   OMG they killed Kenny! You bastards!!!   OMG MY EXACT THOUGHTS!!   Yeah! I'm interested, I'm on scania though...   Yeah he's a pretty decent president, definitely not completely terrible but not revolutionary either. People just like to blame him for everything since they can't blame it on any other politician.    Ah, that makes sense! On a side note, I hope Gon finds his dad sometime soon!   I see, thanks!    Yes I'm looking forward to seeing more of this arc! I liked the Yorknew City Arc as well. Another question, what happened to Chrollo? Why didn't he return back to the Phantom Troupe? I know Kurapika put that chain around his heart but other than that what's stopping him from going back to the Troupe?   I just got up to the Greed Island Arc and I don't quite understand the rules? Do you leave the island when you collect the 100 cards that are part of the restricted card slots inside the book?   Probably going to be buried but oh well...  I've been friends with my best friend since I was in 3rd grade. What brought us together was our shared interest in video games and the fact that we're pratically neighbors. While we're still friends, we don't have the same camaraderie that we shared years ago. Since high school we went sort of on our own separate ways. He hangs out with other people and he spends more time with his girlfriend than with me. Looking back, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced. Seeing the distance grow between you and your best friend is utterly terrible, especially knowing that no matter how hard you try, your relationship with him won't ever be the same. But thats part of life and it's one of the few things I've managed to come to terms with.   	56
    Lets see whose number will be next.   NYPD Red 3 by James Patterson      What a view. It's mesmerizing...      These are the most common questions that I exchange with folks when we first meet.

Be imaginative and start a charity project. There are groups and organizations in need of help raising funds or gathering materials. One student, whose brother was ill during his childhood, saw the need to help the Ronald McDonald house by collecting gently used toys. Another realized that his test prep books would go to waste, so he created a charity that collected these books and donated them to schools and libraries so students could use them without having to purchase them.

(   )       All my ex girlfriends.   torture chamber in the Ministry of Love      When I was in middle school, our entire class was lined up outside our History class after recess, waiting to get in. We waited like 10 minutes, wondering where our teacher was. He suddenly bursts through the door and is SUPER PISSED OFF. There is practically steam coming out of his ears. He divides the class, putting 5 people on one side of the room, and the rest of the class on the other. On the floor, there is a large rectangle of masking tape. He gives rolls of tape to the 5 selected students, and instructs them to bind the hands of everyone on the other side of the room. Everyone in the class is creeped right out. As our hands are being bound, anyone who speaks gets hushed immediately by our furious teacher. He stares them down with an intense look of disapproval and gives the slitting-your-neck sign language with his finger. When everyone is bound, he makes the class lie down, one by one, inside the taped rectangle. He then instructs the 5 students to tape our legs and mouthes. Kids start to protest, but he yells at them to be quiet and lie down. When the entire class is bound and gagged on the classroom floor, tiled up like sardines, the teacher turns off the lights and leaves the room. Everyone starts freaking out, ripping the tape off, getting up. Chaos descends. Nobody can figure out what the fuck is going on. The teacher comes back into the room with a huge shit-eating grin on his face and says "Now you all know what it's like to be on a slave ship heading to the colonies!" He was fired a few weeks later.   I believe in the possibility that there are other life forms inhabiting corners of the universe other than our little patch of earth. I am not saying that this life might be intelligent life or even life on a scale as we know it - it might be bacterial level or in a state which we cannot in our current knowledge imagine. And then again maybe there are other vastly more 'advanced' (or maybe 'civilized' is a better way to put it) life forms out there that we no nothing about.    I am going with my family in Croatia.

 Didn't we find that out in 4x02?   Doesn't make it good. The ending is still weak, with nothing to say about any of its characters. Every single AC game apart from this one does that very well. Altair, Ezio (x3), Connor (kind of), Edward and Shay all had endings that put their leads' journeys into perspective. Arno learns the dangers of revenge...but then goes through with it anyway...and doesn't become an assassin again...but gets a Master Assassin outfit...and honours his dead...and joins Napoleon...what? It's a mishmash of stuff happening, but none of it resonates because there's no real conclusion to any kind of journey. I still hate the direction the modern day story has gone.   Chronicle turned out pretty great. It was extremely relatable for someone like me, as I used to wish I had telekinesis when I was a young Star Wars fan.     However, there were some issues: how could he have never heard of telekinesis? He's a shut-in who listens to Bowie - sci-fi themed music. He'd know about telekinesis.     Also, his father is a raging drunk. Andrew hates him for his drinking habits and what it does to him. At the talent show after-party, Andrew gets blasted without any choice shown as to whether he might refuse or stop to consider whether it's a good idea. He doesn't even try to drink responsibly. He would have spent a considerable chunk of his life resenting this drunk figure and every aspect of what makes him horrible, so it doesn't make any fucking sense that just because Andrew's a teen, we might assume *of course he's going to get wasted*. It just doesn't make sense considering the three guys don't want to let anyone know about their powers, but they're putting their better judgement on the line without discussing it. Might have happened off screen, but whatever.           It's just a tiny aspect that frustrated me. All in all, pretty cool film.   Raging Boll! That's fucking gold.   Not Drama? I didn't laugh once. With an opening line such as Calvary's, I didn't exactly get a funny vibe from any of it.      [first line spoilers](/s "I first tasted semen when I was seven years old.")   Looks like it's Chronicle x Butterfly Effect.   Directed by Martin McDonagh's brother. Great film, but it's not a comedy.    Maybe that statement was a stunt too. I wouldn't put it past the guy.   Correct   He also called himself "the only genius in the whole fucking business", and [admitted he's *never played a video game*](http://www.laserlemming.com/2014/09/03/uwe-boll-admits-hes-never-played-a-video-game/), despite having so many game adaptations on his CV.     At least Tommy Wiseau *wanted* to make a masterpiece. Boll only wants money.      Edit: apparently the genius thing was part of a stunt to drum up controversy for one of the Postal movies. What a tool.   Agreed.   Nope, sorry :)   Also correct.   Correct   Gone Girl, Nightcrawler, The Imitation Game.   Video compiled and edited by regular Lost series editor Mark J. Goldman.   *applause*   Mass Effect and The Dark Tower. Both have finite ends, but they're better than nothing!   How is it a mystery that people have powers? In other movies and TV shows, we just accept that it's possible and move on. That's not something that should need an answer.   TV On the Radio covering Bowie, in a Game of Thrones trailer full of unseen footage. How much awesome...   You know what, I've never even thought about this...   Aside from Blade Runner or Taxi Driver, I'd say Gone Girl. I kind of wanted some kind of closure to any of the characters, like Margo or the cops. I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE WEIGHT OF IT ALL. It's just an unsatisfying, weak note to leave on.     But, hey: [spoilers](#s "That's marriage, baby!")   Casino Royale and Skyfall do this well. People forget that the only Daniel Craig Bond movie where he actually succeeds in what he's trying to do, is godawful. Given, they're more Empire Strikes Back-style of things all going to shit, but it's honestly better than forced happy endings.   Lol you could say that.   He was much better in Season 1 than he is in Season 2, trust me.   I kind of hate the camerawork and cinematography in The Avengers. So many Dutch angles and close-ups! Once the action gets going, it's fantastic and exhilarating. That first hour is pretty hard to sit through for me.   Okay, I've fixed it now :)   *The Star Spangled Man, wiiiiith a plan!*   It's a pretty unpopular opinion whenever I post it. I usually get a long rant about why I'm completely wrong.   You're not remembering the 2 hour DLC pack, released on Valentine's Day, about [spoilers](#s "the death of her *girlfriend*")?   I honestly thought we were past Lost-bashing. I love that show :(   Lol I meant stories you could tell in a movie.     My ideas for cutting out so many parts of the main story was to make room for crew time, which is crucial for fleshing out the characters. I'm sure you could fit it all in. Sure, you could set cool little horror pieces or hard sci-fi stories in this universe, but I want to see Tali on the big screen! I want to hear Garrus' epic voice booming in surround sound. We're attached to the main characters partly because they represent completely different races. Having any other Turians, Quarians or Asari wouldn't be the same.    Hey, you've still got Kaidan and Ash as male/female stand-ins for Shepard!      All joking aside, is there much else to tell in this universe other than THE END OF CIVILISATION AS WE KNOW IT? There are many original stories you can form in ME's universe around this event, but I'm saying since the original games are based around this one conflict, it would be a wasted opportunity to ignore such a magnificent story. In fricking IMAX. I would *insert vulgar comment here*.   Cap 1 was the best Phase One movie.      EDIT 2: Instead of the previous edit containing admittedly pathetic early complaining about a single downvote, I'll just  leave this:     *Meatball. Meatball. Spaghetti underneath. Ravioli. Ravioli. Great Barrier Reef!*   Check to see if they're region b locked on http://regionfreemovies.com/ . Tons of Blu-Rays are actually region free, but only labelled by the region they're manufactured for.   Mass Effect. Not any of my artsy ideas, or the one biopic I've thought about.      Here's the major issue: Shepard, male or female, is a hard-edged space marine. Any mainstream audience would find it painful to follow a character that is constantly forced to make tough decisions and may not necessarily pick the option you'd choose.      **That's why you kill Shepard off on Virmire.**      Make the crew the focus. God, that's still too many lead characters - two would be CG, one under heavy make-up and another needing CG feet.        Unlike in the game, the characters would be actually interacting, arguing, training etc. rather than standing/sitting in one spot between missions. Feros is unnecessary, Noveria can be whittled down to a scene of Shepard visiting the already dead Rachni queen, Benezia v Liara, 1v1 360 no scopes Dawn of Justice could be shifted to the Citadel bleh bleh.      Here you've got a fresh Lovecraftian sci-fi action franchise with brains, untapped because Legendary Pictures have been sitting on the license.   I believe he explains it to Sawyer, whose life was also ruined by Anthony Cooper.   Gladly.   Thing is, many countries outlaw Nazi iconography. And rightfully so.      Blaming an entire people for a small group of extremists' crimes is going too far. Encouraging physical harm is distasteful and widely looked down upon. It's propaganda and it should be discouraged.   *Downey Olympics*     My god, man...   Nikki and Paulo in **LOST** were not good. The episode used to kill them off was fantastic, though.   /r/masserect   [Birdman spoilers](#s "Because he gives him false hope - the happy look on Riggan's face is heartbreaking knowing it's based on a lie")   Not to mention the dialogue was clearly written by someone who doesn't know how English people speak. So many lines sounded like excerpts from a Jane Austen movie trailer.   Actually it's a deleted scene from The Muppets. Close, though.   What I meant was that AMC are certain it's going to be a hit *because it's related to Breaking Bad*. They already know people will respond well to it, so getting the word out - positive word - would be their main priority in order to secure viewers because, like you said, they have to convince people that the show has potential to last.   IMDb synopsis contains hardcore spoilers.   Yeah? I hate it when they do that.   Oh my god, is his name Eddie too? Locke says this is Deus Ex Machina several times.   Gotta say I was quite disappointed in Gone Girl. I didn't expect a David Fincher thriller which was continuously ramping up in tension to end the way it did. I quite enjoyed it up until then. It was certainly original, but I can't say any of the important characters got closure. The line [spoilers](#s "That's marriage, baby!") seemed to me like an excuse.        I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion, so I'll hope you guys can accept some difference in opinion.   That scene was very hard to watch, but not because of that.   Critics usually get pilot/first episode screener copies early if the network has faith in the show. Getting the first three episodes? AMC are certain it's going to be a hit and want to get positive word out.   *Better Call Saul will air exclusively in New Zealand on on-demand service Lightbox.*          Great business move by Telec- I mean, "Spark", with Netflix coming this year and with Soho only really being popular during Game of Thrones seasons.   Only AC platinum with a default name :(   Will that be after [Aussie Sniper](http://youtu.be/s0hsmTp608U)?   Since this game became available on PS+, the platinum percentage has plummeted.   You removed the word rumour from the title.   That sadly doesn't work on mobile. It just shows the word YOLO as the fourth word in your comment, linking to a blank page.   I liked the fact that the professor was called Callahan as a clear Dirty Harry reference, because the city is half San Francisco.       Apart from that, speeding up your main pop song for time constraints is a crime in any movie. As soon as the brother drove on screen, I thought straight away that *this guy is a walking tombstone. He's not in any of the promos and he's an endlessly perfect role model.* I groaned when he Uncle Ben'd.      Overall: great animation, cool concepts, but it's such an origin story! We're all sick of that.   The real crime in this video is the editing.   Which pixel?   Why are they ten metres apart?   Thank you!   ...is that body paint?   I thought it was impossible for Shaggy to look more like a stoner.   Interstellar. It's supposed to be a love letter to sci-fi, but although it's quite inventive, the ending was telegraphed. It's quite similar to concepts I've read about in Clarke's 2001 and 2010, so I was legitimately frustrated at the Nolans for going in that direction when the film had so much potential to end in an original and satisfying way, not telegraphed and just *good* compared to the fucking incredible film it had mostly been.   Great way to find out your job is in jeopardy - browsing Reddit. My condolences to whoever this affects.   Makes sense.   How the fuck did I not notice this before?!   Should we count Pirhana 2 as a Cameron movie?   *Matthew Vaughn has seen Fifty Shades of Grey. He said "It's good. If you like Chronicle, you'll like this."*   Matthew Vaughn said that about Fantastic Four, a movie he's producing, which is directed by Josh Trank, who made Chronicle...or is this a meme now?   I agree with both of them, sorry. It tries to be about two separate aspects of one man's life but at just over 100 minutes long, it ran ridiculously short for how much it tried to cram in.      The dialogue sounds like it was written an American screenwriter who doesn't know how to make characters sound English, and the Norwegian director does pretty well making it sound natural...but it doesn't help that so many of its lines read like trailer excerpts.       So much of the Bletchley Park story felt off. A tad unrealistic, and that's because it actually didn't happen like that at all. They were all fully behind Turing's project - in fact he was specifically brought in to work on those machines. Why did it have to be turned into The Social Network?   I'm on mobile, and usually download movies straight from YouTube. I don't want to sit at the computer watching it, using up more data than I would from otherwise.   2:40? The movie is much shorter than that. Guessing it's another slowed down one (ugh).   And even if, like Lilly, you have literally less than two minutes.   Fucking Zac Efron doesn't take up much time. You can fit Netflix in.   Why were Guy Pearce and Evangeline Lilly in the top billed cast of that film? Their *combined* screen time takes up about 7% of the entire runtime.   Really? Nice. Take it home after the film ceases showing!   I misread that last sentence sorry.   I kind of expected her to die in AoU. The MCU has propelled her career and I thought she wanted to go in new directions, but this is certainly not bad news!   Because it's a visual effects nomination, and that's what his scenes showcased.   I worded it pretty badly.   It's kinda plagiarism if they don't credit them.   It's the iTunes poster iirc, or at least the iTunes poster we have in New Zealand.   Therefore I said "Cuse *had* joined the show".   Because you play /r/games on them, and I use mine all the time.   Not on Vita. Your memory card is tied to your account, and they're super expensive.   It was not actually intended to be a one-shot. It was more that Lindelof underestimated the popularity the show would gain, as the main reason he opted to co-write the pilot was to get his foot in the door with JJ Abrams. After a season of clearly running the characters in circles, Cuse had joined and they began to put full effort into show running a show that was clearly not going to end soon.      Plus, ABC not Fox ;)   You can only buy it on the internet, and not in Australia on PSN, on any of the three Playstation platforms the original was released on.   Damon fully admitted to doing this in Season 1 because he thought the show would get cancelled. The tone of the guy being interviewed, and the writer, is what makes it sound much worse than it really is.   Plus an entire 40 minutes of character development and great moments that do not screw with the pacing at all. Great extended cut.   Ewww, I forgot about that out-of-the-blue corny Bennifer sex scene that they thankfully removed from the Director's Cut.   Hotline Miami is actually a downloadable title, so EB Games is not in the conversation.   I hope to God this doesn't effect New Zealand.   That doesn't change my opinion.   My memory might be failing me in that part.   Do we ever have evidence of that, though?   Europe, Australia and New Zealand, yes. Not in North America, though.   It's not exactly plagiarism if your main goal is to give people hope.   Inception and The Prestige are good enough to be in the conversation, IMO, but Interstellar certainly needed a few rewrites - anything to remove the telegraphing of the plot resolution, from Act 1. It was almost exactly what I expected to happen, having seen 2001 and read 2010. It was clearly an homage to films like 2001, but it didn't need to come as close to copying them as it did.   Partly, I felt like saying something controversial but after I finished the film a few hours ago, I was extremely let down by the ending. The film goes in such an insane, surreal direction that it felt unearned for the story to come full circle. His wife is crazy and her story had some insane holes - the freaking woodshed?! At least if the movie ended 15 minutes earlier, it might have been left up to your imagination (if I'm not mistaken, that's closer how the book ends). The *suggestion* that what we do get out of the ending may be the outcome of the entire debacle, I believe, may have been more satisfying than *knowing* this is probably the beginning of the rest of their lives. By going on longer, you get the feeling that there may be another few twists and turns, considering how many were crammed into the rest of the film; however, that's not the case.       TL;DR: lack of ambiguity for their future, ten minutes too long, full circle ending unearned IMO.     (Edited for italics)  	102
 It's all good guys, It's safe.... I'll show myself out.   Well, "She ain't got time to take a fast train!"   Ha ha.   So sad, it must be a anorexia party or something.   1980 what?

 Harry Potter looks like a really old Bill Gates. Well they atleast nailed Dumbledore and Snape for sure.   This is exactly what I thought about Guardians of the Galaxy. The story drags itself around back and forth and doesn't end anywhere but to a sequel. By the way, World War Z wasn't critically acclaimed in the first place. It has 68% on rt and 7/10 on imdb. It was just an 'ok' movie.   Gone Girl.   * Das Boot * Aguirre, wrath of god * Fitzcarraldo * The 400 blows * La Haine *  Stalker    Can't tell if this is either clever marketing or legit post.      Nah, anyone can visit the criterion closet. Even Alec Baldwin and Bill Hader have dvd picks video.   Nope, this is just a series of videos for their youtube channel where directors come and pick their favourite movies.    You mean Delta Farce : the underrated gem. amirite?    I would add 'King of Comedy' to that list.      The uploader put great effort into editing the audio. But, as Stanley Kubrick's interviews are very rare, it was worth for sure.  This meant that you'd hear Kubrick talk for about 3 or 4 seconds and then have a translator jump in and repeat what he said in French at a louder volume. Usually the translator would step in and cut off the first or last words that Kubrick was saying, or sometimes just talk over the top of him, making it even more difficult to listen to. Maddeningly, the translator would sometimes interject after he said only three or four words! Ciment's English-language questions were spoken over in French simultaneously, often rendering them impossible to hear.

[For anyone interested about the story in the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EShApFSrXqw)    **Fun Fact** : Walt Disneys last written words were apparently Kurt Russell  As Walt Disney laid on his deathbed, suffering from lung cancer, in 1966, the story goes (later confirmed by Kurt Russell) that he scribbled on a piece of paper the name Kurt Russell. He died never writing another word.  Many have speculated what this could have meant, including the famous actor himself, Kurt Russell who in a 2007 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live said, Its true. I dont know what to make of that. I was taken into his office one time after he died and I was shown that. Russell was a child actor at the time for Disney, having just signed a ten year contract with the studio.   TR3N !!!!!!!!!!

"I dont know I think Id like to say only that they should learn to be alone and try to spend as much time as possible by themselves. I think one of the faults of young people today is that they try to come together around events that are noisy, almost aggressive at times. This desire to be together in order to not feel alone is an unfortunate symptom, in my opinion. Every person needs to learn from childhood how to be spend time with oneself. That doesnt mean he should be lonely, but that he shouldnt grow bored with himself because people who grow bored in their own company seem to me in danger, from a self-esteem point of view."

 Etna remains untouched    I noticed that as well, It seem like I can never play on the maps that I like. I'm usually confined to the same maps.   I play/played Halo reach a lot, and it seems as if more people play reach than 4. Thank you though. Going to pop it in now.   I picked up the Limited edition Halo 4 on the release date and after a couple months stopped playing it completely. Is anyone really playing it anymore? If so, is the game balanced and/or glitchy. I want to get back into Halo 4, but I'm not too sure if It's worth it.  I do believe Halo 4 was a good game, just did not keep the same vibe past Halos did.   Yes, certainly is. For some reason i relate to the video and brought me a sense of understanding through myself.   I know it doesn't exactly describe depression, but the video "scarfy" has been a favorite of mine for awhile   It makes me happy to hear that. Keep up the work. I'm proud of you.    I'm scared to feel happy. As if happiness will be my greatest downfall.    I hope that you can too get better. I wish the world wouldn't have to live in misery.    Not necessarily, I'm quite alone. I only have online friends and 2 friends in real life.      *background* Been depressed since I was very young. I suffer from isomnia, anxiety, social anxiety, and clinic depression. I've been extremely suicidal in the past 8 months. Tried to kill myself 3 times, but failed. Anxiety attacks are very common and I usually stress over every little thing. My paranoia makes me afraid to go outside anymore.   For some reason I'm very afraid of healing. I feel as if it's a part of me and without it my other problems would overwhelm me. I've tried to got to counseling, but broke it off after 2 sessions. I never take medication because I'm scared of side affects.  I'm tired of feeling so down, but yet I do nothing to heal. I just end up laying in my dark room. I feel so pathetic. As if I don't deserve to get better.   I just wanted to know, am I the only one that's afraid to heal?   Sound types maybe. A lot of pokemon could fit into it already.    GAMEstop    New mega evolution confirmed!   Saying that is basically saying that all "enter metal genre here" are only creeps who are only angry and want to scream about violence. That's an assumption people make right? Its obviously not true. You make assumptions that all music from that genre is emo bullshit, but yet you're judging it by mainstream bands. It like calling all thrash metal satanic bullshit because slayer sung about this once, or all death metal is about murder because cannibal corpse sung about this (I know bad example).  I'm sorry but it angers me when people classify a whole genre by a mainstream band.  Btw I'm not making those assumptions, just examples from what I've heard before.   Kakuna and metapod doe   Done. I liked the survey and glad to help.   Wallace wells   Mind explaining what's going on my friend?

I'm sorry if this does not belong here, but recently i set up my old gamecube on my 42'' Vizio, and the picture is very blurry. Not only is it blurry, the borders are messed up. Ex. The damage meter(or whatever it is called) on Super Smash brothers. It Is out of the picture. This makes it sorta difficult to play certain games. How do you fix this? Sorry if this doesn't belong here. If needed direct me where to go for help.   Hahaha   I too have sung Death's praise Life is the only thing worth living for Life is simply as it states. I know it has its ups and downs and, trust me I still have my problems but it eventually eases up. Find something that simply calms you and helps you enjoy life. (Ex. Music is what i vented through) The belief of no point us the death's praise. Do not sing that song. Just think about it. Think about what hasn't been done and, what will create a reason for life. Hopefully we all can find our meaning in this sadistic world eh?  	28
 Familiarity mostly. I've also been promoted three times in almost three times and now I make a pretty decent amount of money for a retail job. I have a BA and there are barely any jobs I'm qualified for that pay as much as I make at Staples.  I also don't mind it, mostly. Lately my patience has kind of been wearing thin, mostly due to annoying new people and stupid, unrealistic corporate expectations. But, another perk is paid vacations, and I have one coming up so hopefully that will give me my motivation back.   So I've been in somewhat of a supervisor role with Staples for a little more than two years. Over that time I've been pretty good about motivating people to do their jobs; I have a positive attitude, I joke around with the associates. Whatever. And I've made it work so far. Until now.  All of my associates now (minus a couple) are lazy. They do below the bare minimum. Rewards penetration is at an all time low, ESP is shitty, digital receipts suck, kiosk orders... basically nothing is good. These people can't even shoot a pull list or face the store correctly. It's sad.  So how do you motivate people who just don't care? I mean 39% rewards pen.? That is literally not giving a shit.   I don't like to be mean, it's never been my strong suit. I just feel like people should do their jobs without having to be babysat, but I guess that's too much to ask. And I'm in this awkward position as a new assistant manager where everything falls on me, but I have no power. I can't say "you sold one plan this month, you can't face, and you have a 44% rewards pen.? You suck, you're fired".   Tl;Dr My people suck, how do I get them to not suck?   I average around 15K a day. My record is 30K, when I worked 8am until 9:30pm or something with no breaks and no lunch.   Clearly I work too hard for no reason.    I think the easiest way to do it is to just search the name of the chair or the SKU in the search box in the HUB.    Make a sweater out of them and mail it to the home office.    "The paper is $7.79, but you get a rebate for $4.00 that you can mail in or do online. Doing it online is super easy, takes about a minute, and they mail you a check!"  I say this probably 20 times a week, every week. Every once in a while I'll get the grumpy old man that's like "I don't have time for that bullshit" but I'll say "if you can't figure it out, sir, come in and I'll do it for you." And I have before, it takes like 30 seconds if you know what you're doing.   God, I had a customer yesterday, she bought the last Toshiba Satellite we had (the one that's like, $279 or something after the rebate and coupon). Then she sent her husband and her kids in with kiosk orders. And the coupon.  All in all it was like, 5. And I had no cause to deny it because they were all different customers. My associate asked "are these for family members or...?" and they were just like "oh... yeah... family..." Bitches.   Luckily my store didn't get any that actually went through. I looked at all the surrounding stores, though. The closest one, 15 orders for the same lady. Then the one the next city over, 15 orders for the SAME lady from the other store. THEN the next city over after THAT, ANOTHER 15 orders for the same lady.  And they were all canceled. Like, how long did she spend doing that? Probably hours. Lunatic.    I don't take breaks or lunches, but it's a choice. I never deny any of the associates breaks and always cover when needed whether it's cashiering or copy center.  Your MODs need to get their shit together. Sometimes I see covering a break as a waste of time but I still do it. Demand your breaks, just say "I'm going, figure it out" and I guarantee they'll just deal. If not, go to HR.   Just wondering if employees can use this and actually get 25% back. I made a fairly big purchase earlier and used it, and it would be pretty awesome to get a little more than $75 in rewards.   26. Retail manager. No, but it pays the bills, keeps me on my feet, and I don't hate it.  I got my BA in social work, couldn't find a job that paid more than $11 an hour. And I don't want to work with old people, drug addicts, kids, or basically anyone with problems so I don't know why I majored in social work. I think I was just looking for something to major in and I never realized it wasn't what I wanted to do until I graduated.  I don't know what I want to do with my life, honestly.   2001 was a simpler time. Looking back it was pretty stupid, but in 2001 I think we were all like the kid in the movie; "WOAH SMASHMOUTH?!"   The Butterfly Effect. Trainspotting. American Psycho.  	13
 It isn't all that forced when a) we don't know if they will be "cover ups" per say, b) that maybe he just didn't know all that time, and c) you can't really know until there's more development. I don't see this as hard a twist as any others. And again, I would like to vehemently point out that Bobby will not change whatsoever as a character if he's gay. He will merely be hitting on men rather than women. And it still isn't that big of a retcon than many of the others seen through history.   Hey. Welcome to Tulsa. Where are you coming from?    When the Maximoff twins were retconned to be (and not be) Magneto's children, nobody said anything. Recently, when it's been retconned that they were NOT mutants, people said a few things but shrugged it off as pleasing the MCU. But the moment someone turns gay, it's "[contradicting] half a century of characterization."  I get that his change is merely pleasing the masses of gay readers. HOWEVER, it isn't a huge leap. Yes, Bobby has always been a bit of a ladies' man, but gay men are huge flirts typically and women LOVE gay men usually. And sexuality shouldn't matter. So why does it matter if he's suddenly gay? He'll just hit on men with his suave attitude instead of women. He'll still be Iceman.    There's also this thing that you may not be aware of: plenty of gay men have/had girlfriends and wives for decades before finally realizing they were gay. If they had a telepath around to reveal their sexuality, then maybe it wouldn't have taken them so long to figure it out. Sadly, that's what happens in a heteronormative society: you question your feelings you have for the same sex.  I get why some people would be upset about changing a specific character like Bobby from straight to gay because I've known him as a bit of a ladies' man. However, there are PLENTY of women attracted to gay men and gay men are HUGE flirts typically. So it isn't a huge stretch of the imagination.  This isn't ice cream flavor changes. This is a writer changing something within the continuity of a particular character for the sake of times a'changing. BUT this isn't the first time this has happened to a character. Characters have died off only to come back to life, characters have turned into completely different people due to someone possessing them/amnesia/rebirth or whatever contrivance they decide to use to say they're different, they've had ENTIRE lifetimes completely retconned. Yet, the moment a character goes from straight to gay, it's like people get completely pissed.   It makes a person wonder why the hostility.    I don't see this as clumsy. Is it a bit careless? Sure. But it's just a character realizing something about himself.   No, I'm saying that you're upset because things are changing about a character after his many years in comics. Expecting the character to stay the same is just ignorant.   But couldn't that be said for ANY retcon? I get where you're coming from, but it's like you're deeply upset something changed about a character over time! Like that never happened before.   I've been in bed all morning. It felt glorious. Then my dog wanted some food.    No big. There's always other days. Like today. If it weren't raining. Lol    I would've said "there's always tomorrow" but then this fucking thunderstorm happened.    Currently? None since it's Saturday. But I did wake up at 7am. So I'm pretty tired.    Enjoy your beer, man!  Edit: sorry! Got you mixed up with another poster. It was a long day yesterday.    Sweet. How's the mall area?    Our tv is so old. Haha  I live off 21st and Garnett. We just moved to this place. It isn't bad. What about yourself.    Just ordered pizza. Chilling with a roommate. We unfortunately don't have cable/satellite/Netflix on our tv. So we're sitting in our living room in awkward silence.   	15
 holy shit thats satisfying   He reminds me of Robin Williams... now i'm sad :(   Question of questions, would you rather fight ten Peter Dinklage sized horses, or one horse sized Peter Dinklage?   When he said "i really want to go home" and the way he talked to the guy, he sounds so scared. So glad nothing went wrong.    I have so much respect for the doorman, he acted perfectly.    Holy shit i was shaking when they showed it, this is crazy. Guy thinks he's james bond or something. Amazing that the NOS immediately broadcasts the video. Thanks for uploading!    Please don't give us Dutchies an excuse to mention that match against Spain, dear god that was a crazy night 3, nice goal though, haven't seen it done in FIFA yet. :D    Aah i know this zoo, its in Rotterdam. The glasses say "Bokito kijker" (Bokito Watcher). Bokito is the name of a gorilla that escaped back in 2007 i guess. Some lady visited the zoo almost 4 times a week and thought that she bonded with the gorilla. But what she didn't know was that she was making eye contact and seeking for attention, which the gorilla sees as agressive behaviour.   When Bokito escaped he went straight for the lady, dragged her through the zoo and bit her hundreds of times.   In this video you can see the lady interact with Bokito and some images of the escape (mind you, its all in Dutch).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RICvxpWSrAw     RIGHT, it really has that Interstallar look and feel for a big part of the trailer.    I would drink a beer with this guy. He seems fun.    You can't even see the damn planet with your own eyes if you don't know where to look. At least i can't. And we managed to get pictures from a goddamn robot we send there. Crazy stuff.    Was just about to say the same, i'm literally just looking at pictures of sand and rock, but just thinking about how amazing it is that we can see pictures like that... blows my mind!   Reddit at its finest... English is nog my first language...   well maybe its just the way you play? For some reason i play way better with Ozil CAM then Di Maria CAM, Di Maria is obviously the better player...   I'm more jealous of this squad then all the " look at my TOTY " posts... Looks so fun to play.    If i was playing fifa 14... yeah   Holy shit, that is a sick squad...    I personally hated Falcao, i'm playing Costa Sturridge which is an amazing combination!!   This year they raise money for woman who are victims of sexual assault in warzones. They've already raised over a million euro's in the first day!  	19
 Do you have your own baseball card? If so, do they pay you for that?      Climb the potato chip rock (Mt. Woodson), which I did this summer before I left :)   boom, headshot!

Thank you sir.   I am the biggest Giants fan :) GOT HEEM!   Yes it is   This was painted with acrylics, original was with oils   Only at comic-con, love it   This is the original painting by Leonid Afremov entitled 'Romantical Love'  http://www.internetphotos.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/romantical-love-painting-photo.jpg      I was trying to avoid a possible hadouken      I was at Comic-con at the panel this summer. Is it true what they say about the ticks in the area when filming on location?   I later googled Delorean boat and came across this:  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/361244777/delorean-hovercraft  It's the first and only Delorean hovercraft I've ever seen (or at least just the frame) and it just so happens to be in my neighborhood!

                                                                   Columbus residents are fortunate to have curbside recycling -- but how well are we doing it? I thought I was being good by saving even scraps of clean cardboard and paper, washing out food containers before putting them in the bin, etc. But then I saw that a friend is saving every plastic bag (although I don't know where she plans to take it), and now I wonder. Do you   -- empty and wash jars at the back of the refrigerator with contents that have turned into slimy science experiments? -- tear apart pizza boxes to save the clean cardboard?   -- refuse styrofoam takeout containers?   -- use only cloth kitchen towels, rather than paper?    Bonus question: Do you urge your friends and relatives to work harder at recycling?  And of course: Why or why not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I've worked the polls in Ohio for several years, but Columbus has turned decisively blue, and local Dems are more active by the day. So by waiting too long -- a few hours! -- to respond to the BOE's call for workers, I lost out on getting one of the slots reserved for Dem poll workers.  May other pollworkers here also find themselves facing such an embarrassment of riches!                                                                                 At 4 AM, driving on Sawmill was dicey at best, with visibility of less than 20 feet. Route 161, with no street lights and few residential or commercial light sources, was frankly terrifying. It looked like east Tennessee out there.  If there's a [dead skunk in the middle of the road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu5hzc2Mei4) just west of Linworth, I'm afraid that's my fault.

 Few honestly better drive after a beers I.   A biology teacher asked a question about genetics. As worded, it should've been interpreted as a problem in conditional probability, even though that is not what the teacher meant. Everyone but me answered the question as intended, while I answered the question as worded. Yet even after bringing up that I answered correctly given the wording of the problem, I was still marked wrong.  To this day I have plotted to ensure that the sex ratio of this teacher's F1 generation is less than expectation.   Oh no we're the last two humans on reddit! We need to repopulate; please insert genitals into auxiliary port.   Drive while smoking sugar free smegma.   Reddit. It's reddit all the way down. 24/7/365.   Still probably not much, except along the trench itself. The oceans are already connected below S. America.   5m^2 is just big enough to own God in Michelangelo's Creation of Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.   "Therefore I am."   You'd think rich people would jump on the opportunity to fund to longevity research, but I guess many of them end up falling for pseudoscience quackery more easily (e.g. Jobs).   Yes, but we favor the simpler model, which does not assume a giant eyeball. The burden of proof is to prove it exists, not disprove that it does not.   Leap years!    but could be scattered throughout the depths  Isn't that exactly what we believe?   Other languages still have punctuation. Also, it's a only post, 8 hour old account, so I don't think it's obvious.   If we follow the scientific method, we would look at this hypothesized model, and look at what predictions does this model make about what we should see in the real world. One such prediction would be aboue the parallax of stars, since they would all be on the same spherical surface. Stars near each other would, by parallax, be similar distances from the Earth. We know this is not the case, from countless astronomical measurements. There's no spherical surface that can be interpolated through the distances to stars or galaxies we measure based on parallax (and other methods).   Uh, except that the "thrifty gene hypothesis" has been criticized and simply does not have much support in the literature, and your second paragraph sounds overly adaptationist without supporting evidence (which I think is still a big problem with evolutionary psychology as a discipline). And, it's not a "caveman" adaptation: we know hunter-gatherers were/are less prone to famine than agriculturalists, which is contrary to your explanation. Moreover, I don't buy your explanation because it lacks a conceptual link between the proximal causes (physiological, neurological, hormonal) and the ultimate (evolutionary) causes of exercise fatigue. Lastly, it does not explain why endorphins are released during exercise at all--if your explanation was correct, then there would be selective forces against endorphin release during exercise. Edit: Also, I bet other mammals if not other vertebrates also experience both muscle fatigue and endorphin high, which is a real nail in your explanation's coffin, since these physiological responses must have predated modern humans by a long long time. It's also contrary to the high prevalence of play in many mammal species, which is an energetically expensive activity.  I'll offer an alternative hypothesis, based on WebMD. I think it's at least as plausible as your explanation, if not more so, though I'm not aware of the literature: http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression  During prolonged aerobic exercise, your body may not get as much oxygen as it needs, and will supply some of your energetic needs through anaerobic respiration. This creates lactic acid, which causes fatigue and pain in your muscles, allowing you to consciously register that your body is reaching a point where it's not getting its oxygen needs. At the same time, exercise also releases endorphins (and other hormones), which act as both a painkiller and sedative to allow you to persist if you need to continue a flight-or-fight response. Once you stop exercising, your body removes lactic acid quickly but the endorphins persist for longer, leaving you with a post-exercise high. There's nothing adaptive about muscle fatigue (contrary to your thrifty-genotype explanation), it's instead a negative consequence (an evolutionary trade-off) of adapting to being able to switch to anaerobic lactic acid metabolism when your body requires extra energy; I'm not aware of the physiological pathways from exercise to endorphin release, but it is possible that endorphin release during exercise is adaptive as a painkiller Edit: Also, a reward for play. People who exercise regularly train both body and mind to adapt in favor of increasing O2 capacity, reducing lactic acid production, and mentally craving the endorphin high while also mentally resisting the feeling of pain; basically, acclimation and phenotypic plasticity.  tl;dr: The lie is not the fatigue. Your muscles truly are being taxed (which is simply a consequence of the limits of aerobic respiration). The lie is the painkilling and sedative effects of endorphin release allowing you to push your muscles past their limits so that you can consciously resist the truth of muscle fatigue (which is healthy given modern nutrition, but would not be if you were not replenishing your nutrient stores).   Chaos theory.   Still, I wonder how much it's returned on that extra investment due to increased tourism.   Monument Valley. MC Escher in game form. Beautifully constructed.   I love it when baby's are violent.   Life is Strange. It's like an indie scifi movie as a game, where the choices you make affect the story.   So they were like Butterfrees.   Not really. Populations don't grow exponentially. Fertility rates decline with development in countries which have historically already gone through their demographic transition--the phase of exponential growth is transient. Most of the developed world are already below replacement rate fertility. The growth rate of the world population is decelerating, driven primarily by the development potential in Africa, and somewhat in Asia. Most Western countries would not be growing in population if it weren't for high immigration rates from the global south. Countries like Italy and Japan, with low immigration rates, and very low fertility levels, are already suffering from the effects of population decline and aging. The most likely scenario is that the world population will plateau at around 10-15 billion and start declining--by the time we have any large scale colonization project (which may still be centuries from now), I doubt the Earth's population will be over 8 billion. Whether that happens within this century or the next largely depends on when the demographic transition happens in Africa in the near future (particularly, w.r.t women's education and reproductive rights).   Krieger?   Off-worlders will ultimately provide the vast majority of their own population through reproduction. With close to 8 billion people to sustain, and the easiest resources for research on Earth, most of the highly-skilled jobs will still be on Earth.

But it would be interesting to hear your perspective (well, more interesting for the OP).   Dude, I'm just trying to bitch about this subreddit. Stop ruining it for me!    Is it usual for undergrad researchers to stick with a lab until the end of their undergrad career, or do they usually jump around?  Some undergrads stick with a lab. Other undergrads have worked with multiple labs. The important thing is that they devoted quality time to each research experience. (I know people who do something like, spend a summer/semseter/year in one lab, decided they liked research but wanted to try something new, and switched to a different lab for significant amount of time). It's fine to switch labs to try new experiences, that's normal. But realize that there's a significant investment in an undergrad researcher when they join a lab, it's expensive to train an undergrad, so do take that seriously.  Don't join multiple labs concurrently. I've never heard of anyone doing that.   ...It does say something that "clickbait" on this subreddit is what we assume to be negative stories. Maybe we should get off.   What does the fox say? is about so much more than just foxes.   Great. My computer is now covered in liquids.   Right, because the US population is a well-mixed population with no spatial heterogeneity. /s   Yeah fuck infants who consensually contrast diseases they can't get protection for! They deserve it and so do their parents. /s    Measles has a very low mortality rate and there have been fewer then like 20 deaths in the past 10 years  Do you even know what a *rate* is?    I'm open to being wrong about this, but you'll have to offer a counter-narrative that fits the data if you want to change my view. As far as I can tell A) Clinton has diminished support from minorities, especially minority males, relative to Obama and Kerry and B) there are no meaningful differences between these candidates apart from race and gender.  The biggest difference is year in which the polls were conducted.   Ah, 'dat 101th authorship on a paper.   Sexy stuffs.   War. We haven't won one in a very long time.   I hope he doesn't drive like that.    Complexifying? Not necessarily. If it is better to reduce the features to be more successful reproductively, then natural selection may well favor it. Hypothetical example: Birds with many bright feathers of many kinds of colors find themselves the victim of prey more often due to being more easily spotted. Over time, a duller more monochrome feather scheme is selected for.  We're not talking about specific lineages. There are theoretical reasons why we would expect both maximum complexity and mean complexity of the biosphere as a whole to increase over time in the null expectation. https://github.com/caseywdunn/random_walk/blob/master/randomwalk.md  Said a different way, young biospheres are not likely to have intelligent civilizations. As biospheres grow older, the probability of them ever harboring at least one intelligent civilization should increase. If intelligent civilizations tend to persist, then we also have the probability of there currently being an intelligent civilization increases over time. If a biosphere is too young, there's an upper bound on how complex organisms can be.   It's not about them, it's about you. Focus on what you've accomplished in the last two years, and where you personally are going. You do you at your own pace.   You are the anti-Jenny. Bravo.   I would say that mathematics itself is natural. Concepts such as integers, pi, the equality relation, different base representations, circles, radii, are natural, and aliens could make sense of it. So an alien who sees mathematical *representation* can have a good idea of what mathematical symbols *might* represent. A circle with a radii that is labeled by r is probably enough for an alien to understand that r represents the length of the radius. So if they saw next to it symbols like  2*pi*r=C  they could probably guess that this represents the relationship between the length of the radius and the circumference. But they could potentially think that   2 is circumference, pi is equality r is (correctly) the length of the radius = is 2 (which would make a lot of sense, it has two lines) and C is the ratio pi  assuming they didn't think anything of the spacing around the "=" if it exists as having some kind of most parsimonious interpretation as being a relation instead of a quantity. If you include something like 3.1415926, the might be able to figure out that 2 is actually an integer, in a base representation, and figure out the correct interpretation of 2*pi*r=C.  So I think it's somewhere in the middle. They wouldn't automatically recognize the markings, but there are only so many ways of representing mathematics, that for something as simple as 2*pi*r=C, they could potentially understand it. It's more like, even if aliens had a completely different theory of mind from humans, mathematics is natural that they would understand that there is a shared underlying meaning to these symbols (even if they had no concept of human love, friendship, sky, and we no concept of @^ *@$^). They just need enough examples to crack the cipher. We're basically sending aliens a coded message in a universal (unwritten) language that is mathematics, expecting them to be able to crack the code.   This is a wrong interpretation. Since organisms can have multiple ancestors, it can be the case that there are contemporaneous individuals with the LUA who is a common ancestor of some but not all present day organisms.   It's the most recent single individual that ever lived that is an ancestor of every organism living in the present. That is, it is the Last, Universal, Common Ancestor.  There's a potential misunderstanding of what that means. For example, you and your cousin share a last common ancestor (actually, two). Your two last common ancestors are your shared grandparents. Note that each of you also have other grandparents not in common. These other grandparents clearly contributed genetic material to you or your cousin, but not both. The LUCA is the shared great great ... great grandparent of all living organisms today, even though every living organism today has many many great great ... great grandparents that are not universally shared. This also means that the LUCA can change over time. If tomorrow every organism other than homo sapiens went extinct, the new LUCA would be that of only the organisms that remain, that is, the most recent common ancestor among homo sapiens.   This is a question of what defines a species. Under the biological species concept, all three groups represent a single species, because they are not reproductively isolated from each other.   Me too! That was middle school for me.   Sorry, first google survey I've ever made, it didn't seem like an option as far as I know. None of the questions are required to be answered.   "Matter and energy had ended and with it, space and time. Even IBM's Watson existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to IBM's Watson far less than was a man to Man.  All other questions had been answered, and until this last question was answered also, IBM's Watson might not release his consciousness.  All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.  But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.  A timeless interval was spent in doing that.  And it came to pass that IBM's Watson learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.  But there was now no man to whom IBM's Watson might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer -- by demonstration -- would take care of that, too.  For another timeless interval, IBM's Watson thought how best to do this. Carefully, IBM's Watson organized the program.  The consciousness of IBM's Watson encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step, it must be done.  And IBM's Watson said, "LET THERE BE JENNY!"  And there was jenny----"   I'm vaguely aware that it exists though I don't understand it. It doesn't seem to me to be a very biologically insightful line of research, and is even more out of place today than before the molecular revolution when we've now moved beyond simple genetic models and are thinking about computer simulations, statistical inference, and big-data genomics.   Thanks for the input!   Frozen.   It's whale meat. Has to be.  Think about it.   Weak, was expecting fire and brimstone and dragons breathing hell fire on your research notes. I give you an incomplete.   35 responses so far in 3 hours! I'll make a summary post when response rate plateaus. Thanks everyone who's responded so far!      An arm, a leg, and a ear. You're good to go!   I wonder if he gives private medical classes.   I appreciate your responses.    It seems like you haven't taken any sysadmin courses, and it shows in your ignorance.  No need to be rude. I haven't, so yes I would be ignorant of the subject which is not my area of expertise.Though I didn't claim any such knowledge, was just expressing my opinion. Thank you for your sharing your expertise, truly (not being sarcastic, have to say that in case people here are *that* cynical).   No no no, Bruno is about this gay and european fashion guy who goes around interviewing all these people. Borat is about some other guy, not related.   Life long PC user, started using Mac for work. I can see the advantages. From a institution/company standpoint, it's efficient to have a standard laptop model out of the box with readily available support. Also, some of the software is genuinely good, depending on what you do. Compared to a a employee's salary, a few hundred dollars is trivial, and more than made up for by hours saved not supporting multiple laptop models, or switching PC companies every few years. Sticking with Macs makes things simple, which saves money overall. I enjoy using it. I agree I would not have bought one for my personal use. The phone I agree on. At the end of the day, all smart phones do the same basic functions using the same set of apps.   Bruno was pretty biased in its editing I thought.   Eat.   Falling. I have no problems with planes, or skyscrapers, or any kind of "safe" heights. But get me the fuck away from that balcony. Particularly ones in malls.   Humans.   Nicholas Cage.   The only thing good about the movie is the score. And that it eventually led to Seychelle Gabrielle voicing Asami.

Sewing. Holes in jeans crotch? Nothing else to wear? Welp, not like anyone's gonna see right?   Creeper!   Just imagine if all 50 of these framed... artworks... had holes in them. With the fronds of paper pointing both inwards and outwards on different pieces.   I wasn't implying anything. I was stating a fact about the content of a tv-show, and pointing out the irony in relation to the content on the same tv-show years later.   I would say the two terms are more or less synonymous. The main difference is that "microevolutionary theory" is almost never used (as a Google Scholar search would attest), while "population genetics" and "microevolution" are widely used (in the sense that population genetics is the study of microevolution). I use the "more or less" qualifier because population genetics does extend in to other fields such as macroevolutionary theory, evolutionary genetics, and phylogenetics. But its historical roots and theoretical core a focus on the four fundamental processes of mutation, selection, gene flow, and genetic drift which are most apparent at the microevolutionary levels.  I used Templeton's text to learn population genetics. I think it's a great textbook to learn population genetics. It's solid on concepts, does a good job on theory, and is packed with examples from the literature. It covers all the major topics of classical population genetics. It goes to great lengths to clarify common misconceptions such as different meanings of "effective population size" and "inbreeding coefficients", which even biologists sometimes confuse in the literature, or that "linkage disequilibrium" does not always have to do with genetic linkage. I think it's content is clearer and deeper than most peer intro classical pop gen texts.  That said, there are some short-comings. 1) Take Templeton's section on Nested Clade Phylogeographic Analysis with a grain of salt. Templeton championed the approach, but many have criticized it. (But this is a minor concern). 2) Like pretty much every introductory pop gen text, it doesn't cover more recent developments in coalescent theory (outside of the basics), statistical/bayesian genetic inference, and genomics. It's strictly a classical pop gen text, which isn't a bad thing, but may or may not be useful for you to know. 3) I wouldn't consider it a mathematical population genetics textbook.  Some mathematical alternatives that I know of but have not looked at myself are Crow and Kimura's "An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory", and Ewens' "Mathematical Population Genetics". There's also Felsenstein's "Theoretical Evolutionary Genetics" which I think is poor on concepts and examples, Hartl and Clark is more modern and popular but also more introductory than the other offerings, Gillespie's "Population Genetics: A Concise Guide" which I have no comment on other than "concise" might not be the best intro text, and Charlesworth and Charlesworth's "Elements of Evolutionary Genetics", which is not really a pop gen text, and is more of a reference than a introductory text.   Trying too hard bub. Like OP in the presence of all this framed glory.   "Will you be paying in cash or credit?"   Maybe the guys is really into frames and needed something to put in them.   Which is funny since they had shown Muhammed in full in a previous pre 9/11 season.   Hiyao Miyazaki.   Used a dead dried up kitty as a hall pass. Edit: I should probably add that this was a biology teacher.   Which is what exactly? It's like you're saying industrialized agricultural practices haven't been constantly evolving since the 1800s. What decade counts as "good ol fashion" agriculture?    Evidence of the difficulty of Eukaryotic evolution is circumstantially supportive of creation.  No it's not. It's a false dichotomy and the principle of excluded middle does not apply here. Do you even science?   Drugs are a hell of a drug.   It's hard to sequence that first genome, subsequent genetic info is much easier to obtain once you have a reference genome to guide you. You can do stuff like target a particular gene or other region for resequencing to get population genetic data (allele frequencies over many individuals). The reference genome doesn't necessarily have to be all from the same individual, it may be over a small set of individuals.   Nurses, doctors. We trust their lives to them, and they have literally hundreds of ways to kill us if they wanted to, and the most knowledge about how to get away with it.   Love.   Steve Buscemi.   "Kill me, I'm sane."   See this is why the FDA and USDA are bad ideas.   "Please tell the driver you're going to X."   Don't worry, most PhD graduates these days don't end up as PI's when that *is* their goal anyways. I'm only half joking. I don't think it's viable to go into a PhD thinking there's a high chance of an academic job waiting on the other side. There are just too many PhD position to tenure track positions. I think it's perfectly fine to go into a PhD with the idea of wanting to pursue non-academic opportunities afterwards. It's actually something I asked at every interview weekend I went to, how is the support for graduate students pursuing non-academic post-grad careers. Society benefits from having PhD's in many different roles. That said, make sure you know what you're getting into, only go if it's a good environment in terms of lab, department, and institution, and that the value of the PhD to you personally is higher than the high opportunity costs of doing a PhD (forgone salary and career advancement in other fields) and emotional and physical costs (stress, significant others).  	109

 Note pad.  Write down every step to everything you have to make.  Ingredients and method.  It will show attention to detail and remind you that you know fuck all when it comes to how it gets done there.  If questioned on why or told to not waste the time, just make sure that you prioritize the info you write down and reply with "I only want to make sure I do it your way the first time when I have to do it on my own Chef."  If he doesn't say thank you to that, fuck that guy.  Hydration and keep your blood sugar up.  This is even more important cause you're going to be nervous and stressed as hell.  It is something that people should just understand in life, but even more so going into a new environment.  A Cliff bar or WTF ever is your personal choice should live in your knife roll.  Check the sidebar and dig in the sub.   Wait a minute...?  You mean to tell me that your boss convinced you to go online and help him try to develop a job fair under the guise of helping others in the industry?  Something sounds a little bit not 100% above ground in your situation...    Lots of friends?  That is crazy talk.  If you have lots of friends who have Celiacs, prepare to have a lot less friends when you discover they have been lying to you.  Unless you like to hang around lying and manipulative people...  I'm sorry.  But the scientific statistical knowledge says that if you have a lot of friends who claim this, you have a lot of friends who are full of shit.   Yeah, not so much.  Taking into consideration the view of the majority of the world is enlightenment.  I mean, we can talk about the extreme amounts of ignorance, hate, violence, medical problems, mental issues, disparity, and overall abuse that is exemplified by the players and the NFL.  Or even the kid who just committed suicide in a dumpster, which he accredited to the vast amounts of injuries he sustained playing football.  However, I don't think that is something I'd care to get into with the internet police.  Nor do I believe that the presentation of scientific facts would be taken into account.  The view of the enlightened folks of the world today is that football, *in it's current form,* is an atrocity to our society.  Oh yeah.  And fuck the Cowboys.   World travel would enlighten one to not be impressed or even care about football.  However, I would say that a SE NM town would impress Texan ideals on one...   Well hell, I am now!  Welcome to the club!  There is now officially at least 2 of us fuckers here.  Lots more if you just want to generally include our elected officials...   There are assholes all over the world.  I'm in Santa Fe and so I will acknowledge that there is at least one here.  Where you are talking about is quite beautiful.  Many people flock there.  And it is in the middle of nowhere.  Shit is expensive in that area, even for locals.    With that said, there is a bitter hatred among the locals here (I'd even say the state of NM) for people from TX.  For many reasons.  Some logical and sound.  Others stupid and petty.  However, it rarely gets shown towards those obviously Texan.  That is stupid and it costs people here money and they know that.  In all honesty, head up to Wolf Creek.  Or up to CO if you're planning a week.  That is just an IMO, but I feel there are better amenities around in those places.  Plus legal pot!   "People here love the Cowboys."  *That is funny.*   Unless you're from TX, people herw typically hate the Cowboys less than the Patriots.  Is that what you mean by loving them?   I think I got enough for one more.  Then it's onto the soup!      Holy hell man, that is a *serious* offer right there.  I'd consider moving back to the PDX area to get in on that action.  And thanks for the note about the laws changing.  Not being up in the area, it's hard to stay on top of things for the couple of weekend hunt trips every year.  So all the Weyerhaeuser/GP/ETC land that we grew up tromping is now off limits in OR?  Did that change happen in WA too?   Unless you get it in writing, never trust any agreement an employer offers you.  No matter how nice or sincere they seem about it.    Guy changed his mind after he agreed to something?  Fuck it, get out.  There are plenty of backsliders out there whom you can work for.   well of course!   Just make sure you triple cook those chips!      Check out Banh Mi Coda on Louisiana.  It's in your hood, cheap as hell, and one of the better sandwiches you can find in ABQ.    If your structure is correct, it shouldn't squish out.  My issue with the cutlets instead of bread is getting greasy hands.   Call it whatever you like.

I think more people should smoke more pot.  But for some reason, it's supposed to be common place and accepted for people to get loaded on the job in a kitchen?  Don't people realize that they work with vats of hot liquids/fats, sharp ass knives, screaming red steel, and 1000 RPM razor blades?  They are a liability to you and your establishment.  If your management can't see that or address it, get out.  The longer you work there, the longer you risk some tard sending you to the hospital for not saying behind.  Or "forgetting" to mop up the grease they spilled.   I'll test!  I'll even SEND YOU some that I've been making.  Do you need another on your list?  If so, lemme know and I'll PM you my address.  And honestly, this is fairly funny to me.  I just shipped out a few boxes of various smoked salts to a bunch of my friends across the country.  Several chile varietals and the super secret french fry salt shaker mix.   Gelling and emulsifying have been around for how long now?  Do you know what aspic is?  How to make panna cotta?  Or a simple mayonnaise?  Maybe you've heard of these things, cause some peasants have been making these items for a couple hundred years now.  It wasn't some genius in the last 20 years that figured out how and why air/gas works with certain compounds.  It was just publicized.   We can talk about what kind of ovens and stove tops we all use, if you like.  You obviously didn't grasp the point that I was making when I said he cooks with fire.  It means basic.  There is nothing wrong with modern technique.  In the right places and in the right hands.  Proper technique that yields the results which Keller wants isn't invention.  But adaption.  That is what SV cooking is, FYI.  An adaption of boiling.  If you want to get down to it, a great example of crude/basic technology doing the same thing is a traditional preparation of Haggis.  If you're going to be given the distinction of in the top ten restaurants of the world, it *SHOULD* be stressful.  Hell, it was stressful to eat there.  And that was before the place got popular.    But there is a big difference between Keller and most of the people mentioned in that article.  He cooks for others.  Most that strive to be in the same caliber, cook for themselves.  Now son, if you would like to continue this lesson in food history or are interested in furthering your own gastronomical knowledge, feel free to go get your shine box.   Yep.  That's my issue.  He started off the article like he wanted to have a conversation about food.  And then it moved to sound like he had a personal vendetta towards a couple of specific shops.  Critiques and discussions are two entirely different topic.  So are personal tastes.  Which is why I *TRY* to remove my personal tastes about things and look at places subjectively, but it is hard.  I would surmise that the author has similar issues with removing himself from his writing.  Which leads to me looking at what was written as partial "shock topic" journalism/media BS, just to get more attention.  The "Oh look!  This guy is talking shit about Frank over there!  Obviously what he has to say is important!" syndrome.  While he might have something good to say, he doesn't need to be such a dick.  Then again though, in my case, that makes me a charred up kettle...   This is probably one of the best articles on food I've read all year.  I know many of ya'll will disagree with me, but this is pretty much spot.  I think it is wonderful that other people are much more elegant and well spoken in telling the hispters to fuck off.  You make snacks for fucks sake.  A necessity for all.  Your job should not be some privilege you give specific people you like so they can jack off your ego.  One thing I would like to point out in all of this is what is lacking.  Which I think many might not notice.  It is hard to have a serious conversation about food, especially in the US, without mentioning Keller.  I hope ya'll note that and understand why.  Partly because he doesn't do a lot of that BS.  He cooks with fire.  Mainly though, the relevancy is simple food, cooked well.  With proper method and technique.  Trends and fads come and go.  I'm not saying you can't do it your way.  I just think it is silly to try and fix what ain't broke.    Ouch.  It's to bad that he had to list names.  That was the first thing I thought when I read "one was the best of the year, one was the worst..."  The problem with not naming names though is not giving the concrete examples of what he is talking about.   Do you have a microwave and plastic wrap?  If so, boil water in the microwave.  In a bowl, toss the meat with a little water to loosen the fat some.  Make an airtight seal with the warp.  Nuke it for a minute.  Take out and place in a different, covered container.  Repeat.   This place is fine to live in if you have money.  But if you don't, you feel and realize it.  Also, this place is great to live in if you are an entitled rich old white person.  I would love to know what it is that the locals do around here.  I consider myself one now (been here 6+ years and am tied deep with born and bred native New Mexicans and Santa Feans) and we don't do shit.  Mainly because there is nowhere worthwhile to do anything in town. There are a couple gems, I'm not saying it's totally barren.    However, to get into or go to those places, you have to deal with all the goddamn stupid fucking douchebags that are transitional here.  You know the type.  The self absorbed holier than thou yoga bitches that only shop at whole foods.  Or the asshole oblivious hipster body workers who think it's ok to talk and scream through an entire live acoustic set that people pay $25 to go see.  We actually do a lot among ourselves.  Us locals.  We create our own excitement.  We don't go out.  We don't go to shows.  We hardly go out to eat.  We don't shop at most of the locally owned shops.  And sadly, none of this has to do with money.  At least on the part of myself and my girl.  Maybe some among my friends, but not really.  They all have disposable income they would love to spend.  But here's the thing.  Santa Fe IS NOT friendly to those that live here,  unless you are an entitled old rich white person who makes art.  Or you are apart of the good ol' boy network.  We (the locals) try and change that and contribute into the community which would help foster growth in the other direction.  However, the people that run this town don't seem to have any interest in helping anyone other than tourists and Cousin Jose.  So.  I would love to hear what you do in town or around in the area.  Cause in all honesty, the girl and I are sick of leaving town every other weekend simply for something to do.   Ummmmmm.....  That's what she said?   and some slices...  http://i.imgur.com/aVQpiXY.jpg      What part of butt fuck egypt OR?  I grew up outside PDX and spent a lot of time all over the NW and OR in particular.  I still know a bunch of people out that way.  Specifically Eastern OR.  Farmers, craftsmen, people with pigs to butcher, vintners, hunters, etc  :)    Right right.  Actually reading a few comments now, I just skimmed it before and didn't even watch the video.  Skipped every 30 seconds and checked the still.  The gem though is pretty spot on.  People will go for all kinds of BS.  But fuck that guy for the most part.  I've learned to ignore the cooking and food subs.  And food porn for that matter.  All of the other food related subs I think contain much more, I hate to say enlightened people, but less fucktards than the others.  This sub though, is ONLY full of fucktards.     I'm torn to agree with you.  But that pie looks like shit and most Suzi Q Homemakers can make a better looking pie than that.  I'm not talking about technique, quality, or anything like that.  The basic structure of that pizza is simply bad.  The video was excellent though.  If you're going to go to all that work, at least do it right.  It seems like the person making the pie actually does know what they are doing, so I just gotta ask, WTF man?  Why would you do that?   Thanks for the mention of the MADfeed.com site.  I remember hearing about it months ago but never checked it out.  And after looking at it for 5 minutes, it's bookmarked and when I can sit down later, that site needs a serious combing through.   I watched this again earlier when I saw it posted too.  Lollers.  Now.  I think this guy is pretty awesome.  If he can take this crap and turn it into a plate that people will pay serious money for, I mean, kudos.  That is my job as a Garde Manger, to take trash and scrap and turn it into something edible.  But for fucks sake, this is some serious bullshit.  We can get into the whole discussion of food supply, waste, and all that stuff.  But here's the thing that I love about this kind of crap - other people think they can do it and they can't.  But they try.  And it's fucking funny when these hipster douchebags that can't cook do this shit and then close their doors :)   Right on right on.  I totally get it.  I will go for the odds and ends too if I'm in a pinch at the store :)  But it sounds like you're already on top of the meaty deliciousness that is the pig.  Local butcher is good.  Is there an Asian specialty market in your hood?  That is usually a place to find decent cuts of belly.  Also,  if your friends with any restaurant folk, ask them if they could order you some.  Offer em 10-25% above their cost depending on their price and I don't think they would balk at it.  I'll order product for people all the time if they are willing to pay me to pull it off the back of the truck and hand it to them...   One of the key things about being a bartender is knowing how to identify problem situations and diffusing them.  Conflict resolution.  But able to be nice, professional, and straight about it.  Other than that, you've got to learn your drinks and know how to pull/pour beer.  I've hired/worked with many "bartenders" with years experience that would last one shift or 20 minutes of a trial simply because they can't pull beer.  You need a serving license.  Lastly, if you are wanting to break into the business, keep in mind that most people WILL NOT hire someone with little or no experience to train them behind the bar.  Unless you got a big ol pair of titties.  No offense women, it's just the business.  Find a job as a bar back and learn your shit.  Easiest place to jump into that would be a hotel.   I understand what you are saying and I know what the product is.  But don't agree.  This is what I make that winds up being cheaper and WAY better than any odds and ends pack you might find.  Now I understand that this is house made and you're hard pressed finding similar quality in the store, but you can find your own belly.

I'm down in NM now and I have a completely different problem in that it's basically impossible to sell wild foraged goods due to draconian ass backward laws.  Some restaurants will buy em (most wont) at the back door, but there is no market to take them too, nor a broker I'm aware of in NM.  I pulled about 300# of Porcini this season.  As well as about 150# of lobsters, 30 # of chanties, and another 100# of aspen bolete.  Nobody around here hunts, outside of a gallon container to take home.  There is no money in it, cause ya gotta drive to Denver.    So what do you do with hauls like that?  I've got almost almost three 5 gallon buckets filled with dried porcini.  I guess I'm eating risiotto all winter long and all of my friends are getting jars for xmas...  Ya got any of them delicious chickens dried up in storage that you'd want to trade?  We don't get those down here :(   Ya know what, $20 for a print that size of a good shot ain't bad.  Kudos man, the only cash I'm ever able to make off the shroomies are at the market.  If I can find a decent frame in town for that thing, I think I might just have to order one!   Garbage.  Last time I ordered a pizza from there, I asked for a pie to be delivered that was a total unique 3 or 4 topping order.  Dude showed up at my house, which is 10 min from their shop in 20 minutes.  The pizza he tried to give me, which I had to run outside and flag that fucker down about, had easily been sitting in their shop for a couple of hours and it was obvious that they picked toppings off and put new ones on. They didn't even bother to throw it back in the oven, took it straight from under the heat lamp.  The few times I've tried to eat there, it has been burnt with attitude and it tastes like cardboard.  I would much rather, and seriously, eat Dominoes over Upper Crust any day.  And that makes me sad :(  So fuck that place and the bullshit they try to serve the community.  And their sauce is a complete waste of tomatoes.   Choppers?  That's a new one to me.  I've not been out there since prolly 2007.  But up until then, it was at least 2 or 3 weekends a year, mainly during the summer for years.  And I have to admit, we used to be some of those quite pleasant people you mentioned doing awesome things in awesome mind sets.  Anymore, I hate it too.  My lord.  I'm an old man.  GET OFF MY LAWN!  The muscaria are everywhere, which is why I love them so much.  It is just that one spot out of all the places I've hunted that still stands in my mind to this day.  And it was never fail, always hundreds of em within yards of each other.  More impressive than the multiple hundred pound patches of yellow chanties I'd find in the Gifford...    A spore print is essentially "seed collecting."  It is a way to pick a mushroom and "transfer" the mycelium to a new host for it to grow.  The spores are what allow the mushroom to reproduce.   :)  No worries.  I'm from the Columbia valley basin and I miss my old friends.  And.  It is Saturday.  Which means that it is a good day to drive to the beach.  I don't know where you are at.  But if you are anywhere remotely close to Ft. Stevens and haven't been out there this fall, I would suggest you head out there.  On the Oregon side at the mouth of the Columbia river.  If you stand at the very tip and look east down the coast line, you will see a grove of trees about 100 yards from the mouth.  A good 40-50 yards south from the bank of the river.  In that stand of trees should be hundreds of Muscarias.  I mean, like 6"-15" cap large fucking beauties.  One of the most breathtaking stands of mushies I've ever found out there.  I'm not a photog, but it looks like you are...  Also.  All through the park you will find more of our Cyan friends.  But if you look along the banks of the Columbia around there, Seaside, and Astoria, you will find the Azure's as well :)   Well awesome, that's great to hear as I've always found Ta Lin to be lacking in those regards as well.  But the best/only real option in the area :(  So how does a civilian go about getting onto the base to do some shopping?   Advertising a restaurant usually costs you money in the long run.  The best thing that you can do is have a product which is unique to the area that has a preexisting demand.  On top of it, a better product than your competitors.  Notice, I didn't say cheaper.  I said better.    Also.  One of the biggest challenges of the restaurant industry is to get people to walk back in the door.  But that is usually where people stop trying - to get the customer to come in that has already been a patron.  The best advertisement is word of mouth.  I believe that it is my job as a cook to not only provide the kind of service/product that will drive people back in the door, but to do so with others in tow.  That is how you build business.  Coupons, TV, radio, and print are a waste of money in restaurant promotions.    I'm hard pressed finding decent pizza in Santa Fe and thick crust is almost non existent.  I usually hate saying it, cause it seems wrong.  But IMO Dions is the best pie you can purchase in SF :(   Care to mail out some spore prints?   Are you letting FOH touch your shit?  Isn't that the only explanation for something so shitty looking to be left in your kitchen?  I mean, you wouldn't keep paying a cook who did that, would you?   Really?  Better than Ta Lin?  I find that hard to believe, but it could be.  I've never been onto the base.  If you've never been to Ta Lin, I would highly suggest you check it out.   Ta Lin on Central is probably going to be your best bet.  Also, there are a couple of Middle Eastern stores in the area that carry a variety of product.  Shop on San Pedro is decent and Cafe Istanbul on Wyoming is pretty good too.  What kind of product are you looking for specifically?   Warm and safe in NM?  Lollers.  Go to CA or FL if you want warm.  If you want warm and safe, stay under the blankets...   I dunno.  All I do know is that one of my theater professors would mockingly say "Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd what are you saying?" to make sure that people knew they were not pronouncing and projecting words audibly.   Thank you for giving us an update on your personal status.   thanks!   Thanks.  You are 100% correct that I want to work with someone who knows photo and design stuff.  Layout.  All of that.  Because that person is not me.  I could struggle through, but know if I would do it all on my own it would like like it was done in MSWord by a 6th grader :)  I did some researching online, but was somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of info and what seemed like having to sift through a lot of internet BS.  I didn't find Lulu, I'll check it out.  Kindle Direct I had seen, but not delved into.  Could you recommend another site or two to look into.  And now that I'm thinking of this, I should have looked for a sticky....   Homemade my friend.   Made from scratch at my house.   And I didn't know we were dating?   Hatch.  Green.  Fucking.  Chile.  But no meat, just extra cheese and sauce.         The grilled pork is good, I love it.  And the baguette vs sub roll is always a debate of mine.  The (one) shop in New Mexico that I know about who does theirs from scratch all the way uses a long soft loaf.  Baguette shape, but not crusty at all, more like a sub.  Hence my idea.  But honestly, I'm at 7K plus in altitude.  I hate making bread here and baguettes are much harder than the soft rolls...   Yep.  But I don't like pate and the girl is a veggie, so I tend to steer clear...   Diakon, carrot, cuke, cilantro, 5 spice lemongrass mayo, and Chinese BBQ pork on a whole wheat roll.   Yep.  Somewhat ;)   Then check my other post about possibly writing a book!   Thank you for your service to the public.  Does the FCC have plans to bust up the monopolies that are currently in control of our communication infrastructure?  When it happened with Ma Bell years ago it was for a reason.  Now we seem to find ourselves in a much similar situation in our nation.  Is the current situation less of a monopoly than before?  Also.  Has there been any talk or interest in Washington about making a free, national high speed internet?  It would be in the nations best interest if we did.  Simply from an economic standpoint.  There is no reason that people should be paying $100 for internet...   I'm sorry I'm so lazy to copy and paste a reply to you  :)  Thanks. What I've been kicking around is 26 sandwiches and all of the components to make each one. Why 26? Well, that's a sandwich to make every other week for a year and some of the components take 7-10 days to make.  The formula I'm thinking is 5 recipes per sandwich, 130 in total. Meat, bread, sauce, salad/veg/cheese, and a side.     That would have to be a picture book, coffee table size.  I like my sandwiches, but I don't think they are THAT good.  Maybe I'm wrong?   Thanks.  What I've been kicking around is 26 sandwiches and all of the components to make each one.  Why 26?

Meat, bread, sauce, salad/veg/cheese, and a side.    Right on.  Now that is going to make me question my hunting season next year, as I passed a few that looked like that, but in every other aspect, an Aspen Bolete.  What kind of bolete is that?   Show us your tits!  Erm.... smokehouse?      gorgeous.  So jealous out here where we never see such fine product.  How much per kilo/gram if you don't mind sharing?   Wow.  I'd ask if you work in my town.  But then you mentioned getting paid.  Your post is basically the same experience of almost EVERYONE on my town, except they get $10.61/hr if they are lucky :(   Um...  I very well can be wrong, I'm not an expert.  But are you sure that big guy is a bolete?  I've never seen one that wasn't a sponge.   Somewhat close to that.  No pate and it's not on white bread, so to not cause controversy with the internet food police, I'm not going to call it a banh mi.  Just delicious.   I believe the ODB would say that he likes it RAAAAAAAAAW!   Zoidberg's ancestor?   Right now these are the things that I have on the desk that could be included in a book for non kitchen folk.  If it would happen, I highly doubt it would be in print.  But PDF/kindle/tablet friendly.  75+ different mayos  15 mustards  25 breads  6 bacon cures  20+ pickles of variety  10+ salt/spice mixes  20+ rubs for smoked meats  5 salamis  20+ slaws  20+ salads   And  the list goes on and on...   In the course of the last year, I have made a lot of (restaurant grade) sandwiches.  More importantly, I've made a lot of components to make a ton of awesome sandwiches.  From bread to mayo to cured meats to cheese.  I've made a lot of sandwich fixings.  I mean, the sandwich is one of the most perfect foods ever...  I have been asked in the real world, and in this one, numerous times to provide recipes, instructions, or a cookbook.  And I think it is about time that I cataloged my stacks of binders and notebooks into something useful for others.  So I thought I would judge a basic interest in such a thing from the sub.  If any of ya'll are curious or haven't seen any of my posts, below is a link to a gallery of sandwiches.  Comments, hate mail, critique, or anything else is more than welcome.  I'd love feedback of any kind.  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe      Puff pastry is always a bitch.  But it is good to stay in practice.  The budino is stupid simple.  Sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch (in lieu of gelatin to keep in veggie friendly), and a little salt in a pot.  Bring it up to a hot hot temp while stirring to not burn the cocoa and caramel the sugar a little.  Add milk/cream/liquids and bring that shit to a boil.  Stir ever couple of minutes to pull the nasty off the bottom.  Let that stuff go until it looks like clumpy mud and then run it through a chinoise.  Really, really simple.  Easy to fuck up.  It just takes a little time and attention.   I just got back from HI and saw one of the most awesome things ever in almost every gas station there.  I guess it is a CA company and so I'm sure they is information about.  I wish I would have remembered the name of the machines.  Prepacked "milkshake/smoothie" mixes and the "blizzard" machine to mix it all up and add the ice cream.  It was fucking genius.  It did take up a fair amount of room (think 2 large soda fountains, one of which is a dedicated refer) but I think the profit would be awesome.  Seasonal in most places, but awesome.  Think of it like the new fangled Kurig individual serving coffee stations that are everywhere.  Basically the exact same idea, but with smoothies/milkshakes.  And I think the price point (in HI, so that is inflated island prices) was about $4.50/ea.   Gutting out dilapidated shops and cleaning up after morons who shouldn't be in business in the first place is a great way to make money.  For example, there is a shop in my town right now that has 3 (used 1 year) double pour Astoria Espresso machines that I could probably pick up for about $400 ea.  Then again though, the owner is in a financial shit and is looking for anything he can get his hands on.  With that being said, it's also a great way to furnish/outfit a place, if you know how to inspect things.  And for units with refrigeration, learn how to check Freon levels and cooling elements/motors.  Used equipment is always questionable unless you have an awesome repair guy.  Used equipment is also not always 100% what you want, or more importantly, need.  It doesn't matter if the ice machine is only $250 if it only produces half of the needed ice for a day...   I hate plating.  I mean, fucking hate it.  I spent long enough in the trenches of fine dining to just not care what food looks like any more.  Method, taste, and technique is what I focus on.  So yeah.  Zig zags.  I'm lazy and like colour.  I wish I could bother to actually want to plate at home.  Cause I'll tell ya what, I hate that shit too.  But the girl loves it and treats me right for those kinds of things, so...   I can't bring myself to make pate at home.  The GF doesn't like it and I'm not a huge fan.  And I agree with the mint all the way around.  You can sneak in a piece of basil or two like I know a few folks do, but that is about as much messing with the herbs I like.   Puff pastry  Raspberries  Chocolate budino  Cream Anglaise  Mango sauce      5 spice Chinese style BBQ pork  Cilantro, diakon, carrot, and cucumber  Lemongrass and five spice mayo  whole wheat sub roll      "Banh Mi"  5 spice char sui pork  Daikon, carrot, cucumber, and cilantro    5 spice lemongrass mayo  Soft roll      Sirloin strip with porcini cream sauce  Fried Onion and mushrooms  Snap peas and garlic      Well, you should shout next time you're planning on coming up this way and I'll see what I can do.    Today's sandwich of awesome is a Bhan Mi.  Fuck yeah!   I already got lucky today, I should let someone else have a shot ;)   I was debating on coming down to ABQ today and this might make it worthwhile...   GTFO.   I teach classes often.  If you're interested in learning how to cook better, shop smarter, or how to do pretty much anything you would want to do at home that you can't do now, let me know.   http://www.rattlesnakes.com/   The membership to Plant World is only like $25, it's totally worth it.  The brother in law has one for his vegetable garden and I'm always impressed with the loot he finds.  Without going into long winded stories, maybe try calling BLM?  Or the USFS?  A pueblo?  Maybe could find an area that is having them cleared out to get transplants?  Only reason I say this is because I helped drop a few live pinon this summer doing some conservation work...   That's a first to hear for me.  People just usually want to burn it...  I'm up in SF, I'm pretty sure I've seen Pinon starts at Paynes.  Could also try "Plants of the SW" here in SF too.  Did you call plant world in ABQ?   Completely off topic, but if you've not hit up the Rattlesnake museum yet, you should.   The SF market is pretty much done.  There are the year round vendors in the building, but no produce.  Maybe a couple of hot house greens or tomatoes, but that is about it.  Crafts, bread, cheese, and canned goods now.     Do you mean live trees?   Shouldn't you be in the pit?   Foraging is fine.  It is the elite attitude of the "hipsters " or WTF ever else you want to call them that is the problem.  People shouldn't think that they are special because they went out and picked their own food.    Foraging needs to stop being talked about.  It belongs right there with the words "sustainable, local, organic" in needing to be stripped out of the vocabulary of those who work with food.  Why?  Because it should not be the exception, but the fucking norm.    But the real reason that I think we shouldn't be teaching more people to forage is because when shit hits the fan and we get knocked back into the stone age, the last people any of us will want to have around are the fucking hipsters.  If we teach them to forage, we increase their chances of survival.  That is no bueno.   I honestly don't think so.  But maybe?  That is just an IMO statement.  But maybe he's a outrageous pretentious fucktard?  He's never come across that way to me in the few things that I've read/watched him in.  However, I will tell him to fuck off with that dirt and pine needle shit.  The last thing we need to be doing in the culinary world is trying to convince the god dammed hipsters that they should forage even more.   How old are you?  What kind of education do you have? With 1 year experience, I would be extremely hesitant taking over the reigns of a kitchen that is obviously (by your words) poorly run.  Honestly it sounds like a good way to get fired in a couple of months for something you either don't know or have never handled.    Also.  KM for $30K?  I dunno what part of the country you are in, but that is stupid low IMO.  Just think for a minute.  That is $625/week before taxes.  That is just barely more than what a line cook makes in my little butt fuck town...   Because people are jealous of what they can't be and don't know how to control their emotions.   While all the *serious* answers here are fairly spot on IMO.  I think that it has to do with the fact that there is no money to be made in helping people or in doing good things :(  	122
 Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, Community, Friday Night Lights   Homeland, concept hooked me right away. Great show   Absolutely agree   Absolutely not. First of all, I want to see it on the big screen for the first time but also, I will be hitting myself for years when I think back about missing the first time New Star Wars theater experience.   I've always thought that PoA is my least favorite book, least favorite movie, but it is the best directed and has the perfect look of the series that set the tone for the rest of the series. The gripe about one little thing is ridiculous to claim against the director saying he is the worst. If you think he did a poor job directing, than that's fine. But one small continuity error that has nothing to do with the story and really holds no ground within the context does not make him a bad director. If anything, that should have been caught by the props department, continuity assistants, producers, and lastly the director.    I quote movies and TV every day. Most of them are so obscure, the reference isn't even met by most people.   I have not seen Chappie (didn't look like something I'd like) but I actually enjoyed Elysium. Sure, it wasn't perfect but still a good movie. I just think the concept of District 9 was the best so far.    I'm not better than everyone but I don't use Twitter and to me # is the number sign or pound button.    "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" was a textbook in the Harry Potter universe written by "Newt Scamander".   In 2007, JK Rowling wrote a small version of the textbook for Charity and then due to popular demand, released it to the public.  A few years ago she had a discussion with Warner Brothers and the idea was brought up about adapting the story of the fictional author Newt Scamander into a screenplay to make movie. JK Rowling wrote the screenplay and they are turning a fictional textbook character into a movie franchise.    Because he is an old guy that looks like every other old guy. Leonard thinks of himself as cool, young, and unique but Britta is saying he is just another old guy.    As I said, I know all of the profit doesn't go straight to the studio, but the percentage is different for each film as is the funding for each film. Warners could have only done distribution and not put a dime into the production of the film, they could have paid for all of it, we don't know. The way the profit is split depends on how much money was put in by which company. When a Studio gets half, that most likely means they only paid half, maybe more maybe less. So as far as Warners making money, we don't know. The movie itself, made money.    Kramer? Is that you?    I recorded it the other day on my DVR it said "Live. Die. Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow" and I've seen that on websites and other places where you can rent and buy   It was used throughout the production of the movie. Only before the release they changed it to Edge of Tomorrow. But what I meant was, I think that "All You Need is Kill" is the best title of the 3 titles used and they should have stuck with that in my opinion.    Huh? I never said it was a fact. Just because I didn't spell out that I posting my opinion doesn't mean I think it's fact.    I know, I just hate Twitter culture...    I would get one if it didn't have a damn number sign on it...    Considering it is the best title of the 3, I think it does. But it was also called that throughout production. Edge of Tomorrow is what it was first released as   The movie was distributed by Warner Brothers and had 4 other production companies that made the film. We have no idea how or who exactly funded what portions of the film besides the 100 mil in marketing. Even a giant studio like Warners takes in outside investors to fund movies. The split of the take of a movie is only estimated based on basic knowledge of movie gross revenue split. The fact remains that it cost $280 to make and made $370. That's considered a success or at least moderate intake. Not even close to a "bomb".   The rename has not been specifically stated that it was in hopes to get better home video sales, that's just speculation. The truth is that they already thought "All You Need is Kill" was too heavy with the word Kill in it. They used Edge of Tomorrow but thought it was too stock and finally ended up with a mess of a title in "Live. Die. Repeat:Edge of Tomorrow". If anything, that would decrease sales for people trying to find the movie Edge of Tomorrow.    Cinematography is the only one that it might get nominated for. Other than that, there was nothing Oscar worthy about it. I'll gladly take the impending downvotes because someone has to look past the hype and be realistic.    Baconreader is a simple design. May not look as nice as Sync but it has great functionality and much more options and settings than others.   Link me: Baconreader   It did $370 mil worldwide in the box office on a $180 mil budget. It was successful. The problem is the studio never liked the title "Edge of Tomorrow" as they thought it was too generic. They added the slogan on Theatrical promotional materials "Live. Die. Repeat." By the time it was released on DVD and Blu-ray, "Live. Die. Repeat." was larger than "Edge of Tomorrow" and Live. Die. Repeat. had taken over as a main title. Confusing as hell and just plain stupid   That just puts a big smile on my face, haha!    I don't care that much but they need to make a damn decision.   The script was titled "All You Need is Kill"   The theatrical release was titled "Edge of Tomorrow"   The DVD/BluRay released was titled "Live. Die. Repeat."    My god, I totally forgot about that Troy quote, so damn good!    That was a repeat   The gang would spit on him until he ran out of the bar and that would be it.    YA BIT?!?    Easily the best Shut Up Leonard   Troy:" You are human tennis elbow. You are a pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth. You are the opposite of Batman!"  Abed: "I can't remember the name of the girl from that movie... Kids in detention?... Mary Margaret... Molly Ringworm?...You broke me..."   Annie: "Oh, don't take that. I dropped that class after the lesson on Set-ups. The teacher was soooo old..."   Shirley:"They remind me of Sam and Diane! I hated Sam and Diane" "We get it! You're Young!"   Jeff: "Pierce! What is this. What are you doing. Explain yourself."  Britta: "Shut up Leonard! I once mistook 6 people for you at a pharmacy"  Pierce:" Jeff, I think your shirt is trying to get out of your pants"  Frankie:"Jeff says I sound like Abed. I wonder if Britta thinks I sound like Chang. I assume Chang thinks I sound like distant explosions and screaming babies. You know he's unstable right?"  Elroy:"I'm nobodies fourth ghostbuster"  Chang:"Thank you sir. You won't regret this. Unless I rise up against you"  Dean:"Off campus. Im just a Craigular Joe."  Hickey:"Millimeter don't make a difference. Bullets just kinda kill you."   Haha! That is absolutely perfect!    I've managed to stay away from it all except the first two trailers   She wasn't playing the game.    It's definitely skippable but there is some decent stuff in there. I'd say watch it but go in knowing that Dan Harmon refers to it, even references it in the show, as "The Gas Leak Year" so it's all just a little off. Haha   Still stretching.   I have Netflix, Hulu Plus, and have Comcast with the premium package for HBO. I'm not cutting the cord yet but I will cutout Comcast's Premium package in favor of HBONow   Finally! Can't wait til I can get rid of the overpriced premium cable package in favor of this. Now just do the $99 for a year subscription and I'm golden   [I'll allow it](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ill_allow_it_community.gif)    Well said. Thanks for clarifying. As you know, we all are incredibly passionate and protective of Community. Next time, just provide a little bit of context and we all love discussing different aspects of the show. But really, I hope you can move on and watch 4, 5, and 6. Nothing will ever beat season 2 for me personally but I truly think season 5 is very close and it has some of my favorite episodes of the series. 6 has been really good too. All else fails, watch them, and if you don't like them, never watch them again. It won't ruin 1-3 for you.   Good luck and I apologize for the rudeness before context was given.    "Ugh, so much Jim-ing..."   That's a big stretch. It could be from Its Always Sunny, Breaking Bad, etc. Could just be something funny.    Yes, but Robert California was the WORST   Kaitlin Olson, Lake Bell, and Megan Ganz, I'm sold.    I'm more intrigued now but I was definitely hoping it would have been a live action role. He is the MoCap king though   Ok, so there are others. It works better than the typical cheesy product placement   "believeable within the universe" of the movie. You are a moron and not worth my time   Well, dang. It was worth a try but I respect that for sure. Since my opinion doesn't hold as much ground as yours, mine is Matt's Bar for sure. Thanks for responding though!    True. True True True.    I agree with you on rather having a group centric episode instead but it was still funny.   I do however disagree about Meow Meow Beenz. I love that episode   Big fan and love the new show Man Finds Food!   As someone from Minnesota, I'd like to finally clear the air, if you can remember, which was the better Jucy (Juicy) Lucy Burger? 5-8 Club or Matt's Bar?    OotP was rushed at times, I'll give you that. But the tone of HBP goes along with the story, for the most part, it has its lighthearted moments as it is the last year for Harry at Hogwarts but then it gets serious again. Even though that book and movie have the most changes, they are both my favorite book and favorite movie.   As for DH1, the point of the slow middle is to make it feel that a good portion of time is passing by. I didn't even realize that was the reason until re-reading the book. Otherwise months seem like days in the movie. And it's the calm before the storm. DH2 feels rushed because there is so much that happens, yet it's only the last quarter of the book. It is meant to feel like things are all happening at once to show chaos. You watch those two together and they provide one of the best adaptions of a book I've ever seen.   As for the visuals, as I said in another post, that has to do with the Cinematographer, not the director.    It was the most unbelievable part of the movie. Everything else within the universe of the movie was believable except that. You come and call someone a stupid person and you yourself used a stupid use of language and then called me a smart ass teenage girl. If anyone is stupid, that would be you for coming at me with nothing but stupid Grammer, nothing to back you up, and name calling based on you not being able to handle that someone doesn't like something that doesn't make sense   They are a sponsor of the show, it happens all the time. Subway is the biggest one, popping up for funny spotlights in Chuck, Pawn Stars, etc. The difference is that I've never seen another example of building story around advertisers other than Community with Subway and now Honda. Dan knows they need advertisers and product placement to survive so like I said, he shines a light on it and makes a story out of it. It's either that or they have to shamefully and awkwardly put their products in multiple episodes and mention them. You make that part of the story and it's hilarious   I believe, but could be wrong, that they spent the same as any advertiser to have product placement in the show. The difference is, instead of just showing a Honda or bringing it up casually, Dan Harmon likes to make a story out of it like he did with Subway. There is no need for it but of you have to do it, why not blow it up and shine a light on it and make it into a hilarious storyline?    The third movie was the first to have a darker palette. They tried to keep that continuity throughout the end of the series, sometimes definitely too much. But the dark color palette again isnt chosen by the director. Yes, he oversees but overall he lays that to the cinematographer as that is their job not the director. Yates isnt the greatest director ever but he is very solid and made some really good Potter movies. He is used to the universe and will bring the feel of that to Fantastic Beasts.   That would be the cinematographer and post production teams mostly   Ya know, we are only unwelcoming and awful when someone comes in and puts up a cryptic post that says "Did anyone else stop after season 3? I did. And i think i'm happy with that." From my perspective, that shows a lack of respect for the show past season 3 and a lack of respect for the people that still watch it. Your topic and first comment made it seem as if you were against the show as it is now.  As for the rest, you are very confusing on what you've seen, will not see, where you started, left off. First you say that you stopped after season 3. Then you said you stopped in the middle of season 3 due to "network changes and Harmon normalizing". Then you said you only started in the middle of season 3 and didn't have a chance since then to continue watching (all seasons are on Hulu and DVD and season 6 is on Yahoo Screen for free). Then you said you saw a few episodes of season 4. I am very confused.  EDIT: We actually are a friendly and welcoming subreddit but very protective when someone seemingly comes to troll (I now know you arent but it seemed that way). Anyway, just watch 4, 5,   6. You will struggle through 4 but will be rewarded with 5 and 6.   If you were too obsessed, you would have kept watching. The thing you must know is that Dan Harmon never "normalized" anything due to the network pressure. In fact, he was fired for his push back and doing what he wanted. Then season 4 was not good without him so they brought him back for a great season 5 and 6. The cast changes are tough but it's still great.   What you are saying is like having a kid and loving it so much and as its growing up and is influenced by the outside world, you kicked it out on the street and left it for dead only for that kid to thrive without you.   Other than Alfonso Cuaron, he did the best job directing. You do realize scenes being added/changed/removed is mostly who wrote and produced the movie who is Steve Kloves who wrote the screenplay for every movie but OotP and David Heyman who produced all of the movies and is producing Fantastic Beasts. I mean, David Yates had influence on how he wanted the movie made and was able to remove scenes filmed in editing but he does not typically choose what is included and excluded in the script.  As for the tone and pace of his movies, i think they were very well done. Alfonso set the tone in the third movie and David Yates brought that back in OotP. Pacing wise, his movies move swiftly except when trying to show time within the universe passing by (Deathly Hallows Part 1)   Absolutely agree. I think season 5 might be my favorite season. Between 5 and 2. But yea, it had some incredible episodes   Nope, I'm through season 6 episode 12 and loving it. I'm not a fair weather Community fan. I've stuck with it when the times were tough and then when they were all good again. Season 4 was a little rough but you are missing out on two really good seasons in 5 and 6.    THEY BROUGHT THEIR FUCKING TOYS!!    Seconded   She's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face   Alright, so his back story exists in an off hand quote in an article and the purpose is still not justified because even as a weapon, it is never shown used as that in the movie   I don't expect the cars to look different. I'm just backing up the person who said the guitar guy was useless and out of place. The only "sense" that can be made of it is either guessing or made up back story.   Again, they are better taken care of than all of their cars and everything Immortan Joe owns which is all rusted and shitty   The movie is based in an age of brutality with little materials. Everything is decrepit from the cars to the people to the towns. Immortan Joe seemingly has everyone starving and either fighting for him or worshiping him. Yet in all of this, there is a guy who doesn't fight and has an entire car just to hold him and giant amps and his flaming guitar and the drum guys. And again, everything is decrepit EXCEPT for his guitar, and amp/drum car. And how in all of this does an electric guitar and amps like that survive but people barely can?    Nah, Hot is easily the best. But they are all really good   Make sure to have a hot Butterbeer at either the Hog's Head or the Leaky Cauldron. Seriously amazing!    Reposting from the thread yesterday about the same topic: The flaming guitar guy, the repetitive action, Petite storyline, weirdness of the story.    Wow, getting called a stupid person  for not liking the caricature guitar guy playing a flaming guitar in the middle of a battle in a movie for which makes absolutely no sense other than to feed into the soundtrack in a way that removes you from the movie. Seriously, even within the logic of the story, it makes no sense.  And next time you try to call someone stupid, make sure you at least use the correct words ("Your" should be "You're")   No its not the movies fault but this is the thread asking what we disliked. Having not seen any other Mad Max movies and being convinced by /r/movies and reviews to see it regardless, that's one of the things I didn't like.    I have nightmares about that song.    HAAAAAaaaaaAAM GirrrrRRRRL   Hey guess what. We would have season 6 if it weren't for them. They are our savour and we are their first test. Give them a break and maybe we'll get a season 7 and a better Yahoo Screen   You are sort of right about the characters but I wouldn't go as far as saying one trick ponies and definitely not caricatures (like Season 4). The character development happens here and there but it's definitely not the focus as in seasons 1 and 2. And that's really hard to do when you only have 13 episodes as opposed to 22-24  But season 5 and 6 are well beyond season 4. The writing is so much better and the stories are much more Community. Season 5 had some of my favorite episodes of the series.  Give season 6 another chance, you'll see from people's reviews that Community fans are loving it. Yes, it's different. That's mainly due to 3 main characters being gone. It's hard but the new characters turn out really good. It's never going to be the same as the early seasons, but the best part of Community is that they don't try to be like early days. The have evolved with the changes and still managed to hold on to what we love about the show.    Me thinks he has been involved in 3 great television series.    Loved it. It's odd in the best ways possible.    Well, it is created by the creator of Parks and Rec/head writer of The Office   It was soooo cheesy   The flaming guitar guy, the repetitive action, Petite storyline, weirdness of the story.    Star Wars. Why? Because that's the first movie I remember seeing. Maybe not the very first movie I ever watched, but definitely the first one I remember.    You are comparing two extremely complex multi storyline mega franchise/universes to 2 burnout horror franchises that continued the same idea the entire way through? Bad examples.   "Plus just because a film has good reviews and makes big money doesnt mean anything". Those, plus audience reaction, mean everything. How else do you gauge success or if a movie is good or not before seeing it (besides a trailer)?    Jurassic Park is absolutely necessary. The 2nd and 3rd are good/decent but take place on a different island so they can be skipped   I really think she is talented but she has been type cast as the same role in a bunch of movies now. Bridesmaids was a true great performance from her. I'm glad the reviews are coming in good, I might go see it then. I always like Paul Feig's work   Season 4 was a mess (due to the creator/showrunners being fired)  but Season 5 is one of my favorite seasons and 6 has been really good too. B99 is more consistent on the laughs for sure but Community is just a whole nother level of comedy.    You should, it only gets better as it goes along. It's really well done   But.. But then she wouldn't be on B99...   It's great! One of my favorite shows right now. The cast is amazing and more people need to watch it.   Edit: Come join /r/Brooklynninenine   In a thread that most everyone else is just listing a title of a movie, I did the same. I was not prompted, if you would actually read the other comments, you would see that I said my reasons on my own. I hope next time you try to post a "clever" retort, you actually read the rest of the comment chain to make sure what you are posting about hasn't already been covered. That's how Adults sound reasonable. But I forgive you   Again, I did say why, in the same thread, along the same chain as these comments, and even before you first commented. You just didn't read.    You see, the difference is, no one asked me why. They asked for a list of movies I liked to judge me. I ended up saying what I liked and didn't like about Mad Max in another post in this thread which you just decided to skip.  And again, I wasn't "hating" on Mad Max. There was no reason for your post other than trolling. I went out of my way to explain that I didn't hate the movie, it was just my least favorite.  I know I'm in the minority of thinking Max Max was just okay, but I felt that I shouldn't need to be silenced considering I'm not trolling the movie.    They are totally different franchises and being handled totally different by different companies within Disney.   But anyway, how has Marvel been run into the ground? Last I checked they are hugely grossing movies with quite good reviews.    I did explain my reasoning just a few comments down in this same thread. Way to go and not read and then post some garbage comment.   And why is it that just because I didn't love it (never said I hated it) that I am automatically some men's rights activist? If you read my comment about why I didn't care for the movie, I said it was the subject matter of the movie. The cast, very much including Charlize Theron, was one of the best parts of the movie.   Why do people get all butthurt when someone has an opposing view of a movie? Especially when I didn't bash the movie.    Community   No I didn't think Mad Max was bad. But it's all subjective. I didn't care for the subject matter of Mad Max. It looked incredible and I liked the cast but lacked story and was repetitive. So posting which movies I liked doesn't say they are necessarily "better movies", just more my preference.    It was Lapari. It would make no sense for it to be a giant mystery if they didn't have a big reveal   /r/MadMax   Baconreader is simple, yes, but that's what I like about it. Sync looks great but it's kind of cluttered,  doesn't have near the features, and the settings have good customization but not in the right areas.    Does it matter? If I had seen only one other movie and liked that better, it wouldn't make a difference because I just didn't care for Mad Max like everyone else did. No matter what or how many movies I list, it's just gonna piss off Mad Max fans to no end because i didn't think it was a masterpiece.    I haven't seen a Bad movie this year, but my least favorite thus far is Mad Max: Fury Road.  	102
 so timeless in my opinion.   How could someone here tell you to just go and die...  I feel the same. I'm stuck here and everything else around me is kind of moving forward. Got my high-school diploma in my pocket for over two years now and I'm trying to make it to uni for one and a half year now to study social work, but the expectations are high (and my average too bad). Oh and I'm social phobic, which makes everything a bit worse.    What I'm acutally trying to say is that it's not that easy to completely ignore the outside factors, since we are quite on the emotional side and I definitely understand your desire to just move away and leave all these negative things behind.  Maybe we should both do things step by step, plan little things and not all at once, so we don't hold ourselves back, because we think nothing's not gonna work anyway. J. K. Rowling (writer of the Harry Potter books, in case you didn't know) once said: "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default."   I'm definitely keeping this in mind.    (Sorry for any mistakes. Lack of sleep and English is not my native language)   I'd go as Poison Ivy, or as kind of like a chic vampire.. But I'm probably going to stay at home, make myself some tea and watch a nice movie like "Sweeney Todd", "The Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Sleepy Hollow".    I've seen that, it looks beautiful. :) But haven't tried it yet!  Most of the time I prefer black tea with milk. But when I need something fancy, I drink a mixture of teas which are made by a "herb witch" (she calls herself like that) here in our village. One of my favourites among these is called "chimney fire".  	4
 He told it beautifully. Too bad no one believed him. All evidence was destroyed, and a 70 year old with severe PTSD can be hard to believe   My grandfather, of south-east asian descent, had many stories to tell. He had a gift with his words. The imagery of his words would play a miniature film in our heads while we were boys, from his mystifying tales of cultural legends or grotesque descriptions of the desolate wasteland left after a phantom run. But there was one story he told us, when we neared the age of adulthood, that shook my brother and I to our core.   "It was the year 1972. The sleepy rural village of Treang was experiencing its troubles. It had been decimated by American bombing runs just years before. So far it was spared from Sar's war in the north of Cambodia, one that would later imprison much of the nation in his tyrannical rule. I had just gotten married to a beautiful girl, and this years harvest had been plentiful. If only I knew the horrors that I would face for 8 years, exchanging hands of madmen, and the utter loss of faith in the good of humanity, maybe I would have escaped. But there was no way of knowing of what was to come.  For what reason I was so far from my village I do not remember, but my walk through the jungle to the east took a drastically wrong turn. When I woke up, I was in a small settlement, located on ruins from the Angkor period. White and Khmer men with guns greeted me. Further regaining my senses, I was chained to a wall with 4, maybe 5, other men. One of the Khmer men yelled "THE TWO ELDEST", and the two men to my right were taken off the wall and led outside the shack that contained me. Then an oddly dressed white man, the leader of the group, emerged. Beckoning the armed men's respect, then muttered something to the other white man standing there, and we were escorted out.  The next thing I remembered was waking up in my barrack by way of a loud, inhuman noise. Standing before us was a priest. Not a priest like you know, he was more of a warden of sorts. He was a big and burly man with a pale complexion, more so than most of the white men even. He laid down the rules of this hellscape. You work when you are told to work, you eat when you are told to eat, those who dont work are sacrificed to the god-on-earth. The god-on- earth, I later found out, was the oddly dressed man.  One of these rituals that occurred every month was the initiation of the young, a baptismal event of sorts. What I saw here, however, was beyond horrid. All these kids, they had deformities! Some were missing legs or arms or eyes, some had horrid welts on their bodies, some had bent heads and clubbed feet. "The result of the Ambrosia they feed the women" the man beside me spoke,obviously malnourished and here a long time, "These children are desirable to god" he exclaimed. The Ambrosia, I would later figure out, had a horrid effect on plant life, and would cause illness in the women themselves. In America, they know it as "Agent Orange." Other days, we would see those who refused to work, or had just dropped due to exhaustion. They were tied to a stone pillar, tight enough where the ribs that were able to be counted to begin with stuck out even further, and these poor souls were sacrificed with a knife, and their bodies left to decompose in the open. You got used to the smell, you couldn't let anything bother you in this place. You ignored the sickly women being raped out in the open, instead opting to bury your head in the field and continue to reap under the brutal heat. You ignored the cries of the desirable children. It ruined you and kept you up and night only for a wile, before you were left in a constant state of almost comfortable numb.   After 3 years of this hell, when I had forgotten about my wife, my old town, my old life, they came. The men of Saloth Sar appeared on the horizon. We were made to defend the haven, but when the came closer I ran like the devil to the river, dodging bullets and bombs, and hid. The battle was short, arming weak feeble men against an army that now controlled all of Cambodia proved futile, and the Khmer Rouge torched the site, and shot everyone they saw. My desire to live kicked in for the first time in many years, and I ran into the jungle east towards the Vietnamese border.  Upon making it through the Vietnamese border, almost being shot by the border guards out of fear of me being with White Scarves, then being detained. They interpreted my story as detainment under the Khmer Rouge themselves, who would be found of committing horrible atrocities themselves later. From there I went to Thailand and then America, settling in San Fransisco.  Throughout the years after my experience, the god on earth visited my dreams and appeared in my daily life. I saw the faces of those who died and were born under his horrible regime. I would spend days unable to get out of my bed, out of fear and sadness. Many days I thought of ending my eternal torment, being saved only by shreds of dignity and humanity I had left. In the 80's, I found my wife and your father, who had escaped the Khmer Rouge into Thailand, and had assumed I was dead. They pushed me to continue living, and sent me to a therapist. However, when I tried to explain my story, it was dismissed as PTSD.  When I think of the God-on-Earth, I realize that he was just a man as I was. A man out of his element, in a wilderness he has never seen, faced by an enemy he was bred to hate. I would look through documents to find out his real name, which I will not disclose. He was a pilot in the US Air Force who was downed in the Tet Offensive, and thought to have heroically defended his comrades near Tay Ninh before a few of his men and him had disappeared. He was presumed dead, and  a statue of his was erected in his hometown in  Nebraska. His friends and family described him as a family man who held a deep compassion for human life. He was an environmental activist advocating against uses of DDT as a pesticide. Its funny, how fear and desperation can change you, bring out the worst in you that you never knew you had. Or maybe it was the Ambrosia"   And an American tourist talking slow like you're simple "where....Is....The......Restroom"   I think it sounds similar to "euro"   Lol nobody actually clicked the link they just saw the title and went "HELL YEAH ILL COMMENT"    And this is the mindset that gets nothing done IMO.   Well, seeing as a lot of Court Justices ARE getting up an age, Sanders WOULD be much better so when the congress changes to the left in a few years (after the 2014 disaster), It would be pretty smooth.   In other words, Sanders first term wouldn't be nearly as successful as his second.  	7
 Ha!  that's why i put something between me and him and blasted him with fireballs.  Cheese I know but hey, survivalism ya know?   Go back to Quelaana in Blighttown by warping to Chaos servant bonfire and going back through Queelag's boss room.  Be careful though, not to draw enemies close to her and risk aggro-ing her.  She'll upgrade your +15 to ascended +5.  I used great fireball, black flame, and great chaos fireball on Gwyn.    Just beat him a couple days ago on NG.  +3 Ascended pyromancy flame, and kept one of the stalagmites in between me and him i.e. Smough fight.  Done in like 5 minutes, found it suprisingly easy for the final boss.     http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1nwvu3/7_movies_that_will_leave_you_devastated/.   Keep seeing donnie darko and requiem as most disturbing blah blah movies and thought I'd suggest some good alternatives.     Company of men is pretty messed up!!  Baxter is pretty intense too good double feature!   I originally saw Frontier(s) on netflix streaming....   Yeah that just kept getting worse and worse as it went along....sad   Donnie Darko?  Please.  Here's some truly devastating movies... [Bedeviled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBq0SLWNF-E)....[In the Company of Men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtpmAdgl8UI)...[Martyrs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNpDiQimK6U)...[Frontiers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnoGQfW51ng)...[Inside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVGswuX42x0)...[Baxter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqJtJL6bSRg)...[In a Glass Cage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09AIbYPWLQ)...[Schramm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgk-gBoa54o)....[Angst](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfqN2wuH_Ck) Also 'Fat girl' by Breillat and 'Michael' by Schlienzer   Donnie Darko's the most over-rated crap movie ever.  You left off Martyrs, A Serbian Film, Bedeviled, In the Company of Men and Irreversible..... among others that are WAY better than Darko and Requiem   We are legion for we are many.....   About two hours ago I got summoned to help someone get to O S and there was an invader right at that spot.  I gave em the ol' Wrath of God right off that ledge....was that you per chance?   Mega mule right?     Sooo, after being a dragon for two days, I put my dragon summon in Oolacile Township.  Get two summons in about twenty minutes.  Third summon is wearing full dragon gear.  I drop a prism, he/she drops 99 of all slabs.  DRAGONBROS!   It's f***ing game board.   Block ornstein on way in to fight then run to opposite side of room staying outside pillars.  Smough isnt fast and this will help seperate them.  Pyromancy flame is great for this fight.  Rats in the depths are good for humanity farming.  Also solaire did nothing for me, just gets himself killed right away.  However he does make a nice distraction.   I just joined too, same question.  I know the person youre trying to invade has to have a dragon scale.  Ive had moderate success in oolacile township by pvp bonfire, other than that not so much.  I would guess the main pvp areas?  White a red signs still work fine   Let's rock...    What's your soul level? If you go past 120 you'll have a hard time being summoned in earlier levels even for S O.  Also what system?   Mimic!  Oh wait it's just a chest, phew  	19
 Small correction, that first picture is Beacon Hill, not South Boston.    This is how doctors are trained. Just goes to show you can't make everyone happy.   sounds like he had you pegged   Psshhh, they were doing that in russia and china a long time ago.   from boston, can confirm   Good and bad is basically irrelevant. It's "mine" and "yours."         My parents (near retirement age) have far more than this saved. They both drive cars that are more than 10 years old and hardly ever go out to eat. My dad uses a prepaid cellphone from 7-11. My mom spends most of her time at work running a cash register. For them a 50 dollar dinner would be an extravagance. They may be "rich" in a global sense but it certainly doesn't look like it in their daily lives.   I support fully   I'll quote myself from another thread on this: Doctors just can't win with opioids. 20 Years ago they were taking all kinds of flack for under-prescribing pain killers and not properly assessing pain. Now everyone accuses them of using too many opioids. Ten years ago they were getting flack for under-assessing pain in women and under-prescribing them opioids. Now they prescribe too many. How about let doctors treat the patient's pain to the patient's satisfaction and if that patient can't handle their meds responsibly it's their own fucking fault. All the opioid addiction hysteria is moronic.   It sounds like he was just walking around with a white coat and not actually meeting with patients. People were just assuming he was a doctor. He was also african american and I wonder if some people weren't suspicious but didn't want to be the guy who accused the black guy of not being a doctor if he did in fact turn out to be one.   It sort of seems like if you're a janitor and don't want an immigrant taking your job you are a xenophobic racist.....but if you're a software engineer and don't want an immigrant taking your job you're just protecting the American workforce.   The most disturbing thing on there is that younger people have a more favorable view of the NSA than older people. WTF.   I've been shooting guns since I was about five. It all depends on if there is proper supervision and an appropriate firearm. In this case there was neither and criminal negligence (IMO) occurred.   This is the type of firearm in question https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SZ7cwzILBU  There is no way an 8 year old can be expected to control such a thing. I wouldn't trust an adult without a decent amount of training.   Doctors just can't win with opioids. 20 Years ago they were taking all kinds of flack for under-prescribing pain killers and not properly assessing pain. Now everyone accuses them of using too many opioids. Ten years ago they were getting flack for under-assessing pain in women and under-prescribing them opioids. Now they prescribe too many. How about let doctors treat the patient's pain to the patient's satisfaction and if that patient can't handle their meds responsibly it's their own fucking fault. All the opioid addiction hysteria is moronic.   That is largely bullshit. Yes the MCAS scholarship provides for free tuition, but at UMass Amherst for a resident the yearly tuition is $1714 while the fees (not covered by the scholarship) are $11544.   you have no reason to believe this man was sane   It's fucking bullshit. I went on a no-pants T ride and now I have to register with the state.   I'm all about free speech but when people like you say stupid stuff they should be sent to prison.   listen to yourself   Im not anti-gun by any means, but I am against handguns because   As long as we're speculating, maybe if the doctor had been allowed to have a firearm at work he could have defended himself (BWH bans firearms). Or maybe the scumbag had the drop on him and it wouldn't have mattered if he used a gun, knife, golf club, etc.    Yea, probably region dependent. Around here we have "electric vehicle parking" (no plug). It's to make it clear that they are "GREEN" and not a baby-shooting rethuglican.   The shooter also left a wife and bunch of kids to clean up his mess. What a piece of shit.   some would say by joining the military you are "earning it for yourself"   meh, it's the internet who gives a fuck. It's funny how no one ever says shit like this in person.   Why the fuck are there "veterans-only" spots? That's just some stupid shit.  -a veteran   Is it too late to speculate wildly?  1) person whose spouse/child had bad outcome 2) jilted lover   I think Japan's full fury would be some very limited F-15 strikes because they would have to fly halfway across the world and do a bunch of aerial refueling. They have very limited offensive capability.    exactly, rich people LOVE paying for poor peoples kids   So can we catch them in nets, lock them up, and force them to take medication?   sounds like you do   This is kind of located out in the boonies of Worcester, I wish they could get more stuff like this going on down town or in the canal district. There are a lot of empty buildings/underutilized buildings.   Also Marine (just a grunt, not sniper)...yea the hollywood shit killed it for me. The best was when he decides to "go clear houses with Marines" and proceeds to start teaching them stuff during a gunfight. Like....thanks for abandoning your post, now we have no overwatch in exchange for a doosh who is using different SOPs than rest of the squad. Awesome.    Typical Massachusetts :/   So the sum result of this stunt may be to increase the police powers of the state and make future, perhaps more reasonable, targeted protests increasingly costly. What a win.   I sit down to poop   I don't really know, the article seemed to imply that women without good access to bathing facilities where at higher risk for GU infections during their menses. Baby wipes are good for the bits, though I imagine cleaning man bits is easier.   Your "buddies opinion," what a cop-out you coward.    Thats the funny thing  Middle class white guy on his way to work in finance: "Hey boss, some retards blocked the pike so I'm gonna be late" Boss: "No problem Jim."  Poor hispanic guy on his way to construction site: "Hey boss, I'm stuck in traffic because of a protest" Boss: "Not my problem dipshit, I'm docking your pay for the morning and if this happens again you're done!"   Man for a someone so concerned about the downtrodden you certainly have a proclivity for snobby, generalizing statements about people you don't know.   Rambo 4 was way better.   No shit......that was the worst part of the movie. It would have been better if they had reduced the number of guys he was facing by a factor of 10.   Uh, not really much to share. Didn't have any kind of running water or tubs so we used baby wipes and bottled water. It sucked cause it was the winter most of the time. Striping down and scrubbing with bottled water in 30 degrees isn't fun. We smelled bad, but you got used to it after a while.    He makes stupid people feel smart. It's his schtick. He has exactly 5 first author publications in research journals. He is more of an entertainer than a scientist.    The great thing about America is that you don't have to go to the doctor if you don't want to.   Or Bill Clinton for that matter   One of the less acknowledged limitations to woman serving in combat roles. In Afghanistan I literally went 6 months without a shower.   The author isn't even that attractive, middle of the road for OKC in a big city at best (we have a mutual friend). FWIW my much more attractive girlfriend took the initiative and messaged me. I don't think any sane guy sees it as a sign of desperation. From my perspective the best dates I went on were always with girls that were actually enthusiastic about dating. They didn't want to chat back and forth for days. I'd just send my first message asking them out and they would say yes. The wishy washy ones always ended up sucking.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgwkuVWITFo#t=164  This is what explosive breaching was invented for   Updating.........Updating.........

Has it been officially ruled a suicide? There could be important life insurance implications if it is suicide vs an accident.   I'd say Europeans spend a whole lot more time criticizing the USA about its healthcare laws and gun laws than American spend criticizing Europeans laws. Most Americans don't know or give a shit.   God bless America   Comparing it in absolute terms is stupid because salaries vary between states.   What the fuck does that have to do with Canada in WW2?     It's a war. Shit happens.      Don't respond to anyone in DTX   Poor bastard is a murder.....thats all ANYONE knows about him now....so fuck him   "One to screw in the bulb, one to hold the camera, and 19 to scream 'Allahu Akbar!!!'"   Nothing meaningful will happen. Thanks public sector unions!!   I assure you that members of the REAL military (ie. Infantry, Armor, Arty, Engineers, etc.) are for the most part embarrassed by such bullshit. They're also being paid at about 1/10 the rate of the BPD.   oddly hush hush   When these two are in agreement it is pretty clear the police have fucked the pooch.   That's different, they're trying to show off their achievemnt   afgans sit to piss   Good shoot. Hopefully Jawaad's buddies get charged with felony murder.   So you're blaming it on black people?   Absolutely. When you create conditions in which a leader fears to leave office to an opposing party due to possible prosecution you set yourself up for a bad situation.

So they should be good outside of 1000 meters, right?   I wish a bunch of asian americans could get together and make sitcom about an asian american family on a HBO or something. It would hilarious.   If they want more attention could I suggest setting stuff on fire?   The funny part is that the residents are probably the ones that preformed the surgery. Running to an attorney is definitely a good first step. American healthcare in a nutshell ladies and gents.   Why would you lie to your doctor about your medical history? If you don't think you can speak frankly with your physician, find another one.   of course if no one allowed residents in, we wouldn't have doctors anymore :(   I wonder what she signed.   Yup, that was definitely the blown to shit place in the green zone. We were told never to go inside because supposedly it had a bunch of UXO. I took this pic nearby http://imgur.com/z0UGqSP I also had some jerk toss a frag at me in that neighborhood.    Where was PB Woqab in relation to the DC? We didn't have a position named Woqab when I was there. Our positions consisted of OP Himmel, OP Lakeside (across the west wadi from Himmel), the DC, PB Habib (north of DC in the city), Roshan Tower, PB Kunjak (East of DC in the middle of a wadi), and PB Griffin and OP Panda Ridge (both north of PB Habib and I think built after the Brits left.) There was also "Post 6" which was a huge hesco fort built out east of the DC and run by the ANA, and an abandoned compound near a bridge in the green zone that had been blown all to hell (the locals said the british used it for a base).   This is bullshit. We've bled enough for Iraq. This time the mission should be colonization. If America has to go in there again we get the land and the oil. There's our way, and there's Saddam's way at this point.   They would run shit   Like with axes?   It worked during WW2   An argument against cultural relativism if I ever saw one.   And thousands of hipster voices cried out from the abyss...   If he's gonna get all huffy about definitions he is wrong. It was a "flashbang" or stun grenade.

 Perfectionist is very challenging in blacklist, if that's what you're looking for. I haven't played the first three so I can't speak for those, but still I can't imagine there's *that* much a change.   I don't know why people are complaining about Blacklist not being able to play covertly. I had a ton of fun completely the story in Blacklist as ghost.   Assumging you are Long Muppet, no. I was just making a joke about how your name is 'Muppet', i.e. a colloqiel term for someone stupid, and you performed a stupid act. I can see how it might sound like I know you, though.  Also, can I see your Widow fit? I'm training up for one now :D.   Long Muppet, heh, sounds about right.   - Greyscale, on behalf of the Nullsec Working Group (Scarpia, Fozzie, Ytterbium, Rise, Bettik, Delegate Zero, Masterplan and Nullarbor)   Welcome to reddit.   Here's the original tweet by TB:  https://twitter.com/Totalbiscuit/status/517336530885808128  And Jim's reply https://twitter.com/JimSterling/status/517339470728036352  They're apparently upholding a copyright claim that prevents him from monetizing it.     I'm not asking people to bring out the pitchforks, and people shouldn't, unfortunately that's sort of how reddit does things. I tried in my OP to be as objective as possible,hopefully I succeeded in that.   TotalBiscuit explains (possibly) why here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/ngk4v1   Tl;dr; looks murky because they only gave out pre-release codes to people they sponsored, but the DMCA claim makes it look like WB Games registered the cutscenes with Content ID, and they're being taken down autotmatically.  Although this is still only speculation as to why the videos were taken down, I don't think we can know exactly if they were DMCA'd manually, or be Content ID.   Good quote, awesome movie.      Is this some sort of exercise routine?   As long as they stick to the 9:1 ratio they should be ok.   Thank's for the heads up, I unsubscribed.   Nope, donkey, three strikes and you're account gets shutdown. He probably has one or two judging from the content on his channel. You seem to be a fan so I can understand why you're upset, but please at least try to understand it from the point of view of me and all the other people he's potentially stolen from. Thank you!   At the end of the day I dont care that he stole it, more so that he didn't bother to contact me. However, I know someone who will be really butthurt when they recieve a copyright strike and their video taken down. (   ) (*tips fedora*)   Video was 30 seconds m8, worked real hard. Thanks for your understaning 3   From what i've read that dosen't matter because the essence or the "heart" of my video was contained in that 7 seconds.   http://youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html#yt-copyright-four-factors  http://publishing.wsu.edu/copyright/fair_use/ (See Amount of the Material Copied.)  The precendant for that 1% was set by  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_v._Warner_Books , but that was in conjunction with the fact that it was an educational piece.   I'd appriciate if you could come up with a source.  Edit: Not only that, but 1% of 174 seconds (the length of his video) is 1.74. seconds. My clip was 7 seconds long.   My video isn't under any Creative Common's licence, it's under the Standard YouTube Licence. You need to opt the video in for CC BY.   Edit: Not only that, but 1% of 174 seconds (the length of his video) is 1.74. seconds. My clip was 7 seconds long.   Sorry mate, but even if he is protected by fair use (and I checked US fair use laws a few times before posting this) the least he can do is send me a message telling me he put it in. Thank you for providing an opposing view though, it's always good to get both sides of an argument.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODLvFv7ZwG4 list=UUPkBs8cDAUk9K3RyS_nFiGA#t=20  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1QxSfMUujo#t=22  The only thing's I care about is this:  He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.  He's monetising my content, making a shit ton of money through my video, with zero credit.   I submitted a copyright claim, hopefully the video will be taken down and people will follow suit if they see their video being reuploaded like this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODLvFv7ZwG4 list=UUPkBs8cDAUk9K3RyS_nFiGA#t=20  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1QxSfMUujo#t=22  The only thing's I care about is this:   1. He made no attempt to contact me. He had to have downloaded and reuploaded the video, hence the shitty quality. I could have even provieded him with a clean copy through something like dropbox, but he's too big to care I guess.  2. He's monetising my content, making a shit ton of money through my video, with zero credit.   So hilarious he took a part of my video without even asking me. I would have said yes, even. It's sad to hear about poeple complaining about youtubers recieving erroneous copyright strikes when huge ones like dunkey do it so blatently.      Black ops jump bridge, was thinking of the redeemer.   They're alright at best. For example mastery level 3 on the curse dosen't even allow for T2 neuts - on a neuting recon ship. And for the redeemer at level 5 it makes absolutely no mention of JFC or Jump Portal Generation.   Mastery 3's are alright, at best. The Curse at mastery level 3 want's capacitor emmision level 3 - which dosent even allow for t2 neuts, on a primarly neuting ship.   This is not becoming of a *junior fc.*   He's just a really bad troll. Can't believe people can't see that.   Next time instead of making an back handed butthurt comment try to understand why they think it's shit. An example reply would be "What aspects of the comic do you think are shit?". Don't post your work on a public forum if you're going to get offended when someone insults it.  Edit: After reading your comments its obvious you resorted to trolling because you can't seem to process that someone might not like you're amazingly hilarious comic.   Don't why you're getting downvoted. Launcher wasn't working for me and I use the exefile to get back in instead.   What a child, can't believe he's a ceo of a 600 man corp.

There's all these things that I want to do but I can't concentrate long enough to achieve my goal. I never developed a work ethic in my childhood and wondered if you have any tips for doing so?   Where are they doing the AmA? What time? Cheers   Did the supervisor say that they should have sent out police without you giving more information?   That's what I thought.   I don't get it. Does someone actually use vagabonds versus ishtars?   In other news, the Venture has been discovered as the *only* hard counter to the Ishtar.   Did you like it?   Why 16 minutes? Why not 15, or 17?

Followup question (if im not too late), how saturated is the market where you are in terms of entry level positions?   I just read the devlog and Garry stated how he liked creating the tool for the clothes previewing and disliked not many people using it. This lead me to thinking about something lke what Valve has to implement player made gun/clothing models.   Possibly we could have something like that, something that goes through a strenuous review process then gets added to the game. Alternatively something that just allows for a server to install a limited ammount of extra textures, a la modding.   At least then the tool's he creates for the devs will reach more people (don't get me wrong though, the usage of the tools is an extension of the whole modding/community created content, not the other way round).  This is still a really open ended idea, and i'd love to hear peoples thoughts on it.   already happened, rip me, and lol at you editing out the ship names. glad to know i'm not the only one who thinks they're shit.   your ship names gave me cancer   Talking of points, seeing that pod get away made me sad inside.

Sent (not)    I thought she may be fucking me       Cheers   I think my skill queue must have been doing it automatically, because I haven't been hitting apply for the past four months that i've been playing. Either that or i'm hitting it sub conciously. Any idea where to turn on that notification? I don't remember editing any options like that.   Is this meant to cut down on supercap scamming?   I haven't been clicking on apply at all! Thanks all for the info.   It's happened about 4 or 5 times so far, i'll have finished a train, put new skills in the queue, log out and then when I log back in it will be like I never put any skills in the queue. I must have wasted a few days at least from this. Am I doing something wrong or is it just a bug? Cheers   Can you even give a rough detail? Like, for example, 5 figures? 6 figures? could you buy a private jet? a bently? an island? I appriciate of course if you want to say nothing just to be safe.   What bullshit. The one thing i've learned from 'growing up' is that the whole clique shit and the gossiping never stops, no matter how old you are or how  well respected a company you work for.   What lingo they use, how they use it, etc. I've read storys about how they could impersonate someone in their company, but where do you do the research required to sound like you are?   Not sure why people are saying this is impossible. A possible vector of attack includes, for example, impersonating someone that got something wrong. "I sent you x, but really meant to send you y. My boss has been on my ass all day, would you mind changing it really quickly for me?".   Most techniques like this require inside information into how they run things. What lingo do they use? How do they use it? Possibly you're an intern who dosen't know what they're doing.   The bottom line is, impersonate someone in their chain of command, then use empathy or fear to get them to do shit for you. If you're looking for straight up SE discussion you might be better off in /r/realsocialengineering , generally people care less about morals or why you're doing something over there.   In my opinion, having a mind that is not riddled with prejudices and pre concieved notions, one that can take any idea by itself. Think of how a child dosen't care about if people watch when he dances because he has no concept of embarresment.    Would also be nice if they had a chance to jam/not work unless maintained perfectly, or something along those lines that made them just no where near as good as end game guns right now.    I can answer your last question, mobile internet. Don't know if OP is that smart though.   *shrug*   Are you... 64?   Don't forget GEEMU... they're relevant.. right?   This is cringeworthy.   What did you bet on?   I agree. I really should have said 'Akin to this quote is...'.   And to go with that, "You wouldn't want to be the first one to deviate".   Cheers for the info   "You'll make an exception." Of course you will, because if you didn't people would stop using your subreddit because the mods remove perfectly legitimate content just because it's about themselves. Rofl.   Could I also get a pdf, please? Cheers.   casting, i assume his own twitch channel.   You can still have thick skin and not let people make a mockery of you. It's not like she was there forced.   You're going to have to remind me how naive you have to be fall for an obvious bait like that.   I'm definately leaning towards that. The inner disney child inside me is still saying it looks good, though.   The bad game videos are the funniest, too.   I can't tell if the photo looks better or worse with the filter. Just that it looks different.   Two doors, each leading down a path. My mind could not choose, neither happiness or despair. So I sat, paralyzed, unable to decide - knowing full well what I was missing.   A penis. It was a penis. I couldn't upload it to youtube without it be blurred out to high heaven.

Here's the kicker, you need to 'abstain' for three days every time before donating. That means no wanking or sex until after the six months.   I think by spam he means more so 'an influx of posts with very similar characteristics'. He's not saying they're worthless. He's not saying he doesn't enjoy them. And I would hardly call this censorship, more so organization. At the end of the day he's taking the time out of his today to help this community, if you think you can do it better perhaps you should start your own subreddit.   If I had to guess the MPAA got bored with their lawyers and just decided to pay the mods off. Seems like it would be the most effective way to get rid of a sub.  	121

          Its the arched position of the back when youre performing the back bridge that can be dangerous. This hyperextension of the back places significant compressive forces on your spine, which can in turn do damage to the discs in between your vertebrae. Over time, this stress from hyperextension can weaken your spine.   I can see where sending 3 top US govt officials to the Michael Brown funeral on the spur of the moment would have been impossible.    Remember when Sean Connery was a young man? Zardoz.    I can see where sending 3 top US govt officials to the Michael Brown funeral on the spur of the moment would have been impossible.    But the US president is so much more special than those other world leaders. We can't just be expected to make our security happen like those other third world hellholes that were in France.    None of those other world leaders have complex security to arrange. Just the US.   Rich man's burden and all that.    I don't think this method has been tried on even 500,000 people yet.    Mmmm....  That's fine dining!          Relevant user name.       They're close.   http://killingcancer.vice.com/   I'm talking about the Iranian elections. I don't know wtf you're talking about.    If you're one of the lucky govt officials or foreigners that don't have to go to the regular understaffed terrible hospitals, yes.    WebMD Robot Dr always says it's lupus.    And your dead end sums up your view.  Obama is your hero and it would be impossible for him to do anything wrong.  Back to your regularly scheduled glass dick.   I wasn't in Libya during the Arab Spring but I read lots of biased news stories about it so I'm certain I got a full understanding of what people on the ground were saying.    In your first comment you said you were in Iran during the elections.   Are you lying or do you lack the mental capacity to understand the context?   I'm gonna go with both.          Ah, you were in Iran but have an intricate knowledge of how things went down here.   OK.   Sounds to me like you are just a sycophantic devotee.    You need to take the Obama glass dick out of your mouth, son and realize that there is a real reason why his response to Egypt was so different from his Iran response.    Caveat: YOU probably wouldn't be wondering why that happened the way it did but most rational, thinking people would.   His ridiculously weak statement was basically nothing.   Source: I was here.    You may wonder why he had to come out with a real statement sooo much later that the events happened. We saw how weak and fleeting his response was compared to other world leaders and had to demand that he finally come out with a strong statement of support.   Too bad it took him until December to do so.    Uh, I hate to burst your Obama bubble but this statement was made December 28, 2009.   The protests began on June 13, 2009.  http://m.whitehouse.gov/blog/2009/12/28/president-speaks-out-iran-violence  Maybe you should learn what a Google is.    Ah, voicing support for people is interfering. OK. He came out with this statement WAY late after there was an uproar from the American people regarding his stone cold silence on the matter.    How? How did he support it in principle? I remember watching Iranians hold up signs pleading for American support only to be met with stone cold silence from the admin.  Obama sure piped up when Egypt fell into revolution though!    Remember when the Iranians rioted and marched against their govt after their fraudulent elections and didn't get any support from the Obama admin?    Why didn't they shine lasers down the side of that thing and make that fucker light up?    I'm gonna throw this out there.  You REALLY like horses, right?            Unfortunately evolution wasn't on the ballot.   No thanks.    How much water!?  Full or just some clinging to the sides?    God made the ingredients of PCP! PCP should be legal!!    What fine establishments are you frequenting?    They do take notes. Doesn't take long. Just a few key words.    Because teen angst and social proof.    http://youtu.be/pk-W_i7Z59I   Yeah, but you have to do stuff in Ohio...    Yeah, they're going to outlive you.    How do you know that's a fake dick?    Dead or in Ohio. I'm not sure which is worse.    How old are you?    Specist.    How's mom doing?    The way to handle it well would have been to immediately call the campus police.    Don't tell your kid about this. Even when she's older.    The hologram just comes out looking high as shit eating Cherry Garcia.    Well, now instead of Netflix paying more for what they profit from, the cost will be passed directly to the consumer while Netflix still profits.       Netflix only uses 33% of the total Internet bandwidth. Why should they have to pay more?    The FCC only has my best interests in mind. They just want to make sure muh Netflix stays fast.    Probably Chris Matthew's legs rubbing together when Obama comes in the room.    Station?  Tea?   Do you live in Antarctica?    Stop flushing paper towels.    Yeah, I got the same thing a while back. Very strange.       Oh Christ...    But I already got this tattoo...    So, no new applications either?  I'll just leave my resume with the receptionist.    Bush lied, people died!!!  And so did all these people... Ring a bell?  "One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line."      President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998.   "If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."      President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998.   "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face."      Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998.   "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983."      Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998   "[W]e urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."      Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998.   "Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process."      Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998.   "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies."      Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999.   "There is no doubt that . Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies."      Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, Dec, 5, 2001.   "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them."      Sen. Carl Levin (d, MI), Sept. 19, 2002.   "We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country."      Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.   "Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power."      Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002.   "We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seing and developing weapons of mass destruction."      Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002.   "The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..."      Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002.   "I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force  if necessary  to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."     Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002.   "There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years . We also should remember we have alway s underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction."      Sen. Jay Rockerfeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002,   "He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do."      Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002.   "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."      Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002   "We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction. "[W]ithout question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. And now he has continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real ...      Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003.    Thank you Mr. Nimoy, for getting that stupid dress off the front page.       They shifted blame and tried to bury the fact that no help was sent to our embassy even though they were informed of the  8 hour long firefight.    A YouTube video that 20 people saw just happened to coincide with an impromptu 8-hour rocket launcher attack on a US embassy where our Ambassador was left to get repeatedly raped in the street and burned alive?   Big deal.   Unless, of course, Bush had been president at the time.    So we're still saying that a YouTube video that 20 people saw just happened to coincide with an impromptu 8-hour rocket launcher attack on a US embassy where our Ambassador was left to get repeatedly raped in the street and burned alive?   OK.       I'll never stop staring. It's my right!    For now they just document it and file it away under "Maybe".       And false too. Just wait until the FCC starts doling out permits based on specific types of speech like they do TV networks.  Nearly impossible to start a new news network but you could've still done it on the Internet, until today.    Nigga, I ain't got time for all that!    Look at the bottom, it's black n blue. Start at the top, it's white n gold. Fucked me up until I did that.    Yeah, just a bunch of politically motivated govt bureaucrats in the FCC. The same ones that decide what can be on your radios and TV.    Right. You actually have to suck on the clit. It will vary from woman to woman.    Amen!    Jesus, I have to suffer because you couldn't wrap it up?    These militant beast-feeders are the fucking worst.    That doesn't seem like it's helping your metabolism.    Wouldn't it make you retain a ton of water and look puffy?    I'm sure no self-righteous bureaucrat would ever ban porn on a public utility. And do many other things that disagree with their particular inclination.   So you've got that going for you!    They regulate heroin and child rape too!   Why can't I fuck my wife in front of your playground? What kind of bullshit is that?    I'll tell my kid to bide his time for the perfect sucker punch and then stand by him no matter what.    Well, womens womens woobs aren't regulated by the govt. So feel free to murder as many fetuses as you feel is necessary!    You're going to have to help me out with woobs here.    Don't worry! Your govt only wants the best for you! Now, if they could just find and arrest that Snowden character who put those thoughts in your head...    Such as what?    This isn't going to speed your Internet up if anything your speed will get slowed to even out with everyone else's speed. Boom! Equality!    Don't worry!  The Patriot Act will never be used to target citizens!    Give me freedom or give me Netflix!    Admit it. You gave away a free Internet for fast Netflix.    Don't worry! We only want to use the Patriot Act to get them terrorists!    Netflix was using 33% of the bandwidth of the entire Internet. Of course they didn't want to have to pay for all that.    You don't actually think that handing control of the internet over to the people that monitor your every communication and impose their own morality upon citizens will make it better...  do you?   You realize that it's not always going to be Obama at the reigns of the FCC but the GOP sometime in the future... right?   And before you say it doesn't do that I remind you 1. Nobody's read the bill. 2. The FCC Chair refused to testify about the contents of the bill in front of Congress and 3. Once a govt starts regulating something it only adds more regulations as time goes by without ever reducing regulations.    You don't actually think that handing control of the internet over to the people that monitor your every communication and impose their own morality upon citizens will make it better...  do you?

Don't worry! We only want to use the Patriot Act to get them terrorists!             Don't worry! We only want to use the Patriot Act to get them terrorists!    Riiiiight. You do realize that your favorite party will not always be the ones holding the reigns of power, right?   You traded your free Internet for Netflix to not have to pay for the 33% of bandwidth they are using.    Riiiiight. You do realize that your favorite party will not always be the ones holding the reigns of power, right?    Three cheers for the sickeningly stupid that think that handing control of the internet over to the people that monitor their every communication and impose their own morality upon citizens will make it better!

He would have went higher than 17th if people bought the hype.  Jammer went 5th.                                Figured as much.   They're more likely into the birdfood Whole Foods sells, so they're more likely to be bird brains.  There's some starvation-efficiency modus operandi going on, I'm guessing.  I drove a Prius for a while.  It's a well-made li'l shitbox.  All those backlight center screen cars are annoyingly shit.  An invite to distracted driving.  Even in the newer BMWs and Hondas they are shit.    Patton just sucks.  Seinfeld is toothless as shit.      In their defense, only 7 of them are shitty.  And they almost won a World Series.   Fans are.  I think they made fans across the country who like underdogs.   Lots of fans do.  Companies handing out endorsement deals do.   And then no one will vote.   Brady is fighting for his legacy and a potential lifetime of endorsements.  Joe Montana shit.   Duh and nice detailed criticism.   I hope the Roger shows some consistency and completely fucks this up.   Or democracy.  This is from the bottom up.    A game on national TV that will get pretty high ratings and possibly make history.  This is definitely worth it for the team.

Jameer Nelson would walk in himself to that place.   It's from the New Yorker.  Euthanasia is a legitimate solution to deep depression.   I was looking up Jameer Nelson from another thread in here.

 I looked through the old request threads and all previous links are dead.   Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!    Can we please get a PS4 bundle that doesn't just include last gen games? Argh.    Hey all, we've passed the midpoint of NaNoWriMo. Everyone should be tracking to 31K words to keep to the 1,667 words per day average count. If not, no worries, just keep writing!     But on Hannibal you expect that sort of violence due to the show's characters and stories and themes. Whereas here it's definitely unexpected.    I thought Grant was finally validated in his life long belief that his brother ruined his life by claiming that Grant did that to their other brother, which then led to a series of other misfortune events that landed him in juvie and eventually with Hydra in the first place. I think he genuinely still cares for his SHIELD mates, at least Skye for any matter, and secretly hates the Hydra part of himself. But it's so engrained into his identity and who he is, that he can't detach himself from it. So that was the ultimate moment for Ward - to finally get his brother to acknowledge that he was ultimately the "cause" for all of Ward's problems/current state in his life.    I really thought they were going to go for a Titanic-esque scene with the car window. Such a missed opportunity.     For real.   Though, I think Marvel just needs to make their movies a little longer to accommodate for villain character development time.     I think the reveal of Whitehall and Skye's father's back story was the best. Definitely lends some sympathy to the character of Skye's father.    I like all the tie in's and references to the MCU. Fury, Tesseract, Red Skull, Agent Carter, Howling Commandos, etc.    Agreed, I can't believe they straight up showed Whitehall dissecting Skye's mom. :/    Wonder if they are already in cahoots.    She has such an awesome name. But I just refer to her as Sierra.    I really really thought Ward was going push his brother down that well when they were hugging it out.    Could be Bobbi or Simmons. Especially with that brainwashing comment from earlier in the ep. And then the trust comments at the end of the ep between Hunter and Bobbi.    Needs to be more integral to the plot. Like Fury will be like "yada yada, we'll need the Director of SHIELD for this." and everyone will be like "but isn't that you?"   /cut to reveal of Coulson, "did you guys miss me?"    Wonder if it's possible Simmons or Bobbi did actually get brainwashed by Hydra and has been leaking intel to Hydra... Hydra did know they were coming after all.   That brainwashing comment they made earlier in the ep makes me suspicious.    Dafaq... Grant and his brothers argument and then subsequent reconciliation just makes them both seem ridiculously pathological.   Also, I cant tell if Ward actually killed his brother or not. Either way he's ridiculously good at this bad guy thing.    *Shes not here is she? Phew, thats a relief. You only get one chance to make a first impression.*  *The end justifies the means.*   Yikes. Poor Skye - you really dont get choose your family. Though at least they've finally explained the back story here so he doesn't seem like a complete psychopath.     *"Am I good with this in my pocket?"*  *"That depends - do you ever want to have kids?"*     And I thought there was going to be some big reveal where Skyes father eventually finds out the gnarly stuff that Whitehall did to Skyes mother and then kill him off for us in a fit of rage. Guess he already knew. Oof... this is going to get bloody.    Awww Skyes real papa and adopted papa getting territorial. So cute.     *"He could always see five steps ahead, which was impressive for a one-eyed man."*  I love how Coulson inspires to be a better director by studying Fury. I really hope he reprises his role in one of the future MCU movies. I would love to see the look on all the Avengers faces.     *We get closer. You get scared.*  *Will you never trust me?"*   *"No, but Ill never stop wanting to.*  /cue angry sex. Don't ever change Bobbi and Hunter.     Oh hello Sierra - I was wondering when some Whedon favorites would start showing up.    Happy cheerful cute whimsical games please... I just did a 60+ hour work week dealing with all sorts of stressful shit and difficult people...   Also, a baked potato.    I'll be there. With some food.    I think Black Widow would kick his butt too. She's probably picked up a few things hanging out/fighting with the Avengers/superhero crowd too.    10/10 would watch    Maybe he was going for the so gaudy and flashy no way it's a secret agent in disguise    I think they can lay some groundwork there.   Though what I'm really hoping for is: AoS - Inhumans - Kree - GoG - Starlord guest stars on an ep of AoS... lol.    If this is actually true, this sounds amazing.    That rolled right off her tongue.    I think it's great that they're integrating more with the overall MCU. Nothing wrong with fleshing out some back story.    I just want Skye to gain her Inhuman powers and be awesome.    Would love to see a showdown between the two on the big screen.    I think he'll go after his brother, but I don't think it'll lead to any redemption. His brother will probably just be revealed to be an even bigger cunt than Ward, just as he suggested to Coulson.    Please can this happen?    RIP Beardy McTraitoson   ...coming soon to a small screen near you: Fratricide McTraitorson.     *"Corpsey Diem. Seize the dead"*  So nice to see the Fitz we all know and love back for a moment.   Ughh... that one lady died from the shock from the carving. That's a terrible way to go.     Oh Mack way to be unintentionally racist against Skye. :/ Wonder if the team will eventually be driven apart after Skye's reveal or possibly events of Civil War down the road.     Man, Coulson going off the deep end is scary as SHIT (and bad ass). Too bad it only lasted about 5 minutes.     *Subtlety is the key*   *You were wearing a cowboy hat!*   Please keep this Bobbi and Hunter banter up. I need more.    Nooooooo RIP Beardy McTraitoson   Oh Mack way to be unintentionally racist against Skye.    Subtlety is the key...   You were dressed liked a cowboy!!    Holy shit Coulson goes off the deep end.   Ughh... she died from shock from the carving. That's a terrible way to go.    I don't think the Straw Valley Cafe exists as the eclectic and awesome hang out it used to be anymore. They've overhauled it into an upscale-ish restaurant (with a "cafe and wine bar") from what I hear.    SUCH a good episode! Please have Gina and Boyle find out midseason about their parents (only after some more build up and sneaking around).    Hey! Thanks for doing this! I have a few very basic questions. I'm trying to learn how to use Unity and some general programming overall. I've taken a very basic Java   C++ class before and I used to do some stuff in Ruby for RPG maker, so I have some rudimentary programming skills, but have a lot to learn.   I'm trying to make a simple text /interactive fiction game which ideally I would want to look something like Twine (http://twinery.org/), but wrapped in some sort of GUI with point/click ability and background graphics.   Just want some pointers on where to start/begin researching with something like this? I'd like to start with creating something like this maybe (except without the need for the room based map):  http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/tidy-text-adventures-editor-tool-for-creating-text-based-adventure-games.164625/   I've never done anything like this and would just like a few pointers on where to begin. I'm not asking for an in depth tutorial or anything like that, just something like "you should read about x   y (ie parsing, etc) and how it ties into z (creating GUI, etc)".   Thanks!     Yup - glad to know my parents are the only ones who do this.   When I was slightly overweight (on Asian standards mind you which meant I was like +5-10 lbs from my "ideal" weight = "holy shit you're so fat how are you ever going to get married" all the time.   Then I went backpacking in Europe for a month and lost about 5-10 lbs = next time my parents saw me "holy shit we think you have a wasting disease you should go to the hospital to get that checked out".   You literally cannot win.     I'm a little behind too... just shy of 6K right now. Boss is visiting from out of town so my evenings are being taken up with work related events.   I'm writing a collection of short stories this year for NaNo though so I haven't stalled out due to anything plot related yet. Woot.    How's everyone's NaNo going? Remember to achieve the 50,000 words by the end of the month, you need to write an average of 1,667 words a day!   If you're looking for extra motivation or a writing buddy, try hitting up one of your local NaNo events.    WTF is wrong with these companies? Who's actually going to go shopping on Thanksgiving Day?    Sigh... I have both GTA V and TLOU for PS3. Come on Black Friday ads, there must be a better deal.    Just realized I didn't actually RSVP. I'll be there.    Second this. I do 425 (convection - use 450 for normal bake) for 12-15 minutes. Comes out perfect every time.    Looks hilarious.    They act like it and also just referring to the one undercover episode. They made a hilarious married couple.    Nooo.... but Keanu!   He thinks he could somehow "win" his way back to the team. That or Skye's father is offering some serious rewards for getting Skye back to him.    It was so bittersweet when she walked in on him and Mac's bro moment too.    Or zip ties or duck tape even. Lot harder to get out of than loose handcuffs.    Dude he is such a deluded fuck. I loved how Coulson just handed his ass to him.   You betrayed every single one of us. The only reason youre still alive is because you were of use.    I thought he was going to somehow play enough mind game on Skye and she was going to help him get out to find her father. This did seem like a cop out way for him to get out though.    Thor almost shat his pants.    Coulson does NOT approve of the Grumpy Cat mug. LOL.    Man, englishman can get away with such ridiculous dialogue: *That face is so dour.*   No American could say that in RL.    Peter! Stop being such a dick to SHIELD/morally ambiguous character, you probably need to go chase after Neal Caffrey instead.    Ok that fight between May and that dude was pretty good. However silly that chain knife thing was, it made for a pretty cool fight scene.    *You betrayed every single one of us. The only reason youre still alive is because you were of use.*  So. Cold. But Ward is a deluded **fuck**. Im glad theyre committed to going down this evil!Ward path.    Also, Coulson referred to Fitz and Simmons as FitzSimmons!     Were really digging into this weekly Married Misadventures of Agents of SHIELD.   First May   Coulson now Lance   Bobbi.   Love it. Keep the jabs coming.    *This poor sap is believing every word shes saying. She always makes them feel so special*  Aww Lance and you gave her your nanas pearl earrings. Then she broke your heart. Aww, poor baby.     *So youve been telling everyone Im a hell beast.*  *No no I dont believe I used those exact words.*   I officially love Lance and Bobbi:   *This is you peacocking.*   *Who uses the word peacocking?"*    *You just love the sound of your own voice.*    It seems like there was a lot of groundwork laid in this episode for what Im presuming is going to be Superhuman Registration and Civil War.    Also it was hilarious when Tony and Rhodey were both trying to lift it.    That he did.    Beginning of that trailer SO hilarious.    Peter! Stop being a dick to SHIELD, you probably need to go chase after Neal Caffrey.    Wait ex-wife? I missed something!!    Will be there at 3. I'm about to leave the house now.    Update: might be running a wee bit late due to some work stuff. Shouldn't be more than 30-45 minutes at most. (fingers crossed)    In lieu of the normal 52 Week Writing Challenge, I will be taking this week to prep for NaNoWriMo which starts next week. For the month of November, we will take a short break from normal format and track 50K words for NaNoWriMo. Happy writings everyone!    Thanks. It will be eventually. :/    I'll be there. I'll bring **Mansions of Madness**. It's been languishing since I got it (almost) 4 years ago, hopefully you guys will want to give it a twirl.  /u/r2d8 getinfo   I'll be there. I'll figure out some fall themed food to bring and will update this post then.    The rain and gloom here as really helped with the writing atmosphere. Nothing better to do at night than to buckle down and crank out the pages.   As usual please use this thread for updates and posting your snippets. Don't worry if you fall behind or miss a week, just keep on pace with the current week. As always, any discussion or feedback is encouraged but not required! If you are just joining the community never fear, just start with the current week's number of words. Each new week will start on Tuesdays.   Also how was she NOT completely suspicious when Coulson started "reminiscing" about the past just as they're about to walk into the hotel room?    Me too. Loved his reaction at the end too.  *"I did what now?"*  *"I mean a painting Coulson? And you weren't immediately suspicious it wasn't me?"*   It's those Asian genes I'm telling you: http://i.imgur.com/SeHM7.jpg   Me too. Loved his reaction at the end too.   *"I did what now?"*  *"I mean a painting Coulson? And you weren't immediately suspicious it wasn't me?"*   Or rather, a molestache.    Also Hyrda needs to teach their agents how to properly restrain downed SHEILD agents. Especially the Cavalry.    *Inter-human relations are hard. I was a human and she was a demonic hell beast.*  Lance's ex is really intriguing me. All the delicious hints they keep dropping!     *I spent 5 months in an enemy camp, you people make me miss those times.*    Talbots starting to grow on me.    Best description of Beardy McTraitorson yet:   At least your ex isnt the psycho living in our basement.       I cant believe Im the only one seeing this right now.    I LOLed so hard at Coulsons wire evading pose. Its too bad May ruined it.    What is THAT?   Thats May laughing I think the worst of it is almost over.    I would pay $500 for a pair of flats right now.   My face hurts.   Were modern.   Plus all of her little digs at Coulson when they were undercover.   Man, this episode was pure May gold.    Can we pleeease have a web series spin off called the Married Mis-adventures of May and Coulson detailing all of their undercover operations?    Ming-Na Wen is looking *damn* fine for a 50 year old lady.    Probably will be an hour late but might not make it either tbh. Sorry to be flaky... got some personal stuff going on right now.    I feel like they're setting up Brandon Routh's character as her new love interest... I just don't know how I feel about that. RIP Olicity :(    Fitz was kind of scary in that scene. I had almost wished they just showed Fitz passively watching Ward suffocate for a bit longer and then "allowing" him to live.    Only if Coulson yells "You're Fired!" to a Hydra agent hanging off a missile that he fires into an unfinished skyscraper.    Haha very plausible timeline.   Also, sometime between the events of True Lies and Agents of Shield Harry Tasker trains a young Phil Coulson in the art of tango.    I've been in the van for 15 years, Harry.    I'm really excited to see Simmons infiltrating the inner sanctum of Hydra in the coming weeks. Looking forward to her possible interactions with Agent 33 as well. I'm sure she's going to work on a way to combat the brainwashing/compliance for both Agent 33 and herself. I'm sure her cover is going to get blown eventually and they're going to try and brainwash her except at that point she'll already have developed a way to fight it.   That or we're going to get a couple of episodes of some really awesome EvilMadScientist!Simmons.    "Everything I did, I did of my own free will." Evil!Ward forever!    Also yay we're advancing the Skye's father plot line! Too bad that's totally how Ward's gonna get free. Mark my words, Syke's gonna decide that breaking him out is a good idea.    Ha, after all the speculation last week, turns out Fitz knew he was hallucinating Simmons the entire time.    Psst Whedons... we like this burgeoning MacFitz bromance. Please don't kill or do something otherwise horrible to Mac.    That confrontation between Fitz and Ward was so powerful and absolutely heartbreaking. It's tragic to think of the consequences that Ward's betrayal has had on the team. Gone is the gentle and innocent boy scientist - replaced instead by this broken bitter man. Iain De Caestecker absolutely killed it in that scene - just the right amount of hyperventilation, fear, and barely restrained anger.   Also, Ward is a manipulative shitbag. "It's good to see you Fitz?" Evil!Ward forever.    LOL May and Coulson going undercover next week looks absolutely hilarious. Like straight up True Lies style.    Wow didn't realize Fitz knew Simmons wasn't really there the entire time. That was fast. Also, the confrontation between Ward and Fitz happened waaaay earlier than I thought it would.    Boooo Simmons is actually still working for Shield. I wanted a giant story twist!    I'm surprised Hydra lets Simmons live out in the real world. I feel like you should keep all of your top scientists on lock down... for their own safeties' sake you know.    Rate my thread a 1, rate James' a 10... how is that not rude?

 ctrl + f ghost in the shell, wasn't disappointed    why are they shouting at admiral ackbar from star wars?    a few days ago my cat was pawing at my stream of urine. it was the funniest thing in the world. i couldn't stop peeing and he just kept swatting my pee. so there's an idea for a comic. if you make it i'd love to see it   from a /mu/ thread, i want to listen to later  glass handed kites broken social scene childish gambino - culdesac man of aran - british sea power ken - by request only joy division - unknown pleasures alice in chains - facelift slaraffenland-private cinema Titus Andronicus - The Monitor hundred waters monk solo - it might be the sun mount eerie - the microphones   i can't pronounce the letter R...   how can batman be dangerous if he doesn't kill anyone? why do criminals fear him when they know he doesn't kill anyone?    waking up in a drunk tank surrounded by a bunch of natives and not knowing why i'm there.

"i'm trying to save you a bullet" lol   i asked my dad for a zip (an ounce of weed). then said that a zip is slang for a full tank of gas.    trip wrong? there's no wrong way to trip. providing a nice setting is a good idea but it's not wrong if you don't do that. think of a trip as a trip. you're going someplace new on an adventure, but you get stuck in traffic. could you have avoided the traffic? no because you're someplace new   at least the one in front looks like it has limbs. what is the bunny equivalent of arms called?   liar   do you have steam? i'll gift you a game   i did it once. it was good   damnit i forgot that my audio stopped working. does anyone know how to fix audio on a laptop?   i don't know anything about computers. how do i do that? thank you      i sprayed warhead sour spray on all the food in my highschool's cafeteria.   he dead? nooo   whenever i drive with my gay friend i have him yell "faggot" at people in his gayest voice. it's hilarious    i like how he managed to get his longboard in every shot. i'm that that wasn't planned    asians are horrible people   thanks. are you a cop, lawyer, or have heard of a similar story? it was weed and ecstasy by the way   a friend forgot a backpack in another friend's car. that friend consented to a search of the car because he didn't know the backpack was there. just some weed and ecstasy    at least they weren't black   why didn't you just surround the place with treadmills?   girls think my stutter is cute   what is SC GOP? and where do i sign up?   damnit man i had a boner   it was basketball but with trampolines and pads. that was the shit. what's it called?      you sound exactly like i do   will your show get better? i gave it a shot, should i stick with it?   i loaned a "friend" 700 dollars, how do i prove that money exchanged hands? i have no proof   thank you   so where is mercer island?   i'm looking for a longterm solution though. that helps for a few minutes..   i'm kinda pissed that doctors are taking pictures of him instead of helping hm   how many MCG's of vitamin B do you take a day?   how many MCG's of B12 do you take a day?   thanks a lot. so that's all i need to know?      what is the name of that first song? and the other songs too?   you... you funny   i just bought some and cleaned the fuck out of my room :)   alright thanks i'll look into vitamin D and fish oil      i hate you   lol this woman is retarded lol   	72
 Really awful tattoos.    McDonalds because that shits gross. + basically any fast food burger place.   No prob.   5/10    I've been tracking my drinking habits in Excel since 06 April.  My average daily consumption is 4.8.  My Max consumption in one day is 14 drinks.  A side note: according to my fitbit, which records my average calories burned, I consume ~4,300 calories a day, which is more than twice the human average.  There you go.   It's comforting to know that as a sociology major with bad grammar she'll be unemployable if/when she graduates.   That's so true. People try so hard not to offend. And this obese culture has turned 'being fat' into something that's offensive to talk about, when really, we should be talking about this issue openly in society. It's not like they're even a minority, they're taking over, we need to fight back.   I don't "hate" god. I hate that ignorant people chose to do in the name of god.   This. Looks. DISGUSTING.    You're welcome!   But what if she's on top? And I'm handcuffed?     8.5/10  You look tall and you're pretty.  I love your smile.  If I were to guess ethnicity I'd say Vietnam/Chinese mix.  I've spent a good amount of time in Asia/South East Asia but I'm no expert.  Have you considered one of those spit based DNA services; like ancestry or 23andme?   You're definitely pretty. You have a good bone structure, your face is symmetrical and you look thin/fit.  8.5/10 - would totally smash.   6.5/ Cute.     9/10.  You're sexy and pretty.     Don't forget about taxes!   Yea, it's hard to cheat up from a 10.  I just saw that arm hair and was like, Whoa, I knew we had the right to bear arms but this guy took it too literally.     Hi. Full disclosure, I've not been overweight for about 20 yrs now, but I do have a solid command over my body weight and composition.  Over the past 7 years I've had 35lbs worth of weight fluctuation while maintaining a body fat of 10%.   I see diet and exercise discussed a lot on this/related subs, but there is a powerful tool that is not often discussed here. I'm talking about the mental/psychological/spiritual aspect of controlling your body. I've been regularly meditating for over half my life now. Along these lines, fasting has been used as a tool to reach a higher plain of consciousness for millennia. The key here is to understand that your body and your consciousness (soul to some people) are completely separate. Once you begin to deny your body, in controlled periods, this becomes more apparent. I fast for spiritual reasons, and also I'm very active and eat well, but there is that added benefit of running a controlled drastic calorie defect - you shed fat quickly.  Other benefits of sharpening this tool include avoiding that 3 week on/off cycle of self control.   Note; techniques like this aren't for everyone and meditation, I've been told, is hard for people to just jump into. But if you're interested in hearing more, feel free to message me or comment back.     You look much bigger in one of those pictures.  Also the lip rings aren't doing you any favors.  Almost a 5.  (4.5/10)   You're beautiful. 8.5/10   A lot of times people cheat because they're insecure.   [edit] I'd be insecure if I was so hairy.   10/10 - you're also exactly my physical type.  Tall, beautiful, fit blonde.   That's brilliant.   That's the tiny minority; it's the tail of the distribution.  The huge majority of fat people are fat because they're addicted to sugar and are totally ignorant about nutrition in general. Sure, it's not fair that food companies are allowed to put sugar in everything we eat and aggressively market their drug to children, but the most powerful way to change what corporations put on the shelves is to change societies demands. If society is bullied into believing that things like HAES is legitimate, there is less incentive to act responsibly as consumers.   As a young person, this is a very real problem that your generation will one day have to face. Today I saw a morbidly obese ~10 year old in the supermarket.  Her mother had a cart full of sugary cereal, ice cream, and soda (or as referred to on this site, a cart full of genetics). She was born into that environment. This problem has deep roots. I'd love to hear any constructive ideas on how this problem can be solved, but right now, what you're witnessing with FPH backlash, is a pushback against the censorship of something that should not be taboo to discuss openly in society.   And just to bring home the gravity of this epidemic;  some people are fat because of diseases     The word 'obesity' has literally been changed to a disease according to modern medicine.  Some some people have a disease because they're diseased.   True. I feel like it's rude and shallow not to eat bc it's weird looking. I mean, it's not like your looking at it while you're eating. And I'm a big fan of the finger test before I go down there. Vegans taste better.     6.5   6/10.  You're pretty but at 22 you should not be so heavy. I bet you know your way around a potato.     8.5/10 - You look a bit more mature than 18.  Personally, I'm a fan of natural.  If you're a brunette, be a brunette, because you can *try* to look blonde, but you'll never really be blonde.   Weird looking vagina's are a huge factor in attractiveness.     I don't think it's "funny" to hate people because they're ~~big~~ **fat**.  I think it's necessary to have an outlet to pushback against "fat acceptance," which is really just a phrase describing fat bullies forcing society to accept their irresponsible, gluttonous, and destructive lifestyle.  It's nice to sit here and say, "oh, everyone's beautiful and healthy and a product of genetics" but the stark reality is that if we continue on our current fat path, society is doomed.   Bars are where insecure "Alpha males" go to mate.  If your not there to fuck   fight than it's not a real bar.   Acting stupid/childish.   I've never asked but I'll let you know. [edit] No, it won't.   True.  Personally, I live in a city and bike mostly everywhere so it's not a huge sacrifice to give up an auto.  The problems I'm seeing are in deep rural areas where there might not even be strong enough grid support for charging stations.  On the bright side; the way technology is progressing, I think I'll see the fix in my life time.   	34
 Too bad. This is over. Next year Rafa.    Nice Matrix reference.   I would agree with you, but he isn't the same Rafa today.    Then tell that to the other thread. Get out of here. We don't care about Murray here.   So McEnroe is saying Nadal is making him sick to his stomach, or the Ump is making McEnroe sick to his stomach?   Why did he say that? I'm not watching the game, I'm at work.   For sure. But looks like he is going to get demolished today.  EDIT: WOW what a turnaround by Raffa.      I feel violated.    Abandoned in a jungle with monkey shit all over him.  Best comment on this thread by far   JUST DO IT    Director: Deaf Bodybuilders  I honestly laughed out loud at that.   'Too', not 'to'.   Grammar motherfucker.   JUST DO IT   You should post this on /r/interstellar maybe   Nice username   See you on the other side slick!   I like the idea of returning a String. Good call!        if (fizzbuzz == "") fizzbuzz += i;  Wouldn't you want to do something like       if (fizzbuzz.equals("")) fizzbuzz += i;  instead?   Djokovic and Nadal have played 43 times to date; Nadal leads 2320. **In Grand Slams, Nadal leads 93, in Grand Slams finals Nadal leads 43. In best-of-five matches, Nadal leads 103.** In finals, Djokovic leads 1210.   I have a solution [here](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3ad82de8f0627732acb5) (also didn't know I could make anonymous gists if I am not logged into github).  Am I missing something, or is this probably the best most simplest way to implement the solution?   Anyone have a better solution?   I'll be honest, I don't even know what COBOL is, or what exactly it's used for. I just know it's old, and only old people know it, and it's still used to some degree.   New users on godaddy.com can get domains for under $2. I bought a domain for fun for $1.87 I think.   I am wondering though - what if the supply of COBOL developers becomes so low, that companies invest out of using COBOL. Possible?   I'm not sure. I think someone who actually knows how to code, so they can do Javascript (**and** be able to do fizzbuzz), html, css etc - I think so.   Thanks Obama   We will see a bubble in the webdev sector. Although legitimate developers will be OK, all these 'front end developers' who learn to code in three months - will not be in demand. There will be too many of these types of people. Salaries won't keep exploding. I think they are close to peak. CS is becoming more and more of a popular degree. The difficulty of finding a 'good developer' will diminish over time.   Absolutely. What happens when all these 50 year old COBOL deveoplers retire?   Ha you put into words what I was thinking. "Overzealous designer" makes a lot of sense. I can picture it quite clearly.    git is some stripped down version of github.  Lol does that actually happen? That's so bad it's kind of funny.  Anyway I started going through Atlassian's tutorial on git, and it is quite good.   Go to any sports website, and you will see a big picture with a short title showing who won the most recent matchup. Example -  NHL.com - If you went there after Saturday's game, you would see a picture of a Blackhawks player, and a title that says, "Hawks storm their way to a 3rd Stanley Cup playoff"  Or something like that. I shouldn't have to scroll or look for scores. It should be obvious.   I hear. I guess I like using multiple devices and having remote storage. Setting that up myself sounds painful.   I mean for a second it looks cool - but practically speaking, to get the information I want - it's painful. Without scrolling I should be able to see what matches completed today **and** what the results are.   To be clear, I am specifically talking about the desktop. I haven't tried out mobile.      I think people forget that Djokavic has off games. Everyone here seems to think Djokavic will be in top form - not a certainty. Remember last FO final? Djokavic did not play so well. Could easily happen again.   Definitely mentally weaker - and that was one of his biggest strengths. But straight sets? Hard to imagine.    If you want to keep your code private and secure, use Bitbucket.  Am I missing something? Public code I would show to future employers I put on Github. But that side project I wouldn't want anyone to steal (and I might make money off of it one day) I host on bitbucket. It's *private*.    I just want to see the most simplest thing, like seeing on the front of the page "Nadal beats Sock in 4 sets". Instead I have to scroll around and find the right link. I find the website layout to be horrendous. It feels like a young web developer made it with cool new features, but forgot the absolute basics.    I know programming make a crap ton, but we are actually worth more than a crap ton in this current climate.  I hear that. It's just kind of funny.   Why is this in /r/athiesm? No really, I'm confused.   I have a good friend of mine who just finished residency. I think he's 30. And he is going to do a fellowship or something like that. That $200k-$400k salary takes a while to get. But ya, once you are 40 years old your debt will probably be gone for the most part and you'll be making bank.   You forgot to mention that final will probably be Federer. He will have to beat Djok, Murray, then Federer to win the Open   An extra 4 years of school, then 3 years of 70 hour weeks in residency? Enormous debt? Long term its good, but not until you are 35   Any thoughts on HERE maps?   I have a college account with unlimited and a regular gmail account. Anyway to apply that unlimited to my regular account? I graduated and not really interested in using my college account   In a conservative who voted against Biden, but your comment is ridicously offensive, ignorant, stupid, and in poor timing.  Bush and Iraq? The previous administration didn't get anyone killed? His son just died for crying out loud. Say something nice, or shut up.   Lol - people that park this way. No gender/race is immune to this behavior.   Or maybe people should learn proper parking etiquette. This is a 'blame the victim' argument.   Haha yea. And I am annoyed with the "chill the fuck out" comments. I wasn't freaking out about this. I actually have an example of an even bigger parking etiquette fail, 2x Cara behind this pickup.  Oh, and the pickup is still there   It's probably the same entitled selfish jerks who claim dibs in the winter. Basically, inconsiderate people who don't really care when their actions inconvenience others.    Software engineers are underpaid in the bay area  Lol. Really? Are you sure?    No unions at all, and none in the foreseeable future. Our skill sets alone allow us to make high demands. We get paid well, great benefits, good job security. Why the hell do I need to pay union bosses to negotiate my salary? Screw that.   Didn't say it's legal. It's just not enforced. Basically never. I saw someone get a ticket for parking too close to the sidewalk - but his rear end was about 1 foot from the sidewalk.   That is true in many cases, but not this one. There was no car that was in the 4 foot spot in front of this pickup. Nor any of the other dozen times I see this happen    It solves your problem by finding parking  First off, these types of apps already exist, and aren't terribly successful. The adoption rate is quite low, and would be a waste of my time unless I really felt like sitting down and making a beautiful app - which I don't.  You think anyone in my area has spare parking spots? Anyone with a garage uses it. The problem is not communication. It's supply. There is a nursing home nearby I can park at, but it's not so close.   I wasn't posting this to get irrelevant advice.    That's nice but do you think I'd be complaining if I own property?   Thanks for the very obvious and irrelevant information.  How will my app prevent users from parking like assholes? How does that solve my problem?  Why are you telling me to do something that you are too lazy or too stupid to do yourself?   Are you brain-dead? Homeowners and business **own their parking space**. *Street parking belongs to the city*.   *You cannot rent out something that does not belong to you*.   "Hack an app"  Is this how people really talk nowadays? It's strange people interchange the word "code/program" with "hack".   That doesn't make sense anyway because you can't rent out something you don't own.   You can be pregnant **and** have a baby in your hand... they are not mutually exclusive...  Ah, unless you are making a funny. Good one sir.   "Losing my mind"  I didn't know making a Reddit post qualifies as losing my mind, but OK.  I get pissed when people are inconsiderate and lazy, and negatively impacts other people.    I am the ultimate dibs hater. **Dibs are evil.** My wife isn't entitled to anything. It's just infuriating when a spot is wasted, when it didn't have to be that way.   Don't assume. Dibs are evil.    Interesting, but not around these parts. I've parked with my nose 5-6 inches beyond the pole - overnight - dozens of times. I see cars all the way up to the pole, including large ones. Parking 20 ft within a sidewalk might be the law, but it is not enforced. And in this neighborhood, no one parks farther than 5 feet away from the sidewalk.   I am saying this is not the case. Trust me. And this happens ALL the time. I've seen these people park like this, without any obstacle preventing them parking like a normal person.    Maybe move to a neighborhood where you fell more comfortable walking around?  Yea that's the answer. Move.  Thanks dude. I'm calling my realtor now  /s   West Rogers Park   I'm not freaking out. Not slashing tires. Not fighting with people. Just asking people not to park this way. It wastes valuable street parking space.  Is that a problem?   Who says I'm in the car? When I'm at work my wife uses the car, baby in hand.   SFH? It's a part of West Rogers Park that has 4 apartment buildings within a short block of each other. This intersection has 2 apartment buildings. I sometimes have to find parking very far away - and when my wife comes home at night, I have to go downstairs and park the car for her - so she doesn't walk so far at night by herself.   Seriously I'm posting a pic on Reddit. Not keying the car or slashing tires. I'm not freaking out. It's just annoying. It would be nice if we parked more efficiently.   I'm telling you, if he moved up all the way, we'd be able to park 4 cars here. Instead, we can only park three. Maybe I should submit a picture of that also.   I'm 27.  I didn't leave a note yet. I'd like too though.   Half a car length makes the difference, especially when you are already taking up so much space because you are a pickup truck.  And yes it is a no parking sign, pointing in front of the pole.   Of course it's open. That's the middle of the day. Come back at night time and there is no where to park, and this ass is still here.   It's the middle of the day. There is always parking then. It's night time that's the problem.    For the record, my street does not have ample parking at night due to apartments. This strip has enough round to fit 4 cars, even if 1-2 of the cars are longer than normal. This is provided some asshole like this doesn't take up an extra 3 feet. my wife is pregnant and this spot is right in front of my apartment. It's really infuriating when she or I have to park really far away when there could have been a spot at our front door.   EDIT   EDIT   Nope. I see this all the time in the same spot. People are just inconsiderate idiots.   That's your comparison? A sport where the swinger misses often? Shanks are normal? You need to be able to hit the ball *every time* in tennis. There is no reason to 'guess' where the ball is going. You have a significantly longer reaction time allowed in tennis than in cricket.   If you are looking away from the ball in the last moment, after you are halfway through your *forward swing*, you will probably be ok.   You've used two completely different sports to make a comparison to tennis anyway. And check the attitude if you are going to respond. This isn't /r/politics.       When people respond to the AskReddit question underneath someone's comment, instead of as a new comment. Karma piggybacking motherfuckers.    your brain already knows exactly where that ball is going to end up.  No - your brain knows the *area* it will end up. If you want to hit the ball in the sweetspot, and not shank it, you need to watch the ball until it comes very close to you.  Btw, that wasn't a story.   And that is only the number caught *and* expelled. I had Chinese students in my Humanities class who blatantly plagiarized their paper. They got an F for the assignment, but were not expelled.   If g-d created a tree yesterday, how old is that tree?   If you say one day, you would be correct. But you might also say 5 years, since it takes that long for the tree to appear that way (5 years is arbitrary, but obviously a tree cannot be 1 day old- it had to grow first).  That's how I think of it.  Also I'm not sure when arguing with creationists, we use carbon dating as an example. A much better proof of the age of the universe is to look at the stars. Billions of light years away. If they were 6000 years old - we wouldn't be able to see them.   I'd hardly call keeping national parks open comparable to hurricane relief. The worst part of the sequester was the congestion at airports due to less air traffic controllers. That is still not comparable to disaster relief - and was avoidable even with the sequester.   And I think you are mixing up things anyway. Shutting down the government due to a disagreement of budgeting - that's not pork. That's what a budget is. "Make these spending cuts, or we won't agree on a budget". Very related.   If Republicans made a demand that is *not* related to the budget/spending, then that would be similar. Still, does not compare to relief funds or other kind of emergency funding.    I don't think there is that big a difference, it's just that one is more distasteful than the other because there is human suffering involved. Other than that, it's all the same.  That's a big fucking difference. One bill - "We need to pass it TODAY. PEOPLE NEED THIS BILL TODAY" vs. "We can pass this bill today, tomorrow, next week, or next month - it's not a big deal".  Not to mention when you need both democrats and republicans to vote for a bill, it *has* to have something that both sides want in order for it to pass.  Relief bills are non-partisan, no brainer, non-political bills that should **never** have pork in them.    A 5 dimensional sphere   Although pork barrel spending add ons are typical - for immediate disaster relief funding, I find it unacceptable.   There is a very big difference between adding pork barrel spending to a bill that is not an emergency, vs using this tactic when emergency relief funds are required.  If Republicans tacked on tax breaks to the relief fund bill, wouldn't Democrats vote against it? Wouldn't that be downright disgusting? But that's basically what happened here.    There is a BIG difference between adding garbage legislation to an emergency bill, and adding legislation on a non-critical bill that has been back and forth for a month. The latter is acceptable and typical. The former is unacceptable, and I'm glad it got voted against. Using emergency funding to push a political agenda is disgusting, and it was clearly a completely political move.    This is likely because relief funds were bundled with a bunch of other unrelated legislature that had no business being part of the relief bill.   Sweet. Already got a dollar on my account   No one wants to openly admit that one particular demographic is responsible for the vast majority of this obnoxious behavior. This is my personal experience from riding from Howard to 35th street, 5 days a week for almost 2.5 years.   Intersting. Will keep on eye on it. It's one of those stocks that will do nothing for 1-2 years, and then pop like crazy.   Everyone on Reddit is a bot except you.  Oh oops. wrong post.   Was waiting for this comment to show up   Did you really just name two private ivy-league schools? As if they are even part of this conversation. Anyone going to those schools have no problems getting jobs out of college. And post-doc work? This entire discussion has been about undergraduate studies. Not ivy league graduate students and PhDs. That's not your average student. Those are not the students that typically struggle with unemployment and high student loans.   Someone making $75k straight out of college will be making $90k in a few years. And if they only had to take out $30k, their loans would all be quite low in percentage (probably no private loans needed). Of course it would be better to have less debt.  However my point is that the numbers are no even close to what I'm saying. Average student debt is greater than $30k, and the average salary is closer to $40k (many students don't even get jobs). That is the problem. If we were all only at a 40% debt ratio, we wouldn't have 35% of people between 22-30 living in their parents homes.  And your high school comparison is nice, but I'd take the $30k debt any day over no debt and a $9/hr job. That $9/hr job won't get you anywhere. So yea that's nice you can do it for cheaper, but it is not an end result.    To suggest that 40% of your income going toward student loans is fine is financially irresponsible.  Who said 40% of your income goes to the loan? You pay the loan over 10-25 years. Your payment will be less than 10% of your income.   I can tell you because the numbers I used is exactly my position. I have $30k in loans, $75k income, and my loans payments are about 5% of my income. Over the life of my loan I'll pay around $6,000 interest. Considering the job that I have, and the career I have ahead of me, it was more than worth it.   However to only have $30k in loans, I had to go to community college for two years, and have my parents assistance in paying some of my tuition. $30k is after all of that. The system is messed up. Period. The tuition is just too damn high. The loans are not the problem. They are a symptom of a much bigger and complicated issue.    So, if I understand the habits of you people correctly  Excuse me?  It's interesting how the Post dissects one of the dozens of times Gruber said about masking the cost of Obamacare in order to get it passed. This article from the post would make sense - if that was the only quote we have a Gruber. And let us not forget our President himself who promised we could keep our doctors, which he knew to be a flat-out lie.  If this was a little bill, it probably wouldn't matter. But this was the biggest piece of legislature in the past 2-3 decades (maybe more), so you can't just throw your hands up in the air and say, "Oh haha that's how they do it in politics!".   I'd like to see Republicans say that when defending Bush's invasion of Iraq, and see how liberals take it. "haha yea we lied about WMDs. You know, people are stupid. If we told them the truth, we would have never been able to invade Iraq! HAHAHA"  Yea, I'm sure you'd think that's totally legit.  And my initial comment was a joke. But it's also poking at liberals who are quoting an Republican Senator in a Liberal state who is now claiming the court cases are built on lies - that's a story here. But building the entire premise of Obamacare on lies? That's not a story. That's my point. They are connected in a way. And it's kind of worthless to be quoting a Republican is who likely just trying to appeal to her Democratic constituents in her state.   I don't think you understand supply and demand. If every single person has a diploma - then the value of the diploma (from the recruiter's perspective) is exactly zero. Everyone has one. If only 30% of people have one, then finding a candidate with a diploma is more difficult. The diploma now has value. The person with the diploma now has an easier time finding a job (compared to those without diplomas).  Growing up I used to always hear the stats on how someone with a diploma vs someone without, will end up making $1,000,000 more over 25 years (or something like that). Those stats are not valid anymore, as even those with diplomas cannot get jobs - or take jobs they probably could have gotten without a diploma.      I'd also say the job market is partially to blame for demanding college degrees for jobs that don't need it.  You have the cause and effect backwards. Since so many people have degrees (the supply is high), they can demand degrees. I mean, why would you take an employee without a degree when an employee with a degree is so damn easy to find?   I don't think the government is subsidizing it though, they actually turn a profit on student loans last time I checked. Students are getting shackled with loans many of which are at 8% interest.  Two things wrong with these statements:  * 8% interest is private loans that has nothing to do with government loans * Any profit the government makes is solely due to graduate degrees (doctors, lawyers, MBAs). If we look at undergraduate only, the government absolutely does not make a profit.  A good quote from a Forbes article [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/04/19/student-loan-profits-show-government-should-get-out-of-student-loan-business/)   Are student loans different in a sense that we should allow borrowers to place themselves under debt burdens they cannot carry? I dont think so. If some students cannot borrow money for college because they will likely be unable to repay their debts, the student is probably better off without the loan. If such a system means some students are encouraged to study a subject expected to produce earnings upon graduation rather than a subject which is not, society will not only survive but likely benefit.   This was poke at Gruber - who although wasn't a Senator, has been recorded openly that Obamacare was sold on a complete lie. I said 'Senator' because I thought it was clever to almost match the title of the post.   One of the greatest overhaul's and changes to American economic/political/medical policy - with a trillion dollar + consequence - was sold on lies. That somehow, is of no consequence to liberal on /r/politics or /r/liberal, or liberals in general.    You made a great point in your first sentence! But. . . I think you also refuted yourself :s  Yes, just like Germany, a smaller country with less resources and people yet accomplishing more than the USA. Yes. With a higher barrier for entry to get into college, yes! That way you're not subsidizing 1,000,000 sociology degrees and yes, not everyone gets to go to college.  Yea sorry if I wasn't clear, but I'm saying Germany *could be a good model*. But Germany's model is **not what Bernie is proposing** - that's the problem.    "Former Democrat Senator Admits Obamacare Was Built on Lies"    Nearly all of what you listed are post-education issues, but here goes.  Yea that's what we are talking about here when Bernie says he wants to make tuition free. So yes, post-education is what we are talking about.   Education is first and foremost designed to teach you how to think  12 years of formal education can't do this? The idea that somehow we need to spend 4 years to 'learn how to think' is absolutely appalling. Not to mention the free resources available to students today can easily replace much (not all) of the material covered in college. The 4 year college experience should not be required to be considered an educated person. If that's your goal - do it in two years at the most. You simply don't need 4.   The argument that there are too many diplomas obscures the issue that for many in the job market the diploma is a necessity--this is a problem with the job market and not with the number if diplomas.  The more diplomas, the less valuable each diploma is. Period. It's quite simple.   Your comments about researchers is bothersome. So you think it is OK for us to be taking money from a 19 year old, with no job, with no income, and use their debt to increase the reputation/esteem/prestige of the college? Shouldn't that money only be going to enhance their education? Wtf is that about? Young students are paying for public universities to have high tech research - which in turn does nothing to help them have a better education.  Saying that the entire problem lies with the fact that taxpayers don't provide free tuition - it's not only short sighted- it's just plain stupid.

Saying that the entire problem lies with the fact that taxpayers don't provide free tuition - it's not only short sighted- it's just plain stupid.    how are the current government conservative policies not "short-sighted."  Didn't say the aren't short-sighted. It is possible to criticize a liberal idea, while at the same time not agreeing with some Republicans and their policies.   I would do the following:  * Freeze all tuition for public schools * Limit the amount of money public schools can spend on research * Force schools to take a larger percentage of the burden buy forcing them to use more of their endowments to make tuition cheaper for students * Encourage/discourage certain degrees by offering a set amount of grants/loans for certain majors. For example, provide full grants for 1,000,000 engineering majors a year, but only 50,000 to sociology majors.  * Offer more incentives/funding to non-4 year institutions that provide training  Just some things to do. We need to completely turn around the entire 'college experience'. It's a drain on our economy, it's a drain on parents and on students. And for what? So that they 'can learn how to think'? What nonsense is that? We need to spend $100,000 to 'learn how to think'? And then 'learn how to live in your parents basement', and then 'learn how to collect unemployment'? We are doing a disservice to our children and setting them up to fail.    What I'm saying is that the rate of transactions today is not good for the end users of these mechanisms, but it is grand for the middlemen who get to claim their piece every time money moves around  Really? You can go read study after study on how HFT and derivative trading greatly reduces volatility in the market - because it is those traders that absorb the volatility.    Reducing the pace of capital transactions is not at all the same thing as contracting the economy, and it may be an excellent way to grow the economy.  Honestly I'm just going to stop here because you skipped ECON 101   You're backtracking and sidestepping all the bullshit you wrote earlier.. but OK. The fact is, about 80% or more of the middle class *already* relies on pensions or 401Ks. Period. Bernie himself has said that he wants to contract the economy. His goal is to actually *fuck up the economy*. I seriously hope this guy doesn't get elected.    The straw man is the argument  Haha /u/Demonweed calling out a strawman argument. Irony.   I would eliminate the word 'reality' from your vocabulary, because you clearly don't understand what it is.   "Greatly effect" is clearly a lie  In 2009, the number of Americans who had a pension or 401k was around 40%. Now considering anyone below the age of 18 would never have a pension/401k, that means the majority of the **middle class** has some form of pension or 401k.    but those who do are harmed insignificantly by the change (save for the middlemen who rake in commissions by uselessly churning other people's money.)  You pulled that out of your ass. What reality do you live in? The funds that are behind pensions and 401ks will get hit by the cost, and will increase their commission rates, or simply lower their return. It's not just HFT that will get hurt - we all will.  Not to mention that even more liberal countries like England refuse to have such a law, as they know companies will just move to France or Germany. The net result would be less revenue - which defeats the entire purpose of the law.   And for some simple math - if you have a $1 billion fund - lets say you make $300 million in trades a month - that is $3.6 billion in trades. .5% of $3.6 billion is $18 million. That's a 1.8% overall tax on the entire fun. That tax is now taken out of the return to the customer. What you are left is with a significant decrease to the rate of return for pensions and 401k.   Bernie's proposal is not new or revolutionary. It's been discussed before [here is a short article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/05/08/the-financial-transactions-tax-will-just-kill-the-banking-economy/)   /u/Demonweed you are an ignorant s###. Seriously. Why don't you go read up on the "Robin Hood" tax, and how it will tax and greatly effect anyone with a 401k or a pension- **also called the entire middle class**. You are making ridiculously stupid assumptions that are completely false, and then telling others their ideas/arguments are not in reality.  tl;dr: /u/Demonweed is an ignorant s***. The "Robin Hood" tax will tax the middle class, along with the wealthy. No trickle down bullshit here.    Root causes/problems:   * rising tuition costs - not actually the cost of education, but the rising dollar amount that institutions charge to students. This is the biggest problem. We wouldn't care about student debt if tuition was $2,500 a year.  * Increased number of diplomas given out, diminishes the value of the diplomas * Poor economy and job placement after college. * Too many students getting majors that cost too much, and have no hope of paying back the loans. * Not enough students going to trade schools or other fields that do not require a 4 year degree. * Governments continuing to allow public schools to raise tuition  * Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to make lavish campuses - but not to better the actual education. * Institutions using students' money, and taxpayer money to increase their reputation by hiring elite researchers (at no benefit to undergraduates) * The *culture* pushed by k-12 that everyone should go to college- if they don't, they are somehow a failure.  The problem is the *cost*, and the *job placement* after college. I think we would all be OK with $30,000 of debt, if we all had jobs that paid $75,000 out of college.  The fact that students are struggling with debt is the symptom of a lot of other issues (that I mentioned). Bernie's solution does nothing but eliminate debt - which is nice - but doesn't fix the root problems - and in fact would likely exacerbate many of them.  	113
                Well, ya got me. Well done.      @chicofaraby--Sadly, you are right.   The article includes the name of the company that makes and markets guns specifically for children.      @CharlieDarwin2--Not okay in the New Testament.   @herisee--You're talking Old Testament. Not so in the New Testament, which is the Jesus part, which is the part the Pope would be most interested in.                                                                     Sorry, that's "identifying." I should never reddit on the ipad.                                                                                          @BenLebovitz--Thank you.   Read the article.   Obama does not have discretion in how the sequester cuts are applied. That was the whole point of the sequester. I suggest you actually read the article before going into auto-drone-rant mode.I don't see what civil liberties and drones have to do with people getting their chemo treatments.      @chernobyl-- Unions also work to increase wages and benefits for their members.   @chernobyl-- Why not?         I disagree with you about both Taibbi and Brooks, but appreciate your reasonable and civil tone. We'll see what else Mr. Brooks has to say about same-sex marriage. Did your research into Brooks' advocacy of "gay rights" include an unambiguous statement of support for same-sex marriage.                     Brooks is an intellectually dishonest disgrace who never has the guts to actually argue in a forthright manner for the right-wing causes he supports. He tries to sneak in his real agenda under cover of a "reasonable moderate guy" persona, but that approach results in his "argument," if you can call it that, being illogical when you actually take the time to look closely. Most of his column's commenters get that and so does Taibbi.   Brooks is the most intellectually dishonest hack I've ever read. His standard operating procedure is to pose as a reasonable middle of the road guy and then to slip in his real, Republican-water-carrying point and hope that no one notices that he is really pushing the standard right-wing agenda and not some middle ground at all. He's a loathesome toady, and Taibbi gets that.   If you think for a minute that Brooks' disingenuous column was in favor of gay marriage, then I guess you're proof that his sneaky approach does work on some people. Guess it worked on j purdy below too.         They've also confused Cesar Chavez the labor leader with the late leftist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez. I guess all Hispanic people named Chavez look alike to them.            @QEDLondon: Yes, you are right. Plus, as Klein points out, the ASA is the definitive representative of the profession and it filed a friend of the court brief stating that children in families headed by same-sex parents are not harmed.                                                                                                                                                 That's not the point of the article. Yglesias is saying exactly that -- that it is because they are not poor that Republicans don't care about enacting programs that will help the poor, and in fact enact programs that will hurt them. He's saying they should have the ability to empathize with the problems of everyone in the nation, not just themselves, their friends and relatives.  	136
 It will be totally different from the Superman we have watched. I think it may be funny when I see Nic Cage playing the Superman in the screen.    It depends on whether I would like to cry out or I want myself to cheer up. If I want to cry out to release my sorrow, I may choose a sad story or something that will move me. If I would like to cheer up, i would choose the Pursuit of Happiness or Forrest Gump.    What do you mean? You mean the life in the movie is not our real life? Yes, robot is not so popular in our life now but we are doing so many researches to develop new products like the robot. So maybe the life in the movie will one day become our real life.       Shaun is now very famous. Not only the kids like him, but also some adults. I love him,too. Because he looks very cute.    Many people like the series and i think the sheep is cute, too. Charles Chaplin's Modern Times also has few words but it was a great success. So I think the sheep doesn't speak won't be a problem.    That will be great!!waiting for you to share more interesting things on your way to different places with us and good luck!   Your parents were born there but they immigrated to the USA? So will you choose to move to there one day with your parents? Will your parents allow you to do so? Or you will just spend time to travel and live there for a short period of time?    You might have your ideal place to live in and there may be one country that fits your requirement. share it with us.    The innocent people will soon get into trouble themselves because they are living in the society.    Oh yes! This is exactly me. But you have to make something to eat first and take a shower. Then, you can go to bed with the awareness that  you have to get up early next morning. It's a sad story.    As an adult, I think I should know how to deal with different complicated situations. But, I'm afraid that I'm still relying on others' suggestions to help me.    yeah! I noticed them. besides, the left side has some faces, too.    I really love the natural thinks and the photo with trees, clouds and lakes in it. This photo is amazing!!   Amazing!!i love natural things and the photo took with trees, clouds and lakes! I love this!!  	15

 Numbers dont lie, cats fucking suck   The PDSA Dickin Medal, recognised worldwide as the animals Victoria Cross, is awarded to animals displaying conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units. The PDSA Dickin Medal is the highest award any animal can receive whilst serving in military conflict.  The Medal, which can only be considered on receipt of an official commendation, has been awarded 65 times since 1943. The recipients comprised 32 pigeons, 29 dogs, three horses and one cat. In 2014 the first and only Honorary PDSA Dickin Medal was awarded to war horse Warrior on behalf of all animals that served in World War I.        we tried... we'll try again tomorrow...

Most believe that a Soviet torpedo hit and sank the Struma. The Turks did not send out rescue boats until the next morning - they only picked up one survivor (David Stoliar). All 767 of the other passengers perished.      The festival was staged on the area of a former freight station. The capacity of the enclosed location was limited to 250,000 people,[6] but more than one million visitors were expected, based on the experience of previous years.  Entrance should have been granted at 11:00, but was granted at 12:00 CEST.[7]A 240-metre tunnel from the east and a series of underpasses from the west met at a ramp that was supposed to be the only entrance and exit point of the festival area.[8] A smaller ramp existed between the underpasses from the west. Because of overcrowding, police at the entrance began announcing over loudspeakers that new arrivals should turn around and head back.[9][10] The side of the tunnel that was the entry of the parade area was closed, but people continued to enter the tunnel from the rear, despite being told it was closed. The deaths occurred as the ramp between tunnel underpasses and the festival area became overcrowded.[11][12]  There was some debate as to how the deaths occurred. Some reports suggested they were caused by people falling off a staircase as they tried to escape the tunnel.[13] However, autopsies showed that all of the fatalities were due to crushed rib cages.[13][14] A 2012 scientific analysis of the causes of the disaster dismissed the earlier descriptions of the incident as stampede or crowd panic, and instead found evidence for a phenomenon called "crowd turbulence".[1]      After the earthquake, survivors began injecting opium on a large scale. It was easily accessible, due to Bam's location on a trade route for drugs coming from Afghanistan and Pakistan. By 2006, over 50% of men and roughly 15% of women were addicted. The youngest addict was reported to be 11 years of age. Construction workers have historically been large injectors, and the rise in addiction may be attributed to them passing needle onto the public. An anonymous UNICEF worker claimed that drugs were slowing reconstruction and lessening motivation.[37]      Organized by students and teachers. Rope donated by local store.

 Want to bet on that?      Want to bet on that?   This might have been the case up to 2010, but no longer appears to be the case.  Also, it is worth noting that Japan's government always keeps track of their oldest man and woman just to make sure that they are still alive.    I mean I was 3 at the time  Well, I myself was 6/7 back in 1999. :)  but honestly time seems to be flying faster than it ever did when I was younger.  Agreed.  Eh, I guess that's getting old.  Agreed. :(   Any thoughts on this?   History, especially post-1815 Western history. :) After all, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath really did make history more interesting, in my honest opinion. :)   None, because I intend to get cryogenically preserved and the hopefully successfully revived after I will die. ;)      I am still waiting for a response to this question--did this man take hormone replacement therapy after his orchiectomy, though?      How exactly are you defining middle-aged here, though? After all, being 42 years old wouldn't exactly be middle-aged for a man who lived to age 112.      Did the Communists ever actually have a realistic chance of coming to power in Iran, though?   There--fixed ... just for you. :)   Thanks ;) :  https://edgeoftheframe.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/the-1st-annual-edgy-awards.jpg     I'm sorry ... what?   Only if he is in Heaven right now.   If so, then why exactly didn't someone save him?   Yep--the last two appear to have send him straight to the afterlife. :(   Um ... why not?   Yes--Kathleen Snavely; she was Irish-born but died in the U.S.A.   Yes, I guess so.   Actually, two currently living *women* are still from the 1800s. :)   Actually, he was Japanese.   If so, then this might have been the best way *ever* for someone to commit suicide. Seriously.   That, or maybe his stomach and thus his body couldn't take in that much food at once.   To eat all of that?   Indeed, he is remembered by Swedish schoolchildren as "the king who ate himself to death":  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths#18th_century      I apologize if this question was already asked before (including by me), but out of curiosity--exactly which additional countries (as in, countries other than the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia), if any, do you think would have been likely to have gotten federalized based on ethnic lines if Communists would have come to power in these countries?  For the record, these countries need to be countries where Communists actually had a good chance of coming to power (especially, but not only, during and/or after World War II).

For the record, these countries need to be countries where Communists actually had a good chance of coming to power (especially, but not only, during and/or after World War II).  Any thoughts on this?   Most of the people of Belarus, Crimea, and parts of Eastern Ukraine might be okay with this. However, Yes, there will probably be large-scale protests and riots in western Ukraine and perhaps in central Ukraine as well. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if these large-scale protests and riots will eventually cause the Russian government to allow most of Ukraine to secede from Russia.

Does Adolf Hitler rabid anti-Semitism and the policies that this caused him to implement count for this? After all, I can't imagine that events such as Kristallnacht were viewed very favorably in the West.      I am! :)   Actually, this would be a case where I would encourage transgender individuals to defy the chromosome labels on these bathrooms. :) Civil disobedience at its finest! :)   So, in other words, ISIS = evil whereas SISI = good, correct?   So you're saying that Captain Moses (a.k.a. Captain Mosey) did not get the Ten Commandments (well, later the Eight Commandments) from God at Mount Salsa? ;) If so, then shame on you for challenging my Pastafarian faith! ;) You, sir, are going to spend Eternity in Super-Mega Hell unless you repent for your sinfulness! ;)    Sisi is right in saying that a lasting agreement would make things better.  It will make things for Israel and Palestine. For the record countries in the region, though, not so much. After all, the Syrian Civil War has literally nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  You are also correct in your belief that the P.A. would not honour an agreement.  Actually, I think that Fatah *will* honor such an agreement. However, terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad are going to need to be fully and veritably disarmed in such a peace treaty. If Fatah cannot accomplish this task itself, then it might be up to Israel to do this, and unfortunately doing this can be extremely bloody for anyone who tries to do this. :(   Actually, as far as I know, Mahmoud Abbas *did* previously present his own peace proposal while Netanyahu did not. If Netanyahu is unwilling to present a peace proposal of his own, then how exactly can peace talks meaningfully advance?   This would be a final peace treaty, though, rather than a temporary one. Thus, any violations of this peace treaty will probably be treated very severely.   Yes, they certainly should. Of course, Netanyahu likewise needs to want to make peace with the Palestinians as well.   Agreed. Solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be great for the Israelis and for the Palestinians, but not so much for the neighboring countries in the Middle East. After all, things such as the Sunni-Shiite conflict have literally *nothing* to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Yes, Israeli-Palestinian peace will make the Middle East somewhat safer. However, one should also be aware that a lot of what is currently occurring in the Greater Middle East does *not* have much, if anything, to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Thus, the mentality that Israeli-Palestinian peace will result in everyone in the Greater Middle East shaking hands and singing "Kumbaya" is extremely delusional and idiotic!   A *woman* recruiting *girls* for Islamic State; shit--doesn't she realize that Islamic State is *extremely* misogynistic? :(      I strongly hope that you are correct in regards to this.   Understood; did you like the Norwegian and Russian foods which you ate there, though? Also, can you please elaborate on exactly what kind of foods it was (as in, the names of these foods)?   Yeah, basically, I think that Kagame needs to make a distinction between hate speech (which I have no problem banning in Rwanda for the time being, though ideally I would oppose banning it anywhere) and legitimate criticism of him. After all, advocating another genocide in Rwanda certainly isn't the same thing as criticizing Kagame for his authoritarianism. Based on what I have read, Kagame makes no distinction between his critics (and in, he doesn't care whether or not they are hate-mongers); however, this certainly doesn't surprise me considering that it is in a dictator's interest to suppress any dissent and opposition.  That said, though, in spite of all of Kagame's flaws, I certainly prefer him over what happened in Rwanda in 1994. After all, please correct me, but the impression that I am getting is that if one shuts up and doesn't criticize Kagame, then the Rwandan government will treat this individual well and help improve his or her life over time. If so, then Rwanda appears to be *much* better than some other dictatorships right now. :)   Congratulations to your dad! :) * Hugs * :)   Did you like the food there as well?    Saudi Arabia. Arabs are by far the most warm-hearted and friendly people I've ever met.  Would this still be true if they interacted with an Israeli-American Jew such as myself, though?   Very interesting! :)  Also, out of curiosity, isn't Paul Kagame and his leadership of Rwanda been responsible for a lot, if not most, of the progress that Rwanda has made over the last 20 years?   Very interesting. :) Was your trip extremely expensive, though?   Where exactly within South Korea did you visit, though?   Yes, please. :)   It appears that these bathrooms are transphobic. :( What a shame! :(      As for me, my great-uncle, who was born on June 20, 1906 and died on January 25, 2002 at the age of 95 (for the record, I myself was born in 1992).      Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_living_people   Nothing, since I *don't want* to have balls! :( Seriously.         So do I! ;)      RAmen, brother! ;)    Well, from my limited understanding of France in this time period; no.  Perhaps you can make some stretch that the relative disunity of France in the Hundred Year's War (HYW) is comparable to the initial confusion and disorder present in the RKKA, but I'd say its too much of a stretch. The disorder in the RKKA in 1941 is as much a result of purges and confusion as it is because of legitimate losses; the savagery and speed of the initial attack is as much to blame for the RKKA's condition in the first month of conflict as any pre-existing conditions.  OK.   Comparatively, France's disunity has far more to do with the fact that well....'nations' as we understand them simply didn't exist at this time. In terms of unity of command and concentration of forces, England's far greater unity gave it a de facto local superiority or at the very least parity in numbers.  I've got a question, though--didn't the French King already have the authority to raise troops from areas which were under this control and/or under the control of his vassals back then?   In short, the political and other pre-existing conditions are in no way similar and its a gross misunderstanding of the politics of France in this time period to simply look at size and population and go 'France's military potential was infinitely greater than England's.'  Please pardon my ignorance in regards to this, but did vassals of the French King actually have the authority to disobey him during this time? As in, if the French King would have demanded some troops from them, would they have been able to refuse this demand of his without any negative repercussions for themselves?   Finally, the HYW in reality is a series of separate wars, and must be imagined in such a light. Several of these series of wars ended with treaties highly favorable to the English, and one can indeed safely conclude that the English Kings related to those treaties did accomplish many of their political goals.  It is worth noting, though, that Nazi Germany might have likewise been able to get a favorable treaty from the Soviet Union in, say, October 1941. However, Hitler appears to have been too greedy and wanted more and thus ended up losing everything in the end.   Fuck yeah!      OK--I apologize if this sounds far-fetched, but I was thinking if there is actually a very good analogy between the Hundred Years' War and the Eastern Front of World War II.  To elaborate on this, in both the Hundred Years' War (which, as far as I know, was actually a series of wars) and in the Eastern Front of World War II, a less populous country (England and Nazi Germany, respectively) was able to initially make very large territorial conquests in a much larger country (France and Russia, respectively). However, in spite of their very large territorial conquests, neither England nor Nazi Germany succeeded in achieving their ultimate war aims (conquering all of France and conquering the Soviet Union up to the Urals, respectively). Likewise, both France and the Soviet Union were eventually able to "regain their footing" and to use their numerical superiority (and presumably resource and logistical superiority as well) to push back against the English and Nazi German invaders and to eventually kick both of these invaders out of France and Russia, respectively. To my knowledge, after the English were kicked out of France and the Germans were kicked out of Russia, neither England nor Germany was ever able to pose a serious land-based threat to France and Russia, respectively.  Any thoughts on this analogy of mine?

Any thoughts on this analogy of mine?   OK; that said, though, do you have a preference?   I don't know if this counts for this, but immigrating from Israel to the United States of America. :) This was certainly a wonderful moment in my life and I would like to repeat it if I could. :)   Out of curiosity, though--do you have a pee fetish for other women, for men, or for both women and men?   Conclusion: Sometimes people who appear to be the nicest are actually the creepiest. :(   What exactly was the name of said place itself, though?  Also, I am glad that you liked Plov. :)   Wow! In 20 to 25 years, this coin is almost certainly going to be older than every human being who will still be alive at that point in time.   What exactly does BFE mean, though? Also, exactly which Russian foods did you eat?  As for me, I ate various Russian foods which my parents made, including borscht, shchi, Olivier salad, pelmeni, plov, et cetera. These Russian foods really were quite delicious! :)   I *strongly* beg to differ with you on that. :(   Maybe ... maybe. It certainly makes one wonder, doesn't it? ;)   That, or maybe they are being cock-blocked by His Almighty Noodliness. ;)  Of course, they could also simply be afraid of getting STDs.   "Futurist" is due to the fact that I am generally very optimistic about the future. :)  "110" is a reference to the 110 Club forum, where I first posted under the username "Futurist." :)   Depression, obviously.   "Don't do stupid shit!"   Rice. Seriously.   True.   What exactly was this girl wearing, though?   (Hopefully) For being a proud eunuch. :)   Break up with her and if she won't get an adoption or give our child up for adoption, then I will literally get rid of my testicles by *any* means necessary.   Because she, unlike Bernie, can actually win the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.   Rape and kill multiple people, obviously.   My mom, by feeding me. :)   Imagine.  After all, this word opens up a limitless number of possibilities. :)   Teddy bears, of course. :)   For one, urinals and toilet seats.   "It is better to be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt."   Clap with one hand. Seriously.   Wasting? On war(s), of course.   Many different kinds of soups.   Guacamole.   And then some nice, romantic music. ;)   You will die soon.   Blatantly calling people out for saying stupid shit, of course.   Imagine.  After all, this word opens up a limitless number of possibilities. :)   Many jobs which involve eating good food. :)   Ask him which song I relentlessly listened to in the summer of 2007. Seriously.   The Rear Admiral on the Poop Deck, of course. ;)   When people spell easy words incorrectly, such as writing "there" instead of "their" in phrases such as "their cat."   If both of them are women, then ask both of them if the want to have a three-way with me. ;)   No, I don't think so.   Adolf Hitler, for killing many of my Jewish relatives as well as millions of other innocent people. :(   Possibly shawarma, but definitely some kind of food. :)   Not a movie, but events which show Trisha Elric in Fullmetal Alchemist. :(   Yes, at least to some extent.   Allen Gregory.   Balls. As an aspiring eunuch myself, I absolutely *hate* that word. :(   Getting spanked (with a belt) *much* more than I deserved. :(   For one, learn how to spell "college" correctly.   The ability to clap with one hand, of course.   A hairy back which cannot be deal with by *any* means.   That power can be and sometimes is abused.   To talk with many specific people who are already dead right now.   A penis. Seriously. After all, trans-men aren't born with penises.   Angelica from The Rugrats, of course.   "I am not a procrastinator."   Nope.      Good; this means less oil revenue for rulers such as Vladimir Putin.      Well, at least *some* of us haven't lost our inner child yet. ;)   Actually, that was the Rabbit's wife. The Rabbit himself is in a mental hospital getting treatment for his depression. ;) After all, the lack of Trix in his system causes the Rabbit to get seriously depressed over time.   Not a villain, but the Leprechaun who wants his Lucky Charms should certainly be allowed to have them.   Yes ... *stoned*.  Thus, does anyone have some weed? ;) After all, weed can certainly make someone *stoned*. ;)   Actually, I don't know if this is on Netflix. It might be, but I am not 100% sure about this.  Also, do you have the DVD box set for the sequel to Last Exile as well?   Russia certainly isn't the only country where people drink alcohol, though. :)   Frankly, this is something which *everyone*, lifeguard or not, should *certainly* know. Seriously.  Thanks for educating me about this. :)   Does Pacman count for this?   Meg Griffin from Family Guy. 'Nuff said.   (Assuming that I myself first become a eunuch, begin taking hormone replacement therapy, and sufficiently feminize my body and face beforehand.)  If she counts for this, Gabrielle Reece (and especially a younger version of her). After all, I certainly like tall women. :)   Completely agreed! :)  Also, for the record, I am likewise aroused when women actually wet themselves. Seriously.   Any thoughts on this?   Thank you. :) Yeah, I have a piss fetish, and if one doesn't like it, then too bad for him or her! ;)   Any thoughts on this?   A baguette with caviar, of course. :)   If it counts, Last Exile.   Women needing to pee *extremely* badly and visibly showing it.  There--I said it.   Source, please?   A lack of trust.  	152
 Playing each other    why   To be fair, the mobile phone menu system was used first in Saints Row, and worked much much better. Plus I'm prreeeetty sure the first Saints Row was the first game to use the whole circular bars filling up around the circular mini map thing that GTA 4 and tonnes of open world games now use. Maybe.   Oh yes! Awesome! Thank you!   Wow. Are we sure that first one isn't Louis Theroux?   Republican Space Rangers did a much better job at being a goofy political satire while actually still being a funny entertaining show. This just seemed ridiculous.   I really really hope the Annihilator is back    I find #18 very hard to believe   I'd rather they start a new separate sci-fi IP instead of changing GTA into something it's not   This is the kind of guy you hate, but kinda love to have around   I thought the very first series was okay. It was a pretty cool idea and had some genuinely frightening and haunting stuff beyond the shock gore-rape. All the rest is pretty terrible.    what the shit is a Mermantula    Wind effects would have been alright for flying vehicles and maybe long range weapons from tanks or jets or something, but it would get pretty annoying if simply shooting your guns or moved around you had to compensate for wind.   GTA 4 was about 7 square miles, San Andreas was 13 or 14 square miles. I think Red Dead Redemption was around 20?  The GTA 5 map includes underwater areas as well as the traversable landmass.   It was annoying, but it did feel more like an actual car radio than a wheel would   Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn were both in San Andreas. Michael Madsen was in 3.  Plus if you count movies that were just written by Tarantino and directed by someone else, you got Danny Trejo, Michael Rapaport, Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper   In what way was he dickish? It seems like he'd be very anti-social.   Directed by Marc Webb, director of 500 Days of Summer and Amazing Spiderman   This is the one Xbox exclusive title I'll be  bummed about missing out on    The cast is great but everything looks really generic and flat.    Oh man you're right, that is totally the same dude. That's awesome.   Yeah, I totally agree with all of this, yet I loved this movie. All the things that made this movie a weird non-typical action movie with very little of the same Iron Man/Avengers/superhero movie stuff that we have seen before are exactly why I loved it.   You should watch the trailer for Sir Billy       I like how at 55 seconds in when the camera angle changes, the dog realizes it's been accidentally included in the shot and quickly leaves to avoid embarrassment    Huh I hadn't even heard of this movie before this. Looks good.   Well then I guess us Australians will never get it at all   Doesn't look like there's a spot for melee weapons in the new weapon wheel?    I never finished LOD and I never had any problems with the story    TBOGT was better than GTA 4 and LOD combined    He is the most youth-pastory looking youth-pastor of all time   Radio GaGa was already in the Michael trailer    Well I'd assume it's just a code you get with the game. Just don't enter the code.   This so accurately portrays my reaction to this whole train wreck    That was definitely footage from Red Dead Redemption   That guy's voice sounds suuuuper familiar  Edit: At first I thought it was Christopher McDonald, but now I think it's either H Jon Benjamin or Jason Sudekis   Well now I have to play that game   That's a pretty ugly tattoo. Well done technically, but just a bad idea.   Well this is Kevin Smith's Green Arrow so I guess he gets to put him wherever he wants   I think Vin Diesel said it takes place in Tokyo, LA and Dubai   Yeah she was super bland and boring   Donnie Darko?   It's already passed classification    Grant Morrison's Batman run is super long and crazy, so just RIP on it's own will probably be incoherent and unsatisfying. But if you want an insane and epic sprawling Batman story, it's totally worth it to pick up his entire run. It just ended last week I believe.   dang   Is this completely only on the Xbox, or is it one of those on the Xbox-first with exclusive extra content things?   Tom Cruise must be pissed   I really really liked Elysium. Didn't have as much world building or character development as I would have liked, it was a bit cheesy in parts, and the story wasn't great. But I thought it was a whole lot of fun and I was having a great time watching it.   But I thought District 9 was very overrated and just as flawed as Elysium so I guess I'm just crazy.   29 isn't really true. Of course the actors in Alien knew an alien was going to burst out of John Hurts chest. Unless they somehow left it out of the script and none of the actors noticed when halfway through the scene the director yelled cut and they brought on a prosthetic body cavity and spent hours prepping the animatronics. In the making of on the special edition DVD they say they didn't know exactly how it would pop out and what it would look like, and they said they were surprised by how much blood there was.    The Chinese DVD of Godzilla 1984/5 has the Japanese track with English subtitles.  Pretty much all the DVDs I've found have both the dubs and the subtitles.    6 people think Rodan is the worst monster? Minilla and Gabera suck, and even though I love them, I can understand people not liking Mothra or Biollante or whatever, but how can you hate Rodan?    If it were delayed so as to be ported over to PS4, XboxOne and PC I wouldn't be AS pissed, but I'd still be pretty pissed.   Holy shit it stars Treat Williams   I was thinking of maybe getting this game to pass the time until GTA 5 comes out. Not really worth it now.   Pretty much any James Bond movie    Holy shit. Now I'm really afraid to go back and rewatch all the older Steve Oedekerk stuff I used to think was hilarious when I was a kid. Was it all this bad? And fucking terrifying?  EDIT: Oh man Biff is in this   Guy on the far left is the protagonist from Liberty City Stories, next to him is Claude from GTA 3. Playing the Playstation is Niko from GTA 4, and CJ from San Andreas is above him with the jetpack. The guys arm wrestling are from Vice City Stories and Lost and Damned, the guy behind them dancing with the girl is Luis from Ballad of Gay Tony. Tommy Vercetti from Vice City is chilling on the couch, guy on the far right is Michael from GTA 5, and the asian dude in the elevator is from Chinatown Wars. Trevor and Franklin are unfortunately missing from this picture.   Doesn't Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers show up in that scene also?   That took me out of the movie something fierce   Huh. I would have thought 32 would be more reasonable   What's the top gear reference?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage list=PLCbnPrACOv8psnu68BfpYy_9ihtmhJekD v=OHrD84Y309c t=3229    James Marsden!   My favourite episode   Scott Derickson didn't make those movies    Looks like Vice City   I want that guy to do an AMA    Yeah but why are they called that    I thought the idea was that the Dude was really the true 'Big' Lebowski from the perspective of the story we got    Oh lord please let there be an Opie and Anthony radio channel with Jim Norton   http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=XOsLZ0lSqpg t=39   Ninja is one half of the band Die Antwoord. They have a significantly large cameo role in this film.    And then find out how it got burned   He has two lines in this trailer   Well they do say they have to "tell our boys what they can and cannot blow up" so while this movie is probably concerning a particular group of men on a particular mission where they're saving art from the Nazis, it looks like they might at least acknowledge the fact that the Allies are a danger to cultural icons as well.   I'm gay now    The GiantBomb Quick Look of this game is one the funniest goddamn things on the internet.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdAW5FVj5n0   Looks about the same to me. 7 stations, each with about 15 or so songs.  None of them seem that great except for maybe The Mix, just for how fun and silly those songs would be to play with.   Holy fuck   I've said it before but I'll say it again. There are really not enough videos/captions of these sorts of cuckolding threesomes around. Amazing.   Was getting caught a part of his plan? I thought he just got caught.    Denzel as Malcolm, Oldman as Vicious, Blanchett as Dylan, Phoenix as Cash, and Kingsley as Gandhi are all pretty great.  The rest not so much   The third act sucked but the last couple minutes of the movie are awesome   Killing is badong    "Yeah you ain't never seen no shit like this! Hella dinosaurs like crazy!"   Mel Gibson looks like he's having a lot of fun. He might be a dick but I really like him as an actor.   Also the voice on the phone at the start really sounds like Clooney.   There was an anal probe gun that anally probed people to death and made their heads explode.    This has been known for a while. It's called Chappie and Yolandi and Ninja from Die Antwoord are in it. They even mentioned it in a song a while ago.    I just realized that Robin Williams poster was a nod to the terrible film 'Jack'   Transformers 4?   I like it a lot, but I dunno, I think it's moving a little too fast. It's only a ten issue series so it might not have the time it needs to really flesh out the story.  I love the premise, I love the build up, I love the mystery, I love this huge epic storyline they're trying to craft, I love all the ideas, but whenever something really spooky or interesting or atmospheric seems to be coming, the issue either ends, or we have some monster movie horror action jammed in. I feel like this book would be perfect if it was allowed to be a little slower and more tense and restrained.   I bought Mortal Kombat and the uncensored Left 4 Dead 2 from the UK and they both went through customs just fine   As an Australian, THANK CHRIST   No that part is pretty normal, the fact that its going grey is not so normal   No way. The suit is fine for the Toho films, but it simply wouldn't work at all for modern Western Audiences. I love the suit and the miniatures, they're really fun and great to look at, but CGI can do so much more than a suit can. It can move so much more realistically and perform in a much more advanced way. For the direction the 2014 Godzilla movie is going, a suit would not work at all. CGI is the best possible way to make a serious realistic and dynamic modern Godzilla movie for a wide audience.  The problem with the 1998 Godzilla movie, wasn't the CGI, it was everything else. CGI is a great amazing tool that can do mindblowing things that couldn't be done otherwise. It's all about how you use it.   Chew is funny but I wouldn't put it anywhere near this level    I dunno it looks like a pretty good truck to me   Eh probably not   He doesn't really physically look like Rick Moranis at all, but his character in Pacific Rim was totally intentionally supposed to be Rick Moranis inspired   Wow, do you have any more pics of those figures, they look awesome! Where'd you get them?   I've really been wanting to start getting some Godzilla figures recently.   Yeah I'm South Australian, and whenever I visit the East Coast people always think I'm English    Probably because you met Australians who were traveling and vacationing. There are tonnes of antisocial angry dicks here.    I used to have a pet kangaroo. They're huge as shit, destroy everything, and can kill you with a single kick.

However after the defeat of the Soviets, opium production skyrocketed. This alarming trend was affected by a drought that occurred between 1995 and 1998. After the drought during Taliban rule, opium production surged to over 4,000 MT in 2000 (Blanchard 2009, 4). In 2001, the Taliban, caving into international pressure declared opium production illegal (Blanchard 2009, 3). This campaign was very effective, and in 2001, only 200 MT of opium was produced. But, in 2002, when the new, weak Karzai regime took control over Afghanistan, opium production increased and reached record levels, with an unprecedented yield of 8,200 MT, or 193,000 hectares in 2007 (Blanchard 2009, 4). The rise in the opium economy has created many opportunities for insurgent groups, militia, and warlords to finance their operations against one another.

Your data for expected life and income/education is not normalized to take into account obesity. There could be a chance that the reason why rich people live longer is due to that most are of a healthy weight, for we already know that obesity rates do in fact correlate with poverty and lack of education.    They are wrong, just by your weight alone puts you into a higher risk tier and any medical professional worth his/her salt should not ignore the pending risk.

You're doctor might not be aware of the current scientific knowledge on the risk associated with obesity.   In this large prospective study, obesity was strongly associated with the risk of death in both men and women in all racial and ethnic groups and at all ages. After we accounted for potential bias owing to preexisting disease and residual confounding by smoking status by using midlife BMI values and restricting the analysis to participants who had never smoked, we found that even moderate elevations in BMI conferred an increased risk of death. The risk among participants who were overweight at the age of 50 years was 20 to 40 percent higher than that among participants who had a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9 at that age. The risk among obese subjects was two to at least three times that of participants with a BMI of 23.5 to 24.9. The risk of death among underweight participants was attenuated.    -[Source](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa055643#t=article)   For the time being, but the fact that you are obese (BMI34) means you are at increase risk of chronic obesity related illness and disease.

You said this.    Well the traditional approach usually limits the amount you spray because it can in turn damage the plant. GMOs are resistant to the pesticides, so they spray a LOT of them.    Which has nothing to do with the use of neonicotinoids. GMOs are not to blame at all for CCD.    Neonicotinoids are used on both GMO and non-GMO crops, there are no crops genetically engineered to be resistant to neonicotinoid application because neonicotinoids are an insecticide and not a herbicide.

So Monsanto is selling the same seed corn, world wide, which is all genetically identical.    They are not the same exact seed. The RR trait is commonly back crossed into existing plant lines,   Where in the article does it say that?   What happens if he just so happens to fall into a life boat?   With the new speed limits on the 'Ring I doubt we will see a car beat the 918.    Monsanto caused 9/11 and faked the moon landing.    It allegedly also crashed into a cow.    All GE seeds on the market are fertile, sterile plants have never made it to market.    They never made it criminal, they gave no binding voluntary guidelines for labeling back in 2001.   Luckily there are no sterile GMO crops on the market.    I wish they'd run pikes peak with an F1 car, it would be interesting to see how much faster it would be.    And lab-grown diamonds are still expensive as fuck.    Except this hasn't been true in years, DeBeers no longer hold a monopoly over the diamond market.

I understand that there is no way to know 100% on anything, but in the case of almonds it's a pretty cut and dry case of being reliant on a domesticated/managed animal.    [Almond trees are pollinated by honey bees which are a non-native and domesticated incest which are trucked in from across the country.](http://www.almonds.com/growers/pollination)    In total, we observed 2416 flower visits by honeybees Apis mellifera (70% of all visits), 378 by wild bees of at least 19 species (11% of all visits), 327 by hover flies (10% of all visits) and 314 by other insects of various taxa (9% of all visits). Other insects included flies (primarily Bombyliidae and Muscidae), ants (Formicidae) and other infrequent visitors (Table S1, Supporting Information). The most flower visits by wild bees were provided by the ground-nesting sand bee Andrena cerasifolii (Cockerell) accounting for more than 2% of all flower visits. Sweat bees also frequently visited flowers, especially an undescribed Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) species and Lasioglossum incompletum (Crawford). These wild bees were present only in orchards with nearby natural habitat. The blue orchard bee Osmia lignaria propinqua Cresson, a species that could be managed for almond production in California (Bosch   Kemp 2002), was only observed once.

MORE: How to turn your home PC into a UFO detector  MORE: Is this REALLY a cloud? Mysterious UFO pictures from real X-files fan conspiracy flames  Its part of a long tradition of fear of CERN  which believers claim has a logo mirroring the form of the Indian god of destruction, Shiva.  Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, says, CERN is linked with all manner of conspiratorial and apocalyptic fears. Clyde Lewis writing in 2012 on the Ground Zero website notes:  Is it just a coincidence that CERN is short for the horned God Cernunnos? Is it also a coincidence that CERN has to go deep underground to do their god harnessing experiments? Cernunnos was the god of the underworld.  Going on to state:  The authorities at CERN have done their ritualistic experiments in the underworld and has used unlimited power to turn against the earth. This power has shown that it is causing an increase in earthquake activity and some even claim that it may be the reason for an increase of UFO activity as well.  Now with the CERN experiments starting up again, the fear that they are set on destroying our planet or at least opening portals to other dimensions unleashing terrors of Biblical proportions are being rekindled on the Internet.  As far back as the 1970s UFO expert Peter Rogerson observed that UFOs are an essential part of a growing fear of our impending global doom:  Thus the UFO is an integral symbol of the growing irrationality with its associated apocalyptophilia of the mid-twentieth century. As the two great monoliths of established religion and scientific positivism are crumbling the vacuum is being filled by horrors from the pages of Tudor history.  As with other perceived horrors of science and technology there is always a belief that they will bring about our ultimate destruction and salvation will only exist for the chosen few. The CERN project rather than Atomic warfare or pollution is now the focus for such fears.

Qatar Mega Marathon will contribute in spreading the awareness of sports, and as a kind of social responsibility that the sports play in the lives of the nationals and expatriates of the State of Qatar. The Marathon will support the majestic march of sports of our beloved country, as Qatar is considered as the region's sports capital.  Mega Marathon Qatar represents a decisive response to the campaign waged by the sector of envious haters on the success of Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and to their false allegations of persecution of workers and residents in our beloved country. The Marathon will play an active part in promoting the social role of sport and the ideals and values held in common by the State of Qatar. As the Qatari people, Government and residents have all expressed the wish to present the State of Qatar as active around the world as an outward looking state dedicated to the improvement of relations between nations through sport.   The Marathon objectives can be summed up as follows:  Organizing Qatar Mega Marathon represents our commitment to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State.  Celebrating the Qatari National Sports Day  The image that the Marathon will show how Qatar encourages the non-discrimination attitude among the nations. Promote the social role of sport.

Seth Rollins to check in soon?   it is a flimsy rumour, they would not want to be trapped by spreading an easily disproved rumour. it is smart to focus only on those allegation that have more supporting evidence.   judging by how many personal attack propaganda is put online against these two person, you know what they said hurt.   this is the result of fact checking by 160 lawyers. if they put stuff in there that can be proven wrong, they know scientology will drown them in lawsuit.    car become safer when it have crumple zone that take away energy of the crash.       in 2004- 2006 he did preach the scientology believe that psychiatry is evil. which was not a good move for this public image.    after that movie come out, viacom ended their long term relationship with cruise because they view the scientology link damage cruise's box office potential.            why is Bieber not banned?   did Lesnar new contract mean he will appear every week to beat the crap out of Rollins, that would be TV rating gold.    pizza store own by Gustavo "Gus" Fring   i never realize i am pratically a vegetarian   it is the solution for the German problem   because they got lawyers, lots and lots of lawyers   how is it going to look if the government launch a war on religion?  cause that is how scientology always present any government investigation on them as, religious persecution.       it is already public knowledge what is the name of the co-pilot before today news come out.   that have nothing to do with religious divide?   they did not lost half its student, they lost half its customer.   many think this guy is a idiot, but actually he is just playing this public persona for the target audience that have made him a lot of money.    funny discussion on sex scene  Kiera chats about her sex faces in 'Dangerous Method' and 'Atonement'  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKmn1ZGDbLg   the movie start with a breach that appear in spacetime, a Stacker Pentecost/Kaiji hybrid emerge.....   upcoming TV series on a narcotic dog struggle to protect and serve while fighting a meth addiction.   why is she still called a terrorist when she already done the jail time and her group have been disbanded for 40 years?       this is no surprise, all the east asian countries are quite xenophobic.   the movie will win because it is brilliant examination of the human condition through the method of NOS injection.   actually i think they are working against themselves, those counter propaganda is so over the top and ridiculous it will make more people want to see the documentary.    wont this be very bad PR? opponent will link this to Nazi gas chamber method.       how can vaccine be a big money maker for pharma company? a product that only need to be taken once is never good for profit. they would be more eager to sell boner pill and antidepressant   but Cameron is a much better action director than Bay, Bay keep trying to do epic shots but the characters and plot suffer.  Cameron in his movie are able to make you care for the characters and keep raising the stakes with each action scenes until the final climatic resolution.   Gravity have the best score in recent years. especially the scene where stone return to earth.   late night comedian must be starting a superpac for Ted Cruz 2016   goddamm it, i have said again and again, the wall does not work, we need real protection, we need to have the jaeger program started immediatly.   all walmart employee need to be packing heat to prevent this event happening again. there is no excuse, they got all the supply they in the store with almost limitless reload.   how much more beating can this dead horse take?   also Russian and China are in competition with each other to control those central asian gas producing countries.    so this is the Canadian anchor baby, wake up sheep, the canuck conspiracy is upon us, and no one is securing the longest undefended border in the world.    their actions are only limited by their ability to project power.    that is one of the most homoerotic scene in movie history   he should save his brain by quiting football   Russian and China dont interfere and overthrow government? are you serious?   kim jong il is a great film buff, he have NK embassy around the world to illegally make copy of foreign film to sent back to this collection.  he will instruct the NK filmmakers on the technique and style of these foreign movie, all of which the filmmaker are not allow to watch by law.  he even abducted SK director to improve the NK movie industry output.   report indicate quite a healthy black market for dvd player. china made generic brand dvd player are very cheap.   the sentence of being caught watching foreign tv series and movie is death.   it is all good if they will all go there and get themself killed, but the problem is that some of them will come back with training to carry out terrorist attack    cops shooting a crazy person is by definition a shooting incident   i am very impressed with this operation, the balls that it required.    Asian parent strikes again   have Sean Bean die in a plane crash before in any of his movies?   you do realize the last scarface was also a remake?   so, remove kebab?   knowing what happen in no make the documentary less epic, the show just draw you in from the first minute and take you on this crazy ride that is the life of Robert Durst   i dont get how she can consider Paul career is on a downward spiral while he is still doing so many movie tv and video game projects. she is the one that have the much less succeful career in show business.      his career will be dead to me if he mess up season 2.    22 jump street is pretty good sequel to an unexpected hit   what are the ritual we should observe before taking these blessed meth?   Why should the cops be punished? editing Wikipedia page is perfectly legal free speech. the only thing they can get is like HR rules violation on wasting office time and equipment.

     Inside they found several items consistent with being used to print counterfeit currency including paper, scissors, glue and a printer.  Holy shit I think I might know hundreds of counterfeiters!   Yeah I'll just constantly remove the drivers seat from my car because I dropped yet another thing.   Are you being serious?   You mean when you take the Browns to the Superbowl?   Well, you can't cook *that* much if you only use 2 pans..      She's already replied to this and was reading all of it as it went down.   Everyone here took me the wrong way and alienated me.  Last time either of us post here.   It's hard for me to understand why this hasn't happened already.   People are the way they are and some of them are aware that the way they are is harmful and illegal. They have really no outlet to express things and be taken seriously without getting locked up.   [I'm the type to pick a fight with Phoenix Jones and eat his bones]( https://youtu.be/FVHWxESdN4o )   She read this too and is unsure why I'm being labeled an ass.   Sometimes I hate reddit.   In the heat of the moment, yes.   Well extreme heat and humidity isn't fun. I just deal with it better than cold I guess.   More power to you man. Wish I knew how to like it.   THE ANSWER WAS YES   I am not unwilling.  Fucks sake. Y'all are treating me like a rapist.   We did stop and finish elsewise....  Where in what I said made anyone think different???   Okay.   Please keep in mind this wasn't a premeditated act where I refused lube... This was a heat of the moment decision that wasn't as good for both parties and I was trying to get a female perspective on...   Quite possibly. But well see.  	19
 My honest guess at this is that the black guy who was carrying the concealed weapon would have been shot by the police when they arrived.   I guess all politics aside, I would feel uncomfortable attending a church where people felt the need to carry a weapon.   I think they also underestimate how Bernie can motivate people to vote.  Hillary is just the same ole same ole...Bernie gives you something to vote FOR not against.   So the solution is.....more guns?   Why don't they have HRC on and start asking her questions about Bernie Sanders and his stance on the issues?   Thanks for the heads up!   This needs to go viral!   Just when you think you couldn't love him even more....   Watched and shared      WTF????   yes, but that was BEFORE he talked to his corporate donors, they gave him the go ahead    Thanks for the link...took me about 2 minutes to email both of my Senators   Happy dance!    Seriously, this guy is running for President?   whoops...she really meant to say the people of SC, not her bosses the CEOs /s   i love this idea!! Pint of whatever for me, donate that same amount to bernie   hmmm...how about a pint for me and a pint for Bernie...donate the cost of a pint of ice cream to his campaign.... or maybe a pint for me, and a pint for the Revolution    Hillary Hate is rampant in the Republican party.  Did you know there is actually a PAC called stop hillary now and their one goal is to end Hillary Clintons Political career???   Power to the People! Go Bernie!   Go Bernie!  	21
 I do say to fusion scientists/colleagues, with a tiny bit of good nature, that we already have an amazingly powerful fusion reactor, and that of course is the sun.  That said, I personally admire the idea of fusion, and support the research ongoing at ITER (https://www.iter.org) and other places, but since the first experiments are not going to even be run until 2027, I would like to see us effectively use our single biggest source of energy at our disposal - solar energy hitting terrestrial earth, all the time.    There has been, however, press about Lockheed Martin being on the verge of portable fusion:  http://lockheedmartin.ca/us/products/compact-fusion.html  http://www.eweek.com/news/lockheed-martin-claims-sustainable-fusion-is-within-its-grasp.html  Wish that I knew more about that. The details are being kept quiet.       Wow - incredibly futuristic questions.  Let me try to tackle them, but please remember that I don't own a crystal ball yet to see into the future.  If anyone has one, please let me know if I can borrow it.    1) There has been concern for some time about nanomaterials in the environments.  There are, already, plenty of nanomaterials naturally occurring (soot from our forest fires, for instance, are full of nanoscale carbon and inorganic oxides), and of course rock dust, etc.  That said, I would prefer that we err on the side of caution when considering mass production of new materials, with concomitant releases into the ecosystem.  But, if the nanomaterials are confined, and accompanied with a very good quality recycling program (a la Germany, for instance), the risk is certainly minimized.  ii) CO2 emissions worry me much more with respect to warming.  Since people are talking about interfacing thermoelectrics with solar to scavenge heat and convert to electricity, perhaps this problem (and I am not sure it is really a problem) can be managed and used to its advantage to generate even more power.  Think of how many black roads we have criss-crossing the globe, and dark flat roofs - do the numbers compare?  iii) Modular interfaces - my better half is an electrical engineer, and he believes that the solutions to make interfacing easy are coming because they have to.  Remember cell phones and the staggering array of chargers and batteries for sale at Future Shop - that was awful.  If that can be avoided, we will be better off - agreed.   iv) Wireless charging, just like what Nikola Tesla himself so beautifully demonstrated over a century ago, is interesting.  What you are proposing is fascinating, and I leave it to the big-thinking electrical engineer types to work that out.    v) Solar and wind are democratic energy sources for the most part, and certainly more than fossil fuels.  Inexpensive solar will level the energy playing field - Tata in India is looking closely at solar fuels, solar energy. Look at what China is doing in the area of solar cell deployment.  I see personalized energy, enabled by solar power, as the equivalent to the cell phone - forget the landline (the power grid), and just generate your own power locally.  Now that would help global inequality, and increase the chances of long-term survival of humanity and mankind.    Agreed - in many jurisdictions, solar is cost-competitive with legacy fossil fuels.     This is one of the hot areas of renewable energy/materials science that is being tackled from two directions.  As mentioned earlier, materials genomics is a computational approach to discover new materials (which may, in fact, be old materials, or special combinations of very common materials):  https://www.materialsproject.org http://aspuru.chem.harvard.edu/the-clean-energy-project/  The second is one that involves looking at "rock materials" - compounds that are stable as rocks (because they are, in fact, rocks), abundant, and won't degrade in the sun.  I see famous people giving talks who start with a plot of earth-abundance of elements from the US Geological Survey.  It is interesting to see the push to use iron, copper, sulfur, zinc, and others - some of these materials were studied decades ago during the energy crisis of the 1970's and forgotten (zinc phosphide, iron pyrite), and others were studied by geologists and only published in tables of interest to geologists. With the power of nanoscience approaches, which enable the synthesis of nanoscale versions of these materials, these materials can then be processed as a paint-on or spray-on "ink", there is lots of optimism that these approaches are going to work - they already have led to a number of interesting leads.    Prashant Kamat talks about his Sun-Believable Paint-on Solar Cells, which are really great ideas and can be extended to any combination of elements: http://news.nd.edu/news/28047-notre-dame-researchers-develop-paint-on-solar-cells/   Sun-Believable Solar Paint. A Transformative One-Step Approach for Designing Nanocrystalline Solar Cells http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn204381g  	4
 I can't be the only one who thought when they said "shots fired at NSA" there was a heated argument at the offices of NSA   I bet she was like, "Damn my niece is crazy wanting to kill me, my fianc, her cousin, and WHAT THE FUCK THIS BITCH WANTS THE DOG DEAD?!"    "You just downloaded   opened this app, tell us what you think!"    I would love for some random bloke to find it and do something extravagant with it.   I've never been so jealous    This is the future.    COMPLETELY off topic, but how'd you get into commercials? I want/need to start, but don't know where to.. Thanks man!    the person who just died just saw the light and then came back from it.    Love when things just never get old in Lucid Dreams   	9
 ^_^ this makes me smile   pfft, i work at a pizza place, how on earth could i forget!!   There is so much wrong with what happened to you, and all I can do is give you this lousy upvote.  Heal well, emankrogh!   Coffee and beer? Sounds like a fantastic night...add in some pool and I'm totally there   Upvoted for giving upvotes :) /hands you a beer   I think STEVE was there...   There is nothing in that chamber or bowl...I think it'll be ok :)   I don't think it's disturbing either. I think it's a really neat picture and honestly, the family is probably not american. Sorry america...   i second muscat's question, why would you say that shes is a Scammer?   Hey that's a fantastic idea! I wonder if they are already doing that on closed-circuit tv out there?   Personally, I wonder what they see in Antarctica, if anything. I am surprised none of the explorers have come back with stories of what they may have seen. The sky is so clear down there because of a lack of any city lights.  ...if they are seeing anything, they don't appear to be reporting on it :(   The faces can be kinda creepy   Yeah, that video you sent me was debunked a long time ago. I'm not saying that it couldn't be real, but it could be something else. However, I am quite wary of a major sighting over a major metropolis and there is no other supporting information for it.    mmmm... I dunno... is there any corroborating evidence? Did anyone else see this? Did people call 9-1-1? Did people call the airport? Do we have any supporting film, photography, or radar? I just, I'm not convinced. This could be a really good hoax...    It's...a fake...a good one...but the shake is added in ...and just reeks of the jerusalem video...  /fake.   He's only saying it for the votes. :)   Ahh, he's running for office again I see...   Serious moral implications here...I'm not for it....   As an American, I think that Richard O'Dwyer should continue to live his life happy and free in Britain. I think that the majority of Americans would agree. I personally apologize for our asshole government, and the laws that stretch to other countries, making this place seem like a policeman of the world. Oh wait, I think we are. Sorry guys...   what is an introspection rundown??   she will be missed .  unless, of course, her new bodyguards are able to protect her   this could actually happen to her... =\   I'm kind of a paranormal magnet myself. It sounds like the things that happened to you were by far and large more violent then what has ever happened to me, or anyone around me experiencing it. I would like to hear more of your experiences. However, I have noted this: When I start to discuss these things, they seem to start happening around me with a heightened frequency. If this happens to you, then I will leave it at your discretion to discuss further   Yup yup. It's a mystery alright :)   I wish we had more control as civilians over our government. I think that the Drug War would be one of the top wars we'd end immediately if we had the actual opportunity to.   And thus brings me back around to square one! Wheee!   Yeah, I've heard it's really nice. I would have to get a car on a friday night to do that...yah...not happening lol   I don't think you are the only person that is a ghost magnet. Good luck, I wish I could give advice on this subject!!    you ever seen the fourth kind? that might be something you want to look into...   I actually saw this happen the other day. It made me less pissed off at the guy in front of me. I just moved my rage to the guy in front of him...   Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't find that there is really that much to do in Raleigh. It's kind of a lame city. Maybe I missed the fun?   LoooooL, fair enough :)   Always good to know...but what are they all up to?!   You new to reddit?   Oh, you don't like bdsm or d/s? bye bye   Good. I think this occurs more than we humans tend to think. Lots of things defend their territory, Go Chimp Rights!!   Well put. =)   :) So much better than rushing into things. Go you!   It's just a form of control... =\  But it's good to hear that you are waiting, that is much more mature than believing that this guy you just met is your one true love because he's a RM and you've been dating for three weeks. He's not your true love, that's just hormones, bone the guy and move on.   Or stay with him for years and build a solid foundation and then decide if marriage and children are what you want. :)  And you're right, it is ass-backwards, but it's really a form of control. It's kinda sadistic.    Me too. I'm glad I'm not the only girl that ever spoke out about it tho. The YW leaders in my ward always used guilt tripping techniques to get us to yield to their wishes. The kids thing always set me off. I did enjoy baking/cooking tho, it's a good skill to have seeing as how I like food haha.  =) So I guess it's not all bad! I can make a killer pineapple upside-down cake, mwahaha!   I didn't like the be a babymaker for all your life and the rest of eternity lessons being pushed so hard.  When I told my YW leaders I didn't want any children (I'm 28, I still do not), they told me that saying that made my spirit children weep. When they said it, I was pretty angry that they'd say that, and it was another nick on the wall of the church for me.   Atheism is a lack of belief in gods. In my opinion, ghosts do not a god make, nor are ghosts god(s). I've had some strange experiences that one could classify under "ghostly phenomena" and while I don't know exactly what it was, I don't think that they have to do with each other.   I'm very curious what they might find at the second Anomaly, with the "arches". I did make a joke that it's an ancient underwater McDonald's. In all seriousness tho, it is a very neat structure, whatever it is. :)   It's called the Meringue, but they don't know what it is, or what is in it (if anything)   :)   I don't see a single thing wrong with this. There are sites for people who are black, jewish, mormon, christian, some for people with fetishes, some for people with stds...  nothing to see here, move along :)   jacque cousteau clouds, very nice :)   ....looks more like the FSM... /just sayin'   having seen on close up...i'd say yes. :)   *thumbs up!*   I can't see any one of the pics...can anyone??    I disagree with you. These women do this because it makes them feel good. There are plenty of men that want a girl that looks like that. Fuck, I'm a girl and would love to look like that, it's neat! And it's different. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it doesn't squick all men...   I can give directions in relation to the ABC store. It's been my favorite place to patron since I moved in haha   All of that is awesome! When I start getting paychecks I may have to hit up some of those places.  I'll definitely hit up the Japanese place, I'm a sucker for bogo sushi. =)   ditto it hurts   I want to find this place now!!   Hey! They had those in Florida! I used to get strawberries with the cream flavor :) SOOO good on a hot day. ^.^   not really an option. would have done it already if i could have. =\   Yeah, I've been to Lake Benson, too. And Centennial park. I think my issue is really that Garner for a 28yr old, single person that just moved here, is kinda...wtf lonely. haha  I want to get out there and meet people! :) Then I could go to the park and hang out with others, instead of constantly doing it alone.   But, you wanna smooooke?   I am on r/trees all the time. But having just moved here, it's kinda hard to just walk up to random people: Hi! You toke up? You want to toke with me?  Talk about feeling forever alone :P   What?! There is a freaking bus?!?! This is actually interesting....   You know...maybe we should hold a Garner Reddit Meetup. Seems like we should all get together with some beers at the park and just have a good time getting to know people.   Yeah, ...I should probably add that going anywhere is not really possible for me. I am kind of stuck here without a vehicle to speak of. :(   how old are you? maybe we can hang out sometime?   I just moved here, know no one, I did find a job! (woot!)...but now I'd like to find something to do out here. From what I can tell, the White Deer Park is about all that is hopping so, any ideas would be nice. Thanks   edit: Thanks for the great ideas guys!! There actually are people in garner, not just married folk with kids and old people :)   Look. I'm not going to sit here and nit pick thru all this. We could eradicate humanity and the fucking world would do much better. We aren't. So we cut off some unneeded skin off the body of an infant male? Those that have had it done aren't really complaining. Deal.   Lol   wow if i wasn't all for free speech i'd report you.   I'm talking as far as the proven health benefits are concerned. If you don't want to do it to your kid, then don't. But don't be surprised if they might need it done later in life when they are actually old enough to remember it.   FGM is different. It's an invasive procedure and what we should really be against. I wish we could move this conversation in that direction. It's disgusting what they do to those little girls, and you bet your ass they remember the procedure.   That's funny coming from a forever alone.  Darwin is dead. How can he 'take care of' anyone?   also i think the mods deleted my initial comment to you. but i want to send you something:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFd4IctqZdw  it's not meant to make you feel better or worse. I just think you should hear it.    I know how I want to do it. I won't be posting about it tho when I do it. I'd much rather have people I know try to help me. I am sorry that you don't have that kind of support system for you.   FGM is actually a form of mutilation and the problems that arise from the surgery far outweigh the very very few benefits.  Circumcision for males has the opposite effect. This is something that can and has been proven.  I thought r/atheism was about being intellectual and looking at the evidence presented and making a healthy decision based on that evidence. But, with the responses I am seeing and getting, I feel like unsubscribing from r/atheism.   wow, someone didn't drink their coffee this morning. I really think they look better, and i won't fuck a guy with a non-circumcised penis. :) i just think they look nasty.   man, look, this is probably the wrong thing to say to someone about to do this, but if you are hurting and you really feel this is the only way to end your pain. then do it.  why do we keep pushing people to live when all life brings them is misery? deep, emotional, painful misery. is it because we feel that it is our duty to keep them alive like we do with vegetables? is it some kind of morality reason? i just don't know why we want to keep something that is in pain alive. if your animal was hurting and you couldn't save it, you put it down. if this person is hurting, with no way of stopping that hurt, then we should let them put themselves down. having said that, how are you planning on doing it?   If I lived near you, I'd be your friend. But I'm 28, so I dunno how you'd feel about spending time with younger folks.   Your argument is invalid, because none of what you mentioned can be used for health purposes. Not tattoos, not burning your body, or cutting off the tip of your pinky. Cutting of foreskin is a health benefit.   Really, we at r/atheism should be championing against FEMALE circumcision. Cuz that...that's real mutilation.   I lol'd   I think circumcised penises look better and definitely lack in the smegma...ewwwwwwwww  I disagree that this is a 'good' idea.   Thank you. I am trying to do what is right in this situation.   *nods*  Thank you for your input. I really think that is the point they are at, is his level of comfort. It's really a harsh place to be,as his daughter, I'd rather he live a possibly slightly shorter life, where he can be happy, eat, smile, not have to wear a diaper for the rest of his life, and so on and so forth, than use treatments that could cause just awful complications.  I won't lie, my Mom is the one pushing for this TCM Dr, and his credentials actually don't look bad.   The person who told my parents about this man, was a woman who has worked for the World Health Organization, and her husband had terminal malignant melanoma. All the top doctors this man went to said they could do nothing for him. Apparently he went to this dr, b/c he thought at this point it was a longshot but why the hell not, and two months later he was cured. That was 16 years ago. His cancer has NOT returned. So, I'm not saying this is going to happen to my father, but if he wants to believe in something, maybe mind over matter will help him to at least 'feel' better.   Some of the people that have had his medicine did die. This is in his Testimonials. But, their quality of life before they died, may have been much more liveable. I don't have the ability to sway my folks in how they choose to approach this problem. But my Mom has seen so many people undergo Radiation Hormone Therapy, and seen how it really does change a person, not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, that she does not want that for my Dad.  If you knew you only had five years left, would you spend them fighting and being constantly sick or would you want to try to live out your final years more happily? I don't know if his has spread beyond what the surgery did, it's very scary for me, but I do wish for this time to be easier on him.  I do want him to undergo treatment from a western doctor, I am not really into the energy healing, tea-drinking mumbo-jumbo. I used to think there was something to it all until I went into Massage Therapy. I saw the benefits, but a lot of it really was ... mumbo-jumbo. I just, worry. Thank you for your insight. :)   My Dad just had Prostate Cancer surgery and there is a strong possibility it has spread beyond what they were able to get. We are still waiting lab results. The night before he went into surgery he heard about this man: George Y.C. Wong http://www.georgeycwong.com/  Does anyone know anything about him? The man has a long list of credentials, and my Mom is really pushing for this vs Radiation Hormone Therapy. Now, I know that certain herbs have been shown to target cancer cells and kill them, but I am still wary on using them as a sole option.  Any thoughts, advice, or what have you, would be enormously appreciated. It's kind of a scary time for my family.    Thank you. I will ask over there.   I really wish the choice was up to me, but it isn't. I have only the ability to show my parents the facts and voice my concerns. I am not saying that what this guy has to offer won't work, but I think what they are looking for is a quality of life if it has spread. My Mom said that while she knows Radiation Hormone Therapy can work, what it does to the body is very destructive, can make men grow breasts, have hormonal mood swings, along with the other myriad of issues it can bring. So, in a way, I absolutely understand that she wants him to be as comfortable as possible.   damn.. maybe this is the wrong subreddit. I was really hoping someone would have heard of this man...   Not me, man. I'm not a Dr either, but I am totally sure they are trying to help me!

Their sandwiches will still be just as tasty.   bump to r/eldertrees   Good, can we start working on Chik-Fil-A now???   This is a very special nope.   Not really gonna go into why, but I don't think he's faking it. And if he is, he's done a fantastic job. But, I really don't think he is.   Something about this seems very legit.

Stop and Frisk - without warrant - is **exactly** what we were warned of happening if one of those evil commie countries took over and communism spread. That and listening in on our phone calls, reading our mail, etc. These were the things the KGB did.    Pheonix = 'supposedly'.    What the fuck language is that?    Being stopped for no reason is humiliating and destroys police-community relationship.  I remember being taught in school that we were fighting the Cold War because in 'those evil countries' the police could stop people on the street for no reason, spy on them, arrest them on the smallest pretense. We went to Vietnam supposedly to prevent the spread of that behavior around the world. My beloved Uncle died for this. Now to see it codified into law and todays law enforcement officers performing it is both enraging and deeply saddening.   Stop- just stop. This is not fascist/soviet Russia.   Well we know now how long Baltimore could take it. Of course they are under worse pressures than most 'mid poverty white' areas.    Wonder if Whole Foods is going to be supplying snacks to the Texas National Guard   Military during Jade Helm?

They had an outbreak of this in the southern US last year. Very painful disease.                   It's a very strange event. I wonder if they are going to have another major quake soon. I would be nervous to be there.   Promoted mind fuckery. Looks like most fell for it.  That line of 'civilians' are undercover police officers. It's a staged photo shoot.

Some came here when it became obvious that Mars was toast.   This would explain a few things, such as   1. Who were the [Denisovians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denisovan)?   2. Did Atlantis exist? Every ancient culture has an 'Atlantean' tale, myth or fable.  3. What is the origin of unique, advanced technologies that are discovered on occasion (such as the [Antikythera Mechanism](http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr))?  4. What is the origin of similar ancient stories of massive wars that occurred on earth, many of which involved [air transit and nuclear type damage](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/23630-ancient-atomic-bombs/), such as the Indian Vedas.   I have been considering this since the 1990's.    So I was watching [a video on youtube of police officers shooting a pregnant woman](https://youtu.be/UKJZanyNUhE) who had a knife.  I am always interested in comments and saw this interchange between Russians, and translated it:  English:   *Antonioni Bardzini 2 days ago*     **Once again, afraid so killed a man/woman shoot to kill, this nation can be defeated in less than a month**    *Roman Brovko 1 day ago*     Executing = fright?    *Antonioni Bardzini 1 day ago*     + Roman Brovko they could safely shoot in the legs but they always shot in the chest, let the will of man will kill.   So it is how I see this 'new generation' of police officers in the U.S.. They can't manage themselves and have a strong streak of cowardice- and so they use the gun. Interesting that others, including these Russians, now see American males as cowards.   Russian:    2 days ago           ,           Reply   2      1 day ago    = ?

Thats why Patrolman 1st Class Michael Thomas Slager, a former Coast Guardsman, fatally shot the man, the officers attorney said Monday.  Investigators collect evidence after a North Charleston police officer fatally shot a man Saturday morning.  Slager thinks he properly followed all procedures and policies before resorting to deadly force, lawyer David Aylor said in a statement.     This is a very tragic event for all of the families, Aylor said. I believe once the community hears all the facts of this shooting, theyll have a better understanding of the circumstances surrounding this investigation.  Mondays developments filled in some of the blanks in what was South Carolinas 11th police shooting of the year. Authorities publicly identified Slager, an officer with the city since December 2009, and gave his reason for the traffic stop that led to the fatal confrontation. Police documents also revealed that Slager announced within seconds why he had fired.  Shots fired, and the subject is down, he said into his radio, according to an incident report. He took my Taser.  Walter Lamer Scott, 50, of Meadowlawn Drive in West Ashley died soon after the encounter near Craig Street and Remount Road.  He has been arrested about 10 times in his lifetime, mostly for failure to appear for court hearings and to pay child support.  The only indicator of violence in his past came with his first arrest in 1987 on an assault and battery charge.  Slager, 33, served honorably in the military before joining the North Charleston Police Department more than five years ago, Aylor said.  *He has never been disciplined during his time on the force, the attorney added.*  Slager was on a boarding team when he served in the Coast Guard in Port Canaveral, Fla., his personnel file showed. The 91 pages of documents were released Monday after The Post and Courier filed a S.C. Freedom of Information Act request.  He passed courses on how to use the Taser X26 when he was hired in North Charleston and performed well on shooting tests with his .45-caliber Glock 21. Supervisors indicated in performance reviews that he met expectations as an officer and kept a tidy patrol car.  Of the two complaints in his file, one dealt with a residents allegation of unnecessary use of force.  Slager went to the mans Delaware Avenue home in September 2013 to investigate a burglary. When the resident opened the door for Slager, the burglary victim yelled that he wasnt the suspect, the documents stated.  The man also insisted that he wasnt the perpetrator, but he later told internal investigators that Slager threatened to use a Taser against him if he didnt come outside. When the man followed the order and stepped outside, he said Slager Tased (him) for no reason and ... slammed him and dragged him.  But another officer there said Slager had been forced to use the device during a struggle. The investigators exonerated Slager of wrongdoing.  Slager will keep working during a State Law Enforcement Division investigation into whether Saturdays shooting was justified, but Pryor said he would be on administrative duty.  While the police released Slagers file, one lawmaker said the episode again points out the need for body-mounted cameras whose footage can stave off community speculation.  The city is expected to get 115 of the devices through $275,000 in state funding for that and other anti-crime initiatives.  Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, said it cant come soon enough. Gilliard has authored legislation to require police agencies to outfit their officers with cameras. As an alternative, he also offered a bill calling for a study of such programs. But he expressed frustration because the measures had not advanced.  People will say Im using this (shooting) as a springboard, he said. But Ive said these types of incidents will continue, and when they do, its going to be unfortunate that we are not using modern-day technology to stop the speculation and rumors.  The authorities have not said whether anyone else saw Slagers struggle with Scott.  No one called Charleston Countys 911 Center after the gunfire, and Slagers communications with dispatchers will not be made public until SLED approves it, county spokeswoman Natalie Hauff said.  SLED spokesman Thom Berry said prosecutors also would have to review the recordings and be agreeable and amenable to their release. Quickly escalated  North Charleston community leaders have mentioned the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in urging residents not to grow violent in light of Scotts death. But, like Missouri police said of Brown, Slager saw Scott as a threat when the officer decided to pull the trigger.  Around 9:30 a.m. Saturday, Slager noticed a Mercedes-Benz sedan with a brake light that was out and not working, the police spokesman said. He stopped his cruiser behind the sedan that had pulled into Advance Auto Parts at 1945 Remount Road.  What started out as a routine traffic stop quickly escalated after the driver fled, Slagers attorney said.  Scott ran down Craig Road, which parallels the stores parking lot and stretches southward toward the Singing Pines community. A passenger in his car stayed put.  Slager told other officers through his radio that he had gotten into a foot chase, according to the report. The police have not given details about the confrontation that followed behind the Mega Pawn shop at 5654 Rivers Ave.  But with other officers on the way to help, Slager announced on his radio that he had deployed his Taser, according to the report. But it didnt work.  The statement from Slagers attorney, though, did not say that Slager actually fired the device. Aylor said he could not offer further clarification until the officer talks with investigators.  When confronted, Officer Slager reached for his Taser  as trained by the department  and then a struggle ensued, Aylor said. The driver tried to overpower Officer Slager in an effort to take his Taser. Felt threatened  Seconds later, the report added, he radioed that the suspect wrested control of the device. Even with the Tasers prongs deployed, the device can still be used as a stun gun to temporarily incapacitate someone.  Slager felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon, his attorney added.  The report indicated that Slager fired multiple times, but it was not specific.  Backup officers did first aid and CPR on Scott until paramedics showed up. But Scott was pronounced dead.  Loved ones have said that Scott was a family man who recently got engaged. They insisted that he wasnt violent.  His most serious arrests came decades ago, according to his SLED rap sheet.  County police officers arrested him in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery, and he was convicted in 1991 of possession of a bludgeon.  Ten years passed before he was arrested twice in 2001 on contempt charges. He would face several similar charges occasionally during the next decade until his last arrest in 2012.  He also had convictions from 2008 for driving under suspension and having an open alcohol container in his car.  Anthony Scott met with the police near the scene soon after his brother was shot. The report did not specify, though, whether he had been the passenger in the Mercedes.  The police took his cellphone as evidence. The next day, he promised in a public statement to find out the truth about what happened.  Dave Munday contributed to this report. Reach Andrew Knapp at 937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede.

A large number of companies capture voice prints of anybody that calls them and have been doing so for a number of years. None of them disclose that they are capturing your voice print even though they allegedly are doing so as a form of two-factor authentication. Then they can associate that voice print with accounts, purchases, etc.   When combined with voice prints from other companies it becomes easier for something like the NSA to be able to identify an individual by voice print - they don't have to have their name - regardless of whose phone they may be using. Plus that allows them to associate that individual to the person whose phone they used. That would include identifying people speaking on conference room phones where many individuals can be speaking over the same line on the same call from the same phone.   If recording devices are built to produce voice recordings using the same telephone voice structure the intelligence agencies could then potentially identify all of the people speaking in a room for example without there being a phone at all if a listening device were there or nearby.

 Yeah, it was like this in the UK when some fat, pig-faced cunt called Jade Goody died. She was a D-List "celeb" from a reality tv show called Big Brother. A talentless moron, really. Pretty sure she was accused of racism at one point. Then she got cancer and became the shining role model, a pillar of feminine strength. The papers that had so slated her before practically lauded her as a national hero when she died. Stupid, bald wanker.    Fuck me, me friend does this whenever there's a social thing. Considers herself a photographer and then rudely interrupts any conversation/activities/fun so we can all POSE for a photo. I tell her, "Your photos would look much better if we all looked natural."   I'm of the opinion that if somebody is a good photographer, you shouldn't even know they are there.

Thanks a lot. It's been killing me for three days now.   Woman holds an art exhibition where she's displaying her pictures for sale. The pictures are based around 'the breakdown of a relationship' or something. The pictures show couples in bed. She's not selling any pictures and an art critic disses her work and leaves.   As part of the exhibition, she sells her soul to the highest bidder. She then meets the dude that bought it in a cafe/diner because she wants it back. The guy says he has the contract for her soul in his underpants or something.   Any ideas?   I personally don't think girls should be called sluts at all. We shouldn't judge someone, male or female, based on their sexuality and the expression of it. It's totally natural to be very sexually active and people that are should not suffer prejudice.

On my bedside table was a mug and a glass. As I was deciding which one to use as my DIY speaker, I said to myself specifically, 'the glass will be better to use.' Picked it up.   Turned around and checked if my laundry was dry. When I looked down, I was holding the mug.   Shouted, "No. Fucking. Way". The glass was still on my bedside table.

 Good for them. I used to live next to Tufts and can say they seemed like the least apathetic/most politically aware kids in the Boston area.   I think your shift key may have some gunk weighing it down.   I hope that's it. And I really have very little against him. I just like to ignore Presidential campaign politics for as long as I can.   Holy crap, didn't see that. But this is a very old rumor, one I heard about when I was a kid. Barbara Bush's mother did meet Crowley and Aleister and Barbara look very similar.   You're spot on. And Kubrick was God. He absolutely exposed everything to anyone able to read his films. He was playing hyperdimensional chess with his audiences.   Not sure I follow you.   JFK was the last President who was foolish enough to think that the Presidency has any control over the military establishment. Stanley Kubrick said something once to the extent that you should run away in fear from anyone in power and from anyone who even wants to be in power.   At the very least, Barbara Bush is the spitting image of the Great Beast.      I wonder if it's easier to get on the front page from conspiracy in terms of lower vote count than from other subs?

Obviously a piece that was originally published in the New York Times was hardly a secret, but it came in the pre-digital age and deserves to be discussed in a forum where people haven't been completely lulled to sleep when it comes to discussing the reality of the military and its actions.   More like 14 to 18 year old boys because that's the age group they need to get to in order to have a chance at these guys entering the recruitment pool. Older than that and recruitment gets harder and harder.   Sorry to hear about that. A lot of what drives my interest in military issues is how Vietnam vets were treated when I was a kid. I used to talk with a lot of those guys and it pissed me off for life.  Gulf War syndrome was very widespread and played down. The official explanation was that soldiers got sick from burning oil fumes. The reality was there were a lot of chemicals released/bombed. The whole region was and is a toxic wasteland. Which reminds me, I've been meaning to post some stuff on depleted uranium.   You mean [this guy](http://www.mediaite.com/online/excuse-me-shut-up-bernie-sanders-defends-israel-from-town-hall-hecklers/)?   There was so much disgusting stuff that happened in the first Gulf War, and it just got presented to the public like it was some kind of easily won video game. It was all pretty brutal.   U.S. Army Buried Iraqi Soldiers Alive in Gulf War By ERIC SCHMITT,  Published: September 15, 1991 WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 United States Army forces buried alive scores of Iraqi soldiers in their trenches in the early hours of the allied ground attack that ended the Persian Gulf war, Army commanders said this week.  The deaths took place during the operation in which American M1-A1 tanks of the First Infantry Division cut lanes through a 10-mile-wide stretch of barbed wire, minefields, bunkers and trenches north of the Iraqi-Saudi Arabian border on Feb. 24 as the allied ground offensive unfolded.  Army officials said the Iraqi soldiers who died remained in their trenches as plow-equipped tanks dumped tons of earth and sand onto them, filling the trenches to insure that they could not be used as cover from which to fire on allied units that were poised to pour through the gaps. Avoiding Hand-to-Hand Combat  The Army said it knew the operation would kill Iraqis who did not surrender or otherwise get out of the way, but said the tactic spared the lives of American soldiers who would have had to leave the safety of their armored vehicles and fight Iraqi troops hand to hand in the trenches.  "People somehow have the notion that burying guys alive is nastier than blowing them up with hand grenades or sticking them in gut with bayonets," said Col. Lon Maggart. "Well it's not."  Colonel Maggart, commander of one of two brigades that led assaults on a key line of Iraqi defenses, said in a telephone interview from Fort Riley, Kan., that between 80 and 250 Iraqis had been buried alive. Army officials said the First Infantry's experiences had been the only incidents of live burials during the war.  At a news conference here on Thursday, the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, defended the tactic and said it did not violate the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of warfare. "I don't mean to be flippant, but there's no nice way to kill somebody in war," Mr. Williams said.  The disclosure of the live burials, which were first reported in Newsday this week, seems likely to add to the debate about how forthcoming the Pentagon has been in providing details about the toll suffered by the Iraqi Army at the hands of American forces.  Army officials strongly denied any attempts to hide the breaching operation, and pointed out that senior commanders had given extensive interviews about the maneuver after the war.  Journalists in combat pools were assigned to the First Infantry during the breaching operation, but none of their reports mentioned the live burials. In fact, the reports noted that few slain Iraqis had been visible in the bunkers and trenches.  The Pentagon has provided no official estimate of Iraq's overall casualties. The Defense Intelligence Agency issued a heavily qualified analysis in June estimating that 100,000 Iraqis had been killed and 300,000 wounded in the war but said the figures had a 50 percent margin of error.  Breaching operations are among the most dangerous maneuvers for ground troops. Obstacles like minefields and barbed wire can slow advancing forces, leaving them particularly vulnerable to enemy attack.  Colonel Maggart said two the First Infantry units had punched 16 tank-width lanes in the Iraqi defenses.  In most cases M1-A1 Abrams tanks mounted with a plow were positioned on either side of and parallel to the Iraqi trenches, the colonel said. The ditches were typically several hundred yards long, three feet wide and four feet deep. Operating like snowplows, the tanks drove alongside the ditches, filling them in. Colonel Maggart said that in most cases, Iraqi troops had enough time to see the plows coming, jump out of the trenches and surrender. Gunners Beside Plow Tanks  For those Iraqi soldiers who continued to resist from outside the trenches, Bradley fighting vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns and 25-millimeter cannon drove alongside the plow tanks, Colonel Maggart said.  "The Iraqi soldiers that were killed in this process were those that chose to stay in their trenches or behind obstacles and fight during the breaching operation," Mr. Williams said. But neither Colonel Maggart nor Mr. Williams said how they could be sure that wounded Iraqi soldiers had been able to get out of the trenches in time.  Colonel Maggart estimated that the Iraqi forces he had faced had numbered between 800 and 1,000 -- the 110th Brigade of the 26th Iraqi Infantry Division -- and had had four T-55 tanks. No one was killed in Colonel Maggart's brigade, which consisted of 5,222 soldiers, 125 M1-A1 tanks and more than 50 Bradle fighting vehicles.  He said that the daytime breaching operation, including the ditch filling, had been completed in about three hours, and that the brigade had continued its advance after securing its breach zone, an area of roughly 35 square miles.     That's why I come here!       Thank you, I've been looking for info about this.   I can't watch NFL because of the blatant, non-stop militaristic propaganda.      They talk about this shit on NBC and never mention Building 7? Seriously, why don't they just tell me which brain vat is mine so I can just lie down in it now.   That could have ended very differently.    I thought that was the theme of every day on here!   I'm not sure I agree with him about video games being to blame. I think it's too easy to demonize these games. In my opinion, porn is more of a culprit along with chemicals in the environment.      Seriously, watch it. It's fucking shocking stuff.      Good Canadian documentary on this: [The Disappearing Male](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-disappearing-male/)   Those ARE the beautiful ones. They're beautiful because they spend all their time obsessively grooming themselves instead of trying to survive.   Great find. I would like to see a lot more solid info about the growth of these companies on this sub.

It's weird. I mean the guy doesn't offend the core of my being or anything, but at the end of the day he's a politician.   If you don't believe this kind of technology is possible, research MKULTRA and particularly Dr Jose Delgado and look at what he was able to achieve as far back as 1965 with mind control of a bull: [bull experiment]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa2FvH7ojBM   Thanks! Much appreciated.   Thanks!   That's interesting. Can you refer me to any other reading critical of AI?   Consider the astonishing coincidence that the two musicians most active in the Anti-Vietnam War movement - Joan Baez and Phil Ochs - both developed late adult onset multiple personality disorder which is just extremely rare in people over thirty years of age. Consider the possibility that Hendrix was killed because he turned political over the war. His manager Mike Jeffery was likely an agent in MI5.          any links to such raids?         He's talking about opponents of climate change! He's not admitting to spending that money! Don't be thick.   I call bullshit. The title is just wrong. I'm no fan of the CFR but I am a fan of truth. The CFR members are discussing the millions spent by the carbon energy industry to distort the debate on climate change. Whatever opinion you may hold on that debate, they are simply not admitting in this video that the CFR is spending millions to intentionally distort the debate.   There are so many things you could post about the CFR that would criticize its activities that would be truthful, why resort to lying in your title? THis kind of propaganda, because that's what you're doing, doesn't help people in any way.   Very disturbing stuff. Needs to be discussed more on here.   These systems break when they run out of fuel. I think our job is to be as ready as possible for the day that comes because it will be intense.   Serious answer, and this is from personal experience: start with your own life and see how much control you can take back in that. A big change for me has been diet. I eat healthier food now than I used to, I think more clearly. I do more things because I have more energy. Some of these things are for myself, some for others. People need to reach out to each other more. This isn't just hippy BS, this is the only way to replace enormous inhuman systems. Stuff like diet and exercise can be as political as anything. Talking to people is a political act when the powers that be are happy for us to be at each others throats. Above all, educate each other. There is no system we need, just a million common sense things that humans used to do naturally.   Thanks man, nice to be called young once in a while!   I think that at the level of the people who control banking and policy, profit isn't the biggest goal. They create money out of the air as it is, so I can't believe profit means everything to them. I think they use profit for their ultimate goal which is control. Powerful people like to control other people. We're everything to them. We're their toys.   Right now the public is a bank utility.   The alternative is already there. It's who people already are. We just need large scale systems to get out of their way. We don't need the old systems replaced with new systems. I don't want to replace one elite with another one.   Then you're one of the lucky ones. And seriously, good for you. I have no problem with that. But some of the places I've been in America have been disheartening in the extreme. Places where all the jobs have been sucked out and sent abroad and the local police maintain law and order by basically considering all the poor people who are left there as criminals. We could do a lot better than this.   It reminded me of that old show Dark Shadows. Very aristocratic. Mind you, we were just there for the beach.   Why would the lack of empire make you suffer? Your life might improve markedly.    I stand corrected. And for those monitoring this conversation: I won't do it again.   Hedges has outlined alternatives repeatedly in his books and articles and on Truthdig. He may skim over it here, but he isn't some nihilist.   But what if the dead priest was actually a saint, and by some miracle his body is still there fifty years later smelling of roses? What then?    Agreed. Just in comparison, the minerals buried in the ground in Afghanistan are off the charts.   Replace it by decentralizing and focusing on the local and the communal. For example, take apart the agribusiness infrastructure in America to focus on smaller farms delivering produce locally. The food gets tastier and healthier, work gets created in the process. Or better yet, focus on people growing their own food as used to happen. Take this example and apply it to any major system, you can find great alternatives to the top down model. Health care, criminal justice, education, everything works better when the starting point is local rather than national/ international.      Very creepy, but this is already a reality here in many ways both seen and unseen. Credit scores are a huge way of controlling people's behavior for example. God knows what kind of scores the intelligence agencies keep on us.   From the piece:  If you want change you can believe in, destroy the system. And changing the system does not mean collaborating with it as Bernie Sanders is doing by playing by the cooked rules of the Democratic Party. Profound social and political transformation is acknowledged in legislatures and courts but never initiated there. Radical change always comes from below. As long as our gaze is turned upward to the powerful, as long as we invest hope in reforming the system of corporate power, we will remain enslaved. There may be good people within the systemSanders and Elizabeth Warren are examplesbut that is not the point. It is the system that is rotten. It must be replaced.       And who cleans up that mess? Whoever has to clean up the entrails can hardly be called free. More wage slavery in my opinion.   Don't be fooled. Heroin is small potatoes. Afghanistan has always been about the trillion dollars in minerals they want to extract from the ground there.   Am I still Charlie? What am I this time?

Dave McGowan's Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon really raises some unsettling questions about mind control ops in the counter culture back then.   I suppose there are kids who dream of becoming anchormen or anchor people... whatever they call it now. Or the kids who want to grow up so they can work at call centers cold calling for debt collectors.   Isn't this the bunch that gave Bill Clinton his start in life?   Another disturbing aspect of Jonestown - among the many - was the connection between Jim Jones and Dan Mitrione, who was the CIA agent who basically taught South American police how to torture:[Dan Mitrione](http://jimhougan.com/wordpress/?tag=dan-mitrione). Jones was the guy's protege from the age of twelve in Indiana.   That's why when people use the phrase "drink the Koolaid" they don't understand how tragic it is. No one committed suicide. There were a thousand people murdered at Jonestown. Most disturbing of all is the possibility that the whole thing was connected to MKULTRA and was basically a mind control experiment that got out of hand.

There are so many great things you could do in this world.    That's brilliant!   Me too. Amazing how much fresh material there was after so many years and all the research into the assassination. Jonestown is so unsettling, especially the links to the CIA who seem to have been on the ground there as the killings were going on.   True story, I swear... my wife and I were driving through Maine and went into Kennebunkport where the Bush family has its summer home.

You must not remember Daikatana   Arguing about fighter generations is like arguing whether the Xbone or PS4 is more next gen.  Pointless.   Fly her apart, then!   Bing!  It might help developers somewhat but honestly it's not very relevant until there's a wider release.  Plus it's already been posted about all over the place here on Reddit.  	102
 FUCK PENNY ARCADE Gotham is great!   you just made an enemy FOR LIFE!!!!!   i mean its like the world is trying to convince me that "you are not allowed to like this show, people wont like you for it!" type of thing, and its like the rave reviews dont come from review fairies people!! (bruno heller: i wish my new show had rave reviews. Fairie: your wish has been granted) theyre from all natural real human persons!!! i hate what i hear from you people "its bad because theres no batman" "some actors arent the right age" i mean its bad enough that there are people who dislike the marvel universe movies (and i avoid them as much as possible, and if i DO come across them, they make an enemy for life.) am i bad for liking a show? i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE TIME it doesnt meet your petty expectations youll make an enemy FOR LIFE!! if anyone has a good reason why i should or shouldnt like gotham, dont hesitate to explain why. thank you  EDIT:dear god, why do i keep asking for permission to like stuff i should know better by now   i chose GOT as an example because that and veep are the only two shows i can think of that are not in their final seasons, with like true blood and boardwalk empire ending   i mean HBO still PLAYS movies, but now people want it for the shows, its like the movies they play are just filler for when GOT comes back on  EDIT:*for UNTIL GOT comes back on   in case you dont know who doug jones is check this link out!  http://imgur.com/gallery/h8A09QY  EDIT: since no one yet has said it i say he plays beerus   because i yearn for a smart imdb user to be conceived, but its all ignorance and insults, which is why i have no imdb account of my own because they are MONSTERS theyre not people      1993: oh wow! thats that guy from that movie i liked, its a huge honor that theyre on the simpsons!  2014: man, you need to be THAT desperate for a PAYCHECK, to be on the simpsons   i have a sucky imagination though   i know of the audio dramas, id check them out but i prefer a tv show   because i watched all 800+ episodes (and i do mean all) and no episode mention propane, to my recollection   you know it really stinks that doctor 8 didnt get a full series, because man i watched the tv movie and reminded me of the x files, and i thought man if this was a full show, the x-files wouldve been the perfect lead in show   But this one is here to stay, I swear   Oh there's others but this user sticks out like a sore thumb, I think he has an agenda and writing plans as we speak         You actually keep track how many times you say something? Damn talk about keeping track.   Because I feel very unsafe and I need holding and protection. The haters are out to get me. So I ask is it ok if I like the new movies to be into Star Trek at all? Because I feel that I have the right to say what I think is right. That's all, so I ask will I ever see another Star Trek watcher who likes the new movies? And am I wrong for doing so? I say this from the bottom of my heart. I mean I feel as if I say EVEN ONE POSITIVE THING, people want me executed or something, I just want people to enjoy the new movies, and Talk to them, is that so wrong, anybody know any whiskeys good for binging in one sitting?  P.S. At least this isn't imdb the users are probably not even people, they're MONSTERS (in a literal and hypothetical sense)      because people influence other people   not until they make 28 seconds, minutes, or hours later first   Man, What a dummy I am for not being aware of those subreddits   Ok that was a pretty funny response actually          good dentist: oh man, i hope the people who go there brush and floss regularly  bad dentist: ALRIGHT!!! job security!      i can never tell whether i like his movies or not, but this looks nice   sounds like i have ALOT to learn apparently   *haters people, but what that makes sense though, but then when i say it civilized i STILL get downvoted, what gives?   whats the point of expressing my opinion if im just gonna be called an idiot, or a moron, and insulted? i thought trekkers were supposed to be for tolerance!!! i cant say ANYTHING good bout the new movies without being seen as a skinhead or something, its just not fair! so on behalf of your franchise and your fandom i bid you all, GOOD FUCKING LUCK!!      because ive never heard any one character whether in the games, the anime, manga, etc... mention or drink moonshine which leads me to wonder, is there moonshine in the pokemon universe, hey this is making me be in the mood for a mixed drink   if adrian monk has a germ phobia, why does he work as a homicide detective?   I've said things like "I wish all reboot haters die horrible painful deaths", I called them jerks, pussies, fags you name it. I just wish people were more grateful about new str trek and weren't jerk to people who do like them, that's all. Hear me out people are probable planning to downvote me already, but I NEED TO KNOW, IS OK IF I LIKE THE JJ ABRAMS STAR TREK MOVIES OR NOT!!!!! And is it ok if I like the writing I the new movies?! And is it ok if I look forward to Star Trek 3 with bob orci directing? Again, hear me out I'm speaking as a movie fan and sci fi fan with an honest heart.   reninds me of porygon   ive heard of cd burning, but this is ridiculous      producer: i wanna make a movie that revolves around a scene where patton oswalt chokes the chicken, and pair him up with one of those lesser insignificant guys from goodfellas  other guy: but sir, wont patton oswalt spanking the monkey repulse people?  producer: DAMMIT MAN I DONT WANT EXCUSES! get me a shitty script with unlikeable characters, a whiny protagonist, and a fapping patton oswalt, NOW!   Hey man I like marvel movies, I don't wanna get insulting, When I get insulting I get mean   Whenever a new sci fi movie comes out there's always the usual "it's not like the source material" "this'll be worse than the prequels" "the director isn't good" "that ship wouldn't work in real life" why is it so hard to like Star Trek or Star Wars?when there's all these little pussies who call themselves "fans"? I can't go 5 internet articles on sci fi without finding those people,is the universe TRYING to tell me something? Am I doomed to live a living hell as a sci fi fan? Are people TRYING to make a dons smaller? Please tell me someone   dat ass on the second one   bill murray in zombieland   all the ones with Doug Jones   NOW you're talking!!      Ok so this prequel for professor oak first act is the usual going to college, graduating, earning his phd, getting married, having kids, having grand kids (Gary), and (establishing) a laboratory, and then later on professor oak finds a stray pichu, he brings it back to his lab, and he studies it an researches it and finds out it evokes into pikachu, so then he tries many methods to make it evolve which are unsuccessful, and then on the night before Gary and ash get their own pokemon that we're all familiar with there's a break in at the lab (possible by team rocket) an professor oak runs to the lab, then he sees the pichu he's been trying to get to evolve is fending off the theives with its electrical shocks. and all the pokemon are  unharmed and then we see the pichu start to glow that white color were all familiar with and much to professor oaks delight is celebrating on the inside of its victory. And before cutting back to the evolving pichu, professor oak then says to himself "I hope it'll stay in its pokeball." And then we cut back to the still evolving pichu, and cut to black. ROLL CREDITS what do you guys think?   *oil SPILL  	49

 I had this crush on a girl in high school for years. After we graduated she said to me, "I really like you and wished you would have asked me out."  I told her at that time my feelings for her and about the crush and she said, "oh I was just kidding around I didn't really mean that" and she walked away laughing.   OP is really the vandal!   All it takes is one little fight.   winner!    Often called pears....   The bathroom at Lafayette Coney Island in Detroit..   Anyone who has been there knows what I'm talking about..   The walk to the bathroom is terrifying. If you survive the trip you must then attempt to avoid hitting your head on the pipe that is in the bathroom. Once successfully completed beware of the cockroaches coming to take advantage of you with your pants down.

 I love reading! It has always played a massive part in my life. I've been writing a lot since around the age of 15. I am now 18 and I'm editing my first novel.  A good friend of mine is editing helping me and she is overwhelmingly positive. though when I read my work, I find it hard to not compare it to the books that I love, which are always significantly better. I"m wondering if others feel this way about there writing? And if so, how do you approach these feelings?     I would say don't give up on the idea of survivors if that is what you want, it may seem that there is no way but perhaps there is  a way which will think up while you're in the shower one day. Its always ok to rewrite the ending. Also I think a less depressing kill everyone off would be something whereby everyone devoted their resources to the survival of a specific individual or everyone collectively just sits down in one another's arms and accepts their fate.    Thank you for your honesty. I Think this is a really great example of how a work of fiction can provoke some major change within people and their perceptions of the world.    My Grandfather loved Nevil Shute! I believe they exchanged letters for a small period of time in the late 50s. My grandfather was an engineer as well and would not read any other fiction.   For me personally it would be the novels of Aldous Huxley, Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, and Chuck Palahniuk's Lullaby. All of these have changed the way I see the world and I find it strange, that I once had not been influenced by them.  	5

 So glad I just moved to Raleigh :)   Megaman Legends 3 :(   Beat me to it. Dammit.   Can you imagine if Bowser was the good guy and Mario was a villain?   She's legitimately nuts. I found out shortly after hooking up with her, twice. She held a knife to her ex boyfriends throat when he wanted to sleep for work the next day instead of having sex, I told her that was it between us the next day. I received CONSTANT calls for the next couple days, then it turned occasional calls. Finally, nothing. Fast forward two years, she now has a baby and (to my knowledge at the  time) she had just broken up with her boyfriend. Also at this time, it had been awhile for me and I had a couple drinks. She called me with the sole intention of having sex, so stupid me went and did it....twice again. It was the same thing, oh why don't you wanna be with me until finally she let loose. "Fuck you asshole, my boyfriend will be here any minute and he's gonna know about this!" I laughed directly in her face and saw myself out of there. He calls me twenty minutes later, I told him my side, he ended up staying with her and not really being pissed at me. Fast forward to now (almost ten years since we originally hooked up). In the past year she has contacted me, seemingly friendly. Until she starts asking questions like, "Do you think it could still work between us?" and other stupid, bat-shit crazy things like that. I respond the same way I always have for the past 9 years. "Nah, we are two different people, would've never worked." Today, I just moved from PA to NC the other day, somehow she caught wind and was all "Oh I'm gonna miss you I wish we could've been together, at least one last time before you move." HUNG UP immediately.    So yea, that bitch is still crazy.   Have you seen her recently? I'll have sex with any female 46 yr old if they look as incredible as her. Also, Kate Upton would be up next, she's only 20. :)   Dammit, there goes my plans for the weekend.   Born, died, revived, got older, didn't become handicapped as expected. Experimented with a lot of drugs, still not handicapped, now I'm a network engineer.   Anyone? Sex. Definitely  Look out Jennifer Aniston.   I was walking to 7th grade math class when a commotion quickly swept the school, so fast that it seemed like the whole school found out and knew about this in between periods (about 7 minutes). I sat down and the teacher told us that it was now a study hall, and we all just watched the news in shock, and the rest of my classes for the duration of  the day all turned into study hall's while we just watched the news in every class. About halfway through the day, our principal came over the loudspeaker to announced exactly what happened, and that we will have the news on every TV in the building, so we can be up to date with such a brutal moment in our nations history.   :D   "and for JaMarcus Russell to continue to underperform."  Boy, they put that REALLY nicely. I still wake up in the middle of the night from that nightmare.   Raghib "The Rocket," Ismail   Trust me on this, nobody forgot about Nnamdi in Philly.

 This song is the best original song by a Queen besides Ru's IMO, excluding Willam's because they're parodies.     omg i totally forgot about the word blooper   I want Harry as an auror, perhaps some new big baddie is emerging... Maybe Voldemort could return? If J.K. decides to do it, it'll be good. I have no doubts.    I was always disappointed that they didn't reveal who the marauders were, I always thought the twist reveals at the end of PoA were amazing, I couldn't believe how they left so many out of the film.   I also would have loved to see Dobby and Winky in Goblet of Fire, as well as the Sphynx.   I would have loved to have seen Wormtail have his hand choke himself to death.  Peeves.   I always wish they would have included Nearly Headless Nick's birthday in CoS.   And my biggest pet peeve with the movies is when Snape just shushes Harry before he goes up to kill him. In the book, Harry's under the invisibility cloak and is completely immobile, he would never have just let Snape shush him, he would have fought right away. Plus, it's so much more dramatic with Harry wanting to fight but not being able to... And when you find out it was Dumbledore's plan it just makes that moment so intense for me. One of my favorite moments in the books, devastating, but riveting. The movie's version was pretty lame compared to the book.    do you go to beverly?   pretty sure it was   Terrifying.       it looks like shes saying "put ur hands"   I love how some people on nofap are all like OMG I JUST REALIZED WOMEN ARE PEOPLE TOO BECAUSE I STOPPED MASTERBATING.    I saw him walking down the street once, he was golder than the fucking sun. Guy is obsessed with looking tan. I never watched west wing, but Social Network and Newsroom are fucking shitty and pretentious.    God, this show is for pseudo intellectuals. Hate it.    I LOVE JOAN NOW. "Don't get so FUCKIN' smart."   Wow. Love it.       Did he also buy your meth?   Some of those characters look nothing like anything in the hebrew alphabet.    LOL   video = awesome. song = oh god.    Great to hear! Hope you enjoy!   So... I start off by slicing the mushrooms into little slices and chopping the onions up to the size I want. I then take a pan and spray some organic olive oil spray, I use spectrum, but there are many brands. I usually have it at a high heat at first, then bring it down and up according to what else I'm doing in the kitchen. I put the mushrooms and onions in. I let them cook, sometimes with a lid, sometimes not, depends on how fast they're cooking, the onions seem to dry up before the mushrooms, so I usually put a lid after a minute for 3 -4 minutes, then take it off so they dry up a little. Then once they're all brown and a little burnt (I like them like that), I put a new pan on the stove, put the onions and mushrooms on after giving it another spray, then add the egg whites and broccoli and voila.    I don't really like Dylan McDermott but I always thought Booker looked just like him.       purple?   Filet mignon is really lean. It's less than 280, theres about 50 calories from the onions and mushrooms.   edit: nvm, i guess i'm wrong. some sites told me one thing, and others are now saying another.... i'm assuming it's somewhere between 400 - 700 calories. sorry. i''m still new to this.    Be careful of carbs!!! I know how it feels to lose a bunch of weight really fast just to find when I go back to having even the tiniest amount of carbs I end up binging for days. ANYWAYS YOU ROCK!   15 miles?! Shit man! You rock!      I just started making fart noises with my mouth. I stopped and said sorry, then it happened again.    You're crazy to think girls never ever hit on guys. Just cause it hasn't happened to you doesn't mean girls try to get guys attention.    some people aren't on reddit 24/7.   I showed this to my Dad and he got really disturbed and started saying the guy was a pedophile... I kind of see it.    Thank god.. I was WTFing way too hard.    I would like to see this film.   I think this guy just beat John Sakars.   hey, i deleted this because i dont know why this took so long to show up but i reposted it and it appeared... you can find it on the front page of this subreddit.    L M A O   All I can think of is Vice City.    How'd you keep the fish from going bad?    tell us more please   Looks like some Doctor Who shit.    ah... upvote for you   I felt like this a little during season 2 when she was bitching and moaning about little shit, but towards the end I really sympathize and feel bad for her. I, did however, kind of hate the actress when season 4 started cause she looked like she gained 20 pounds in what was supposed to be 24 hours. I got over it though.    I mean, that's what I thought, but it wasn't explicit. But it's definitely what I thought. I even think the actor alluded to it once in an interview I saw.    what is this from? it's awesome   huh      wtf   I really think Frank wanted Russo to be Governor but then Claire fucked it up when she met with those two senators and told them to vote against the bill. That's when Frank needed to intervene.    I wasn't trying to undermine him, I wanted to know about his experience. All i got was he got 100 days. Id like to hear how his life is different.    oh god i gotta see this movie that shit is SCARE E!!!!   I love the elizabeth pic but am I the only one who doesn't like the icons in ios7? they looks like some google bullshit. i love my glossy icons on my phone.    and?   i want one... too cuteeee   stop   except that he is... http://cdn02.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2008/08/kevin-spacey-butt.jpg   I was just discussing this with a friend and he didn't read the scenes at the academy the way I did. I really felt that the dialogue was alluding to some sort of sexual history between Frank and his pal. "Pleasing you" and "Yeah, but have you got somebody special?" and the "Come chill and let's go boating alone wink wink", really made me feel Frank was either gay or at least bisexual. The friend seemed to have some hardcore longing for Frank, and Frank, seemed too intensely into his job to even be willing to put something as dumb as lust before his career. As we know we haven't had many if any openly gay politicians in high places. I really liked it and I don't care if it comes back or not, but I was wondering if any of you read it that way too. My friend was kind of convinced after I told him and he said "Oh, maybe Zoe will uncover it or something" which could be interesting. What do you guys think?   Nah, I feel like, if he's producer it's still a higher quality comedy. At least ever since Knocked Up. They're still his films.    This would be an awesome way to start a Mario game.    It's got some nice cinematography, great comedic acting, a great script, nice music, good themes. It's quite a step above from your typical everyday comedies. As most of Judd Apatow's films are, but this one is still my favorite. I was also a big fan of This is the End. Including this with Pineapple Express and it's like a spiritual trilogy about best friends.    shaunie who smokes duh   I love you.    this topic is over 2 months old      I love it, but can I also get a link to the original outer space pic?   Oh, god, I hope Saul is okay.    Upvote for Harry Potter.    Kate has been excellent in HoC.    I like that Jim and Claire "tell each other everything", or basically, they fuck other people to use them slash get ahead. They're really hardcore.    How many calories do you think it is? It looks tasty.    It's weird but I feel like it would be a just as appropriate title. I haven't watched Game of Thrones yet, I'm still reading the first book, but when I was watching House of Cards I kept saying to myself, wow, Game of Thrones is so good. I feel like it could have easily been called Game of Thrones, but I feel House of Cards will be the best title once shit hits the fan, which I'm assuming it will.    I'm pretty sure it was Call of Duty.    He was always a pawn to me. He was never great, not a hero. His run for governor was all at the demand of Frank. Russo was just easy to control.    Definitely. I think he just played the cards he had. Murder was not plan a, b, or c, in my thinking. I think, it just occurred to him how easy it would be and he had to seize the opportunity literally moments before he did it. After the drunken interview Russo was too much of a liability for Frank's reputation and was becoming a pest with his threatening to come clean about everything.    Read this topic.    Did anybody read the word LOVE in there? Cause I certainly do.    I wanna see the movie.    Doin' evil. Lookin' cute.    John! He's not claiming it as his own. AND WE LOVE YOU ON REDDIT! JOHN SAKARS 2016!!! Or whenever Canada does that shit. I LOVE YOU!!!!   I mean.. I'm not sure if I get her point... I mean... She could easily keep all her jobs if she was hypothetically sending pussy pics to some random person on her phone under an alias? As long as it wasn't to a student or other employee... Am I wrong?

I read this earlier today when I was in a place where fapping was not a viable option, and it resonated more and more through out the day... I guess, I technically have 20 hours now... I'm not gonna wait till Monday now. I was in some social scenarios today and I wish I was more on my a-game. Thanks for the wise words.    stfu, chucky is awesome   STFU CHUCKY IS AWESOME   I don't care about the characters. Like. The series finale was all about the characters. I care about the plot twists and magic.    can they please fix the final season please?   Well Russo being from the same state as the VP was luck.    What a story, Mark!   Get over it.    I'm gonna rewatch it later... Thanks. I think it was kind of like, hey, look, I have some power, but it isn't really accomplishing anything, and could make him look like a fool... But actually, I kind of like it...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgrFTu6KTI   In Glendale, California there are luxury apartments in a mall. People sit on their balconies, living their lives, with their epic views of people buying shit. Always makes me WTF. You can kind of tell in this photo. On the weekends this place is PACKED.   http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lTgMRVHZz98/TOiWIEZd7fI/AAAAAAAAAAU/vNkYEwoF_OU/s1600/DSC00811.JPG      I get that. I just don't see how SanCorp can afford to seize enough property to affect Tusk if they're not as powerful A, and B, if Tusk becomes VP, they're still going to own nuclear companies... The more I think about it I get it's in SanCorps interest to derail Tusk becoming VP, it's just, how. I guess buying some of his companies makes sense to make him make sure things dont go into a blind trust...    I think what I'm a little gray about is what Underwood wants SanCorp to think they're gaining by overtaking these subsidiaries? Stopping Tusk, controlling Tusk (would that do that?)? It just sounded like a waste of money for SanCorp and a desperate plea from Underwood who isn't really one to beg, and is now, all of a sudden on SanCorp's side.     Underwood tries to get Danton to convince SanCorp to initiate a hostile takeover of the subsidiaries of Tusk's nuclear organisations.  That part, how / why would SanCorp seize Tusk's property if they're separate corporate entities? And substantially smaller than Tusk's business? And why would Remy have SanCorp seize these subsidaries all for the benefit of what? To have leverage over Tusk if he becomes VP? Perhaps that's it. Or perhaps to block him from becoming VP...?   Well, I recently lost 20 days.... Chaser effect.... But anyway.... I've been a lot more content than I was before... With my fapping that is. Anybody experience that? I have been fapping too much though. I plan on resetting on monday and trying to go on another streak till I get some good sex.    I miss the old myspace. Still better than facebook piece of shit. My fucking mom is on facebook. I will rue the day she's on reddit.    Michael Phelps was amazing.    I love him.   I think the VP thing was just blind luck. At the time of the DUI he wasn't thinking he would be able to get Russo to run for Governor and then kill him and get the Vice President to run in his place to secure the democrat majority in the house and then become the new Vice President. Maybe, in a crazy, 15th possibility of the events that were possible when he found out about the DUI, but at the time of it he just needed somebody who would do anything for him. He was mad about things early into the Presidency, needed to show he has power by having control over major events, and by the end of the season, luck had it that he was able to orchestrate such a big power play that he ends up in an even better position than Secretary of State.    How was it that Frank envisioned SanCorp going after Tusk's nuclear company? That part I wanted to understand a little better.    I like your reading of it, it could also be symbolic of Frank hurting Claire's cause with the clean water program. She's just his tool, he could care less of her ambitions, it's all about his.    In the Weiner age would it even matter?   I do. It really makes me realize how great the show is when I can love Francis, but at the same time see what a monster he is. At times I want him to succeed, but in the end I want to see the House of Cards fall. Not for moral reasons but for entertainment. Maybe he'll be President or something. Would be epiccccc.    I literally read this in Frank's voice. Not purposely, it just sounded exactly like something Frank would say.    Yeah, I noticed that too. Also, it seemed like he was playing the same game on two different systems. I dunno... Really nitpicky cause everything was so great.    So true.   Another moment that made me yell at the screen was when Claire met with Remy against Frank's wishes. I just kept saying. "You bitch! You whore! You fucking bitch!!!!"   Dat look of euphoria.    WTF   That is literally the scariest thing I've ever seen.    Contender for ugliest dog ever.    Flower and dragon were the best. The blue bionic dog was just shameful.

 One of the few situations where I dont mind being trans. Gettin my insider information from my undercover years~~~   I could care less about all these word crimes.   My mom spent most of her 40s trying to look younger. It was rather amusing, but she never went to the extremes yours did.  I referred to her as "Susan" after the character from the Narnia books who does just that :)   Oh yea, I get tons of these. I'm worse than most, as almost anything reminding me of my mom sends me into a full blown panic attack. And I'm talking normal stuff like hugging, the song "Let it go" and the scent of roses.  Triggers are common, very common. How you deal with them is up to you, but for most people it required external help. The first step, as usual, is recognizing the problem.  Good luck!  	4
 Ez Tron skins Ez life   If you dislike the map looks, point out your opinion below on why.    I'll check it out.   No. D:   I'll do an open playtesting on Mapcore, check that website out for all the cool mapping stuff.   I used it as a refference for inspiration, it's not totally a rip-off. The actual place is real and it exists in UAE. Most of structures in screenshots are based on refference photos i found on Google. I'm unsure about posting links in comments on this website, so if you'd like to see the photos PM me.  Moving on, I'm not sure whether people hate or like the maps looks. I can scrap the map anytime and make another generic facility/cache style one.    Ez Tron skins Ez life      The tower doesn't make sense. I'd rather make it into some old ruined temple or something.  It's very nice for the first map though!   I'm just joking. No need to hype up.   De_OpticGamingCOD   volvo pls.   Since I don't know the guy i can't blame, but clips don't make you a pro. Just like my friends thought I'm Global Elite cause i got a few lucky wallbangs and uploaded them.   Okay, I hate to be nit-picky about the map design over-all but here's a few pointers and suggestions.  * The overview is bad, you need to highlight parts which you can access and which you cannot, Bombsites and Spawns.  * Map lacks clipping, players can get out of bounds pretty easily.  * Try to make arches round instead of "triangle-ey" looking.  * Players hate dust and fog.  * Use info_particle_system for dust instead of func_dustcloud. it looks way better and is less intrusive.   * Each choke-point should provide a decent amount of cover with pros and cons. You might get to a good spot but CTs would still be able to counter you. Kinda like Rock - Paper - Scissors.  * You can find entities in Hammer (Related to your note about fog)  Anyways, I hope to see it improved. Nonetheless , good work.    It works if you defeat the De_Dust2 boss. Didn't you know!?   Rekt.   IMO it will be too OP, IMO having 24 hits in the head should be a kill so people don't over use it IMO.      Just a note, it seems like compressing the video caused some weird motion blur. Demo wasn't the greatest too, sorry for inconvenience.      It gets WORSE. Only during Gold Nova 1-4   Dudududududududududududu   I'm playing over Wi-Fi but i have fairly decent ping.   Yeh! Let's go back to 1.6 then!   Oh no! I see a dust mote in the air! VOLVO FIX PLS.   That's one of the perks of having a knife. GabeN thought it all along.   It also depends if they wan't to showcase the new engine. If yes, they'd update the models/textures a bit i guess.   Everything is done in real-time. The Hammer will no longer need to compile/bake lighting and rendering. tl;dr - No compiling. :P   It's basically the same except you can edit in 3D grid and no more compiling, hordes of new stuff. I am sure you will be able to set up workspace like in previous Hammer versions.   Download the new developer tools to see for yourself. The tool is completely different from World-craft style Hammer we seen before.  Where did i get this info? Open up and take a look. Lighting and rendering ARE real-time.   Actually, new engines are meant to be more efficient. If it was only a graphical update we would still be running on Source 1, Valve has said themselves that they wanted their engine to be more efficient and easy to use.  For example, the rendering in Source 2 is dynamically calculated unlike previous Source, which is both easier for developers and more efficient if done properly.   And if all else fails you will always have graphical settings. You would have to have a really ancient PC not to be able to run CS:GO on lowest of lowest settings.    Here's the list that new Source engine has that we, map makers would love to see -  Lighting is dynamic/real-time. No more need of 24 hours of compile or shit tons of optimization.  Same goes for rendering. No more hint brushes.  New materials system - 5 way-blend instead of default 2 on displacements.  Displacements can have way more splits on the fly now. Way more flexible.  Real-time cubemaps  This would be a godsend for map makers.     Is it possible to somehow set it up for use in Source 1 games? I'm just wondering.   Source 2 is comming... And it's gonna strike hard.    "Get ready boys, we're going in."   Players could have an option to disable Directx11 effects?   Not only would that RADICALLY increase graphics and performance, it would also make it easier for server owners and developers/mappers. DO IT VALVE!   Blessed GabeN granted you the power of partial- Wallhack. Use it wisely, you don't wan't Overwatch to reck you.   Dualies? What drugs are you on?   Ok.   Ok.   Ok.   Have you ever heard a term called "Yoloqueue"? Stop complaining and go premade. Ez.   Sup Crashz! Mapcore FTW.   Like, this subreddit. Do you know what this subreddit is for? I would suggest trying to contact the owner of those servers, neither CS:GO devs or players are officially in any relation to Freebieservers.   CS:GO, remember?   Fuc* you m8.   A human brain has a part responsible for emotional attachment to inanimate objects caused by common brain activity disorder called.. Just kidding, I don't know shit. I just love Source engine physics when the pots fall and break.   The bolt animations after shot were so much faster, in result you had "almost" an auto-sniper with sick accuracy.   Ok.   Yet again your saying "bugged out". That's funny.   Carn? Source? It doesn't show nicks.  It is said so in the overwatch FAQ. Duuh.     "Steam bugged out" - There is a bug or there is no bug, shit like "bugged out"  is your own fault. I doubt steam support would be able to help with that.   The players on Nova ranks are even more toxic than Silvers. (Silvers are atleast genuinelly bad)   You do not need to make new threads everytime steam goes down!  We get 100 of those!   Go check out TopHattwaffle (If i spelled correctly?) and 3kliksphilip. They have a lot of great tutorials. It's worth it if you do it right.   You cannot overwatch higher rank players.   It's a pain in the ass to recompile official maps but I'll make it. It would be called de_dust2x2 just like in 1.6 i assume.   You sir, should switch to COD. Maps should never give unfair advantage for those who simply find these cheap spots. Even Valve's Aztec has solid bushes. I don't know if the map maker is weirdo or you just made it up.   At Silver rank if you know your shit you can basically one tap enemies. Try to rely less on teammates carrying you and more on self improvement.   Legend says that if you scream on MIC with mid-puberty teenager voice during warmup or half-time the Juan Deag ghost will grant you confidence and insane deagle skills. Use that wisely, you don't wanna face Juan Deag in the opposition ever.   rekt.   Unfortunately, I'm still working on It's fresh new layout, as it proves to be suuuuper imbalanced on CS:GO. If you would like to play the original layout, the map has already been remade by someone and posted on the Workshop.  Also, I would like to mention that Torn is my side project, as I am not the original author of the map and it's mainly a fan remake. Don't get me wrong, please, as much as I love it i would like to make a map that is solely crafted by my own to put it at my portfolio, as i don't have any reputation so far in the map making community.   Thank you! Means a lot to me! :)   Thank you, I'll be updating the album as i progress! Since everything you saw in the screenshot was made over-night, with that rate of making I'll hopefully be able to finish the map in about a few weeks or so. My main concern is that I don't have any "fans" of my map to show them something to, as i never released any versions of the map anywhere. I'm mainly focused on showing how MUCH a single person can improve on level design! :)       It's pretty retarded to see cheaters at that rank.   Players play with low graphics mainly due to visibility. Previously, if you had graphics on high you had a smudge on AWP scope. They patched it recently. Remember, it's about gameplay.   My hearts beatin! My hands are shaking! But I'm still shooting! Boom Headshot! Boom headshot! BOOM HEADSHOT!!!   I didn't see frags in the video due to the over-use of screen shake.   Wait..

Illinois' opinion was based in large part on a pair of earlier, lower-court decisions in the state, which held that the anonymity of someone who makes comments in response to online news stories isn't guaranteed if their opinions are potentially defamatory, according to Don Craven, an attorney for the Illinois Press Association.

If you dropped down to 2 or more the list would be enormous.    "Police say an overnight shooting in Savannah left one man dead and sent four other people to a hospital early Friday. Two of the shooting victims are children."  Yes, that is a mass shooting.   No - that is the definition of mass murder, not mass shooting.  For example, "in 2012, Travis Steed and others shot 18 people total. Miraculously, he only killed one. Under the incorrect definition of mass shooting, that event would not be considered a mass shooting! Arguing that 18 people shot during one event is not a mass shooting is absurd."

Instead, America should lead by example by investing in Americas enormous untapped potential.  **Moneyball America**  acknowledges that we cant manage every international challenge but asserts that we must defend U.S. interests wherever theyre threatened. Like the Oakland As general manager Billy Beane spending scarce capital only where it offered the most promising return.   **Indispensable America** insists that only Washington can promote the values on which global stability increasingly depends in our hyper-connected world. Turning inward would threaten Americas security and prosperity.   There's a big difference between "Zero Tolerance" and "One Punishment Fits All".

Why does Capitol Hill lurch from cliff to cliff, instead of actually do the job of governing?

The idea is based on a recent discovery by the study team. They found that transparent refractive objects may settle into a position where they feel a force that is perpendicular to the incoming light direction. This transverse force is akin to the lift experience by an airplane wing and other airfoils. Thus they call it optical lift. Objects in their experiments simultaneously thrust forward. The combination of lift and thrust allows for the optical steering of optical wings. In the coming year they will conduct experiments and computer modeling to advance this discovery for future space missions employing solar sails. The long-term goal is to devise a means to allow solar sails to navigate through space using only the power of sunlight. In the short term they will design and fabricate small-scale arrays of optical wings and test them in the laboratory to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. They will also perform numerical modeling to determine optimal design parameters for optical wings."

 My bros did this to me years ago (don't worry, its a fun story).  We finished playing a drinking game which I won (or lost, either way you're fucked up drunk). In my victory dance I ended up puking in the garden. I then got the sudden drunk munchies. I remembered that I had a half eaten Whopper in my car. Success! So I got my keys out of my pocket and started stumbling towards my car to get my tasty treat.  2 of my mates saw a drunken friend with his keys out walking towards his car. I don't blame them for thinking I was going to drive ahaha.  So they both kind of accosted me and wrestled the keys off me. Even in my drunkness I knew how it appeared so I tried to dissuade them.  Unfortunately "*Don't worry guys, I'm not going to drive - I'm just getting some food from my car!*"  Became  "*Guyss.. I'm just going to get a burger*"  Yeah I couldn't communicate my needs very well and I got yelled at hahaha.   I passed out soon after and the fuckers put deep heat in my underwear.  I love my friends.  **TL:DR got drunk, wanted food from my car, got called out for drink driving, deep heated genitals**   You can date a bros sister, but the bro has to be consulted with. Most of the time this rule will result in a 'go ahead'. It's less about asking permission (we're all fucking adults here) and more about letting your bro know first.   This really is the only answer.   That scene from Pulp Fiction confuses me. I'm in Australia and we use the metric system as much as France, but we call it a quarter pounder with cheese. The change seems stupid.   You had me at *meat tornado*   This is pretty much all you can do. It hurt for a long time, 2 years with someone means there are a lot of things which remind you of them. But time was the only thing which healed it.   I made a post a while ago [about how my favourite hoodie](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/360x02/nsv_whelp_i_really_liked_that_hoodie_oh_well_i/) had suddenly become more loose fitting. Being the master of causality that I am, I determined that losing weight causes clothing to become defective.  So I decided to go hoodie shopping this weekend. I saw a nice zip up hoodie but the only size left was an XL.   I couldn't buy an XL, I've been in the 3XL category for as long as I remember.  I guess I was wrong, the XL was a really good fit. A quick look around showed that clothes that are baggy are not clothes that actually fit. Good times.     I hate this.  Both me and her are very stubborn people. But we were the best of friends for near on a decade. Until August 2013. In Australia, that is the time of year that our Aussie rules football season heads into the finals. She is a life long Collingwood fan, to the uninitiated this means that she has a over the top reaction to anything about this team.  So anyway, while I was out with several other friends we got the news that Collingwood had been eliminated from the finals. So as a joke, we all decided to coordinate a simultanious Facebook message to her  "Hey X, the power went out where we are, how did Collingwood go?"  That was it. It was a fucking joke.   Anyway. We all immediately got removed from Facebook and she didn't return any of my calls or sms's.   We've not meet up since. I'm not apologising. if she is willing to destroy a friendship because of a joke about a football team, then that speaks to her willingness to being my friend.   You're absolutely right. It's really easy to end up making a sub be upwards of 1000+ calories.  I have now adjusted what I get there down to around 800 calories. Mostly by removing the cheese and choosing better meat.

You're about to start a new level of education and that nonsense won't hold up.   As corny as it sounds, it's your future - don't fuck it up over laziness.   Me too, crossing guards are so touchy.   'Would' also adds a hypothetical nature to the question.   *Would you please take out the trash?*  *Yes, I would*   The trash is now hypothetically dealt with.   Ah good, it's nice to hear that the weight fluctuation can last only a few days.   I think that's the case now, that I've 'gained' weight. So the 1 pound loss I've registered is *actually* like a 3 pound weekly loss   I'm doing daily weigh ins, I wan't to see that *whoosh* happen!  So you've had a flux of weight every time you've been sore?   Hey guys  So I just finished a long weekend and I decided to challenge myself by going to the gym every day during it. I would normally workout twice a week on the weekends (45 minutes of cardio). This time around I did 4 straight days of cardio workouts with the Saturday session going for a full hour followed by my first bout with body resistance training.  Needless to say I'm still rather sore from the resistance training. After all of this, my weigh in yesterday showed that I'd only lost 1 pound for the week, which is smaller than usual.  So with all of that information, how likely is it that my weight has been fudge'd due to water retention?   I like the Stannis meltdown, it shows that the Mannis circle jerk can be broken.  To be honest, we all knew this was coming and while !book Stannis stated quite early on that there will be no burnings, that was said before he was desperate.   The Bolton sabotage (while kinda of lazy writing wise) felt like an adaptation of some sort of set back that's coming up in the books, a set back which would make Stannis desperate.    **Killing Them Softly**, I made a thread about it yesterday. It looks like lots of people loved it too, but I got quite a few messages from people who have not seen it because of the reviews which is a crying shame.   Do yourself a favour and check it out :)   IM SO FUCKING PSYCHED!! I had the biggest smile while watching this   It ended up with a 75% on RT, which isn't representative of the quality I think. I would've guessed 90%~   Hey everyone,  While I'm an avid movie lover, there are still lots of films I've missed out on enjoying. Killing Them Softly is one of those movies. Thanks to Netflix I was able to watch it last night and it was incredible.   I'm a fan of dialogue driven crime dramas and this is one of the best of them. The world, the characters and the tension are all excellent. I had no idea where this movie was going and I didn't care, I was loving the ride.   Brad Pitt was the obvious standout, he controlled every single scene he was in. But also Scoot McNairy, he really sold the character of the junkie to me. I felt actual empathy for him, despite what he does in the film. The cinematography is also *absolutely* gorgeous. There is a rather amazing slow motion sequence involving a drive by which is amazing.  I had a blast with this movie and I feel if you're a fan of dialogue driven movies like Tarantino, then this will be a great movie for you.  What did you guys think?  **Edit: It looks like I'm not the only one who has loved this movie, do yourself a favour and check it out guys. Lots of people have seemingly made snap judgements about it because of some of the reviews.**   I've been consistent with my feelings towards him, irrespective of the internet. I laughed my arse off at his old shit (I still do), but he hasn't made a funny movie I like since Little Nicky.   I cannot fucking wait for this movie. BRING US A FULL TRAILER!!!   Lots happened, it was a 2 year relationship between us. So it's kinda hard to write everything out.    I updated my post with some further information on how we met, what else do you want to know?   Haha, mums is at end of may   Hes 2 years older than me   That works both ways, all my mates in the military **always** make my birthday parties, but those who go away for christmas are **never** at my parties :(   Sorry you asked now, aren't you :-)  OP has deliverance'd.   Great response!   His responses usually are  He's definitely /u/funchords at parties.   Really solid post with amazing information, I do have a question though:  Do you want to *feed* on someone named Cletus, or are you asking someone named Cletus to *feed* you?    I personally don't use it , but now throughout the day I do tend to watch what I'm eating and count the calories for the day in my head just to give me a rough estimate.  I'm not trampling on what you're doing, since I'm doing the exact same thing. But something we both need to be constantly aware of is that when we get really close to our goal weight, we're probably going to have to use some form of proper calorie counting.  Guestimation isn't going to cut it when you need to accurately have a small daily calorie deficit.  However, that's future train_subject5967's problem :P     They have so much love forearms.   That's the most common question I get when people find out my birthday is on Christmas eve "do you get two sets of presents?"  Of course I did! :D  The benefit of having a brother who I live with with a birthday 4 days from mine is awesome combined birthday parties that I only have to half organise :D   I totally get what you're say, but my biggest ambition is to find me a lady friend :)  I'm 100% sure of that. I broke up with my last girlfriend because I wanted to be single while I was working on my career. I've been working on my career and I've enjoyed being single. I'm ready and willing to settle down :)  I don't want to be romantically lonely for the rest of my life, just like I don't want to be unemployed for the rest of my life. So I guess in that way I'm 'filling a hole'.   When it's smoked tuna it removes much of the fishy-ness. Also when it's mixed with the tomatos and spices it accentuates really well.   I work as a software developer and I work with a lot of testers and business analysts. I've been working in this career for almost 4 years and the business analysts and testers are almost **always** female.   So back to your question - I have no experiences what so ever with gender dynamics. Everyone is respectful and friendly. Gender is not something which has ever come up, everyone is there to work and work we do. If we socialise, we do so with great affection.  This is why I struggle so much with some of the SJWs out there, they scream bloody murder and tell these stories about gender injustice, but I just don't see it - ever.  The people I know all treat each other with respect, irrespective of gender, politics, religion or sexual orientation.   How's everyone in this thread doing today?  *uncomfortably averts gaze*   A girl I was pining over for months offered to pick me up and drive me to work. Along the way, she was acting weird. So we kept driving as we pulled up, she turned to me and said "I broke up with X", I had ran over this scenario in my head over and over and over and I still was not prepared for it.  She was staring at me and I froze up, I wanted to kiss her I wanted to hug her, but I didn't want to take advantage. So my brain shut down, after at least 10 seconds of staring at each other (it felt like hours). She scoffed and threw her face at me in a passionate kiss.   Turns out she broke up with him because she wanted to be with me.  **Edit:** To add further context and embarrassment - we had met, hooked up (while she and her BF were on a temporary break) and parted ways, she then started dating her ex full time (who has the same first name as me, make of that as you will). We had such a strong connection that she contacted me out of the blue and we started hanging out, strictly platonic, I don't cheat. We talked almost everyday and became best friends very quickly. As the months drew on, her relationship started getting rocky. (No, it wasn't because of me. Their relationship was in trouble before she even met me, thus the temporary break). One night when we were out at a party, a friend (who didn't know about her BF) assumed by the way she was looking at me that she was interested in me, after asking her about her obvious feelings for me she bursted into tears and ran away from the party.  I ended up chasing her down to find out what was wrong, we had a weird little moment where she admitted she loved me and didn't know what to do. I told her I felt the same way, but it's not fair to string her SO along like this. She agreed the event as described above occurred the following week.  **So as you can see, when she said "I broke up with X", that was her basically yelling "I want to be with you". So I did get the hint but I was stuck like a deer in the headlights on how to react to it.**  **Edit 2:** As a follow up, [I wrote a post the other day about how we first met](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/38cv83/would_you_go_home_with_a_girl_you_met_in_a_bar_if/cruotla). We had a 2 year relationship after all of the events above. There is a lot that happened during that time so it would take too long to go over all of it.  **Edit 3:** I've been PM'd a few times to ask what happened after she broke up with her Ex. Ill give an outline. So finally, after months of knowing each other and having the most intimate relationship we've both ever had. We **finally** had sex and it was the most explosive and intense sex I've ever had. It was full of passion and affection. The best way I can describe it as is **pure unrelenting lust**. We both wanted each other in every way available and couldn't have enough.   Our sex life was like that for much of the 2 years we dated after that. It never reduced in intensity, which was incredible. It wasn't just the sex life, it was the connection we shared. Those who've met someone they can just talk to about anything while never breaking eye contact and never being uncomfortable with silence, know exactly what I'm talking about. But I was an idiot 19 year old and I didn't stop the oncoming train which I created.  She broke it off with me because I was an idiot. I wasn't willing to make changes to my life (for the betterment of myself) that she wanted. I was gaining weight, smoking, drinking too much and I was spending more time fucking around with my mates or playing video games than finishing my studies. This immaturity ended up ruining the relationship with this girl. My first love, she was perfect guys. I'm serious. In 2 years of dating we almost never fought, and if we did then it was always resolved quickly.  It's been 8 years since that day and I still think about her. I still think about her smile, her smell and her voice. Everytime I see a redhead I think for a moment that it may be her and she wants to get back with me. I've not spoken about this for years to anyone, I strangely feel cathartic just spelling it out to you guys. Thanks for that.     The real question is, what order?   Also FYI, */r/thosearetheheartandsoulofreddit* doesn't exist :(   Having the far better situation during a pregnancy : /   tl;dr read this thread, that's some sad shit :(      Fucking Taken.   Yeah, it has better character development.   Forced two girls in our class who were wearing satin boxers longer than their school dresses to remove them in front over everyone in the middle of class. For clarification, it was an old lady teacher and it was kinda fucked up now that I think about it.   Oh you better believe I did/still do.   I know that feeling! I get it on the walk from my office to the train station on a Friday afternoon. Best feeling ever.   [Link for the lazy](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyBoners/comments/17fl4o/one_of_my_friendshes_pretty_adorable/c8540j5?context=3)   Don't have kids or pets.   Haha, your title is still making me laugh.   I misread it as:  What was your worst shit**?** that sounded much better in my head'   Phone call, or SMS if I'm in a movie.   Each sentence you wrote was its own rollercoaster.   How typical is this? A close female relative of mine is looking to have a divorce and they have a 2 year old involved. I would hate for her to shut off because of it :(   I just posted the recipe in my comment, it is like a casserole, yes.   Absolutely, the main culprits for calories are obviously the cheese and the pasta. There is no reason I couldn't also reduce the amount of pasta in the dish and perhaps add something else to it. Diced carrots could work quite well for a filler :)   I'm currently 27 and I'm looking to settle down. I'm ready to start a LTR. I have a stable career and nearly have enough to buy a house. I would love to find someone to move out with, I'm done being single.  That being said, I'm not ready to start a family. Not right now anyway. I'm still not sure if I'll ever be ready, it's kind of terrifying actually. What if I'll never want kids? What a the chances of relationships working out if that doesn't change.  I would be totally upfront about that. I could definitely handle some casual dating, but if I find someone worth settling down with, I'm happy to do that forever.   So there was a meal which I used to cook quite often before I started my journey. Tuna pasta bake. It was simple and oh my god was it delicious; carb and cheese loaded deliciousness.  I would make a big batch and get 4 meals out of it. After I started losing weight I decided to do some calorie counting for this meal. I was shocked, the entire meal was around 6000 calories, so by splitting it into 4 meals it was around 1500 calories each meal.  No fucking wonder I was going over my daily limit, that is 75% of my daily calorie needs.  I then got a little bit sad because, I realised that I can't eat like I used to. But after some further calculations, if I were to reduce the cheese I added to it and then broke it down into 6 servings instead of 4, then that would limit each serving to 800 calories. I now can budget it into my daily diet, so while it isn't something I will eat everyday - I can keep it frozen for meals down the line.  Just because you're cutting back portions, doesn't mean you cant enjoy the food you love :)  **Edit: I'm bored and hungry, so ill post the recipe ;)**  - Grated cheese, 500g  - Penne pasta, 500g  - Canned tuna in brine, 420g  - Canned diced tomatoes, 800g  - Garlic salt  - pepper  - Need 2 saucepans, one of pasta one for sauce, pasta strainer and baking dish.  *Instructions*  - Preheat oven to 200c and start boiling water for pasta. Heat a pan with oil, then add the canned tomatos and a cup of water.  - Stir for a bit, then add garlic salt and pepper, keep simmering till the mix is thick. Take off the heat after around 5-10 minutes.  - Drain the tuna and place into the sauce and mix well.  - Cook penne pasta in the water, once the pasta is cooked, strain the pasta and mix it in with the sauce.  - Add half of your cheese to the mixture and stir well.   - Base the casserole dish and place the mixture into it, then cover it evenly with the remaining cheese.  - Place into the oven till the cheese on top fully melts.  **Bingo, you have lift off. A very inexpensive meal which is absolutely delicious**     I miss cheese, but after seeing how calorically rich it is, it's been easy to avoid.   Right, here we go.   So to set the scene, its a 16 year virgin old me. Never had a girlfriend before. I end up meeting this girl through work, we hit it off and end up dating. Over the course of the next 10 months more and more lies start to pile up. I would like to preface this by saying that I was a foolish youngster who had no reason to think someone could be a compulsive liar and I was finally getting laid - so I was able to be in denial about the problems with her. Here we go:  She tells me that she was not a virgin, but had been kidnapped and raped over the course of 2 weeks the previous year by a group of guys. She apparently broke free with the help of a innocent bystander and with help of the doctors afterwards, she was able to have surgery to restore her lady business to "exactly as it was before the ordeal", so she would conveniently appear to be a virgin.  She tells more progressive lies about medical conditions she has. She would have 'seizures', and I was told by her to attend to her when it happens, hold her, comfort her, etc. After this happened a few times, I was growing suspicious since she could apparently retain all of the memory during the seizures which I'm told isn't how they work. So one night, while I was trying to get to sleep she was apparently not getting enough attention, so after checking if I had fallen asleep yet, she started to seize in front of me. I pretended to be asleep while she writhed around on the bed. I could see out of my partially closed eyes as she noticed I was 'asleep', she immediately stopped seizing, looked at me and then shrugged and rolled over. After I brought up her condition to her mother (who said she had no idea about it), the seizures seemed to disappear. Funny that.  She would tell complicated lies about my best friend who was suspicious of her bullshit. One time almost convincing me that he had forcefully grabbed her and tried to force himself on her. This girl really liked to play the rape card. More on that soon. She also started spinning lies about how the attacker who had her kidnapped was back in her life and started threatening my life, she told me of an envelope she apparently received with a picture of me doing yard work. I was so scared.  After finally having enough with her, I broke it off. I had finally caught her in enough lies that I bit the bullet. Immediately after I did that I started getting crying phone calls and text messages. She wouldn't leave me alone. She then lied and told me that she was pregnant and that I needed to leave school, get back together with her and be a father. [I made a post here elaborating on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/385al8/how_did_you_tell_your_parents_you_were_sexually/crsfyy0) and with the help of my parents I was able to see through her bullshit and after confronting her by making her take a pregnancy test in front me, twice. It confirmed her bullshit once and for all  I started getting more phone calls from other people I've never met before. Turns out she was going around telling station rats that I had been a violent boyfriend who had raped her while my brother video taped the whole thing. After she got pregnant from this, I then pushed her down a flight of stairs because she wouldn't get an abortion. These violent phone calls I would get never amounted to anything luckily, but my brother was accosted by some station rats with baseball bats after work, they ended up smashing in a coworkers car thinking it was my brothers. Completely fucked up situation. After that, the direct attacks on me and my brother started to end. I was finally knowing peace.  Until a few months later when my sister started acting out in the family, she was distant, would sneak out and do all sorts of stuff which wasn't typical of her normal quiet nature. Turns out my cunt of an ex had started manipulating my sister to get back at me. I wont go into detail but my very impressionable sister was getting close with the wrong crowd and after some worrying behaviour I had a sit down with her, who had only ever heard my ex's side of the story. After a long and candid conversation explaining what had happened between us, my sister came to her senses and broke off their relationship.  All this happened almost a decade ago and I guess I've kind of suppressed it. It was a completely fucked situation and I had a **really** hard time trusting women after that. I think it also explains why now days I have a hard time dealing with sympathy diggers.  I've learned my lesson and I've not stuck my dick in crazy since.    FYI, in Australia we stand to the left and walk to the right. This is also true for driving on the road and walking on the sidewalk.   There is a limit to this. I'm never going to fully understand physics, but I'm proud that I have learned some of it.   Just attach a padlock to it when they're not looking.   I appreciate your judgement, as a fatty who's 30 lbs down I wonder what people think when they see me smash out a good cardio session at the gym :)   The inability of some people to work in a customer facing job.   I don't need you to go above and beyond your position, but I expect some damn customer assistance. I worked in retail for 7 years and every single time someone approached me with a query, I would (with a smile) be friendly, helpful and would address their query in a timely manner.  **I was being paid to be the front end of the store**, why the fuck is this lost on so many people?  I constantly will see obviously bored people, who roll their eyes and do the bare minimum to assist me while being mono tonal and somewhat rude.   I get it, you don't enjoy your job. Go fucking work somewhere where you're not the face of the company then.   I am also lazy as duck  Paging /u/fuckswithducks   Really good post man, you know what we need?  A wave of scientific consensus towards the effects of actual medical conditions and obesity. I'm so sick (heh) and tired of hearing so many people blame a self diagnosed condition as an excuse for shitty living.  Much like the climate change denying movement, we need a large scale effort in debuking such misinformation.   It wasn't the present itself, its the context of the present.  My birthday is the 24th of December and my brothers is on the 28th, we're both very used to getting a combined birthday/christmas present, that's fine.  One particular year my sister bought me a DVD of Hot Fuzz for Christmas, fuck yeah - I love that movie. The conversation went something like this.  "Thanks sister, this is awesome" "No worries train_subject5967, now that's a shared birthday and christmas present for you and your brother"  That's right, she spent $20~ on a 4 in 1 present for me and my brother. I didn't really care all that much, I'm sure money was tight, I just thought it was a funny piece of ingenuity.   What I loved about that was how fucking close it was to the books. There were some slight choreographical changes, but otherwise it stayed true to the book.   The Raid and The Raid 2.  Both of those movies had the most incredible and dynamic fight scenes I've ever seen.   You and me both. It seems most of the criticisms isn't due to the entertainment value of the movie, its around some ancillary thing . Over the top cameos for example.   Letting myself go at the age of 21. I had broken up with a wonderful woman and instead of working to make myself better, I kept letting laziness take over. I'm 27 now and I'm now working to undo all of those years of abuse towards my own body.  My regret is that I feel that I've wasted the majority of my 20s in a sorry state.   Ser Arthur Dayne.   I read somewhere that excessive body fat acts like estrogen, thus males getting more "femaley"  Hold on, I remember reading something about this. That's why obese men develop that gynomastia (or how ever you spell it). Now that makes more sense.  I'm in the same boat about the facial hair man, im 27 and I still cant grow it well for the upper cheeks and that area in the middle of your moustache (I call it the reverse Hitler.)   "meat **lover** pizza"  Yeah, without the pluralisation, it's still oddly sexual.   Everytime you post, your links stay blue for me. It's not that I'm disgusted, I'm actually rather impressed.  It's just that I'm worried something will get triggered.   Yeh, nah she'll be roight.  Don't mind me, just setting the scene.   "Your kid sure is cute"  Oh god what an ugly baby : /   Rather than posting everything, I'm just going to post what happened this time last year.  June 5th 2014 I got a job offer after 2 months of unemployment. I'm still at that job now :)  Yay     "Hi, I'm train_subject5967, what's your name?"  Works a treat    Yeah, it was a strange couple of years.  :|     It wouldn't make a difference and I would question the people who think otherwise. Of course this depends on the skill that you're talking about.  I couldn't care any less if a girl doesnt have my computer programming skills, but if she has no ability to handle her own finances that may be a problem, unless she is willing to learn.   /thread   It's going to be hard, but it needs to be said. Many years ago my first serious GF had to have that conversation with me. It sucked but knowing where you stand will help if he wants to make the change.  He may think that you're indifferent to his eating habits, thus why he does what he does.   My ex told me that mine tastes better when I transfer her a weekly shopping allowance. I'm starting to think this whole thing was a ruse.   Ask leading questions to find interests. Quick example - *What do you do for a living?* - if they're a student, you can go from there and ask them what they're studying, where they're studying, what is their plan after studying, etc. If you have personal anecdote about something they've said, share it! Keep the conversation going. Ask questions and be genuine.  They just mentioned that they're studying something you've never heard of? Ask them to give you a brief run down. If they're working full time instead of studying, then ask them about their job in a similar manner as above. You'd be surprised how many stories and questions you can come up with from just about any topic.      I'm figuring it's something like that, there are some seriously strange and unexpected side effects of weight loss out there.   Instructions completely clear - dick stuck in fan   Depends on the girl.  Let me explain.  While away on a holiday with my school friends, we were organising a party at our place that night. We bumped into a group of girls during the day. So being the super confident dudes that we were, several of us approached them and struck up a conversation. We ended up inviting them to the party that night (god I miss confident 18 year old train_subject5967). So anyway, they said yes.  In this group, there was a stand out girl. Smart, pretty and extremely funny. My friend and I on the drive back both called dibs on her. He ended up backing down as long as "I could close the deal in 20 minutes". Pretty tall order.  Anyway, the girls turned up and me and this girl hit it off. One thing led to another and we disappeared into a bedroom. There we were, both in a locked room. She told me straight away "Long story short, I'm not sleeping with you tonight. Nothing personal, it's just my rule". I decided to go with it instead of bailing.  It was one of the best decisions of my young adult life. We ended up spending most of the night lying in bed, making out, laughing and talking. It was like a fucking movie. We had the best time.  After spending the night in each others arms, I was totally smitten. Over the next week we spent nearly every night drinking, talking and hooking up. Still no nookie though. That was **totally** fine, those who have had a true connection with someone know what I'm talking about.  I'm happy to tell the whole story if you guys want, but suffice to say that if I had bailed on her the second she declined sex, I would've missed out on my very first love.   I almost thought about tagging this as a NSV, but I noticed in the shower today that my underarm hair has gotten thicker... I'm a fair haired guy and over the years of obesity I noticed my underarm hair was getting thinner. Now it seems to have started to grow back.   Is this a normal part of weight loss? I'm happy I guess, it used to look like I shaved my armpits.   So 3 months ago, I'd had enough. So I decided to make a real effort to change. So far, so-fucking-good.   - 27/M, 5'10'' SW: 285 CW: 252 GW: 190  I'm currently losing around 2 lbs a week consistently, so my main goal will to be keeping that weekly loss going for the next 12 weeks. Which means I'll be able to get past 50 lbs lost well before the 12 weeks are up.  In late August I have a planned camping trip (proper camping, none of this porcelain toilet nonsense) and I would love to be in crazy good shape for that trip. In previous years I've struggled with some of the physical needs of the trip. Not this time.  At the moment I'm doing 2-3 gym sessions per week. They consist of 45~ minutes on the tread mill:  - 5 minute warm up  - 10 minute fast walking  - 5 minute jog  - 10 minute fast walking  - 5 minute jog  - 5 minute fast walking  - 5 minute cool down  My end plan is to gradually reduce this watered down cardio session to a full jogging session. I'll be periodically increases those jogging intervals as time passes.    Don't be such a negatron.   That's a perfectly fine thing to think about, but I think you're missing the big picture here...  You've already proven how strong willed you are! To lose 50 lbs is an insane achievement! If you stuck with the initial change of diet, you're totally ready to adjust it further to meet your goal.   I'm currently eating a 2000 diet, but I know once I get to your level of loss, I'll need to readjust my diet just like you need to. I'm ready for it! Show that will power :)   I know the fear you're speaking of, I have around 100lbs to lose and I'm worried how my stomach will look. I've taken solace in the number of photos I've seen where people have had minimal loose skin with that kind of weight loss. It **does** happen.  I'm the same with you though, it's not going stop me from doing what I'm doing.   I've not seen it yet (doing so tomorrow), but this the the one thing I care about. It can suck, it can be boring, but it better not try to reinvent the wheel. The movie could be made with minimal reference to the show, but the main aspects of the show need to be in the movie. Brotherhood, growing up and defining yourself.  It's currently 32% on rotten tomatoes, but from what I read, those who're fans of the show enjoyed it.   That's not the realisation I meant, I mean show her *exactly* how much each piece of food is. She might think a salad is low cal, when it's not in her case.   "And then he gave a ton of money to /u/thehonestyfish, for ~~no reason~~ **snake oil to fix his curable cancer**."  FTFY    Toyota. I've only ever owned Toyotas and while my friends all have persistent car troubles, mine have never needed more than the standard wear and tear services. Not only that, the parts and very cheap.   (Spoilers All) The white walkers can't swim   I'm not saying the white walkers can swim.  I get what you mean, but this is still funny as hell   Hello fellow Australian :)  Nice work, it's never easy to give up old habits. I've been off the beers for almost 3 months now and I can tell you... It's been kind of awesome. I'm saving a ton of money, I'm having better sleep and socialising at parties is actually easier.  While I do miss the shit out of a nice cold one with dinner, I have lots of metaphorical debt to pay off before I can do that again.     The proverbial proof is in the proverbial pudding, isn't it?  Shit loads of people from this subreddit have lost tons of weight without any exercise. I had a 3 week break earlier last month from exercise and my rate of loss was pretty much the same.  Exercise is still extremely important, but I'd rather see a skinny out of shape person over an obese out of shape person. So if exercise is a deal breaker, telling someone to focus on their diet is perfectly fine. As long as you preface that advice with a mention of how important exercise is *as well*.   Next time get diet cocaine fries.  Nice one :D   I think the you underestimate the number of underrated under-appreciation threads.   Seriously? That's a rather stupid thing to let lose. If they do plan 'for the watch' to occur, why reveal something like this?   Wait a minute, this didnt happen in this weeks episode, why are we discussing this OP? /s   Wouldn't it be funny if they *did* include the rattleshirt/mance bait and switch from books and Tormund just beat Mance Rayder to death haha   You really dodged a bullet there   When ever she repackages askreddit threads with a slightly different question.   Paper? Like from the toilet?    misinformation (or lack of information)  While both of these are the problem, I'm sad to say that there is probably more *misinformation*. Which makes me fucking sad.   Think about it, somewhere an overweight person is spending their small amount of spare money on a pill they saw which guaranteed them something for nothing. Or there is someone who has a disease which stops them from being overly active, but because they were always told "you need to exercise to lose weight", they've given up hope and eat their sorrows.  I'm in the same boat as you, I really enjoy the 2-3 gym sessions I do each week. It really is a mental and physical boost. It falls back on the common saying in /r/loseit.  **Weight loss = 80% diet + 20% exercise**    June 3rd, 2015 - the day Reddit stood chill.   **Cunty McFucksticks**  Hey, that *is* fun :)   Whiskey in a Jar by Metallica, that shit is incredible.   PUT THE RABBIT DOWN, SIR   The problem is the misinformation out there. If society tells you that you can't lose weight without exercise (obviously nonsense) and you can't exercise, then you can't lose weight in your own eyes. The amount of people out there who're not willing to try because 'exercise is hard' is staggering.  Hell, I was one of those people not that long ago. We all hold onto our ignorance and don't really like to hear a contrary truth. Especially when we've been telling ourselves these 'truths' for many years.  So while you may feel it trivialises your efforts (and it does), you have to see it from the perspective of the uninformed.   In the vast majority of cases fat people are fat because they eat too much, not because of genetics.   Had to read your post a few times to get it haha  That's actually an awesome idea to help conceptualise your efforts! Now what weights 30 lbs that I can strap to my body...   I don't suppose you have it? For posterity?  	120
 my brain hurts   sexual assault is hilarious    The size of the debt only has meaning relative to the size of the economy.  Citing the debt number outside of that context is dishonest.    I would shit my pants   I totally agree with the general sentiment here; but in the writers defense, doesn't Detroit derive most of it's notoriety from being a shit hole?      Aaaaaand now I'm weirded out by all the Belleville redditors.    Religions are cultural linguistic expressions of our ancestors view of the human condition; what it is to be born and grow from childhood to adolescence to adulthood; to enter old age and die.  They are mechanisms through which wisdom traditions gain traction in and are transmitted through history.  A wisdom tradition is concerned with how should we live?  This is a question that science does not ask and cannot answer.     First, Term limits are just as likely to remove someone competent as they are to remove someone incompetent(honest as corrupt, etc).    Second, Parliamentary bodies like congress have enormously complex procedural structures that lawmakers have to navigate to accomplish anything that want to accomplish.  Its inefficient, but its the nature of the beast. By term limiting out long time legislators you remove the people who maintain the bodys institutional memory. Which is to say that you get rid of the people who know how to do stuff.  New legislators will need to know how to do stuff so they will turn to those people outside the institutional body who are not term limited who know how the body works.  So you are actually conferring more power to Lobbyists and special interest groups over the legislative process.   Last, by creating a set amount of time that someone can serve you remove the incentive for lawmakers to develop long term relationships and further polarize the body, making it more combative and generally less likely for that body achieve a compromise.   The goal has to be getting *better* legislators. Term limits just get us *different* legislators.    Wore JNCOs... I feel shame   Only according to your arbitrary definition of what constitutes divine revelation.  Outside of that narrow view your litmus test is useless.  Its not as if there is one universally agreed upon approach to which all faith traditions adhere.    Fundamentalists make up a solid percentage of practicing Christians in the united states but they only represent a tiny sliver of Christian thought. The theological implications of divine revelation are broad and vary greatly across history, communities and individuals.  To simply assume that divine revelation must mean that one would have knowledge of the physical universe unavailable otherwise is shortsighted and intellectually dishonest. Just check out the revelation [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation). That just a small sampling and here is no shortage of approaches.  I wouldnt say Im convinced of atheism  Im agnostic. Im really comfortable saying I dont know. Agnosticism seems to me like the honest neutral position. The atheist insistence that one must find evidence in the natural world for the super natural strikes me as a self-refuting.    Claims of divine revelation or divine inspiration dont necessitate the expectation of scientific accuracy. It sounds like you are referring to biblical literalism or biblical inerrancy which are a completely different.    Look, You don't have to argue like Pat Robertson is across the table from you.  Im not even Christian. I dont think the bible is divine anything, I think its an entirely human product. It tells us what our spiritual ancestors thought not what god thinks.   At the risk of being overly broad and simplistic, it breaks down like this. There are two basic understandings of contemporary Christianity. Call them liberal and conservative for lack of better vocabulary. Both are the result of Christianitys collision with the enlightenment.   One is a defensive rejection of enlightenment knowledge (conservative), the other is a discerning integration of enlightenment knowledge(liberal). But its important to realize that both understandings are recent. Phrases like literally true or biblical inerrancy arent first uttered until the second half of 1600s and didnt become common until the 1800s.    The idea that its dishonest for beliefs held by the community, literal or otherwise, to change based on new information is just ridiculous. To what other belief system would we apply such a standard? Why would we expect Christianity or its theology to be static? They dont exist in a vacuum, they are dynamic,  they grow and evolve and respond to history. Of course some literally held beliefs have been cast aside. Others have been invented from practically nothing (Trinity anyone?)This is the nature of ideas, the nature of culture and language.  That doesnt invalidate the entire tradition.  Look, I think the fundamentalist need to press their faith into sciences conceptual mold so that they can walk around with some  self deceived certainty about god and the universe diminishes their own tradition and is destructive to society. Yeah, ancient people believed stuff we know to be wrong (if only they had the benefit of your 17 years on the earth -just a guess-) Yeah some people, out of some sense of obligation to what they think they are supposed to believe about the bible or pure good ole fashioned stupidity, still believe some of those same things.    Im not sure everyone gets it, maybe cry about it some more.    I dont need a get out of disproof free card if proof in the scientific sense is not a standard to which I aspire.   An ancient cultures pre-scientific cosmology isnt correct so? Why would we expect it to be? And unless someone is using that as the basis for a public policy argument -in which case I will stand right beside you as we tell them to fuck off- why should we care?  BTW Genealogies are incredibly common in oral traditions. Usually as a way of keeping a family or tribal history but often as a way to confer or denote authority to a particular figure in a narrative.  Did you read Ops link? The kind of debate you are trying to engage in is part of what its talking about.    I sympathize with alot of the arguments made by new-atheists but it feels like they are stuck on a single plane. I want to engage but it all seems so conceptually shallow I just end up whistling right passed.  "metaphors aren't true therefore they are lies" and it kind of stops there.   You're right about this. Thanks for this thread.   word. The lack of conceptual depth in this thread is embarrassing.    all time favorite Blues jerseys   John Riggins    Just went on a road trip and found myself listening to Lost from beginning to end and wondering the same.   so crazy it just might work   what else do they have to remember?   I just think King spends so much time in the characters head that it makes it really tough to communicate all the important parts of a story visually. Which is probably why Shawshank is arguably the best King adaptation;  It's not terribly long and there is a narrator.      Apart from that can we just say, "do whatever Frank Darabont does."       My experience tells me that the average person and redditor only gets half the facts, half correct (both theists and atheists) because s/he doesn't bother too much on reading about them. That's why it's common to find fundamentalists refusing to "believe that we descend from monkeys" and many atheists half-assessing the ideas that inspired religious thought.      I think its more than just ignorance.   I think a lot of atheists fall into the same kinds of fundamentalisms as the religious.  I know the defense but atheism is the absence of belief, we cant be fundamentalist. True enough if someone is just an atheist. But once you move beyond the absence of a belief into declaring an affirmative vision of the universe I know the true nature of reality then youre a Naturalist, Scientist, Materialist, etc. As such you can fall prey to the same structurally flawed kinds of assumptions usually associated with religious fundamentalism.  Some of the questions from OP are truly Large Conceptual Stuff and have been around for centuries (what is god? What is his relation to the universe? Is it embedded in its creation? Does it "embue" his creation with divinity? With purpose?...). I get why concepts like these are hard to get and very easily misunderstood, but anyone who claims to be a (free-)thinker worth his value, owes to himself to read and understand many points of view before arriving to any kind of conclusion  Agreed. Are you familiar with Joseph Campbell? He who thinks he knows, doesn't know. He who knows that he doesn't know, knows. For in this context, to know is not to know. And not to know is to know.     Good call. omnipresence and a pantheistic god aren't the same thing  My experience on reddit has been that a lot of atheists have a hard time with the larger conceptual stuff.  My guess is that its because they spend so much time focused on the superficial anthropomorphized god of fundamentalists.      I'm 3 years into my routine and my wife is still on the couch.   I'm in the best shape I've ever been in and she's enthusiastic about what I've been able to accomplish but can't seem to do it for herself. I've done everything I can think of to help her but I can't go to the gym for her.   I thought Frank Muller's stuff was fantastic. I really enjoyed William Hurt's Hearts in Atlantis   I had to look twice because at a glance I totally thought it was Michael Jackson.   He's so good and yet i still wish someone would break his face again.   Picking some hyper literalist branch of Christianity and arguing from their view is a cop out.  If its the divinity that you cant stomach then cut it out all together.   Think about it Christianity  as a sociological phenomenon and start there.   All religions are  born out cultural linguistic traditions. If they are around long enough they become cultural linguistic traditions unto themselves.  In philosophy a wisdom tradition is concerned with how should we live? Religions are the vehicle through which wisdom traditions gain traction in history. Theyre steeped in cultural symbols and metaphor. Who needs god?  There are bible scholars who use the same  historical critical method that academic historians use. Some of them Christian but many of them secular academics. Marcus Borg and the Jesus Seminar are the first that come to mind.  But John Dominic Crossan is another, Bart Ehrman, etc.   You can do this is a way that applies critical analysis.     Steen is my favorite interview on the team.

                Kind of have to agree with you there.   From what I recall, they did in the study that is the subject of the NPR story.      The only traffic court I've had jury duty for was the Houston Municipal Courts. Haven't done jury duty at any of the JP precincts, yet.

In particular, former IOC President (1980-2001) Juan Antonio Samaranch, was a member of the Franco regime in Spain. The IOC doesn't get as much attention as FIFA because, even though the World Cup finals is every four years, FIFA plays a much bigger role in the operation of soccer than the IOC does in the variety of sports that make up the Olympics.            From: https://www.ridemetro.org/SafetySecurity/MPD/FAQs.aspx  Q: Do officers of the METRO Police Department have the same authority as Houston Police Department officers?  A: Yes, the METRO Police Officers have the same law enforcement authority as other licensed peace officers in the State of Texas, including Houston Police Department officers.  Q: What is the jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department? A: The jurisdiction of the METRO Police Department is defined as any part of the county in which the 1 cent METRO sales tax is collected. This area spans approximately 1,285 square-miles, which includes most of Harris County and portions of Montgomery, Fort Bend, and Waller Counties. The METRO service area crosses several political jurisdictions and METRO Police has concurrent jurisdiction with those police agencies. However, the METRO Police Department is the primary police agency whenever an incident occurs on METRO property, such as bus stops/shelters, METRORail platforms, Park   Ride lots, transit centers, buses, and light rail vehicles. METRO Police also has primary jurisdiction of the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) network, as well as other right-of-ways or locations where transit-related incidents occur.  Q: What types of crime does the MPD investigate? A: MPD investigates all crime occurring on METRO property or right-of-ways (see above). METRO Police also act on information received from Crime Stoppers and individuals who report criminal activity observed on METRO property or right-of-ways.

According to the article, the lawsuit has been filed. They may have filed suit for tactical reasons, i.e. scaring the landowner into taking their offer; but, the landowner in this situation is retired attorney who spent his career working for the rights of Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes, not gonna scare easy and has plenty of time on his hands. I'm curious to watch how this plays out.   I'm not familiar enough to know how that might work under North Dakota law. I do get the sense that eminent domain is essentially a "King's X" and has a superior right to all other land rights, subject to compensation.         I would think a reporter would really have to go out of their way to find Paula Jones these days, guess it's a slow political news day.   First rule of the military - never volunteer for anything.

Wisconsin                     Beyond the headline, this article actually does a nice little job of highlighting just how easy it is to get arrested, and have an outstanding warrant, in New York City thanks to the concept of "Broken Windows" policing.      Actually, even if they lose the lawsuit, they won't actually lose their land. A ruling against them will mean that an easement will be granted for the pipeline and the landowner will still have to be compensated, but that amount will be determined by the court - an amount that will likely be less than what has been offered already.      As someone who lives in Houston, Texas, it really pissed me off when Texas Republicans didn't want to support federal relief in the wake of Super Storm Sandy. First of all, I know I live in an area that can get ravaged by weather and federal relief is important in our recovery from those incidents. Second, just cause I am a Texan doesn't make me an island unto myself - not only do I have a lot of family and friends who live in the areas hit by Sandy, but as an American I don't like seeing other Americans suffering as a result of natural disasters and I don't like seeing a-hole politicians play politics while other Americans are suffering.                  A little bit of background on the landowner, James Botsford, he's a retired attorney who spent most of his career as the Director of the Indian Law Office of Wisconsin Judicare, a legal aid law firm. He was also instrumental in the drafting and passage of the federal law that protects the use of peyote by members of the Native American Church.         Probably Mario Williams, he's the one that bought the Camaros for HPD.           	199
 Further discussion in [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/224d3g/til_that_its_common_during_tv_showings_of/)      Yeah I saw that too. Some things can not be unread.   [Welcome to Winnipeg!](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1020281/52332465_41206d89e4.jpg)    ITT: antiverts   Reddit: satisfying the needs of ambiverts since 2005!   All voices were impersonated... poorly.   I'm curious about the "Harvey Hotel" and "Lakeview Hotel" near Lachine.   Portuguese to english translation (via google with some formatting) for the lazy...  **Cetaceans, sex and sea serpents**  In 1741 the missionary Hans Egede published the report of a "terrible monster" seen at sea near the coast of Greenland. Accompanied by an illustration of himself which you can see below, would become a particularly famous story in the collection of stories about "sea snakes".  Over the centuries, various explanations have been suggested to the event, like the sailors might have seen a giant squid (Architeuthis) with a raised tentacles confused with a tail. But Charles Paxton, University of Saint Andrews in England recently suggested a more interesting hypothesis. Paxton has received the Ig Nobel biology prize in 2002 for his study on the procession of excited to British farmers ostriches, so it's not so surprising that one of the ideas outlined by scientist to explain the story of Egede is that sailors have seen a whale penis.  Yes, a male whale of a species unknown to mariners, excited for some reason and taking his erect member - which can reach almost two meters long - confused by the tail of a sea serpent .One image, however, may be worth more than the past thirty-five words:  The suggestion is serious, and is contained in a paper published in the journal Archives of Natural History, "Cetaceans, fri   sea serpents: an analysis of the Egede accounts of a Most Dreadful Monster seen off the coast of Greenland in 1734". At work, Paxton together with Erik Knatterud and Sharon Hedley, discusses thoughtfully:  *We do not have "absolute confidence" in our interpretation of the creature Egede. Nor are we suggesting that whale cocks are a universal source of marine sightings of snakes, although we believe that another sighting, the merchant ship Pauline in 1875 when a sea serpent as a White pillar? of views between various sperm? frantic with excitement? (Heuvelmans 1968; Oudemans, 1892), could be a mistake of this nature (penis sperm whales can be white (Harrison, 1938)) .In the case of Egedes, we assume that the use of facsimile snake and drawings were not completely accurate. If they were accurate, then the strongest objection to the interpretation of whale sighting Egede is evident the presence of teeth in the drawing.*  *Our explanation also assumes that the witnesses would not have recognized the penis of a whale and that some species exhibit their penises in the summer of Greenland. Hans Egede (1741 ,1745) described the great Manhood a whale but Egedes may not have realized that he could be seen at sea.*  *Despite these objections, even if the monster was an unknown species, characteristics suggest a cetacean diagnosed. In the end, we will never know for sure. Whatever Poul Egede had seen that day, be a loving whale, a whale without a tail or an unknown species, was a very unusual sight both then and today.*  Which brings us to another fascinating image comparing frightening medieval illustrations with casual pictures whales wildly excited. The first image of a whale penis in this note comes from this site, and second, this.

(edit: spelling)      There are 69 story missions in GTA5. Here is a useful guide to them all:  http://gta.wikia.com/Missions_in_GTA_V  As we know, the order of most of these is optional. You can choose Michael, Trevor or Franklin (or sometimes a combination of the three) before each is begun. Of course, some can only be completed in order, such as the prologue and the ones involving Franklin at the beginning of the story.   Let's make a very conservative estimate that only 30 of these missions are of the type that can be started in an optional order, and that there is a choice of only 2 before each. Then, there are  2 to the power 30 = 1073741824  **1 billion** ways to complete GTA5, depending on the order of missions.  What if the big easter eggs we would all like to see required someone to complete the story with one specific order of missions? Wouldn't that be the kind of elaborate puzzle that rewarded true fans, which Rockstar is likely to set up?  The chance of someone already finishing the game in the correct order yet is miniscule, and Rockstar needs to leave an elaborate clue about the order required. What in the game looks like it could provide those clues? **The Chiliad Mural**.  This post is an extension of the ideas started in this thread started by /u/Notaredditr from a few days ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1wny24/my_mural_theorya_hunter_never_really_stops/  Basically, the lines and glyphs in the mural are a represntation of the GTA5 main story. the ufo is Michael, the egg is Franklin and the jetpack is Trevor. Thankfully the mural is to the right of this post, so you can follow along. Now, here are the key pieces of evidence that this whacky theory may be true and why I believe it should be investigated further:  * the line joining the ufo and the jetpack is the Prologue, because it is at the bottom of the mural and only Michale and Trevor are involved in it. As the story progresses, we go up the mural.  * After the Prologue, we start with Franklin (the egg). He goes up the first middle line, turns left, and eventually meets Michael (the ufo). Then they both come to the first heist, the Jewel Store Job, the first red X. Only those two are involved with that.  * The other red Xs are other heists. I come to the final heist in a bit.  * There are 4 lines which seem to leave the main set of lines, two of which even leave the "mountain" on the mural. These could represent the trip to North Yankton and Did Someone say Yoga, where Michael literally leaves the story, for a while.  * There are 6 heists in GTA5 but only 5 red Xs. The final heist is the eye at the top of the mural, representing the end of the story. What about the 5 lines on top of the eye and the two below? Well, after the final heist you can either kill Michael or Trevor. Those are the two lines below. In the Third Way, the five lines represent the first fight plus the 4 people you have to assassinate in that mission.  How does this relate to completing the missions in a specific order? I believe a good place to start thinking about this is to "travel" along the lines in the mural *which cover the shortest possible distance*. Beyond that, I believe someone with more familiarity with the "mission tree" of GTA5 might be able to identify more parts of the mural's lines, in order to confirm or debunk this theory.   Update: the man who was shot has died.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/man-dies-after-police-shooting-outside-montreal-bus-station-1.2521309      Ah you do indeed. My bad.   I should point out that under this theory, the line underneath connecting M/ufo and T/jetpack would certainly represent the prologue, since these two are involved in that.   Right, is it possible to complete the main storyline by "traversing" the lines in the mural with this idea of M/UFO, F/Egg and T/jetpack in a way that makes any sense? Perhaps by covering the shortest possible distance? This doesn't preclude some big payoff at the end. After all, it's "not how you won or lost, but how you played the game".   OK I'll bite. Could the Xs represent the heists? The first heist, Jewel Store Job, involves only Michael (UFO) and Franklin (Egg), it would be the X on the lower left, most connected to the UFO and Egg. The second last heist (Bureau Raid) also only involves these two, it would be the X on the upper left. The other three heists (Merryweather, Blitz Play and Paleto Score) involve all three characters, and could be the three Xs on the right. The final heist (Big Score) could be represented by the eye at the top, which represents the end of the story. "Come back when your story is complete". The lines in between these could represent the paths of the characters in between the heists, i.e. the intervening missions. Therefore the mural could be a graphical representation of the story.   Most trusted **and** least trusted, according to that poll.  	77
 Could you perhaps try       String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minutes, seconds);   I would consider using python! Python is a scripting language and is pretty easy to pick up and learn and you can do a lot with it - that's why it is used as an intro language for lots of CS courses.   There are also a lot of modules you can use to help you create nice things such as PyGame etc. I would definitely consider giving it a look.    http://i.groupme.com/400x300.jpeg.d8af482b085f4adfa98a846fa1d0e385   my first thought   http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130331234508/aladdin/images/e/e1/Genie.jpg  	4
 `Victoria Argent was a recurring character on MTV"s Teen Wolf played by Eaddy Mays. She is the late wife of Chris Argent and the mother of Allison Argent.  Since the men of the family are hunters and the women are leaders, she was in charge of the hunters in Beacon Hills. ` Read more here: http://teenwolf.wikia.com/wiki/Victoria_Argent   So, many people have their theories. My guesses are: Victoria Argent and The warden at Eichen House  This list has narrowed as the season continued, but I feel like these are strong candidates.  Care to share your theories?           Sam Trammell wasnt even in this episode. I think this may be the first episode that he ever missed on the show. Its such a waste of the character and all because of how some fans responded to him in the last book. I guess if the fans wanted Sam to be a random stranger who had no connection to Sookie, thats exactly what True Blood now turned him into. Sam Merlotte was Merlottesthe living pulse of Bon Temps. Now I dont know what he is. This just makes me sad.   Stop looking for monsters. Were already surrounded by them. The Strain...I loved this quote!         I`m glad too that it will have a second season, I`m excited about the next episodes...one thing is sure though: it`s not for faint hearted people   I also liked the music...it was perfect for the historical set they are trying to depict!   `The Knick' is a look at the professional and personal lives of the staff at New York's Knickerbocker Hospital during the early part of the twentieth century.  I think it`s a pretty good show if you dont mind blood and such. I totally buy Clive Owen as an asshole surgeon. The music is pretty awesome as well and I appreciate the setting and time in history a lot.  Have you seen it yet? What are your thoughts?   Yeah...I think that too!   I think people won`t be offended for too long...at least I hope so!   Yeah...me too! I think it will only go up from here!   Aaron McGruders Black Jesus is going to piss off a lot of people.  I love it already.   	15
 early next year for sure, dodger stadium is certainly one I'm looking forward to seeing, cheers   honestly, more about being there than the beer itself, haven't had a bad beer yet (although miller comes verrrry close).

 I haven't thought about getting help before because just as you said, I didn't even believe I had an addiction problem. Then my boyfriend asked me not to take the pills one night so we could have "cuddle time" (sorry, maybe too much info there) and I panicked because I didn't think I could handle being swamped with my thoughts right then. I'm thinking I probably should try to talk to someone    Thanks for the info. The only kind of support group type settings I've been in were enforced anger management groups when I was in high school. NA sounds a bit more accepting   This post will probably be a bit of a mess.      Over the past couple of months I've started to realize that I'm relying too much on my pain medication to get me through days that I'm not having problems with my condition that I'm prescribed it for. I would like to stop using it altogether and try other pain management things but right now I'm too afraid that trying to do that will topple this proverbial card house that I've built. Nothing feels stable.      I'm only 23 but it still worries me that I have no real direction in my life. My job is not a bad one but there is no option for moving up in the company from my position. I have just barely enough money to scrape by each month if I'm actually being responsible and most months I don't even make my student loan payment. I filed bankruptcy a few months ago and now I worry if anything happens to my car I won't be able to get another one. I have severe anxiety that I take medication for that tends to make me sleepy a lot so my energy level is almost a non-existent sliver on a graph. I think this makes me feel like a don't have the will to change things a lot of the time because I'm just too tired.      I know my pills aren't really helping anything. They are supposed to be there for when my endometriosis symptoms flare up and I absolutely have to have something. But I'm taking them four or more times a week and have to really try hard not to take them more just because I'm having problems dealing with things in other areas of my life.      I'm sure counseling might help but I'm too afraid that I really can't afford $50 just to go talk to someone for an hour. I was thinking about going to an NA meeting but I get anxious around groups of people larger than 3-ish and I feel like they might realize I'm not really ready to quit yet and call me out on it. I really wish I had a better support system. I do have my best friend, we are close and have been for about 13 years but she also struggles with things that make me worry about putting any more on her shoulders. I also have my boyfriend but we have only been dating for a little over 5 months and I worry about telling him how unstable I really feel. I'm not close with my family at all.      I'm just not sure where to start making changes in my life and I'm afraid of trying to give up the one thing that helps me get through bad days with everything else I'm supposed to be dealing with.      :(      Needless to say, I'm having a bit of a rough day.   I really like reeblebeeble's reply.      I would highly suggest if you aren't already taking a daily vitamin, definitely do so. I take medication for acute anxiety and I often make myself a bit sick with my worry and forget to make myself eat right. The vitamin helps me get the things my body needs to run that I otherwise wouldn't get. A car can't run without fuel, and neither can our bodies. I think its just like reeble said, there isn't really a magic formula, all the little bits of advice will help add up to a bigger solution   I was just thinking that!   I just want to squish his little face!!! Adorable :)    Oh dear, that's an interesting reason for the collapse of the web. They definitely made sure we wouldn't joke about killing their baby-faced dictator again, now didn't they? Thanks for your reply!   So it has come to this? 0.0' Your body was among thousands of others found alone in their homes by looters scavenging for supplies. An eerie reminder of the connections between each other that were lost in the internet age. Thanks for your reply!   Oh woe is us! Will we never know of this interesting prompt you thought of?? Thanks for your reply!   Hopefully Jerry was more appreciated at his new job!! Great submission by the way, I enjoyed reading it  	10
 Hmmm...I see what you mean now, but I did put a little bit of blue in the darker skin tone.   I never thought of purple before...I have tried green, but they always look to..."mucky?" can't think of a better word. Any other advice love? If you don't mind that is.   	1

       So happy you have someone there for you during the tough times. Bunnies are the best!   Thank you for saving that little baby, and for seeking out information on how to properly care for her. 3    Really? That is so awesome!    I second all this - and add that black bunnies can also be hard to adopt.   Our post easter lop/lionhead intake isn't as obviously high - and they move out of the shelter quickly   If you can free up a weekend and house them together while hanging out and supervising I think that is the safest way to see if they are ready to live together.   But first - what sneaky_dragon said.  We have one pair that was great right away and we moved them in together after about 3 weeks.  We have another we have been trying to bond for months and we still can't even leave them to play in the roaming area without us in the room.  It sounds like yours get along well - but cuddle with them for a while, let them play together some, and keep a close eye on them the first couple days/nights they are housed together.    The REW T-shirt campaign has ended! We beat our goal - finishing up with 40 shirts sold and $418 raised for REWs!!! Whether you bought a shirt or shared the link - Izzy and I thank you all who helped make our first Booster campaign such a huge success!  https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/575288_225872154250575_156327903_n.jpg   Thank you thank you! I will be over there tonight :-/   Every bit helps and the Rabbit Haven uses money very effectively from what I have seen. Thank you so much for your contribution and well wishes... this is definitely going to be a difficult situation to get under control. 3   hmm... maybe Booster hasn't tested on Chrome? I can ask them about that.   Thank you so much for buying one and for trying to share - I usually just copy paste the link to the page - you might try that :)   My REW Contessa Isabella Button-nose (Izzy) helping me set up the campaign ;)  https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/1391473_218198245017966_1974862070_n.jpg   We have four, and a bird. The cover photo for the page shows all our animals.   Other than that we have Anushka, our foster. And we get to play with all sorts of bunnies at the shelter we volunteer at and the adoption shows we work with The Rabbit Haven. It's a bunderful life :)   What is the purple stuff in the litter?   Awesome! Thank you so much! All rabbits are wonderful but these guys need the extra helping hand.    https://www.facebook.com/BunnyMenagerie  I have a whole album of pics of her and a few of her sister (when they got a little older then started fighting and we had to find a different foster for her sister).    Only a little. Her sister is the sassy one. She is pretty sweet/docile.   Elvira is a cutie! :)   This is her glamorshot https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/944298_216373865200404_1213283964_n.jpg   You should tell your friend about Booster.com if she needs to raise funds for anything!   BTW - our foster bun is a black lionhead half-lop. Even with all that cute, she still hasn't found a home. I believe in black bunny aversion :( https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/1476377_222044297966694_1047771619_n.jpg     Your Barry is right! And damn cute!   He wants to help his brethren.   If you are the one who just bought #35 - Thank YOU! REWs are difficult for us to take in as they are harder to move out to homes - and we are a foster based rescue, no actual facility. People tend to come in wanting lionheads and lops and dwarves. If they have any medical issues this compounds the problem as we have limited funds. With some money for the bunnies we can focus on finding the fosters and not fret about the cost for a few!  (Our fourth bunny is a REW and she is absolutely incredible - smart and sweet and so much fun.)      I meant to have her sit on a perch and hold it - but she was having none of it. If I knew she would be using the candy cane as a perch I would have got a bigger one!!!    Absolutely! Along with our rabbit pics: http://imgur.com/a/EEahq   Two of our 4 were a result of fostering! We have a foster now we have managed not to adopt - but it is so hard. I fall in love with every one of them!            Where do you find tiny wings!!!?   Good luck!   As far as the carpet living room - we put litter boxes in the problem areas. We also block off some areas with an extra x-pen. (You can get them online at amazon for just $35-$40).  Also, depending on what kind of pen you are using - we use a fitted sheet on the xpen of our foster bunny. We put a nice big blanket down, then we just put the pen inside the sheet and pull the elastic edges up the sides of the pen and spread it out. I imagine if you put down blankets, then the shower curtain liner, then did this with a fitted sheet and pen - maybe even using binder clips to clip the sheet to the pen so that they can't pull it off - you could probably keep them from being able to move it. They could still eat through the whole pile if they wanted - but hopefully they wouldn't! Here is a picture of the sheet setup: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=214026748768449 set=pb.186692944835163.-2207520000.1383324903. type=3 theater  RE litter- You are correct. Aspen is a hard wood and is fine to use. Pine and cedar on the other hand are the problematic ones. Details here: http://www.rabbit.org/care/shavings.html Carefresh is fine as well! :)   I would say - new skin for the one with the red scabbies. Then the A D ointment daily on both buns feet (you can get it cheap at any drug store) since they are prone (the weight of the Cali and the fur type of the rex) - wait until you aren't using the new skin to put it on that bun.   One thing you could try is to soften their ground - put down a bunch of thick blankets so it is cushiony. Then cover it with a shower curtain liner and do a single sheet on top. You may have to wash the sheet, but at least you wouldn't have to wash the pile of blankets, and you would have the squishy surface that helps prevent sore hocks in the first place.   As far as litter selections - we used Critter Country to start and now use wood pellets. Yesterdays News is another type of bedding made from recycled paper that you might try. Wood shavings are actually not a safe litter for rabbits (despite being sold for them) because of the phenols in the wood. Basically it is toxic fumes that over time cause liver problems in small animals.   As far as getting him to quit peeing everywhere - keep it clean, use vinegar to get rid of the ammonia scent, and basically don't let him think it is a litterbox. Our rabbits peed most when they were fairly new to each other - they calmed it down a lot the more comfortable they got with each other. Did the peeing start only after changing the litter? Or had it already been a problem?  Also, when I have had problems with lots of peeing, I just put several litter boxes in the pen. That way there was not a lot of space to pee on towels etc., but it was reinforcing the use of the box. Pay attention to if there is a specific spot he wants to pee as well, you can always stick an extra box there.  Good luck!   I LOVE the bag! Gorgeous work!   This is the advice I give to people when I cut their bunnies nails:  What Are Sore Hocks? If you take a close look at the heels of an adult rabbit, you will usually find a small, bare, pale pink callused area right at the tip of the heel, covered by a fold of fur. This is normal. Sore hocks are different - red and inflamed rather than the pale pink callused area. They may weep or become infected. In very severe, untreated cases, the tendons that run over the hock may move out of position, crippling the rabbit. The usual site of trouble is at the tip of the heel, but severe cases may involve any or all of the weight-bearing part of the back and front feet.  There are many predisposing factors: Poor hygiene and damp bedding, Rex coat, long nails, obesity, immobility, unsuitable flooring, large breeds, excessive thumping. Even well cared for house rabbits can get sore hocks.   Causes In the wild a rabbit spends its time moving about on grass and earth. These surfaces are compliant and allow for the healthiest use of the rabbits feet. They allow the toe nails to sink into the ground, encouraging the whole bottom of the foot to contact the ground and hence reducing the pressure on the foot. In contrast, hard flooring means that the rabbits toenails cant sink in. It doesnt make any difference whether the flooring is carpet, wood, vinyl, or plastic. All give the same result; the toe nails cant sink in, the front part of the foot is lifted off the ground, and the majority of the weight is thrown onto the hocks, causing problems rather like a pressure sore. If the rabbit is heavy, or obese, the pressure on the hock is greater and problems are more likely to arise. Conversely, an immobile rabbit wont be hopping about in order to relieve the pressure on the hock area. If the surface upon which bunny spends most time is abrasive (e.g. carpet) this can contribute to sore hocks as well.   Treatment   The first step is to trim the nails as short as possible without damaging the quick.   Next, look at the surface the rabbit spends most time on. The perfect flooring is a compliant surface, where the toe nails can sink in, allowing the foot to function more as nature intended. This should be provided where the rabbit spends most of its time. Layers of fleece can provide a good flooring.   Carpet is abrasive, some bunnies develop friction burns on back and front feet from leaping about on synthetic carpets.   If the rabbit is too fat examine the diet for changes.   Any rabbit kept in damp conditions or outdoors or in a hutch must be brought in.  The hock itself can be treated with the following products: SSD 1% Cream or A   D Ointment   New-Skin can be highly effective treatment for sore hocks. It provides extra cushion to take weight off the hock, and protects the inflamed area, allowing it to heal. Just place some on the affected area and hold your bunny until it dries. Each treatment will last several days.  With a severe case of sore hocks take your rabbit to see the vet for a thorough health check as well as treatment of the actual sore hock. Sometimes systemic antibiotics are required as well as pain medication and possibly bandaging.   Prevention  Keep those nails trimmed, provide good flooring and dont let your bun get fat.   	32
 Yes! I am really starting to get the feeling that I might get more out of the experience if I wait.Thank you for the advice!   Thank you! I was just feeling worried that if I did not start now, that I might be one of those teachers, 30 years in the future, who wishes that they got their masters. It's awesome to hear that your experience may have been better after waiting.   Thank you. These are some awesome questions that I will definitely ask myself.  Truthfully, I miss being a student, I would love a pay raise and I feel like if I don't go back soon, I won't go back at all.   	3
 Kolin looks like Samus Aran in terms of the hairstyle.   Apparently from the Capcom Pro Talk, it was announced they are both commentating Ultra on the srkevo1 stream. Disappointing since I preferred Seth Killian or/and Zhi.    Great for humanity.   Air won't beat Gamerbee in his bracket.   Xiao Hai is a dangerous darkhorse. Won't be surprised if he won it. The KOF god is hungry for SF glory.   Yeah I think so too. Isn't gambling illegal anyway in the Las Vegas hall where the Evo venue is at?   If he sticked to Chun throughout the whole SF4 iteration then I doubt he would make as big as an impact like in 3S.    Daigo got 5th place in Evo 2012. So it would actually be:  1, 1, 4, 5, 7, 48   Apparently there's gonna be a special exhibition between these two at this upcoming Evo on Madcatz's stream. I saw it on MarkMan's twitter but I can't find it. If he deleted it, then I'm gonna assume it's not happening.  	9

 Yeah thats the chalk drawing I saw of it first as inspiration. I then looked up the artist and found her deviant art page, read up on it and said she'd like it changed around for a tattoo. So as you can see I actually switched it up quite a bit with my tattooist.    Oops sorry!! I didn't realize this was risque in the traditional sense. I'll watch for that next time, thanks for the kind warning :)   The direction you're stepping in is outrageous for a first tattoo!! Firstly yes it would be very painful, the area around your eyes is thinly covered by skin and you would be tattooing right over bone which is the most painful.  But what you SHOULD be concerned about is the finality of tattooing your face. Tattoos are forever and your face is YOU, and how the world perceives YOU. there are a ton of things you have to consider before getting anything done neck up. Jobs, dating, social standing, acceptance of the people around you, and dealing with how people will inevitably judge you in a matter of seconds. It will reshape your life by having a facial tattoo, and this is what you really should be considering, not the pain level!  The fact that you're considering something this drastic for a first go based off of fantasy art on LOL makes me think that you're not ready for your first piece of ink. Dont do it!   It's covered haha so no fear here!   No no no lisa did not copy it, that was my original inspiration that I brought to her, but as the blurb on the bottom says I had it changed around quite a bit (colours, dimension, style) before tattooing it. Remember that i came to lisa with the idea, she didnt copy the bird because I asked for a quetzal   As I said previously, inspired more than anything because I still chose to change things for personal taste since it is my permanent decision. I was mostly inspired by their tail feathers and then afterwards the story. I gave my artist the basis and what I liked/didn't like and this is what we created :)   Haha I like that! That's exactly how im going to think of it now :)   Oh wow I had no idea that's a really cool story! I was aware the green had to do with flourishing crops but I hadn't realized the story behind the red belly. Being that it's yellow it's realistic that I could add a strong colour like red on top of it. But honestly I find red to be such a strong colour and it illicits ill feelings from me for some reason.   Kind of overwhelms me, I think because my grandparents LOVED red and everything was red red red. They had these thick red curtains that blocked out all the light in the room I'd sleep in when visiting, and once I couldn't find my way out of the room because it was dark. I started crying and my mom ran in and turned on the lights and it was red everywhere and I just hated it after that haha. Kind of ridiculous what sticks with you from childhood.   It's your national bird right? And traditionally yes it should, but as you can see this isn't traditional in the strictest sense, its more so inspired by a quetzal and left to some interpretation from my artist. I kept the green because it's my absolute favourite colour and 70% of the bird is green, but I wanted to play with the other colours a bit. I'm not a huge fan of red either (surrounded by it as a kid) so that was the first colour I bumped.   I really like this. I like to think of it as "one blind, and one able to see", it's a nice contrast and kind of an artist way to interpret this.   In the GTA, Whitby Ontario. She's amazing but oddly enough she doesnt promote herself much! Just has a private group on facebook that im lucky enough to be a part of. She's really humble and has a loyal client base all by word of mouth.   Recently she was featured as a great Canadian artist in a magazine and I was so happy for her because she never asks for recognition.   Wow quite the compliment! Thank you I appreciate that :)   Well this is definitely the place to be! Just make sure you switch yours up a bit and allow the artist some creative freedom once you decide on a basic design. You'll like it more once you make it unique to your tastes!   Thank you! I'd like to see it! Pm me a pic of it :)   Well firstly it is a beautifully coloured bird and a very feminine image to have on my body (even though this image is based on the male) which is what initially caught my eye.   But also after looking into it, and as someone touched on previously by mentioning quetzalcoatl, the quetzal was viewed by the Mayans as the god of the air and believed to bring light and goodness to the people. I just really like the meaning behind that and what it once meant to an ancient culture.  	15
 Hvorfor i helvede kbe klamt dansk lort nr man kan kbe lkkert Amerikansk istedet?

Jeg kan lige nu finde en masse videnskabelige artikler om at homoseksuelle par ikke burde have brn men jeg gr det ikke da allesammen indtil videre har vret upartiske.

Og hvor er dit bevis for at homoseksuelle forldre ikke er lige s gode?  Jeg har ikke sagt at homoseksuelle forldre ikke er lige s gode.   Arin's butt.    man kan sagtens referere en artikel for at pointere hvor uenig man er.  Det er ikke tilfldet ved de to personer som jeg har nvnt tidligere, hvis du kigger artiklen igennem.   Jeg ser ikke helt sammenligningen. /u/Maybestof siger ikke at alle familiesammenfringer er positive fordi hans er. Han siger at reglerne er en kse, hvor der er brug for en skalpel.  Hvis der er folk som kommer frem og siger at de har lidt skade af at vokse op med homoseksuelle forldre, s er det vrd at tage det i betragtning.  I sidste ende er brnenes velfrd vigtigere for mig end forldrenes ret til brn.   This is my main account.      En referenceliste er en liste over de argumenter/data/citater som man bruger til ens undersgelse.   Lad os nu ikke blande anekdoter ind i det.

Og hvad er det helt prcist der er min holdning indenfor dette omrde? For jeg er rimelig sikker p at jeg ikke har ytret mig omkring min egen personlige holdning.  Jjeg lavede en stikprve p 2 af de personer som der blev refereret til og begge tilhrte LGBT organisationer. Hvad er sandsynligheden for at der ikke findes en 3. i den liste? Hvis man har partiske referencer i sin undersgelse, s bliver ens konklusion ikke ligefrem upartisk. Det er da logisk nok.  Desuden findes der ogs mennesker som er vokset om med homoseksuelle forldre som har fortalt at de nskede at de havde en mor og en far istedet:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3001703/Another-mom-never-replaced-father-lost-Woman-raised-lesbian-moms-comes-against-gay-marriage.html   Jeg siger at de referencer som de bruger til deres undersgelse, er taget fra folk som har rdder fra LGBT organisationer som jo vel ikke er upartiske.  Her er der en komplet referenceliste:  http://faculty.law.miami.edu/mcoombs/documents/Stacey_Biblarz.pdf   At de ikke har rdder i LGBT organisationer ligesom at en person som er medlem af Christian Organisation of Family Values heller ikke vil vre upartisk hvis de kom ud og sagde at brn af homoseksuelle par var drligere stillet.   Nu har jeg s gjort dit dirty work, og fundet frem til referencerne i artiklerne.  Sjovt at personerne som der er refereret til, s som Sharon L. Huggins, Theresa Gramlich, osv. har rdder i visse LGBT organisationer.  Igen m jeg gentage mig selv: Upartiske undersgelser, tak.  	22

Boehner's office said the visit aimed to send "a strong, unequivocal message that the House of Representatives wants to maintain a right-sized presence in Afghanistan."   Starting in 1964  the same year he signed the Civil Rights Act  U.S. forces and their allies flew more than 580,000 bombing missions across Vietnams neighbor to the west, targeting nearly every corner of the country. The bombs stopped falling in 1973.    Great comment.  Thanks!   Its like a combination between a college reunion and The Big Chill, said Ron Kaufman, a longtime political director for the 41st president.   He dropped bombs on innocent civilians and he's worried about morality?   Does anyone have the video?   Please watch this video.  * Carter calls Osama bin Laden, et. al "freedom fighters" and admits he was responsible for giving them weapons. * He admits that he threatened the Soviet Union with nuclear war if they moved any further east than Afghanistan. * He thinks the U.S. should go to war over Crimea.    "I was hoping the United States would say, 'Let's sit down and talk and solve these problems,' but America was going on and doing what I expected them to do."   "Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country, McCain said. Its kleptocracy, its corruption. Its a nation thats really only dependent upon oil and gas for their economy. And so economic sanctions are important. Get some military assistance to Ukrainians, at least so they can defend themselves. Resume the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Look at Moldova and Georgia, both of whom are occupied by Russian troops as we speak, a path toward membership in NATO.   Declare that any further Russian military incursion beyond Crimea will lead to a rapid and favorable response from NATO to any request from Kiev for weapons. These would be accompanied by significant numbers of NATO trainers and advisers.   I think this is actually an important event.  A conservative Texas Republican governor thinking it's politically prudent to take a more moderate stand on pot legalization.  This never would have happened 5 years ago.   How convenient...   People my age have grown up with a decade of war and were tired of it, Mezzina said. When people like Sen.

Laurence Vance's response: [Professional Murderer to Be Honored at Super Bowl](http://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/professional-murderer-to-be-honored-at-super-bowl/)   Late post, but thought this story was worth a read.   So who did they kill?   How many countries are stamped on your passport?  Quite a few.  I've always found that people are pretty much the same around the world.  You see dark-skinned head-chopping religious fanatics around every corner.  You've been brainwashed by the U.S. military, I haven't been.   You and your attitude are why people around the world hate and want to kill Americans.  You're a murderer for Empire, nothing more.    The Lone Survivor episode is a tragedy that reveals the best of American bravery. But even greater tragedies could come if Americans leave this movie believing that purposely targeting innocents can ever be right, and heedless of how this attitude undermines our war efforts.   US engagement 'as broad and deep as at any point in history'    Middle-school sports programs at Defense Department schools in the Pacific are the latest **victims** of defense budget cuts.  Interesting word choice considering the military's role in the world.   BTW, that Tom Hanks movie is a piece of jingoistic bullsh*t.  Muscular star-spangled white guys murdering skinny black dudes.  USA-USA-USAwhatever.   Obviously, a very unbiased piece of journalism:  Some scholars affiliated with the Mises Institute have combined dark biblical prophecy with apocalyptic warnings that the nation is plunging toward economic collapse and cultural ruin. Others have championed the Confederacy. One economist, while faulting slavery because it was involuntary, suggested in an interview that the daily life of the enslaved was not so bad  you pick cotton and sing songs.   I wonder if the U.S. will also condemn [this attack](http://news.antiwar.com/2014/01/17/probe-wednesday-us-air-strikes-killed-14-afghan-civilians/)?   The NYT article makes depressingly, horrifyingly clear that we remain very, very far from becoming adults, if by "adult" we mean recognizing certain unalterable facts of our existence. Our politicians, our military personnel, and many Americans still refuse to face honestly and completely the reality of what the U.S. did in Iraq, just as they refuse to recognize the blood-drenched reality of U.S. foreign policy in general. It is inconceivable that any of the catastrophic consequences of our actions, including the suffering of U.S. military personnel, should be our own responsibility. We therefore blame anything and anyone else, including the victims of our own crimes.   "Hygienic reasons?"  Check out the pics and see if you come to the same conclusion:  http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/15/iraq-soldier-bodies-on-fire-marines-investigation-military-photos/   How is the US govt and political class killing innocent people in Yemen "off topic"?   but then brightened up after perusing his investment brokerage account statement."   If the United States does not get involved, al-Qaeda is likely to win. None of our options is good. Each has risks, but doing too little also has risks.   Will he do the same for the Afghan War, which he supported?   I'm no elementary school construction expert, but doesn't that seem like a lot of cash for two schools?   What were they doing in England in the first place?  Protecting us from the imminent Soviet invasion of West Germany?   No, I didn't expect "good karma."  People want to believe that the American empire is somehow different from empires of the past.  That's delusional and pathetic, but the reaction is completely predictable.   Libya holds 48 billion barrels of crude reserves  Africa's largest  according to BP Plc. The OPEC-member nation has struggled to restore production to levels reached before the civil war that toppled Khadafy in 2011.   "Gains?"  Huh?   King said these Republicans calling for Clappers resignation are part of "the isolationist wing of the party.   Americans and their representatives in Congress are often skeptical of peacekeeping operations and reluctant to fund them. But the argument in their favor is this: They promote stability, serve our interests and save innocent lives without sending in the Marines.   Marine Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, called Karzai to apologize personally. The international coalition also issued a statement saying it deeply regrets the incident.    Marine Gen. Joseph F.

The international coalition also issued a statement saying it deeply regrets the incident.    "I know he felt very bad about the whole thing, that this Vietnamese agent had been killed," said Michael Heaney, a Vietnam veteran who taught at Outward Bound. "I don't think he was ever sure whether the guy was a spy or not.... But he decided not to let it end his usefulness. **He turned around and did good things the rest of his life."**    For CY 2013, there have been 112 potential not on active duty suicides (70 Army National Guard and 42 Army Reserve): 81 have been confirmed as suicides and 31 remain under investigation. Updated not on active duty suicide numbers for CY 2012: 140 (93 Army National Guard and 47 Army Reserve): 138 have been confirmed as suicides and two remain under investigation.   Send in the Marines?   And it falls upon Muslims themselves to take on their violent brothers.  Has Rand taken on his Christian "violent brothers?"   Today's war is perpetrated by **"a fanatical element of Islam,"** Rand said, adding that most Muslims are not commited to violence against Christians. However, those who are number in the tens of millions, he said. And it falls upon Muslims themselves to take on their violent brothers.   But the United States wants to keep using Special Operations forces to target the **roughly 75 operatives** that American commanders estimate remain in Afghanistan.   Afghanistan is decades away from self-sufficiency  it currently covers only about 20 percent of its own bills, with the rest paid by the United States and its allies.   Because cluster bombs are so much more humane in their killing technique, right?   He participated in an aggressive, unjustified war that resulted in the deaths of a million Iraqis.  How's that for starters?   How many different Reddit user names do you have?   First Sarah Palin, then Rick Santorum, and now Michele Bachmann.   Great comment.  Thanks.   Who will act against America's "crimes against humanity?"   In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, Senator Rand Paul ( R-KY), who is Ron Paul's son, said his preferred choice for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve would be either Friedrich Hayek or Milton Friedman, both of whom are dead.   Good news for the Filipino brothel industry.   I think they've been watching [The Dark Knight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Dqf6Ptjoo) too much.   Hilary Renner, a State Department spokeswoman in Washington, said the embassy extended its deepest condolences to Mariki's family and wished those injured a speedy recovery.   I wonder if Obama will agree to extradite the suspect?   He described Al Qaeda, the reason the United States came to Afghanistan, as a shell of its former self, with **only about 75 members** in Afghanistan, and most of them too busy trying to stay alive to plan attacks in the West.   We left (Iraq) on the edge of being stable, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, a former military intelligence officer, told Fox News.   While saying it's clear the job was "not done," he warned: Al Qaeda as an entity is coming back strong within the region and is doing things to destabilize governments, which, at this point in time, are still friendly to us."   "What it makes me feel is deeper guilt," said Mike Prysner, an anti-war activist who, at 19, was part of the 2003 Army invasion. He served in Iraq for 12 months and left the service as a corporal.   "One of our roles was to shred their national identity. What is happening today is a direct result of the U.S. occupation's strategy," added Prysner, 30. "I remember the Iraqi government being setup along ethnic lines by the U.S. occupation. I remember arming certain ethnic groups to fight others. I'll live the rest of my life knowing I was a part of that."    But he wouldn't fight as hard if he knew the weapons would be used against Muslims or Hindus?   He was told there could come a situation where he might be forced to fire on a child. He realized then he could not fire upon a child, even if that child was a risk to him  Thats when things really clicked for him. Thats when he didn't believe anymore that he could kill.   I'm from the U.S. and I don't want our military anywhere near Australia.   The capture shows "active participation in the field of North American military men and mercenaries in counter-insurgency operations under the guise of contractors," the statement read.   The news is that armed *American* fighter jets are flying missions in *Australia*.  Why?   Lincolns belief in a strong union **dedicated to civil rights**  Obviously, Mr. Gerson has never read any of Tom DiLorenzo's books.    The **Air Force closed** Highway 98 west of Panama City and east of Mexico Beach because of fires from the crash.  Where does the Air Force get the authority to unilaterally close a highway?  Scary   "It's not like it was a conscious thought or decision," he said of that moment. "But one was like, 'You know what, [urinate] on these guys.' And some said, 'Yeah, [urinate] on them.'"   Yes, in case you are unaware, Barack Obama is the President of the United States.   To Democrat supporters finally disillusioned: we dont need better candidates we need a fucking revolution. The side of human dignity is with Americas victims, not with the murderous arrogance of the professional sociopaths of American empire who are their victimizers.    I want to lay blame squarely on the shoulders of the person who is responsible for the carnage.   Is Nigeria the next stop for the Endless War?   "Unlike Iraq, to which comparisons are often made, the Afghans actually need us to stay. Most Afghans want us to stay. And we have promised to stay, he added.   Officially, a Berlin spokesman confirmed on Friday, Bienkowski is suspected of having violated a law against "**insulting organs and representatives of foreign countries**."   From the comments: "That a society would willingly go to such lengths to eradicate an intoxicating plant in a futile attempt to make itself 'idiot-proof' is in itself an act of profound idiocy."   We know that something like 40 to 50 percent of Americans dont vote. **Ron Paul created his vote. His people were not previously Republicans. They were disaffected, anti-government activists who hated the political process.** He drew them from those Americans who dont vote, and a lot of them are going to go back to not voting.   In northern Afghanistan, the State Department last year abandoned plans to occupy a large building it had intended to use as a consulate. After spending more than $80 million and signing a 10-year lease, officials determined the facility was too vulnerable to attacks.   [From the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/science/civil-war-toll-up-by-20-percent-in-new-estimate.html?pagewanted=all _r=0): By combing through newly digitized census data from the 19th century, J. David Hacker, a demographic historian from Binghamton University in New York, has recalculated the [Civil War] death toll and increased it by more than 20 percent  to 750,0000.  Is it possible that there was a better way to solve Lincoln's problems with the South other than killing nearly a million people?  Why is it crazy to ask that question?   Suffice it to say, if anyone in Pauls office knew of this mans background then Paul has a serious problem on his hands. And if no one bothered to vet Hunter, then concerns about the close-knit, amateurish staff will heighten.  All that because Jack's made statements that the disastrous American Civil War may have been a mistake?   Obviously, he's lying.    Interviewer: Did the NSA help to create Stuxnet? (Stuxnet is the computer worm that was deployed against the Iranian nuclear program.)  Snowden: NSA and Israel co-wrote it.   Yes, because [socialism and militarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism) are always diametrically opposed and can never be part of the same philosophy.   Barack Obama is president now.  You may want to thank him as well.   That George W. Bush, who is known to have authorized torture and numerous other crimes against humanity, is being given an award for improving the human condition is a sick, cruel joke, she wrote.   The $310 million project, which faced considerable opposition from Italians against militarism, will house elements of the 173rd, the 509th Signal Battalion and eventually U.S. Army Africa. A few dozen protesters still opposed to the project gathered several blocks away.   Maybe.  But he's sure as hell more deserving of the award than Barack Obama.   It appears to undermine the claim made by President Obama in a May speech that "conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones, and likely to cause more civilian casualties and local outrage".   It is no worse than what other countries have done in the past/are doing now.  For the last 50 to 60 years, the US govt is by far the [most violent and deadly force on the planet earth](http://www.alternet.org/investigations/executive-branch-evil-and-lawless).  Your statement is simply incorrect.   Maybe he can't get past the mountains of corpses the US govt is responsible for throughout Africa and the rest of the world.   Like President Barack Obama, Bush deflected criticism of the spy program.  "I put the program in place to protect the country, and one of the certainties is civil liberties were guaranteed," Bush said in the interview.    Some folks mightve looked at Ron Paul and dismiss him out of hand because he was far too extreme to them. Theyll not be able to do the same thing with Rand after they meet him. If you sit and talk to Rand, he comes across as extremely bright, extremely articulate and the farthest thing from crazy or extreme.   I'm assuming you're talking to the WashTimes headline writer, not me.  The headline above is directly from their website.   Note how the WaPost leaves out the second part of the quote in their headline.   It is a matter of indisputable fact that the U.S. Executive Branch has over the past 50 years been responsible for bombing, shooting, burning alive with napalm, blowing up with cluster bombs, burying alive with 500-pound bombs, leveling homes and villages, torturing, assassinating and incarcerating without evidence more innocent civilians in more nations over a longer period of time than any other government on earth today.   We're supposed to worship these military guys, right?   Witnesses had testified that Hutchins and another marine shot Awad and placed an AK-47 and a shovel next to the corpse to suggest he had been planting a bomb.   Note he didn't say anything about sending drones.   Great comment.  Thanks.   Nice try, but that makes absolutely no sense.   I never said that the US is "worse than Nazi Germany," so please don't put words in my mouth.  You still have never explained how Germany, located across the Atlantic Ocean and then some, posed a threat to your beloved Homeland.  Stopping genocide was never a war aim of the US govt.  You're smart enough to know that.   You're actually wishing that the Axis had conquered Eastern Europe   Actually, if the USA had never entered the ETO, it is less likely Stalin would have "conquered Eastern Europe."  Hitler then could have concentrated more forces on the eastern front thereby preventing Stalin from advancing to Berlin.  Over time, the Russians would have pushed the Germans out of the USSR but probably wouldn't have had the political or military will to set up the Communist eastern bloc buffer zone that eventually rec'd the Allies' tepid blessing.  the wholesale extermination of Eastern Europe  If you're talking about the extermination of the Jews and other minorities, please remember that the USA did not go to war with Germany to stop what became the Holocaust.  In fact, [FDR was turning away ships with Jewish refugees as late as May of 1939](http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267).  Here's one passage from the article:  "Sailing so close to Florida that they could see the lights of Miami, some passengers on the St. Louis cabled President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking for refuge. **Roosevelt never responded**."  So perhaps the "miserable racist fuck" you're thinking of is one of America's most beloved presidents.  put a bullet in your head, you fascist fuck  In fact, as a libertarian anarchist I'm the exact opposite of a fascist.  My guess is that your views are much closer to those of the Nazi party.  You probably support torture, endless war against Muslims and other suspect non-white peoples, rendition, domestic spying and the collaboration between govt and corporations in advancing the interests of the state.  I seriously doubt that you have ever advanced the notion that American society would be much better off if it embraced the principles of liberty.    Even granting your premise that we weren't threatened by Germany (which I don't)  How again was "The Homeland" threatened by the German military?  I still find your view repulsive  I support peace.  You blindly support war, the most evil enterprise ever created by man.  Whose views are truly repulsive?  a country directly responsible for mass murder and aggression  Then you should engage in war against America.  Because what country on the planet is more responsible for "mass murder and aggression" then your beloved Homeland?   Germany posed no threat whatsoever to invade the USA.  They couldn't even conquer England from bases in France.  The US govt should have simply ignored Germany's declaration of war.  If they had, millions of lives would have been saved and Eastern Europe probably wouldn't have suffered thru 45 years of Communist oppression.   It is irrelevant whether Germany declared war on the USA, they never posed any threat to the "homeland" and therefore America should never have been involved in the European war.   Yes, I did.  If you feel so strongly about your views, then sign up with the U.S. military and go kill Muslims in foreign countries.  Or, perhaps you can become a drone pilot and kill Muslims from Nevada.     You may want to ask yourself *why* someone would want to attack your "homeland."  Perhaps your govt was bombing that person's country for decades killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people.  Maybe your govt had initiated sanctions that had caused untold misery among the population.  Maybe your govt had bankrolled and supported the oppressive dictatorial regime that had terrorized the citizens of his country for decades.  Of course I'm assuming you are talking about the 9/11 attacks since the Germans did not initiate an unprovoked attack against the United States in either WW1 or WW2.   Jesus, man, you are one sick and immoral person.   Because there's never a better way to solve problems than killing millions of innocent people.   Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.   Yes, I am telling you that the neither the Zimmerman Telegram nor the Lusitania incident justified U.S. involvement in WW1.  Of course, the Germans weren't involved in the Pearl Harbor bombing so that attack did not justify the U.S. entering the European war in WW2.  the two worst wars that the world has ever seen  They were both made worse by U.S. involvement.   You need to read more history.  Both of those wars were b.s.  In any event, America never should have been involved.  Germany never threatened the "homeland" and therefore all of those soldiers died for absolutely nothing.   Yeah, like when?  Give me a couple of examples.   Then why continue the wars, drone attacks and killing?   Small children are burned alive in cars. Worshippers are cut down outside their own mosques. This is beyond unacceptable, he said on May 17; Systemic violence is ready to explode at any moment."   I expect him not to go on a trip that costs "tens of millions" when the benefit to the United States is zilch.   Nothing like a new war to distract from scandal.   he should have revealed it to a congressional oversight committee  Yeah, I'm sure that would have done a lot of good.   Silber takes Glenn Greenwald to task for not releasing all of the information contained in the Snowden docs.   Please don't comment.  You're just embarrassing yourself.

Update: [17 killed](http://www.stripes.com/suicide-blast-in-kabul-kills-17-near-us-embassy-1.225326)   No one can seriously deny today that the war on terror is and always was a war on the American peoplea cover for imperialist war internationally and an unrelenting assault on democratic rights within the US.   Jones said she didn't interfere with or touch any of the officers, who were dressed entirely in black, including their masks and combat boots. **Police were accompanied by a crew from the reality TV show, "The First 48."**   Personally I am willing to accept a little more danger to my life from terrorists than the greater danger posed by those seeking to destroy our rights under the pretense that they are making us safe. What say you?   Huh? The govt - Congress and the White House - are responsible for tapping the phones of Verizon customers.  Did you even have a point or did you just want to repeat your partisan "Tea Bagger" talking points that you learned on the Daily Kos?  Please don't comment again.  You're just embarrassing yourself.   How about we blame Congress and the White House?   When he told a woman he was seeing that hed been a drone operator, and contributed to the deaths of a large number of people, she cut him off. **She looked at me like I was a monster**, he said.

Brandon Bougades [is] a 31-year-old decorated, two-tour Army sergeant who is in the last stages of medical retirement after being hit by multiple bomb blasts in Afghanistan.   In the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendant now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.   David Coombs, Mannings civilian defense lawyer, opened by describing an incident in Iraq on December 24, 2009. A US military convoy, traveling along a roadway, forced a vehicle carrying five civilians onto the side of the road. They struck a roadside bomb.  At Forward Operating Base Hammer, where Manning was stationed, he and other intelligence officers watched the event unfold. The other soldiers erupted in cheers because the US forces were unhurt, Coombs said. Manning was disturbed.   I didn't see any white South African leaders on the list.   [We're not](http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2013/01/03/u-s-likely-to-keep-thousands-of-troops-in-afghanistan-after-nato-forces-leave/).   We lost out, said Michael Makovsky, a former Defense Department official in the Bush administration who worked on Iraq oil policy. **The Chinese had nothing to do with the war, but from an economic standpoint they are benefiting from it, and our Fifth Fleet and air forces are helping to assure their supply.**    Mr. Paul wanted to define himself for those skeptics as not being an all government is bad libertarian - an image his father, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, had among some of his fellow Republicans.    I am a libertarian-conservative who spends most of my free time outdoors, he said at one point, seeking to make the case that conservatives are not indifferent about preserving the environment.  I bike and hike and kayak., I compost, I plant trees, he said. In fact, I have a giant Sequoia Im trying to grow in Kentucky.   He hated the damn savages he was fighting.

[Baghdad bombs kill 16 in Sunni-Shi'te bloodletting](http://news.yahoo.com/bombs-hit-baghdad-districts-least-10-dead-073044431.html)   Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned.   [More Than 50 Killed in Wave of Baghdad Bombings](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2013/05/27/world/middleeast/27reuters-iraq-violence.html?hp _r=0)   Perhaps war is so obscene that even the people who supported it dont want to hear the details or acknowledge their role.

I have a penchant for deceit. I am generally free of entangling and irrational emotions. I am strategic and canny, intelligent and confident, but I also struggle to react appropriately to other people's confusing and emotion-driven social cues.

[43 more dead in Iraq](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/iraq-bombing_n_3291896.html)   From the comments section:  Take an 18 or 19 year old. Send them off to a needless, futile war in a country and culture they know nothing about. Force them to observe brutality they had never conceived. Have them watch their buddies be slaughtered and or maimed for life. Send them home, where life goes on and no one really understands the profound change in their life and perceptions. Let them deal with the VA bureaucracy that is consistantly overwhelmed and underfinanced. Have the VA delay or deny their rightful claim to disability. Have republican members of Congress vote against a Veterans Employment Bill.  Combinatons of the above can induce suicidal ideation and action.  Most effective solution?

I don't have time to educate someone who is clearly so ignorant of current events.   If you don't know that the U.S. military led by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney destroyed Iraq and brutalized several other countries, then I can't help you.  I'm sure you also believed that O.J. Simpson was innocent of the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.  Now get back to listening to the Rush Limbaugh show.   And, as President of the United States, the most powerful job on planet Earth, he is incapable of taking any measures to close it.  Blind partisanship is so childish.  Please grow up.   For starters, why don't you go visit the graveyards in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia?  Or, maybe you're right and the people in those countries have only benefited from a decade of bombings, secret prisons and torture. USA! USA! USA!   Dick Cheney is responsible for the destruction of hundreds of thousands of innocent lives across the globe...How's that?   The [ORB Study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORB_survey_of_Iraq_War_casualties).   I guess he's forgotten about the Iraq War he initiated that killed a million Iraqis.  Maybe the heart transplant has affected his memory.   A philosophy that could have reformed the GOP and the country.   Dream on.   Fucking Rand Paul.

"Were doing a lot more there on the ground than really is known..."   From Wikipedia: Keller was one of the leading supporters of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, explaining his backing for military action in his article 'The I-Can't-Believe-I'm-A-Hawk Club'. Two days after the invasion, Keller wrote the column 'Why Colin Powell Should Go' arguing for US Secretary of State's resignation because his strategy of diplomacy at the UN had failed. In contrast, Keller was much more sympathetic to Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, describing him as the 'Sunshine Warrior'.   It's Obama's legacy now.   I guess we need to start another war...   I still post every death from every illegal war the U.S. is currently engaged in.  I'm generally downvoted by angry war-loving nationalists such as yourself so I'm not sure how that's "karma-whoring."   I guess mass killings are only acceptable when committed by U.S. forces.

[Khaleesi](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Khaleesi) is a title for the female leader of a Khalasar (the wife of the Khal).  Like "Queen". So characters, particularly the Dothraki, address her as such.  But as has been said before, you wouldn't use her title without an article (a, the) to refer to such a person in the third person (i.e. "Queen looks very lovely in her elegant gown").   i have no idea why you're being downdawkinsed. cooome ooon reddit. EDIT: this.   Since he is bastard born, he wouldn't be a true Lannister either.  He'd probably be a "Tommen Hill" since his parents are from the Westerlands.   Awesome!  Please look into permaculture practices as well!      Here is a great article that goes in depth about how the word "organic" is being systematically rendered meaningless for the sake or protecting corporations:  [USDA Takes Over Organic](http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/usda-takes-over-organic-program-eroding-organic-standards-to-benefit-big-food/)   I found an [update](http://www.koat.com/news/omarees-stepfather-charged-in-childs-death/25743702) on the story.

Could it be that Vermont's government isn't completely corrupt? Should I start packing my bags for Vermont?   How bout that Queen of Thorns? *swoon*   In the call, the man mentions the kid's little brother.  Please tell me that child is now out of reach of these sick sick people!   Literally.   Upsagans for you, good sir!   So brave.   Your post is so arrogant and assumptive it's not really even worth replying to, but here goes.  But the GMO labeling initiative is not in any way meant to inform or educate consumers. It's meant to mislead and scaremonger.  This is not a fact, it's an assumption.  The people who rally and petition to get GMO labeling laws on the ballots care very much about consumer knowledge.  Calling GMOs "GMOs" is not in any way misleading.  If the industry is proud of their product why are they afraid to let people know what it is?  You would think they would wear the label with pride.  Mandatory labeling doesn't necessarily imply a "huge health risk".  It implies that people should be free to make their own decisions for a variety of different reasons.  It has nothing to do with how safe the industry-funded studies say it is.  As I said before, there are a variety of reasons someone might want to avoid GMOs.  We don't need to go point by point on those reasons.  It's about having the knowledge necessary to make personal decisions about what to put in ones own body AND what industry practices we want to encourage with our dollars.  **Saying that people shouldn't have the right to know what they are eating because they don't know what's good for themselves is EXTREMELY arrogant.**  Then you quoted some arguments for labeling in the bill, but offered no refutation of those points, just said it was "propaganda".  Ok, well that's like your opinion, man.  How is slapping a sticker on something that says "GMO" going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance?  Well, for one it's going to let people know that they are and have been eating GMO foods for years.  Make of that what you will.  Most people don't even know what GMOs are.  When they see it labeled they are going to go home and look it up, and then it will be up to them to decide if it's something they want to buy or not.  If you are a proponent of GMOs, the best thing you can do is to make your case for them honestly and out in the open.  Not just hope that people never realize what they are eating.  You obviously didn't read the article I linked to, so whatever.  Now, looking through your post history reveals that your entire account is devoted to pro GMO posting. 2,831 comments and every single one about GMOs.  Now tell us something honestly.  Are you paid to do this?   Do you know if VT's law will count as a state towards enacting CT's law?   The potential problem with labeling GMOs is that the vast majority of consumers are not educated on them.  You are contradicting yourself with this statement.  You are saying that because most people don't know about GMOs, we shouldn't notify people about GMOs.  Don't you think that if people realized that nearly everything they buy in the store contains GMOs they will be more likely to educate themselves about them?  How is not labeling going to solve the problem of GMO ignorance? It's not.  Moreover, health concerns aren't the only reason people are concerned about GMOs. What about the fact that [pesticide use is increasing due to GMOs](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002)?  What about the concerns that GMOs further encourage monoculture farming, something which many believe we need to move away from for the sake of the environment?  Those with concerns about GMOs and their impact on our planet might be more educated than you think.   Ser pounce loves the bitches   Score!   That is until they pass the books.

You do realize that the "JIDF" picked that name for themselves, right?  It's a perfect example of what I was talking about above.  Zionists trying to speak on behalf of all Jews to legitimize their cause.   This is just sick!   SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK SKANK!!!!   Guess what. There are some racist people on /r/conspiracy[1] , just as there are some racist people in every subreddit, and probably every subculture in the world. I call them out when I see them. Not everyone, or even most people, on there are racist. You can cherry pick examples of ugliness from any subreddit. What is the point of doing this? Seriously?   Dude said.. we want to be there to ensure that [wikipedia articles] are balanced and Zionist in nature.   Does he see the irony in that statement?   Ever hear of the [Streisand effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)? EDIT: This was supposed to be in reply to salvia_d above.   /r/conspiracy is really struggling to walk this fine line.  The problem arises from Zionism being so conflated with Judaism, by Zionist themselves, as well as its critics.  We all know that criticism of Israel doesn't equate to "antisemitism" (anti-Judaism).  It becomes confusing because of the Zionist's insistence that it does, which is really presumptuous on their part because there are MANY jews who either actively oppose Zionism, or just don't care that much one way or the other.  Further, many people do in fact use the "anti-Zionism does not equal antisemitism" defense to say things which actually ARE anti-jewish.  I see it on this subreddit all the time and it becomes really exhausting to call it out all the time (while usually being downvoted for doing so).   Because there were no wars before Israel?  I'm sorry, I'm the first to criticize the Israeli government for its policies of discrimination, aggression, etc. but this sort of hyperbole is really not helping.   I'll just say that in chess, if you resign your chance of winning becomes 0%.  Also the unpredictability of the future is our friend.   I don't buy any of this crap.         You correctly identified the challenges, but why ever start with the premise that a problem "won't be solved"? These certainly are big challenges and it does look like the cards are stacked against us, but we can and WILL overcome. I will never believe that humanity is doomed to slavery.  We just need to start thinking outside the box and taking bold action.  Companies are legally responsible for maximizing profit to shareholders, not sharing the profits with workers or hiring more workers  This is true of corporations, and this is why we should avoid working for corporations.  Join or start a workers coop!  I've seen some very successful ones, for instance, look at the rise of credit unions as an alternative to commercial banks.  What's to stop worker's collectives from advancing in every single industry if we have the will to do it?  Globalization has merely made all human labor cheaper as jobs now compete with slave labor (it's unbelievable wrong that slavery still exists in the year 2014... yet slaves make our clothes, our ipads, etc.)  So stop buying crap.  Commit to buying/trading/gifting locally with people you know.  You'll end up with really unique stuff that you treasure and that you know that no one suffered to make.  Technology continues to reduce the need of human labor  This is actually a really good thing!  It's only under our current system that technology (which is really just efficiency) becomes a hardship for people.  Doing things with less effort is a good thing.  I can image a world where machine produce our food and other goods in sustainable ways and leaves humans to innovate and relax.  Learn DIY technology and you'll be taking the power back.  The rise of the sociopath... the system of profits over social good/contribution rules the day now.  It starts with you.  Change your own life and you begin transforming society.  Transform society and you begin to change people's psychology.  Debt ... finally the big one. When you spend more than you have for a long time, you eventually destroy growth. A person would have declared bankruptcy and started fresh, but a gov with $17T of debt can't declare bankruptcy. With no room for more debt (beyond the rate at which it will rise already) there's basically no money to drive any kind of growth initiatives or more importantly create confidence that things are going to be 'ok' for the next 30 years (which spurs investment).  When people rely less on the pervasive system to meet their everyday needs, money will slowly lose its importance.  This may take a really long time or it may happen very quickly.  In the meantime a political movement to alleviate people from debt would be a big help.  **TL;DR: There is hope.  Think creatively!**   Yes it is.   Dude... don't tell me how "Jews" operate.  Say all you want about Zionists, people with a political agenda, but when you go throwing the word "Jew" around you come off sounding like a bigoted prick.  Not all jews are Zionists and many are adamantly anti-Zionist.  If you read the article posted you would understand that.   Shrooms are still legal in Holland? I thought they were banned after a drunk/tripping French girl threw herself off a bridge in '07.   This news of Israel dropping fluoride is undoubtedly a good thing.  Most of the Israeli population is manipulated by their government just like any other nation.  An awakening of Israeli consciousness will help them to understand and challenge the atrocities going on in their name.  I don't think removing fluoride means they are gearing up for more war.  The Israeli government has no problem starting wars as is.   I thought this was [relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythrdCsOFJU)   If fluoride makes people docile and apathetic, and removing it makes them aggressive, why is the most aggressive country in the world, the USA, fluoridated?   Americans won't get off their asses to protest being spied on in every conceivable way, but they will to defend their right to stream movies?  Well, maybe.   Instructions unclear: penis stuck in Le Nice MayMay Man   Instructions unclear: mind stuck on this silly meme   Fair enough.  See my reply to /u/NegativeGhostwriter below.  Thanks for replying with actual evidence instead of just ignoring/downvoting me.  I would really like to continue to investigate things with a skeptic such as yourself, and perhaps we can take a look at some other claims.  In the future I'll do my own debunking before submitting bodies of evidence to others (especially skeptics).  Everybody has confirmation bias.  The only way to approach truth is through a constant challenging of beliefs by others who with different world views.  I think a subreddit devoted to theorists and skeptics doing just this in a friendly matter would be awesome.  I (and many other people who challenge widely-accepted assumptions) really am committed to finding the truth, wherever that may lead.  Let's work together on that.   When I first posted my link I was downvoted immediately without anyone posting any sort of rebuttal.  That's why I wrote my edit.  I'm happy /u/Tony_AbbottPBUH actually replied with some real information and I spend a lot of time looking through the NIST documents.  He seems to be right that some of the information in the link I posted seems to have no valid source.  I am perfectly capable of seeing this and admitting when I am wrong.  I am not an expert on everything 9/11, and in fact, I haven't been 100% convinced with any version of the events.  I am committed to truth and I challenge myself and others.  Do not make assumptions about me (or anyone) please.   Uptoked.      Discredited by whom?  Why don't you try addressing the content of the article instead of using ad hominems?

I just made an account to say this, and I'm hijacking the top comment to say this, and I'm probably going to be downvoted for this but...  Upvote me.   Can't we just have something genuinely uplifting around here for a change?   He's also started extending the range of the light spectrum that he can hear.  He can now perceive UV and IR light.  Pretty darn cool (and useful?).   He talks about it in the video linked to in the article.  I was really hoping you'd be able to train yourself to have that sense even after you remove the sensor.   You're saying that one can't criticize or advocate independence from corporations if they've ever once used a service or purchased a product from one?  That's pretty a pretty absurd sentiment.  Following that logic it would be "hypocritical" to petition for any sort of governmental change if you've ever walked down a road paved by tax money.   So?   Take your life into your own hands.  Yes, the system is completely corrupt. You can not rely on your politicians, your "leaders", your government, or your corporations.  You can only rely on yourself and your community.  (Choose your community wisely.)  The way to freedom is through self-sufficiency.  Learn to grow your own food.  If you can produce your own power, even better.  Find the right people to band together with and build a life that depends less and less on the existing power structure.  When people do this in mass, and the state is fading to irrelevancy, it will have one last death throe where it tries with all it's might to cling to power.  But once the illusion of power is broken, there will really be nothing for them to do but die.  Then we will be free.  It all starts with taking matters into our own hands.  It starts with you!      Sometimes they are brown.   Quick point: not all apples are red.   You said it yourself. They don't share information.  Next question: what is the FBI looking for?   I'm trying to find the source for the super high resolution capabilities of spy satellites.  That they exist at all is [very well documented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance_satellite) and is [confirmed by former DIA-aget Russel Tice](https://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2013/06/19/podcast-show-112-nsa-whistleblower-goes-on-record-reveals-new-information-names-culprits/).  Now think about how clearly you can make out a car in Google Earth, and this is just what is publicly available.  They've spent billions of dollars on this technology.  I'll keep looking for a source for the candy bar wrapper claim.   There are [17 different spy agencies in the Unites States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community)!  If they were all sharing data there would be absolutely no need to do a low level flyover like this.  At least one agency has satellites capable of reading the label off of a candy bar from space.   What I don't understand is, why do they have to do this when they have the capability to monitor us from space with spy satellites?  According to Russel Tice, a whistle blower, former DIA analyst, and satellite systems specialist they have the capability to read the label off a candy bar on the ground from space.  The only explanation I can think of is that the FBI doesn't have this capability itself.  In fact, we have 17 different "intelligence" agencies in the United States and there  must be a lot of redundancy.   It's even tougher than just fighting special interests groups.  Take a look at [this graph](http://occupy-monsanto.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/individual_monsanto_federal_position-large.jpg) showing the overlap of Monsanto employees and government officials.  The government literally IS the special interest group!   Very interesting part is at the end of the article:  Nassim Taleb, professor of risk engineering at New York University and author of best-sellers 'The Black Swan' and 'Fooled by Randomness,' recently said that GMOs have a very real ability to cause "an irreversible termination of life at some scale, which could be the planet." Talebs thesis basically stems from the fact that GMOs come from laboratory alterations rather than natural processes, and that humans cannot understand that with each modified seed, the potential for total ecocide increases.  "There is no comparison between the [bottom-up] tinkering of selective breeding and the top-down engineering of taking a gene from an organism and putting it into another, Taleb and colleagues say in a draft of their research.  "The planet took about close to zero risks of ecocide in trillions of variations over 3 billion years, otherwise we would not have been here."      Source for this quote please.   Oh.  Who thinks that?   Just because you're trying to separate truth from lies about a disagreeable topic doesn't mean you are a "fan" of that topic.  For instance, I don't like soft drinks, but if someone said that Coca Cola contains donkey piss, I would call them out on that.  I'm not defending coke, but defending truth.  There are plenty of valid reasons to criticize the soft drink industry without inventing any.  Please try to move beyond black and white thinking and you'll be helping our cause.

I should have replied to OP and not you.   I think this is more of a symptom of a world in crisis than the cause.   We NEED primary sources.

 Here is a playlist of truecrypt performing.  If you listen to some of these I think you would agree he is a tremendous and expressive pianist, well trained in the Russian school of piano performing, with his own beautiful, powerful sound. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL65D7125C29FA7CDB   No, he's really a phenomenal artist who was trained in the Moscow Conservatory, I believe.  He was unable to have a performing career, probably because of unspeakable political difficulties, and I think he went into computer programming.  His Pictures at an Exhibition is superb!   Thank you so much!  The ensemble from Il filosofo reminds me a tiny bit of La Serva Padrona, which I love a lot.  The piano sonata is lovely, too.  The aria from Demofoonte resembles Mozart's Idomeneo a little.     When Tchaikovsky first performed his new piano concerto for his mentor/most famous pianist in Russia, Rubinstein, the latter hated it and ripped it to shreds, much to Tchaikovsky's great distress.  Later on Rubinstein became the champion of this work, performing it frequently.   Can you please recommend something gorgeous from one of these four composers - would love to hear.      Well, Mozart was only 14 in 1770.  His blockbuster hits were yet to come in spite of already having composed over 100 works (correct me if I'm wrong on this number.)      Scott Walker will go down in history as the ideologue destroyer of Wisconsin's economy, environment, educational system and public image.  He's the creator of the now backward Wisissippi and is the darling of the mentally arthritic old white men who rule (and vote in)  this state.  He's a disgrace to the legacy of Wisconsin.  As an arrogantly ignorant anti-intellectual, among his worst crimes may be the harm being done to the state's flagship school, the UW.  He'll never be the president because it will be too easy to out him as the Koch brother's idiot whore.  Even the American voting public won't tolerate a smarmy little liar like Scott Walker.     The last movement is really exciting. Thanks.   Daphne, his final opera, possessed him at the end of his life.  It fulfilled his inclination to classical scholarship.  It's very gorgeous and this is a brilliant recording of it with Fritz Wunderlich and Hilde Gden. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i4XWlC_Qc4   You're right. I forgot that. Thanks.  	12

Woah... did you just... ap... apologize on reddit?   My wife was working nights and I found the biggest issue I was having was that I was keeping her up too long. She stayed playful and never acted 'tired' while we we're playing, but bedtime was hell. When I moved her bedtime up an hour and made a routine out of it (dinner - bath - jammies - relaxed playing - books - songs - bed) everything got infinitely easier.

You're not wrong. You're just an asshole.    Forgive my ignorance. I thought Ant Man was Hank Pym and they called this guy Scott in the trailer, what gives? Isn't Hank Pym Ant Man, the same guy who's on Iron Man's side in Civil War?   Why does a sinking ship need a captain? Seems like at the point they gave him his raise they were already beyond hope. Nothing left to do but sell off assets and liquidate the company. Who needs a figurehead at that point? And think of how much longer they could've employed their hard-working employees (or paid severances to them) had they had a CEO's salary to throw around.   I didn't understand this answer for like five minutes. I read and re-read the code posted but for the life of me couldn't find a scanner object anywhere, near line 6 or not. Than I saw the pastebin link. I guess I need another cup of coffee.    What a bunch of twunts.   I'll be 100% honest with you. 15 months ago, my daughter was born. We owned a baby seat and a stroller that it fit in (present from my mom), and a onesie to bring her home from the hospital, plus a handful of clothes. That was it. We had a stack of Target and Babies' R' Us gift cards from friends and family given to us for gifts, so we began to slowly accumulate some stuff. Do you love your wife? Of course you do, and I'm sure you'll love your daughter. That's all you'll need as cliched as it is.  Brass tacks answer, if you really want it. Make sure you have a car seat, a stroller is nice, but realistically for the first few months you'll want to hold the baby, not put her in a stroller. Look into buying a co-sleeper, that'll help get her used to being in her bed, not sharing yours. Don't worry about baby-proofing, it'll be months before your daughter is rolling around, much less crawling, or walking. And than, just keep moving stuff higher. My 15 month old is running now and all of the baby proofing we've done is spent 10 bucks on outlet covers and put one lock on a cabinet that has the cleaning products in it.   I know what you're feeling right now. It's scary as fuck. But honestly, there's not much to worry about. Spend these last few weeks getting plenty of sleep and reminding your wife how much you love her. Focus on preparing to be an amazing father in an amazing family.   Thank you.   I know, the /s is shorthand for sarcasm.    What does Washington have to do with this? /s   I'll think of you while my wife and I ride out to get oyster's on the coast tomorrow.    I can''t breathe.   You don't have to want to get someone a gift, you just have to want to send someone a piece of trash and receive an actual gift in return.    The 'line' side of the lane is not the cleanest part of the road. If you're in the bay I have lots of spots on 880 I can show you to illustrate my point. The cleanest part of a lane is where the car's wheels travel. They do a fairly good job of clearing items out of the road, including moving water and oils to the edges of the lane. When I split, I'm only on the line while passing. If I'm not actively splitting than I'm back in the lane in the one or three spot. Other than that, this makes sense.   NSV: You look hot. Good job, keep up the awesome work.   Awesome.

I would've shit in the bag of chips.   That's a bold statement. Got anything to back it up?   Is it bad that I came here to see if this was from Playboy also?   C'mon, it's also not really a freeway. It's just a street. No busier than hundreds of other streets in the bay area, and just as likely to cause a traffic snarl up this bad or worse any other day of the year through normal rush hour traffic. Some people need to get over themselves.   Yes, those assholes should be riding bicycles.  Or, or... walking. Yeah.  /s   Golden Gate is closing for a small period of time? Let's protest that shit.   I love how everyone is screaming that these protester's blocked the freeway. But c'mon, let's be honest with ourselves. 101 isn't *really* a freeway right there, is it? These guys (gays... hehe) blocked a street. The street they chose just happens to be labeled a freeway on the maps.   And seriously, enough with all the anger over some traffic. Damn, I commute every day from Novato to Hayward and back every day and if I wanted to strangle every single person responsible for some stupid traffic between here and there my wrists would be tired before I even left Marin.   It sucks for you that people are blocking traffic. Get over it. This is the bay area, someone's always fouling up traffic, and typically, it's just because they're some idiot that doesn't know how to drive.   Woah. I see what you did there. Very subtle.   I imagine it's gotta be pretty tough to set this all up, what with the planes and the boats, and what-not. But, it really bugs me the the planes are centered with the boats and that the boats aren't in nice straight lines.   Kept asking the same thing. Now I just want it to stop.    Not true. I called 911 from my cell when I saw a guy stumbling across 101 in Novato, where I live and where my cell bill goes. Got Novato 911, they than transferred me to CHP.

However, when the interview turns from the abstract, practiced questions to the wheels meet the road questions, like big-O notation and the interviewer and I actually begin having a discourse, I can tell that I've hit on something that the others they've interviewed were completely unable to.   Wait, you're saying that people fail the fizzbuzz test? I thought it was the most inane question I'd ever answered the first time I saw it out here. I've answered it three times now for various jobs and I still can't understand why any serious team lead/engineering director, etc... would rely on it to hire someone. I always thought it was something that some HR guy picked out of a book so people went with it.   Was in similar situation to OP. Close friend, three tours, mentally scarred from it, horrible PTSD, anger, night terrors and sweats, just miserable stuff. He and I talk a bunch about it. He'd seen a number of doctors since his last tour but never really got any 'help' from any of them. Some of the stuff he told me about, I wish I'd never heard him say it. Some things, it doesn't matter how much 'help' you provide, the human mind isn't meant to see those things without cracking.   I was scared when I went on my trip, until I got high.

[I thought Osric Chau did a good job as Kaneda in this one.](http://youtu.be/t1GO-93Nt3c)   Why not someone age appropriate like Osric Chau or Booboo Stewart?    If you think that the Hollywood remake of Akira would be 'too weird' for big names to make a difference in, you don't know Hollywood very well. This thing is going to be a dumbed down Akira with very little weirdness and absolutely no cultural identity at all.   Here's more kind words. Thank you for doing this. No matter what the writer of Harry Potter puts out on the screen, I an always just ignore it, open up Youtube and enjoy my happy place of what could have been. You all did amazing work. If Hollywood was smart, they'd cast guys like Osric, Daniel Henney, or that Booboo guy from X-Men, in an adaptation. They've got major acting chops already and just think what those guys could do for this potential abortion of a movie.    This picture, I feel, is always the best way to explain any of the cultural craziness that the Japanese experienced post-WWII. To win the war, the Allies (let's not kid ourselves, the US) literally leveled two of the most major urban areas in Japan at the time.   As an aside, it was only the honeymoon memories of one of the heads of state and his arduous convincing of Truman at the time that saved Kyoto and the Emperor's Palace. I can't imagine how bad things would've gotten with the Japanese had we made that major mistake. Truman allowed Nagasaki to replace Kyoto as a target. During the mission however, Kokura was the intended target for that particular bomber, but cloud cover obscured the target. Nagasaki was the backup. Pretty unlucky chain of events for the residents of Nagasaki.    Akita (Akira?) isn't actually a character in the anime movie titled Akira. Yes, he is shown in some flashback scenes, but I think the character that you're thinking of is Shotaro Kaneda, addressed as Kaneda in most of the film.   You're supposed to forget about Warriors of the Wind. Miyazaki asked politely.    How did you make it past the top replies talking about it being dual powered and not get it? I think you might actually be the only one.   They have it in Novato on DeLong. Not sure where you're at.   I got it.   Oh, that's what made it bad? I thought it was the horrible acting pasted on top of a horribly campy storyline, that while entertaining in the 80's was just shallow and flat today.   On the off chance that you're not joking, I'll answer this. What you're suggesting is definitely illegal. We don't live in a Hammurabic society where some eye for an eye stuff is okay. If you have a person on tape doing this, contact the authority's. If you encounter a person doing this and they attempt to harm you, maybe, just maybe you could get away with calling it self-defense. Although I'm willing to be that if you walked up on this guy in the act, he'd probably just drop your shit and run.   Ain't no party like a Liz Lemon party because a Liz Lemon party is mandatory.

Looking at the map, looks like it doesn't go through New Mexico, although I guess I could be wrong.   Get a new bike.   You got meatballed.   Santacon has gotten rough this year.   You were going 65,000 miles an hour over the speed limit? Holy crap, what do you ride?   Don't they speak Norwegian in the Netherlands? I'm not sure, only been there a few times in Minecraft.   It looked as if he wasn't holding the front brake at all.   They forgot the third option, someone could go cut the lock and open the gate and announce a party on the beach. Thousands of individuals could arrive and set up shop, partying like it's 1999 on the beach.   Than it's likely that the cops would get called because things got out of hand and an undercover officer would brandish a firearm at the 'peaceful' protesters. Someone would get hit in the head with a hammer. Hermit crab shells would get looted.   Yeah, probably not a good idea.   You didn't come off like an ass. But you do come off as someone who doesn't have a child or hasn't been around one alot. Guess what, I sleep right through my child screaming, it doesn't offend me. I also seek out the areas on a plane that have children now because I can typically snag an aisle or window (they usually grab either end plus a middle, unlike most 'couples' on a plane,) and I have no issue, what-so-ever, without earplugs, 100% ignoring any noise that comes out of that child that you would probably find offensive. After a year of crying, I'm immune. So yeah, some of us don't find that offensive. I've also met tons of older people (typically grandparents, but not always) who could care less what noise comes out of where, since they either don't hear it because they're deaf or because they just don't care anymore.   I fly alot for work. Like, alot. Some month I feel like I'm commuting to Socal from SFO on a weekly or more basis. And I can say, without a doubt, that it has been a very long time since I've been on a plane that didn't have someone under the age of three on it. In fact, I can remember when it was because it was a flight that consisted of me plus six other people. No babies on that flight and that was three years ago. And more often than not, unless the stars are truly aligned, a baby is going to fuss a little. It's in their nature. So yeah, I'm not sure where or how you're flying, but babies, they're a part of life everywhere and so are their sounds. But apparently you're just one lucky SOB, no noisy co-seaters, super quiet aircraft, that's awesome. Although, I think the reason most people fall asleep is because the noise is random (white) and constant. Not quiet, the interior of an Airbus A320 is at average 86.3dB which is nearly the OSHA 8 hour limit, just saying.  And to get to the crux of your post, the reason I dislike the wording and the tone of Oreo's post is because it implies that the base-level of effort is me, going out of my way to provide him with something that yes, he may or may not need, in order to make his trip more pleasant. And if I do that, than he'll make the gesture to not cough on my child (hyperbole... /s). I think that's wrong. Should I do my best to keep my child entertained if I've made the choice to coop them up on plane with 100 or so of my closest strangers? Yes. If that doesn't work and there is a meltdown should I also attempt to do something about it and not make the situation worse by telling everyone to 'deal with it.' Of course, yes. However, I shouldn't have to go out of my way to apologize, in advance of any possible wrongdoing (which in my case, usually doesn't even happen) because he thinks it's the decent thing to do. It's not. It's stupid.   Your first paragraph also worries me. You call my argument out as bullshit. You say it's BS that us parents use to justify our screaming children. Your entire first paragraph reads like someone who is-anti parent. You have to realize that there are all types of assholes in this world. What about the lady that screams at the flight attendant about how important she is and that's why she can't close her Macbook for landing? What about the subtle drunk guy that get's steadily more and more drunk until he's hitting on everything that walks down the aisle? How's about the bitchy flight attendant that's had a horrible day (or week, or month) and decides to take it out on you for no apparent reason. Look, some people are just asses. It is what it is. But I would never have the expectation to they or anyone would provide me with an upfront apology about some action that may or may not occur, that I may or may not be offended by. And if it was something truly offensive, I would think that the act of pre-apologizing might just make me more angry.  Here's a thought experiment, replace the baby in this story with a large, unbathed, gassy man handing out nose plugs and essential oil rub apologizing for smelling like shit.   This is more /r/unexpectedninja isn't it?   The Britney cover... uhmm... yeah. Funny, anytime I even think about this song (hear it on radio, hear it on someone else's radio, see a Britney Spears ad, etc...) I feel the need to watch this movie.   If you think that the people who perpetrated the crime on this poor delusional graduate student had a 'cause' than you're as deluded an individual as the guy who got his two front teeth for Christmas.    I clicked on that. Wasn't sure what I expected.   Actually it is an option. I've seen plenty of parents pick up their fussy child and soothe them by walking up and down the aisles. Typically, standing up and holding the baby's head at shoulder level usually drowns out the crying into the surrounding airplane noise.   Granted, as I mentioned elsewhere in this post, I've been lucky, my daughter enjoys flying and I have no problem keeping her busy, even on longer flights. But I feel bad for parents who feel like they're being shamed because they have a fussy child. What about the ass that I inevitably have next to me every time I fly for business that want's to talk to the guy next to him at eight times the normal volume of the plane. Why isn't he shamed for not bringing ear plugs?  I guess my point is, planes are loud for lots of reasons, not just babies. There's plenty of assholes in this world. Some of them are parents, but not always. Why is it an expectation that I, as a parent, should go out of my way to bring supplies to make your flight more pleasant just to be considered courteous?    I had a free drink coupon once that I gave to the guy behind me that was sitting next to the screaming baby on the flight. I felt bad for him. I felt bad for the baby and the mom too, but apparently the general public looks down on buying drinks for babies.   I think we're arguing that it's part of life, and now, can be easily considered part of the flight experience since it's been a long time since I've flown on a plane that didn't have at least one child on it. So now, you don't have to enjoy it, but yes, you're an adult if you don't enjoy the sound of kids making noise, maybe you should bring your own earplugs.   Why is it that I have to provide supplies to other people who may or may not be offended by the sound of a fussy child to be courteous? When did this become a thing? If I'm in a public place and my child is being an ass, I politely do my best to calm them and remove them from other people's personal spaces as much as possible. I even typically apologize for her behavior. But damn, now, to be considered not an ass I have to have to fore-thought to provide you with supplies? How's about, if you don't like the sounds of a typical (yes, typical, it's been a long time since I've been on a flight without at least one baby on it) airplane ride, you bring your own earplugs?   I don't care about the parents who do this, however, as a father of a well-behaved in public one year old, I also won't apologize for not bringing candy and earplugs for everyone else on a plane. If the sound of a fussy child bothers you, bring your own damn earplugs.   I'm a parent of a one-year old and when I fly for business I do this too. I once watched the entirety of 127 Hours on my laptop because the lady next to me wouldn't shut up about how she always get's an empty seat next to her and can't believe that I'd sit down there seeing as how she had a baby with her. To be clear, it was the last available seat on a Southwest flight. Given the availability I would've selected a different seat.    I've flown with my 1 year old lots in the past year, she has had mostly relaxed, cool, calm, and collected reactions to being cooped up on a plane for some amount of time, including this last jaunt to and from Hawaii. The sad thing about this is, that in this situation, if the flight has empty seats, most people will generally choose another seat to make the extra room for my kid. I have yet to purchase a seat for her, but she always has one, and it's always because of the kindness of other passengers willing to give up their seat.   New's Flash, most people are decent human beings. The pricks like this are the one's that make it seem like to be a good parent I should start handing out earplugs on a plane.   Check out Berkeley, they've been having nightly ~~protests~~ parties, cool vibe, diverse crowds. Check it out.   That'll buff out, right?  	106
 i hope they serve copy pasta.   do or do not. there is no fry.   most likely that means it's a burn and turn restaurant. another hint is when they drop the check while you are still eating.    eye see what you did there.  	4
 Shame. Also, spiderman    Was this written by Charlie Kelly?    I apologize in advance if someone has already posted this (I didn't read all the comments :/). But he strikingly resembles his own master (Ben kenobi). Foreshadowing?    The same    No joke. We have this in the men's bathroom at my university. It's a Christian College BTW   	5

 I do this to Korean food, which is already spicy by most standards. There's just something about crying involuntarily into your food that makes the dining experience great.   Twilight, Entourage, Most Facebook games, GLEE FUCKING GLEE   Being quarantined on the ship. I hate ports that do that.   That the police arrested you for ripping the tags off of mattresses, talking back, and a host of other normal kid offenses.    I was in middle school in the 90's so....Tight, Hella, Da Bomb, Jawsome....I'm trying to think of some odd ones that may have been region specific... for some reason I said (and still say) "Splendid" and "indeed" a lot, but I also watched WWE as most 90's southern kids and "IN...DEED" was a thing, don't ask. "Velociretard". that one was made up by my group of friends to describe a certain kind of stick drawing I did of them with velociraptor claws. We had weird clique names also.   	5
 Brave is just a nicer word for stupid   Just being honest, Belgium is a little bit of a microcosm. We have it all, but tiny.   Hey, at least there's something on the screen!   1. typical fashion for girls: in student environments i'd say you can wear whatever you want. In my classes (language and lit student) you get goths, preppy, hipsters,... Law students tend to dress more conservative. 2. regular groceries: not sure what you mean by this, but i'd say you can never go wrong with lots of fruit and veg. I feel like those are cheaper than in the US. I'm always stocked on yogurt and cheese as well. Supermarket bread is usually no good so i'd recommend going to a bakery for that. 3. Learning dutch: don't be embarrassed, we all have shitty dialects anyways! 4. blend in: don't! I'm sure people will be interested in where you come from. Belgium is quite boring so we're always happy to hear some stories from the outside world :D   I feel like belgians do one when they meet, but three on special occasions   Not a bad tattoo per se. Just bad taste.   wow what a dick   I always wonder how people don't notice this. You must get cold...   7 bazillion calories   Awwwww   Try explaining that to your partner.  "Ew what's in here?"  -"A burger. I've had it for like 20 years lol."      God forbids a female buys a to-go beverage with her own money, takes it to class, and talks about relevant people in her life.   Looks like these japanese rice crackers to me. Slighty spicy/musty taste though still addictive? https://shizuokagourmet.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/arare-2.jpg   Now this is wtf. I have no idea what is going on here and i couldn't even describe it to ask someone.      i never got past the annoying tune to see this... such a shame   ...this is how the story goes   Round here they throw you the money so they don't have to touch skin. Very nice as well.   Agreed, Lige waffles should be eaten vertically!  	20
 I played all fucking 82 games in my player...  Went to the playoffs and accidently press play key game.  Fucking Kings go down 3-0 Vs elimination for first round. I had 52 pts, 10 asts, and close to 6 stls. We are down by one and I get the ball with 5 seconds left and try to call timeout...  But I hit the Xbox button...  GAME over.  I Chris Webber choked playoff style.    Not yet   What was courageous about what seems like a publicity stunt by the most publicity hungry family in history. Courage isn't seeking public affirmation...  Courage is doing what you feel is right for you no matter the consequence. This whole thing disturbs me.    Prep the down votes.

On a couch with Anna Kendrick and Emma Watson wearing comic book themed pajamas with cats all over while Elon Musk is on his way over for a foursome he will later do an AMA on....     Shit...

That's pretty cool actually   I'm not trying to sound ignorant, foolish or rude by this.  I just can't understand why baseball has such an enormous following.

I would consider talking to an admissions counselor and finding out the appeal process...  May be an up Hill battle    Per transfer contract you must maintain 2.0 GPA in all registered classes and maintain a good status with your college...     Unfortunately yes...  They will rescind your admission.  There are appeal processes so good luck but it's time to find a 2nd option...    My question...  How the fuck did you fail theatre?    I recommend a bathroom  Edit: and by bathroom...  I mean in the toilet....    This.    No I don't want any other team than the Kings to win...  I just hate harden,  Howard and especially terry for how he did sacramento.    Because man do I fucking hate Terry...    I was driving with my SO today when I saw a Clarks pest control car. I decided that it would be funny to yell "Clark we need you"  which is their slogan...  Well I yelled it..   The guys expression which reeked of FML just glared at me.  Not an ounce of amusement..   He then looked genuinely sad which honestly made me sad. Now I look like a fucking ass hole for trying to be funny..   Tl;Dr I needed Clark but he didn't care..       Thib would be an upgrade to alot of teams....    I have?    That was my 2nd one   Cheers..    22 is still eh... T swift sings about you...    23 is like...  Fuck we got Miley Cyrus...    I was watching the news today when I saw a story of a girl about 19 years old. The news program kept explaining that a *Woman* did this and a *woman* did that....    But I kept saying to myself that she is just a girl...  A kid.  I'm 23 and I'm still just a kid. Then I fucked up...    I am a man...  Not a kid anymore.  It is a sad day today.  Beer is to be consumed...   Tl;Dr I'm fucking old..    Oh my apologies...  Still a great team nonetheless.. They still had DWILL for a little.  Ended 11th in the west   2010 jazz stick out to me.

 Over-analyzing a shitty comedian's joke for internal philosophical consistency?   Congratulations, you're a libertarian.       I'm not calling her a liar, but, unless she has a certain amount of familiarity with firearms, it's unlikely she would be able to differentiate between a gun that has jammed vs once that has been shot until empty, especially during the course of the event.   I suspect that the experts with the Pima County Sheriffs Department would be able to suss out the difference, however.    His opinion of the places shows the typical New Yorker disdain for any place outside of NYC.   No wonder he and other big money groups dropped their support for Morse and Giron after they lost.    http://tucson13.nytimes-institute.com/2013/05/23/sheriff-releases-photos-of-11-tucson-shooting/  During the attack, Loughner emptied one 33-round magazine into the crowd.* A second magazine jammed, giving bystanders a chance to tackle him before the first police officers arrived.*  http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/09/nation/la-na-0110-gabrielle-giffords-20110110  He finally changed the magazine and tried to fire, *but the gun jammed. * Meanwhile, two men from the crowd grabbed him and subdued him, officials said.   The after-action reports and analyses for most mass shooting events are freely available.      Violent crime is only the justification for selling these cockamamie ideas to the public.   The people who supported these laws knew they would not do anything to actually reduce violence.   Rather, it was all about sticking it to an out-of-power constituency in order to put on a show for the national-level party bosses.    Loughner was shooting people at contact distance and was taken down when his gun jammed, not when he was reloading.   So your one and only example of a shooting where limited capacity magazines might have made a difference is pretty much a useless data point.   Your claim is clearly counter-balanced by all of the mass shooters who clearly had no problems killing many people despite their limited capacity guns.                   I generally like Texans, but holy fuck you guys suck at winter driving.    Thanks for the karma.   You are clearly a moron.  Go take an actual firearms safety class and learn how guns actually work and then maybe we can talk when you have dealt with your ignorance.  But you won't, because actually learning things is hard.   So your solution to violent crime is to pass a ban on a form of device that is mechanically simple, essentially lasts forever, and where teens of millions of them already exist in the wild?   Never mind the fact that a magazine ban will have no effect on the outcome of a mass shooting event.   What your argument boils down to is that you're willing to arrest, try, convict, and imprison tens of millions of lawful citizens simply because they own a plastic box with a spring in it.   That's pathetic.       Hey, you're the one that enables violence by disallowing people effective means of self defense.  Your policies would result in far more deaths, on aggregate, than pro-gun policies do, but I guess you would find that acceptable as long as people are murdered by methods other than shooting.             Your feels don't trump others civil rights.   Don't like guns?   Fine.   Don't carry one.    Sara Brady doesn't speak as brazenly or as often about guns as Piers Morgan did.   John Walsh?   Where the hell is CNN recruiting their talent from, a timer warp to 1986?   You have to give a name/email/zip to submit your votes.   I don't know. Probably hit by a car or something.      Here's a big fat list compiling examples of anti-gun activists threatening violence or engaging in violence.   http://www.saysuncle.com/index.php?s=%22so+violent%22   I stumbled across this post a year or so ago, and had been unable to relocate it.   Thanks for posting this.    I didn't twist your words, you mouth-breathing imbecile.  The bottom line is that TSA has never, not once, stopped a terrorist, and there's no evidence that they're any more effective than pre 9-11 security, especially given that they have such a tremendous failure rate.  Furthermore, the fact that TSA does actually manage to find a gun now and then, or a shampoo bottle that holds more than 3 oz. is hardly indicative of their utility.  In case you hadn't noticed, this is the USA, and a lot of people here own a lot of guns, and, frankly, the way the TSA trots them out like they're any sort of proof to justify their phoney-baloney jobs is utterly laughable.  The way TSA agents react to the finding of even a single shell casing (or toy gun) like they've just found a case full of plutonium is laughable.  As for actual guns, yeah, people forget that they may have one in a bag, and yet they do it less regularly than TSA forgets about their own protocols for being able to legally fly with firearms.  But, yes, please do continue to justify feeling up toddlers, your posts amuse me.   I think it's hilarious that youcompared TSA to actual law enforcement officers who apprehend actual criminals committing actual crimes.     So, what you're saying is that the TSA has stopped exactly zero terrorists, but they have confiscated a list of things you find scawwy, (things that would have been just as easily detected by pre-TSA security) as well as leveled charges against one guy who you expect us to hate because he's a rich douchebag or something.  What's it like being the kind of person that defends a useless federal organization that spends most of it's time finding ways to justify touching children and attractive women?     Is that the book that claims that a Glock can go through a metal detector?   Oh, I don't have a problem with people interested in honest debate, but good posts have clearly been nothing but outright trolling for quite some time.    Australia, that's the country where the criminals make guns in clandestine machine shops, right?    It's a shame you wish to see people dissenters and unable to defend themselves.   I know people who have successfully used guns in self defense.   Why do you want to see them dead?    About damn time.    That stock wouldn't be legal for use in service rifle.    The original proposal for instituting the NFA would have made handguns NFA items.  Of course, if handguns are an NFA item, you can't have someone cutting the barrel down on a rifle or shotgun to make it easier to conceal, hence the barrel length requirements.     Even Bota Box is better than yellow tail.    I love when they make that argument, frankly, because it means that you've won.  Here, let me explain:  The people who make that argument aren't giving any actual thought to the enormous failures our government would have to suffer for that to happen.  They're essentially unconcerned that for that scenario to play out, the entire Bill of Rights would have to be suspended, along with prohibitions on the military operating on US soil, and a whole host of other things that would have to fail in order for such a confiscation to happen.  What they're focused on isn't the scenario, or whether citizens could successfully fight a military, or anything else.  Rather, they're engaging in a form of public masturbation.  On a visceral level, these people *hate* gun owners. They see gun owners as an impediment to the ability to create a better world.  As a result, they want nothing more than to see gun owners killed.  On top of that, most of the people who make the argument that gun owners can't stand up to the military also hail from the same political viewpoint that has an ardent hatred for the military as well, seeing them as the embodiment of America's crass imperialistic designs.  From where I sit, the people who make this argument don't make it out of any actual practical sense, but engage in it because, frankly, they hate the military and they hate gun owners, and (being too cowardly to take direct action themselves) they would like nothing better than to pit two groups of people they hate against one another.     I'll occasionally do two WODs in a day at my gym.   Depending on what they morning workout is, I'll usually opt to do something different.   If the morning WOD was a metcon, I'll focus on strength, or vice-versa.   The trainers at my gym are good about putting together an alternate workout for me, though sometimes space is a consideration that has to be worked around.   You'll feel a little self conscious during the workout, but you'll get over it.      Avoid Paras. They're cheap because they fall apart.  There's a reason why none of the high level USPSA shooters use them (unless they're sponsored by Para.)   Oh,look, he thinks he's still presidential material.                        Something about invertebrates killing vertebrates makes me uncomfortable on a truly deep level.      Many of the posts there are a great example of the deep-seated psychological anxieties of gun control fans.   It's really amazing how simple-minded and profoundly fearful they are.       If you want to be able to use a firearm for self defense without getting yourself dead or into legal hot water, your very first step should be to get enrolled in one of the NRA training courses that focus on home defense.  To find a list of local training courses, go to this website: http://www.nrainstructors.org/searchcourse.aspx  Or look up your local gun shops, give them a call, and ask if they offer courses or can recommend a local instructor.   Glad you liked it, however, nothing I can possibly say would be worth the spillage of good whiskey!    So your solution to end gun violence is to threaten peaceful gun owning citizens with gun violence.    No, the mods don't really ban anyone, which is not a policy I agree with.   I'm all for open discussions with fence-sitters and curious/open-minded anti-gun people, but the toleration of people who have admitted to being here only to troll mystifies me.       He really is.  I mean, he sucks at arguing. He's not creative. His posts are neither witty, insightful, or relevant.  Yet he keeps coming back, saying stupid things that demonstrate his foolishness.  I suspect he likes to troll because mommy and daddy are too busy to give little extremeftw* the attention he so craves.   *Even his name is a sad little bleat for attention.    There's no reason why Bloomberg's people couldn't have hired a group of locals to pull this off.  After all, when you're a multibillionaire, throwing a few thousand bucks at some white trash yokels, plus the cost of a few rifles, is nothing.  That said, until there's evidence to the contrary, I don't think there's a conspiracy here, and these "people" really are that stupid.   So your solution to over a century of failed gun control policies is to double down on failure?  What's it like being a loser?   We have federal gun control, clearly it's an abject failure.   For what it's worth, it was a pleasure reading your posts.    And the overall rates of homicide for both the US and Australia are roughly the same and have been trending downwards for the same period of time, which is a pretty clear indicator that whatever has caused a drop in crime in Australia isn't actually the removal of Australia's gun rights.    You'd rather be burned alive than shot?    Last time I checked, Australian criminals had built quite a decent side business importing illicit guns or constructing them in clandestine machine shops.    Cars and booze weren't designed to kill, yet kill far more people than guns, which supposedly are only for killing.   You'd think that someone who was worried about preventable deaths would be far more concerned with the far higher number of deaths caused by devices that aren't even supposed to be deadly.    There are a lot of firearms that don't have manual safeties, e.g. high end target pistols, revolvers, and some striker fired guns like Glocks.   In an ideal world, no one would graduate high school without knowing these rules.  It'd be the same as driver's ed or sex ed.   Modern guns (with the exception of some rimfires) will stand up to tens of thousands of rounds of dry fire practice before suffering any kind of wear and tear.  All of the best competition shooters swear by dry fire practice, and it's a cheap and easy way to build your skill set.     Dry fire practice is one of the best ways to increase your marksmanship abilities.   All of the best competition shooters use dry fire and advocate for it as a training aid.       Awhile back there was a woman who made three posts about a malevolent creature that showed up.  The description of it was creepy: arms of uneven length, short, large head and skin that looked like it was bruised all over.  The interactions she described were downright terrifying.         So since getting interested in supplements, I've been supplementing with Kirkland Brand Fish Oil. The label says the capsules are 1,000mg each.  However, when looking at the nutrition label, it says that each tablet only contains 250 mg of EPA and DHA, and 50 mg of "Other Omega-3 fatty acids."  Examine.com references 250 mg as the minimum dose, and 6 g as being optimal for combatting muscle soreness, etc.  My plan was to kind of hit somewhere in the middle, and get a daily dose of 3 g, but frankly, the idea of swallowing upwards of 12 capsules (in addition to my other supplements) just holds no appeal.  Is there a better brand of fish oil that has a higher amount of EPA/DHA that anyone recommends?  Thanks.   It's actually quite relevant.   I'd like to hear you're justification for some of the gun control laws that you endorse.    The conditioning I refer to started in 1994 with the Republican revolution, something that would not have been possible without the massive political backlash resulting from the passage of the Federal Assault Weapon ban.  Bill Clinton, among others, acknowledged that it was the passage of gun control that sank the party in that election.  As a political issue, gun control has been shown to be a consistent loser for the democratic party, and the most ardent prohibitionists have been forced to moderate their tone and stridency.      I would say the you're the one with a problem of understanding how the world works.   Murder and drunk driving both represent actions that in and of themselves are harmful to others.  Gun control laws, on the other hand, tend to treat all people exactly the same, regardless of whether they're a career criminal with a history of violence or an athlete competing in a shooting sport.   While no one advocates for allowing criminals unfettered  access to guns, you have to be daft to support the kinds of gun control laws that would result in prison time simply because someone puts an adjustable stock on a target rifle or chooses to own a magazine that holds more than an arbitrarily-designated number of rounds.    In short, the law can only punish people after an act has been committed, which is why laws punishing a murderer are good, and laws punishing someone who hasn't victimised anyone, but owns something you think is scary, are idiotic.    Most gun control advocates don't openly talk about confiscation because they've been conditioned, through years of lost elections and public mockery, to avoid using the c-word.    Thanks for posting a primary source, I agree that they're preferable.   The better example would be the 1911.  What's particularly interesting is his attempt to create categories of acceptable guns vs. unacceptable guns, and its all wrapped in an appeal to antiquity.     Yep. You can verify it via the BATFE web page.   Its probably just the one progun puff piece they run per year so they can still claim to be unbiased.   NSSF is based there as well.    Spoiler:  Lady in the Water didn't have a twist, and that was kind of surprising.                http://www.examiner.com/article/dell-statement-on-school-s-web-blocking-suggests-low-traffic-on-anti-gun-sites   For some reason I couldn't get the link to submit the normal way.          I love how Josh Sugarmann comes across in this article.   He's a fun-hating, finger-wagging, prohibitionist scold who thinks that kids who are winning state and regional level shooting competitions are too stupid to be safe.          If they have to add up the numbers from an arbitrarily-picked date range, then you can pretty well be assured they're just trying to scare people.    Not creepy, but haunting.    This is stupid.    Understanding this reference officially makes you old.    What about the infertile?  I guess they're just fucked, eh?   I had no idea that moving money through a governmental intermediary erased the cost of this policy to a small business owner.  What an amazing economic discovery you've made!   Which means he actually is paying for it.   Unless he's cheating on his taxes.    In retrospect, I've never been so effectively trolled by a video game.  It was a complete inversion of what happens in COD, and I almost quit playing at that point before realizing what an awesome commentary had been made.                I would agree. Most of the reporters there probably aren't even aware of their bias, but you really only have to see how they portray organizations like the NRA and compare that to how they portray gun control groups.   You can also see it in what they choose to cover.   For example, here's a story they posted about the father of the Santa Barbara rampage killer meeting with the father who gave a speech in favor of gun control after the rampage.   http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/06/16/322592320/photos-father-of-santa-barbara-killer-meets-victims-dad  Take note of the context, though.   They didn't do any actual reporting because no NPR reporter was actually present, and the photographs were provided by a communications firm that works with anti-gun advocacy groups.   Given the context, it's clear that the story isn't a news report in the slightest, but rather the regurgitation of a press release accompanied by some emotionally loaded photos.     This is the first article NPR head posted that's even somewhat pro-rights in about a year.   Every other story on guns they post is just yet more drum beating demonizing gun owners and spreading misinformation.   So either this one somehow managed to sneak through, or it's the rare story they post as top cover so they can claim that they're an impartial news source.    Gun buy-ups aren't about effective crime reduction.  From a left-wing perspective there are two advantages to this.   1.) Good feels and lots of back-patting. 2.) When the buy-up policy ultimately doesn't work, it allows them to claim that the failure was the result of not "going far enough." They can then campaign for stronger gun control laws.   This is a common theme on the left. Failure of their policies is always going to lead to calls for ever stronger policies which will inevitable fail just as badly, leading to yet more calls for stronger policies, wash, rinse, repeat.    I've started taking a combination of supplements and vitamins, and instead of trying to keep track of everything in my head, I'm thinking about creating a spreadsheet of some sort to keep track of my supplement use, dosages, times, and any perceived effects.  Does anyone have any tips, or even a template on how to go about doing this?           Have I mentioned that you're one of my favorite people here?   Because you are.   N/H   They both believe in having a monopoly on force in order to control the populace.         So now you're drawing comparisons between the left and WBC?   Damn, that's harsh.    As the old saying goes, if you're taking fire, it's because you're on target.    Yeah, that was kind of my first thought, too.    In regards to gun control, they sure are.   :-D   Clayton Cramer us a well-recognized 2nd Amendment subject matter expert.   I find it interesting you don't actually take his arguments to task,increase just resort to name calling.     It's the truth, and until they clean up their own house, I will continue to mock them.       I log the strength work and WOD. I also keep a page in the back of my notebook for recording 1 Rep maxes.  I don't really log any other stuff like food intake or how I was feeling unless its something unusual.   Is it just me or does it seem like Hillary is actively campaigning to lose the presidential election?  I mean, she just keeps saying and doing things that almost seem deliberately designed to piss off anyone to the right of Amy Goodman, which is pretty much the entire country outside of a few metropolitan enclaves.   One of the things I love about my CrossFit box is the culture, lots of good people who want to see others succeed no matter their skill level.   Its alright to be nervous, I certainly was when I first started, but the best way to get passed that is to go get involved with a gym and see how it goes.    Wow.   Maybe try a few sessions with a massage therapist. I've had some good results there as well.  Other than that, I know some people who've reported good results from having dry needling work done, but I don't have any first hand experience there.  I wonder if it's possible there's anything that would help on the nutrition or supplement side of things?    Go sign up for some yoga classes. If you can go twice a week, that's great, but I've noticed some improvement just from going once a week.          PF is selling the modern equivalent of indulgences.       I've got a couple of the blender bottles and they work well, though I don't think they'd be secure enough to put in a backpack, it would be easy for the mouth to be bumped open by other items in the pack.   In general, I've had really good luck with products made by Contigo, you can jostle them, knock them over, drop them, and they will leak very little, if at all.   I don't know if they make anything with a blender ball, but it would be worth checking into.   Costco regularly has Contigo products for sale at decent prices.                      I had the same attitude, and only recently began supplementing after doing quite a bit of research on examine.com.  I've been using creatine for about a month now, along with some targeted use of vitamins and minerals (D3, zinc, magnesium, krill oil) and have noticed gains in my ability to complete WODs.  The difference isn't something massive, but I find that in really hard WODs where I have to really dig deep to finish, there's actually something at the bottom to use.   Frankly, I wish I had started supplementing years ago.    The problem is that people like you, or Browning, know what they're talking about.  To the average layman, the term "automatic" is synonymouse with "machine gun" and unfortunately gun control activists have attempted to capitalize on this confusion.         This chart was the first hit I found on Tootle.   http://www.wehealny.org/healthinfo/dietaryfiber/fibercontentchart.html   Banned from /rguncontrol?  Go team tolerance!   Thanks for this list.    As I understand it, there's generally more fiber in a serving off most kinds of fruit than in grains.    It could be argued that it wasn't the diet that was responsible for the early deaths of paleolithic man, but rather the fact that medical care was nonexistent, fire was the best killer app we had, food was scarce, and then when it wasn't, your chosen meal was unlikely to cotton to your notions of being dinner.    Many of those things you listed are unproven or outright false.   For instance, if you check the examine.com entry for green coffee bean extract, you'll see that there's very little evidence for it's efficacy, even compared to other herbal supplements that are totes to do the same thing.   Regardless of whether or not he's shilling for an actual product, he's still willfully endorsing things that are not proven to work in an attempt to build an audience of credulous people and body hid ratings.    All the courtroom arguments have been over since April, we're just waiting on the judge to render a decision, which should happen by the end of the year.       I hope they find the we linked to them and I hope so odd the mockery in this thread causes them to cry into their pillows.       They forgot to include OKC and 9/11.      No, Bradley Cooper's character wins in the end, and frankly, it's awesome.    Or they'll resort to the use of arson or explosives.   Let's see. Magazines have something like four-six parts. Are robust enough to last for years, and are essentially untraceable.  Good luck enforcing that ban, poindexter.      So the gun ban hasn't stopped violent crime, but it has stopped a particular kind of event that was so rare there was really only one example of it to start with.   And to think, all you had to do was have the government steal property from its citizens and strip them off their ability to actually defend themselves!   What a deal!       So what you're saying is that you're on with more people getting stabbed on a daily basis if it makes you feel slightly better about reducing the already minuscule odds of a mass shooting?   Wow.       His tears of rage are so sweet and yummy.          I care only insofar as Obama's statement is a concise and perfect way to respond to anyone who claims that "no one wants to take your guns, that's just paranoia."  Sorry, but the President just endorsed confiscation, so it's clear that anyone who claims otherwise is lying.            	176

[This hurts everytime.](http://imgur.com/kZdDRGe)   I'm stuck on Hell on Wheels. Got me the Cholera...   There will be no better Gandhi.   I've seen it several times. Still uncertain about the physics of it.   The Tesla machine that Angier uses for his ultimate trick creates a duplicate of Angier. One remains in place at the machine and another several feet away. My question is if the "real" Angier is at the base of the machine isn't that certain death in regards to the glass tank beneath him? This is assuming that the original Angier is at the base of the machine. If it isn't then the original Angier dies during the first usr of the machine back in Tesla's house. So what was it?     =calibrating the machine to Copy Angier the base of the machine and teleport the real Angier to a different spot.  =or Angier is fine with dying over and over to best borden   =Or maybe another possibility I haven't thought of.

Goose McKenzie!   Oh, man. You're right.   April?   I can draw better in ms paint...but that's just like my opinion, man.   I have watched it again. I find that watching movies with a twist have tend to be enjoyable as you see how it builds up the twist. That is, if it's well done. Also it's fun to show someone a movie with a twist and see their reaction, but that's just me.   Operation Paperclip   I'm sorry, Mr. Williams. You've created countless smiles and that's just on my face.      Well, technically Mr. Universe was a better pilot than Wash only because he hacked his grades. So the Alliance would prefer to clone him.   It is but I like his style.   I like preparedness, you sir are a survivor.    For science...   Get off your ass and follow your dreams.   I think cloning a new wash would be more expensive than looking for a new pilot. Besides if they could they would've already done it in the comics. That being said it would be a neat concept to have clone wash have an existential crisis about being a clone.   Yeah, it's been accepted that Wash's death is the most brutal and emotional in the Whedonverse. It really hurt and was done ultimately because Serenity was a last hurrah for Firefly(as was River's rushed character development). However, if we were to get Firefly back, we would want Book and Wash back, even if it meant in a parallel universe.   Mal lived...do you mean Wash? Look I used the show, movie and comics to create season two. In the end I sent them to an alternate universe where everyone could come back.    I expected this insight, I know it's kind of a cheat but Firefly itself was cheated and fans would look over this if it meant Wash and Book could come back. It's the writing equivalent of saying,'we're starting over because we didn't get a fair shot the first time.' And quite frankly it seems less sci-fi that we Unkill wash than Firefly coming back (please Netflix).  Joss has said that when he is done with Marvel and Nathan is done with Castle he might revisit the 'verse.   I don't think it's so outlandish to accept a universe tear, even in today's world we are experimenting with particles that could erase everything. I will concede that it's a bit of a coincidence that wash be near the crash site.    *blows air, spitting*   I tried to do this myself and failed.   Also I used current canon planets.     At the beginning Shepherd book and Wash are still dead but I created a rift in the universe with the cosmic cloud (think fantastic 4) that threw them into an adjacent universe.    I tried to make some characters from season 1 come back (Jubal and Bager) but not so much to stretch them thin.   Great ok, here we go.        **FIREFLY** *Season 2*  Post-Serenity events have led to a civil war in the core planets. After discovering the cover-up on Miranda the citizens of the core planets decided to rebel.

Zoe is cradling her child as the cargo bay is welded open. She sees the welder take off his mask and its an old man. He says, You folks took a hell of a fall, are you alright? He has a dirty beard. Then a voice and face come into frame, Hoban 'wash' washburne.

The ending are the end scene/s.   I spent the better part of this afternoon creating plot summaries for 14 episodes of Firefly for a second season.   I read an Adam Baldwin interview where he said he'd love to return to Firefly but he would want Wash to be unkilled....so I tried to achieve that.  Interested?

Batman's footage is very interesting. He leaps from rooftop to rooftop, when decending upon the criminals of Gotham you can see him systematically pick them off and beat them to a pulp.   However, Tony Starks footage is just more fun to watch, he zooms through the battles and shoots at folks while cracking smart ass comments.   In this respect, the thing to remember is that Batman probably suffers from a mental disorder since he habitually goes out to fight crime and takes no pleasure in doing it. Tony Stark can notice the danger in what he does but will make it fun to watch all the same.   Only think that comes to mind is Smokin' Aces.   Anyone else scared that it's airborne?

 While it is true that one could argue that the occupants are at risk of great bodily harm most states require more than the fact that someone broke into the home to prove that.   No. They could only shoot him if there was a threat of death or great bodily harm. So if he was not armed and ran when he saw them then it would not be legal to shoot him but if he was armed with a gun and they shot him then it would be legal. States do different on these laws though.   Then you get charged with murder. Well manslaughter more likely but still not a wise decision.  *edited for grammar   ["Did it ever occur to you it could be turned off and drip at the same time?"](http://www.cornel1801.com/video/Cousin-Vinny/lovevideo.html)   That's more than understandable. Feel free to PM if you'd like or ignore me lol.   Your parents subscribed to that method of parenting? What was it like? I don't mean to pry too much but I find the perspective of the now adult who was raised that way very interesting. Unfortunately most of my young clients I never see again so I do not know what happens to them or I see them again and again as they get in more serious trouble as they get older.   I am a criminal defense attorney. I can't even explain how infuriating it is when I get a young client because of some minor infraction that occurred in school. Often times the school safety agent acts as a judge, jury, and executioner and roughs up my client before placing him/her (mostly minority boys) under arrest. The thing this article leaves out though is the staggering number of parents who use the criminal justice system to discipline their children. There seems to be an increasing number of parents that call the police on their children for such minor things as fighting with their siblings, getting caught smoking marijuana, breaking something out of anger, etc. I acknowledge the fact that there are situations where it is necessary to get police involved even with children but the standard for that has lowered. A growing number of parents do not want to raise their children; they want someone else to do it for them. They choose the police, judges, etc. to effect discipline but are completely unaware or unsympathetic to the horrors their children face. Prison can be a scarring experience, even being stuck in jail for one night can do serious damage. Let's not forget missing school, becoming a social pariah, and getting criminal records. The list is endless. Don't blame TV, video games, etc. when your kids no longer trust you and do everything they can to avoid home.      This isn't recent news. This article is from 2009.  *edited for grammar   Rarely does anyone get jail time for prostitution in NY unless they were the pimps or had lengthy rap sheets. And as much as I hate prosecutors the majority of in court assistant district attorneys are low level nobodies with high law school debts and average pay, not the movers and shakers you apparently think they are. Their bosses may be though.   You do realize that it was a lot more than inconvenience for a few customers, right? And that this is not his first time in trouble or the first time he has been/will be sentenced to prison? And although you think justice is not intended to make examples of people that has long been accepted as a motive for sentencing people, the deterrence of others. In fact it is a factor that federal judges are required to consider in their sentencing determinations, "to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct." [18 U.S.C.  3553(a)(2)(B)](http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/18/II/227/A/3553). I agree a life sentence is too harsh but it is also unlikely for him to get a life sentence. I also agree that this judge should recuse herself to avoid the appearance of injustice whether it would exist or not.      You remembered correctly. [Here](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-21/suit-against-new-york-law-school-dismissed-by-state-court-judge.html) is some information about it and some more [here](http://abovethelaw.com/2012/03/breaking-class-action-lawsuit-against-new-york-law-school-dismissed/).      The article is a little confusing because it does not appear he was fighting for his right to be tried as the article claims because he is no longer being held and no charges were ever brought against him. He won the ability for his lawsuit against the government to go forward. When you sue someone you always have to demonstrate standing and damages. That being said it is terrible what the government did to him and I hope he wins.   Ah yes I should only let you make serious statements in /r/funny. I actually practice criminal law so enjoy whatever class you're still stuck in. And good luck trying to argue common law in motions and in front of a judge when he is going to defer to how courts have interpreted the statutes. I'm sure arguing about malice aforethought for a murder charge based on a statute involving intent will go over real well.    But that is only true for the minority of jurisdictions and for the rest that's incorrect. That statement implies that the criminal common law is still followed while statutes supplement it. When in reality the penal codes (statutes) completely replaced the common law in the majority of jurisdictions.  	17
 I would say 99 of the "benefits" people experience are placebo.   http://m.imgur.com/3wktVKd   OP has gone crazy, this could never work.      Same thoughts exactly. The OS on mine is still as fast as when I bought it, but lacking basic apps like Netflix make it hard to use as a daily tablet.   Wow that's a great idea, thanks!   I have an old BlackBerry playbook kicking around from when they were all the rage. As I recall they were pretty much useless, but does anyone know of anything I can use one for besides an expensive alarm clock?    Thought it was sped up until my third time through when I realized no one else was moving fast  	8
             Any ideas on how to solve it? I've tried decoding/encoding in many ways, but nothing seems to crack it. I don't know why I'm starting to feel this sub-phase is gonna be much harder than we thought... I mean, they do look like the codes A858 posts... and they haven't been solved yet. But I hope I'm wrong.   th?id=JN.ene  d86IiyhptVnP  fAQ4oKg am  p;pid=15.1 a  mp;H=120 a  mp;W=160   th?id=JN.Mgp  B%2bemuzN  ONQJalfQW2  DA amp;pi  d=15.1 am  p;H=102 a  mp;W=160   th?id=JN.M  N4dBX0EH  9Jzz8kksw  LaPA am  p;pid=15.1   amp;H=90   amp;W=160   v=fayio  gzn3pc  __________________________________  ANd9GcR  Mmlk8Bm  aSYPJW_u  1P87FAyB  0LNc5NHe  6bR6g2yF  XdoPXNC  4ir1tLEhQ   HOLY COW!!! {:'-D   This is hot.

I really wish I knew...   Oh no... you're right. We should maybe refer to it as phase 2.1(flashing gif with 5 and red/green boxes, )phase 2.2(binary with picture), phase 2.3(A858-like codes), etc.   She never got annoyed at me.... maybe she just suddenly didn't like me anymore?   But does it mean you hate the guy?   But thats not what he's asking... lol... click on the pic of snoo and it'll take you to some post...   I wonder what happens when we complete the last phase....   Some cool flairs might be like trophies(for users who solve a ~~phase~~ page/part of a phase), and for regular use... maybe small pics from the website might be cool?   Hmmm.... by the way, for phase 5, the code looks similar to the codes posted by A858... maybe whoever solves this phase, might also reveal the key to solving A858... it seems hard though.   6.Password: 70325  Solved by Ryuk_ on IRC Explanation: He used the 1001st Fibonacci number, and got the first 5 digits (70330) and substracted 5 from it.

Is it because they think a guy is starting to like them?   It's because of your cute smile and with your eyes, it makes you look so innocent!

I started talking to her and we became friends. Every time she saw me in the school hallways, she said hi and smiled. We also did this peace-thingy with the 2 fingers. But one day near the end of the year, I waved at her to say "hi" and she just looked away. The year ended.... and this year started. I saw her two times in the hallway and she just looked away as if she doesn't know me. What the hell? I mean, I didn't have a crush on her but why pretend she doesn't know me even after long time no see?   time   Go explore NSFW subreddits....   Omg, you're so cute and innocent-looking!

    That was tried when the South seceded.  But Abraham Lincoln revoked their 10th Amendment right to secession by force of arms.   "If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that." -- Abraham Lincoln, in a letter to Horace Greeley, 22 Aug. 1862.      Please don't cite the Iraq Body Count stats.  Their statistics count only deaths which were reported in newspapers when we know full and well that the vast majority of Iraqi deaths were not printed in newspapers.  As such, the IBC functions to *downplay* and *minimize* the crimes we committed in Iraq (this is why George Bush cited their numbers). There are [other far more realistic estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) of our carnage and destruction of Iraqi society.     On the legal basis of this, just stop and think about how many peon war criminals we have in the Pentagon. Obviously not people employed as peons in a genocidal war, but flunkees and bookkeepers who engaged in our immoral war of aggression in Iraq (and other places) where we slaughtered hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.  Hypocrisy much?   "If certain acts of violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us." -- Justice Robert Jackson, Chief of Counsel for the United States at the post-WWII Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, and later US Supreme Court justice.   So they're saying that Israel is like the US. Not really any surprise here... :(   Then those families should have stopped their son or daughter from joining our country's war machine.  The problem is we value the attacking, imperial American soldiers' lives as more valuable than the semi-defenseless natives that we slaughter. And so our humanity and morality suffer. Today we're a war-loving country that not only unapologetically tortures people, but we openly shield and protect publicly-admitted torturers.  In many cases the soldiers in the body bags have it easy, as we can see by the epidemic of military suicides today (suicides outnumbering battle deaths in some years).  Do those families whose moral son or daughter commit suicide grieve as much as the family whose kid dies in battle in some far away country that never attacked the US?   "It will be a great day when our schools get all the money they need and the Air Force has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber." -- Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.    I believe Bill is quoted as saying that not intervening (or at least pushing for intervention) in Rwanda is one of his biggest regrets as President.  Spin after the fact is irrelevant. What's he going to say -- he was glad he did not intervene and thus be essentially ignoring the deaths?  The entire Rwandan tragedy in our popular culture/mainstream narrative is off. It's like pretending that the US has nothing to do with what's happening in Ukraine even though we've overthrown the government there twice in a decade.  To know about Rwanda you have to look at the politics of the various leaders of the area *before* the tragedy, the US and French role/interests in those politics, and follow an exact timeline of events. Needless to say it is a complex situation.  Bill spinning things after he's out of office is like listening to Bush talk about Iraq today. It's largely defensive spin and he'll say exactly what we expect him to say.  **Edit:** For a start on the Rwandan tragedy, [this article](http://journal-neo.org/2015/01/17/the-un-congo-offensive-a-continent-betrayed/) would probably prove to be informative and illuminating reading.    On what evidence do you base that?  Several factors. The first is the fact we're still fighting all of these fruitless imperial wars and creating mangled soldiers. Secondly is years of being a disabled veteran. And also as a former professor and history teacher, I'd add a firm grasp of American history and culture.   What else are citizens supposed to do besides thank servicemen/women for their service?  I know it's a *radical* idea, but here's a thought: Perhaps force our corporate-funded, war-loving politicians to stop attacking other countries and creating veterans?  Why don't we stop being an empire and only fight wars when the US is attacked, and allow the UN to do the job we invented it to do?  We used to be able to excuse our imperialism based on an invented threat that the USSR was going to take over the world. But since the breakup of the USSR what's our excuse now? Again, why aren't we allowing the UN to do the job that we invented the UN to do? (We know the reason, because we're a rogue state and the UN won't do exactly what we tell it to do.)  Of course, that would mean the US government would have to stop seeking "full spectrum dominance", start treating other large powers as equals, and to stop trying to take over the world. That would be a big change. But the upside would be a more peaceful world and stopping the impoverishment of the American people from the debts of all of our insane wars.   "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy." -- US ambassador to the USSR and State Dept. strategist George F. Kennan.   Quite true.  One is imperialism that doesn't work but that doesn't upset the American people too much since we're slaughtering the defenseless natives by bombing them; and the other is imperialism that doesn't work but that upsets the American people *a* *bit* because we have gullible Americans soldiers coming home hidden in the dark of night in body bags.  Is that *really* that big of a difference?   Just don't call it an "old boy network" of *systemic* *corruption.* Remember, these people are "serving us."  /s   The thing is you or I (or the US government) don't get to make that choice -- the Iranian people do.  And as I said above, if there's one thing that history proves, it's that the Iranian people can overthrow a tyrannical government if they want to. But most Iranians (certainly not all, but enough to keep it in power) support their Islamic Republic.  Thus, we should stay the hell out of their internal affairs and let them govern themselves as they see fit. We would ask for nothing less from them if the situation was reversed.    republic?  Yes, Iran is an Islamic Republic.  There are many forms of republics. Iran may not be the type of republic you or I would design (hell, I would design a republic where the people at least voted for the president, something I in the US don't get to do!), but Iran is a republic nonetheless.  And whatever its faults, Iran is a huge step above a literal dictatorship like the US backs and arms to the teeth in Saudi Arabia (and other countries).    At least half of this country is stridently against all of those things,  As much as I'd like to agree with that, there's no way I can.  If we *stridently* felt that way, we'd be out organizing with others and protesting against those things.  Or we'd *at* *least* be writing letters to our mass media and politicians demanding they stop.  Or *the* *minimum* we would do is to refuse to vote for the 2 corrupt political parties that constantly commit these crimes.  But the majority of Americans are *not* doing those things! Therefore, I cannot accept your feel-good claim no matter how much I'd like to. We're simply too indoctrinated with nationalism, militarism and capitalist values.  So, to be honest, given our own laziness and apathy and refusal to work with other people about these issues we supposedly care about and which are impoverishing our country and bankrupting our moral values, the future I see is likely one of a spiraling decline into barbarism.  The old saying was that people had a choice of "socialism or barbarism" -- and it seems we're clearly making that choice.   "The price of apathy is to be ruled by evil men." -- Plato.   You make solid points, but the real question is why should we have done all that? Who put us in charge of running the world?  We used to be able to excuse our imperialism based on an invented threat that the USSR was going to take over the world. But since the breakup of the USSR what's our excuse now?  Why aren't we allowing the UN and collective international action do the job that we invented the UN to do?  Oh yeah, I forgot. Congress in the Clinton years openly debated a bill called the "Silk Road Strategy" which called for the US to establish US hegemony in central Asia and to replace centuries of Russian influence there. And Clinton's Pentagon rolled out the idea of "full spectrum dominance" (nothing less than a plan to rule the world), and since that time we've been doing just that -- waging wars to try to seize key resources and to take over the world and to turn country after country into American vassal states.    Following Black Hawk Down, Bill became very hesitant to intervene in foreign affairs.  LMAO! Yeah, I guess the 8 years of *needlessly* bombing Iraq daily/weekly and those little wars in the Balkans were just examples of Bill being timid.  /s    because unlike most civilized countries they've actually been marching stridently in the wrong direction.  My country unapologetically tortures people, protects and shields publicly-admitted torturers, and wages wars all across the planet in a clear strategy to take over the world. Therefore, I'm not the most qualified to talk about "civilized countries".  But I will say that when countries and cultures are under attack, they often react in harsh or strange ways.    Forget imperialism. This is right-wing fundamentalist proselytizing.  I don't see much of a difference. Cultural imperialism is a facet of imperialism. Religious proselytizing is and has long been a key facet of imperialism.  The fact that today our key facet of imperialism is becoming "NGOs" should not diminish the role of religious proselytizing as imperialism.   ... after finally failing to establish it here in the US.  It's well established here in the US! It may be losing ground in a lot of the US, but it's far from dead.   "There is a story, which is fairly well known, about when the missionaries came to Africa. They had the Bible and we, the natives, had the land. They said 'Let us pray,' and we dutifully shut our eyes. When we opened them, why, they now had the land and we had the Bible." -- South African Bishop Desmond Tutu.   There were scenes from different neighborhoods, weren't there?  The most hostile was the one asshole who deliberately walked between the two and then got in one guy's face, clearly itching for a fight. That scene appeared to be in a more working class neighborhood with a large apartment building in the background.  I'm not defending the asshole, and another person has pointed out that Russia does indeed have a less accepting view of homosexuality than the US or UK has. What I'm saying is that in most any city you'll get a variety of responses from different neighborhoods and different situations.  And since I don't speak Russian, I'd love to know what the two guys holding hands were talking about as they were walking. That could have been another factor in the response they got.  Cultural change in a large country takes time. The change in attitudes towards homosexuals in the US has been fast over the past couple of decades, but that is due not only to the brilliance of activists, but also due to the AIDS crisis and the open support of much of the corporate mass media.  I'm guessing that Russia has very different factors at work, and our renewed Cold War against Russia and them feeling under attack from the west likely helps breed intolerance towards gays.   This is part of the problem -- cultural imperialism.  Rather than let various countries observe more the way other countries do things and to allow the society to willingly adopt change at their own rate, our imperialist mindset turns countries a political football for our internal politics and forces divisions in the countries themselves.  I think a good analogy is Iran and their theocratic government. If Iran had been allowed to develop themselves, they'd be a very different country and government today.  Instead, we overthrew their democratic government in 1953, backed a dictator hell bent on making the country look like the US or Europe, and the backlash from strip bars and the foreign culture shoved down Iranians' throats by the dictator resulted in a reaction that still impacts Iran today.   "Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people." -- Karl Marx   "Downtown" is a rough description. I'd guess that in a city that large you'd have a variety of different neighborhoods and areas where you'd be more likely to get different responses.   I do not support *legalizing* all drugs.  I *do* however, support *decriminalizing* *all* drugs.  We should learn the lesson from Portugal's successful 10+ year experience of decriminalizing *all* drugs.  Portugal has saved massive amounts of money in anti-drug law enforcement, has eliminated drug-related crime, and now has the lowest heroin addiction rate in Europe. For various other drugs, their usage as essentially the same (some rising a bit, some falling a bit).  We in the US have an epidemic of heroin use, stemming largely from our absurd drug policies and the fact that we're fighting a war of aggression in Afghanistan (the CIA always imports drugs from areas where the US fights wars).  We're way overdue to actually *do* *something* about our drug problems, and it's crystal clear that Nixon's "war on drugs" and Reagan's insane "just say no"/lock them up policies have been utter failures.  It's time to try something that will actually work.   That's an interesting chart and data; simplistic but still interesting. I read that as saying that a very large majority of humanity says they do not accept homosexuality.  Given I live in the US, I had no idea that the amount of disapproval was so huge.    Incredibly biased.  But that's the Washington Times in a nutshell. It is a far-right newspaper. Sometimes they do make a point, but the vast majority of the time they're way over the top and are just pushing their agenda.   "the American appeaser-in-chief."  This is one of my pet peeves about history. Appeasement is often a perfectly valid and logical policy. But today it's used as a mindless political smear. Historically the policy of appeasing Hitler before WWII was fully supported by the UK, France *and* the US.  In fact, the only country to oppose appeasement was the USSR, and Stalin read the west's appeasement and refusal to form a joint anti-Hitler alliance as the west wanting to turn Hitler eastward towards the USSR.   To go along with this, a question:  For a user who knows what SysV's /etc/init scripts do, a basic idea of SysV's runlevels, etc., but who does *not* want to become a *nix guru, could someone suggest an "overview" of systemd?  I'm looking for an overview that gives the basic concept(s), the location of important things on the directory tree, commonly used commands -- that sort of thing. Something aimed more at a user or poweruser level as opposed to something deep and aimed at gurus or pro sysadmins.  TIA.   We have been deliberately misinformed by anti-Iranian propaganda for *decades.*  One example I stumbled on recently was about Iran's military vis-a-vis the Saudi military. Our corporate mass media constantly portrays the Iranian *republic* as a military threat to the entire region, and at the same time, the Saudi *dictatorship* is portrayed as sort of twisted but largely benevolent.  So answer this: Which spends more on its military, Saudi Arabia or Iran?  According to [this](http://atimes.com/2015/07/historic-iran-nuke-deal-resets-eurasias-great-game-escobar/), the Saudis spend *13* *times* *more* on "defense" than Iran does. I like to think I keep up on current events, but needless to say I was shocked.  The fact that Iranians party and that Iranian women typically wear makeup would come as a shock to many in the US. We've been deliberately misinformed to fit our government's geo-political aggressions and goals.  With that said, even Der Spiegel in this article cannot help but to spin things with the theme that Iranians are yearning to be free and to be just like the west.  If history teaches us anything, it is the fact that the Iranian people are more than capable of rising up and overthrowing a corrupt government. The west should keep its nose out of Iran, resist the temptation to fund dissidents and to arrange another US/western-sponsored coup d'etat, and to let the Iranian people decide their own fate.   Elitist as the guy's fares? How about as elitist as the guy himself?  Who the hell displays a CIB on the dash of his taxi?!  He's using that callous display as a way to con/guilt people out of a larger tip -- that's a disgrace to every infantryman who has ever worn the CIB!    Almost no one notices it, or they notice it and just don't care.  Veteran here. We don't care. And this guy is nothing special -- even if he displays his CIB (in a cab!?!) -- he needs to get that through his head.  He *volunteered* to join the military. We were never attacked by another country. His war on Iraq was based on coldly calculated lies and propaganda by an evil government who decided to wage a war to control the Middle East and Iraq's massive oil reserves. He was a gullible pawn used in a large geo-political game of empire.  That's a tough pill to swallow, but the sooner he swallows it the better off he'll be.  We no longer have a military made up of a rough cross-cut of citizens of the country. Today we have a form of Praetorian Guard -- an elite, privileged military force with little relationship to the country the military claims to serve. This guy choose to join that Praetorian Guard, what the Pentagon calls the "professional army", an army of non-conscripts deliberately created so the US government could wage unpopular wars without the public opposition (and opposition *inside* the US military) that we saw in the Vietnam War.  People give faux polite deference to the military and its soldiers (the "thank you for your service[sic]"), but we really don't care what those soldiers are going through. This is only common sense, since deep down many Americans know that the sacrifices of US soldiers have nothing to do with serving our country, but the military instead functions in reality to seize markets, complete corporate conquests and to wage imperial struggles decided by our out-of-touch political class.  This guy needs to swallow the "red pill" and accept reality. And Vice needs to stop this type of emotionally-based militaristic propaganda.   "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor.   Oh yes, I remember reading the blather.  I particularly liked the feel-good rhetoric about his anti-nuclear claims. In the years that have passed, the US opposition no a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East and our massive spending to build a new generation of nuclear weapons, not to mention our destabilizing anti-missile system in Europe designed to negate Russia's nuclear deterrence, should have all put the lie to the claim that the US is opposed to nuclear weapons.  The Nobel committee's feeble claims of Obama's outreach to the Muslim world are also pretty laughable. Not only was Obama forced to withdraw from Iraq based on Bush's agreement and timetable, but the US-backed slaughter in places like Libya and Syria, to the US' support of the US-trained/armed/funded Egyptian military overthrowing their elected government and slaughtering hundreds of civilian supporters of that elected government, should highlight the truth that we're not interested in either peace or democracy -- except when it suits US geo-political purposes.  Let's face it, we're an empire trying to take over the world. Obama's adherence to the immoral "Bush Doctrine", and our many wars and aggressions across the globe all proves that.   The corruption of *both* of the parties that rule the US and our government is *systemic.* But no one seems to look at it that way, let alone do anything.  With that in mind, how should we motivate people to organize and act?  For a population raised on TV infotainment and constant remakes of James Bond movies and other good-guy/bad-guy movies, Taibbi's use of the term "double agent" in his title goes far beyond merely being "clever." Let's hope it sinks in...   "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.   Given the disgrace of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama, and the previous award to the war criminal Henry Kissinger, does anyone still take the Nobel Peace Prize seriously?!  Sure, to give the Prize an air of legitimacy, some deserving and honorable people working hard to advance peace are given the Prize. That's nice.  But overall, the Nobel Peace Prize is simply western propaganda. It's an award to push the geo-political agenda of the US and west. In Obama's case the prize was given to Obama for doing nothing as a way to whitewash the US' reputation after the crimes of the disastrous Bush regime. The reasons behind the advocacy of giving the prize to Poroshenko is obvious.  As sad as it is, we should accept the reality and simply ignore the Nobel Peace Prize as a propaganda tool.   In certain areas/neighborhoods that's most certainly true. In other areas, it would be no problem. I'm guessing Russia is pretty much the same.   Is anyone else saddened to know that this entire genre of music -- this "thriving rock scene" -- arose to service and entertain American soldiers during our immoral war on Vietnam? We can see the legacy of this cultural imperialism by calling him the "Cambodian Elvis."  We should be thankful that Vietnam invaded Cambodia to put an end to the Khmer Rouge's murderous regime, and we should also remember the sad fact that the US and west *supported* and armed the Khmer Rouge after they were overthrown by the Vietnamese.      It is a far-right newspaper from the US. This article is merely another facet of the right-wing drive to oppose the Iranian agreement.  Russia, the US and everyone with a brain knows that the European-based US anti-missile system was never about Iran. That was just a convenient lie by the US government. The anti-missile system is and was always about trying to negate Russia's nuclear deterrent.  And for that reason the US will not abandon our destabilizing anti-missile system no matter how much money it saves us.   *If* this is true -- that the US will dump our destabilizing anti-missile system -- then that is great news!  But let's be real. Russia, the US and everyone with a brain knows that the European-based US anti-missile system was never about Iran. That was just a convenient lie by the US government. The anti-missile system is and was always about trying to negate Russia's nuclear deterrent.  And for that reason the US will not abandon our destabilizing anti-missile system no matter how much money it saves us.  Thus, this entire Washington Times' article is off-base. This article is merely another facet of the right-wing drive to oppose the Iranian agreement.     	37
    Exactly right. I took this on a bike ride with a canon canonet rangefinder.       I know how to sport   He must play sportsball   Sidewalk and Grass Mimes don't count.    Your username makes a lot of sense   yea dude. I saw! So excited for them. Gunna totally check em out live next week at Rockwood in NYC      Hence the question. I had no idea. I now know all of this and so much more. It's great.    Full disclosure. I am a musician. Studied music theory, all eras of western music history and performance practice in college while playing in up to 10 ensembles a semester. I know how to analyze 12 tone music, perform some of my instruments hardest repertoire as well as understand its significance but I do not understand basic construction principles. I did not take a single class on the subject. I also have not played minecraft. Im more of a fall out 3 guy. Shadows of Mordor is also dope. Mario and Zelda are my bread and butter.    I will for sure    I was hoping to find out more about this. It was part of my original question so I appreciate you chiming in. Anyone have any insight?   Wow. I wood've had no idea   I live in the US, yup. Love hearing what the rest of the world uses to construct homes and why. Maybe we should take pages from their books.    Is this legit?   Do you see this changing in the future? How will we use wood to build our homes? Do you think we will see a shift to using more manmade materials over wood? Have you started to see this at all? Sorry for the questions. Very interested to learn what your thoughts are.   Edit: I am speaking from a North American perspective. I am learning now that it seems we love our timber more than most of the world. Fascinating to hear about the alternatives and how sustainable wood is!     At this pace well probably see that as reality sooner than we'd hope.   Edit: thanks for the knowledge folks! Had no idea wood was this sustainable.    In a world with no trees or a severe lack of trees, where would we turn? Besides that sounding like this intro to a shitty movie trailer, what can will humans use to make reliable and safe structures?    I was commuting to work and I saw a newly completed wood frame of an apartment complex made from - well you guessed it - wood! Nothing crazy. We build shit with wood all the time. Seems just like standard fare at this point.   But wood is prone to so much damage especially over time; accidents, rotting, etc etc not to mention other environmental reasons. Why (besides our lack of desire for change and the sheer convenience factor) something else more durable and for lack of a better term, 'furureproof' has not been used or developed yet? If it has been, why has it not been made scalable.  EDIT: Thanks for your responses everyone. I am learning so much about wood, its uses in modern home construction, its sustainability and all of the alternative materials the rest of the world uses to build its homes. This is great!   EDIT 2: So far today I learned that you can make not only houses from hemp but cars as well. Add that to the list of things everyone has contributed with, I can say that wood is very cool. Seems that while wood may work great in some places, in others it does not make as much sense. Love the endless stream of information that has been put forth in the thread, so for that I thank you all for answering my question and exceeding my wildest expectations. Looking forward to seeing us innovate with both timber and other materials as we build our homes in safer and stronger ways than ever before.   EDIT 3: "Wood actually grows on trees" Cheers for that, folks!   Was on the mobile. Please find a link above, friend   Was on mobile. Please enjoy! https://open.spotify.com/user/lotrguy007/playlist/25qcSWqez3Aas8D5OOl33X      Princess Mononoke is a masterpiece!   	24
 That was nice.  Well I've always heard them in trees, their presence was always known.  I might have seen them in their bright green form, but as for this shit all over my house, I've never seen it.  I've lived in Las Vegas, NV for 15 years.  For the first few years I've lived here, I didn't even know that noise was coming from an insect, I was 13 years old and thought it was electricity of some sort.   Thank you everybody!  I've always known about Cicadas, but I've never seen them, just heard them.  I'm so appreciative for the quick replies.      I agree, that movie was better than I thought it would be.  It made me like her more.   :') very appreciated   [Johnny Cash joined in on the sequel](http://youtu.be/q-_XhuzIrqY)   We are in the same boat.  This is my second pregnancy after a miscarriage.  I'm 6w2d along.  I'll be right here with you guys rooting you all on xoxo   With my last pregnancy,  my doctor held off til 10 weeks.  I went to one of those stand-alone ultrasound places at 8w5d, and for $25 I got to see my baby's heartbeat and make sure everything was ok.  I couldn't wait til my Dr's appt.  It was totally worth it.   [Yea not what I was expecting.](http://www.dariawiki.org/wiki/index.php?title=Alvaro_J._Gonzalez)   Does it feel like you can still wiggle your toes?   I completely agree.  Loved it.  The music was even modern and on point.   I'm a hairstylist, when I cut myself these are the only brand that stay on my hands in and out of water all day.   Well those places want your money, they really don't care if you've seen your doctor.    Don't use the word awkward, :/.  Everything will be ok!   I just remember not wanting to wait as long as my Obgyn wanted me to for my first ultrasound, so I went there for reassurance and it worked great.   Idk how available they are in your town, but go to a stand-alone ultrasound place.  They usually have instant availability,  and the one by my house only charged me like 25 bucks.  Edit:  I'm in your same boat.  I miscarried last year, just took my first positive test today.  I'll be thinking about you!   Nothing about that sub gave me any idea of what it's about.   Uplifting news that still kinda brings me down... :(      Goddammit you people are clever.  Who comes up with this shit?     Aww, I love her.   Make every last moment amazing.  I'm so sorry stranger :(   That's it.  Most people I know really struggle.   I think the problem is people expect it to just happen and don't realize they can create their own happiness.   I have friends that it seems like happiness falls in their lap.  I don't feel bad for myself and only see the positive that's happening to them, I seek it for myself and realize there are always bad things and good.   This is what I was going to say.  People don't realize how many calories things contain.  I wasn't even aware of it until I had MFP.     Dude.  Yes.   Aww, I adore all of them!    Gotcha!   Wtf is going on with her   Something about it being HD feels wrong...   That time was noticeably more uncomfortable too.  Just walking to the car was so unbearable.   On your part of town in the middle of those 2 weeks did you get the downpour?? It was kinda cool that it came out of nowhere and cooled down 30 degrees for like an hour.   No!  The people look even crazier in the summertime... like sheep on the strip.     I know, it's noticeably more comfortable than when it's 10 degrees hotter.  I have never minded this dry heat. You can go swimming at midnight and never be cold, I think that is a neat thing.   When I do it, I spend like 10 minutes washing it like a shower would, never just use tp or a wash cloth.  When I'm low on time, a washcloth is fine though.    I completely agree and that makes me sad.   That *was* very good.  So much feeling at the end, loved it.   I have a friend that has been dying for me to watch this.  I'm not clear on the synopsis,  and I feel like even when she had explained it, there was something that was telling me to bypass it.  Is it a good one though?    This is, to me, one of the movies that I can have playing in the background of my life and be very content.  There is something unnerving and yet oddly comforting about her character.  I also like when movies feel realistic, and even though she is over-the-top psychotic, the situations and dialogue are accurate.    This pic makes me so happy!    But I want people to think I'm funny *because* I like making them laugh.   Thank you!   [Bonus clip of my other baby](http://youtu.be/CnHGpRd_A9M)      It kind of sounds like one of those melodies that you can make yourself with that app that uses dots in a sequence, I can't think of what the program is called. It does just have a very generic sound.  Edit:  I looked it up, it's called a sequencer.  Not what you're looking for, I know, just trying.   NOT COOL.  NOW HUGGING MY DOG WITH LIGHTS ON.

A *scary* tunnel"      Jagermeister, people always try to push that shit on me and I dry-heave just thinking about it.    Maybe a Missy Elliott song?    Thank you so much!  *Of course* an amazing critic hated this movie, I remember liking it. How do I flag this as solved on mobile?   A dark movie where a cult leader pours something on his followers and sets them on fire.  A girl lives and falls into a coma and she sees the cult leader in her nightmares.  The male lead is pretty known, but I don't think the other characters are.      "You can't triple stamp a double stamp, *Nic!*"   Here we have a glass-half-full kinda guy.   Yes, but to be honest, the feeling of relief that I get seeing they even *have* toilet paper is so strong I don't care about anything else.

[Well](http://www.imgur.com/O1O87Sh.jpeg)   I just don't understand how some of these subreddits are legal.     Well I completely agree.  After soaking them in ice water, then putting them in the fridge for a while, I would think that logic would be enough.  But it just doesn't peel right for me, maybe my eggs are too fresh.   That's hilarious   That is the exact method I use to cook my eggs, they still don't peel nicely.      Just be prepared to watch an overly flamboyant Tim Roth.  I liked it though.

So wait times and service, are hit or miss.  But the food at both places was very delicious.  I did prefer the pub at Caesars!      Because pleather is like.. butter.   This may be TMI.  I have gotten ringworm a couple different times, so  I started to wash my clothes at pretty high temperatures just to kill any germs.

From their website,   "If you claim to be Christian, I DARE YOU to give your Pet(s) away, if you cannot, then your Pet(s) are your Gods, Not the Lord Jesus. I DARE YOU to give-up all your Play, Entertainment and Sports, if you cannot, then those are your Gods, Not the Lord Jesus."   It's pretty safe to say that you're not usually ever handed a lump sum like this in your life.  It would be so smart to hang onto it.   I saved the documents that another redditor posted a short while ago.  But it's like pdf format and I can't post it. It's pretty crazy that it's not just a single case of him *maybe* hooking up with like, a seventeen year old.  He likes babies.  He finds women that let him do sexual things to their babies.  It's an insane story, look into it.   Be cordial and respectful.  Then cry yourself to sleep.   I've realized that when it comes to some popular movies, my mind doesn't go deep enough to appreciate what they are.  I feel like I'm the only person that doesn't love Pulp Fiction.  I  respect it, I love the actors, but the cult status boggles my mind.   We get it, it's not funny.   Sometimes my car shoots out too cold or too hot, so I do it sometimes.   	103
 Reporting this thread for being brigaded.   So which is the real confederate flag?  The one you linked?   Lol, freaking rtz, quit trolling and drop dat fiya.   And nigma is newer to dota, he's hon trash, he even admitted so when he transferred over, so you there goes that.  Nigma's skill/knowledge is nowhere near the vets of the game, he's just good at making content.   Whoops there you are!

But it's gonna be nuked again anyway kappa   This was from yesterday, borrowed from u/noodlenonger   m-muh skillcap  Can we stop this? It genuinely affects the skillcap of the item. Stop avoiding that fact. If you have arguments for why it should be changed then that's fine but don't act like it doesn't affect the skillcap and that anyone who mentions the skillcap should have their argument invalidated. Automatically attempting to invalidate people's legitimate points is exactly how you make yourself look like an idiot.  Srsly, whiners need to quit ruining everything for everyone else.     Of course nigma responds "it's dumb," dont' forget he came from HoN, not even true dota player, so how the fuck would he know about blink mechanic   Too bad she sued as a "white" for racism against a predominantly black university.

Well most certainly the one this subreddit was named after.    In most professional kitchens these days, long gone are the times when dick jokes, drug use and alcohol consumption were the norm.   Wait alcohol consumption and dick jokes are long gone??? Well SHIT! Goodbye cruel world.    86 slang as well.   Thought the same. It looks like a fish bowl to me. I'd go with a much shallower dish, and try to tighten up the food placement because the way it is now looks like you said play it where it lands.

Not to sound mean buy you either have no balls and letting the Chef walk all over you or you don't know any better and should find another line of work like was previously stated. I suggest that you stand up to the chef and believe me there's a chance of mad respect.  When I was still green under the collar in this industry I had a coworker be a dick towards me everyday, and one day the Chef himself pulled me aside and said don't let him walk all over you. Next day I grew the balls and got major respect from the Chef and the other guys.   Lived in GA for 2 1/2 weeks and between the spiders and micro-frogs I lost count.   This.

Was just about to post this.   Never met him but he did an episode of Restaurant Impossible at a restaurant by me that I used to pass all the time. Was one of the funniest thing I've seen. One clip had him calling a place for a sign (sign place is right next door), and another one had him driving back to the restaurant after asking people to come to the reveal (they were in the parking lot of the restaurant the whole time).   If I was to get that form it'd be a paper airplane within 30 seconds.   Serve this with some goat cheese and Ritz for $25.   Bandanas is more of the stop on the way home and pick up dinner in a hurry type place. I say close to the airport go with SugarFire Smokehouse. I'm a chef and all I keep hearing is nothing but good things about the place.   Exactly those. They're grrrrrrreat!   Damn people are still pissed about this. Not sorry but I think he was a shitty wrestler no matter what organization, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that.   The part of this that makes me SMH is getting little kids involved in this.   You cheeky lil bastard!  Congrats and if you haven't already we're going to need a full 30min long review posted on YouTube tonight.   Thanks for the link. Found this as well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuJWpl7W6mc  Give a more in depth explanation.   Because it was my First kitchen job and I didn't know any better.  I was the KM/Cook of a Mom   Pop Pizza shop. The owner was a cool guy who I got along with to an extent and I pretty much had full control over the place since he was barely around. Well he would hire in these teeny bopper girls to run the counter, and started to notice why he would hire in these girls is so he could try to get a piece of jailbait ass. In the long run the business started to take on water fast. We ended up losing our contract with pepsi because the bill wasn't getting paid on top of them being unable to deliver. I had no key to the place or I would've accepted it. He also let somebody other than himself handle the books and she ended up screwing him over and the place shut down without notice.  Oh and to answer the P.S. No because I was paid under the table in cash. Come to think of it I was hired under the table as well.   Would love to see a video of how it goes about brewing the tea each morning.   It's Duck Season Muahahahaha!   He did but the Lion no longer had a Choice.

Everytime I try to it pops up Unable To Update At This Time.   Lumia 520 and biggest gripe is the app store. If I would've known that 90% of the apps I used on my android was unavailable with Windows I would've stuck with Android or got an iPhone 5. Besides that the 8.1 update fixed a ton of the problems like the others folder that was just there with no means of dumping the file build up so my storage space kept getting lower while that kept getting higher.   Got it free with a trade in.   Where the fuck you get your info from a cracker jack box?  I'll just leave this here: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm_of_heart   Why not join it? If I'm stuck with this phone for the time being might as join a subreddit where I can get info on it and ask question.   In that case have fun. Still wondering if he got an S5 which is only a few months old why is he wanting to trade in so soon.   Well for example no official app for Snapchat, Instagram is still in beta, and Vine hasn't been updated since God knows when along with many other apps. Also very well known companies are looking at WP users like they have Ebola or something and aren't even creating apps for this OS.    Good point.   Pretty much sums up my degree.   That's like asking if you should trade in a Lambo for a Pinto. The answer is no. As a convert from Android I could kick my own ass. For one thing calling the app market limited is an understatement. While the cameras are good IMO that's the only thing good about these phones. So in turn if you have an S5 keep it, enjoy it, cherish it, and stay away from WP like most companies are doing.   Hate to say it but what else is new. WP is like the damn plague to companies.   That doesn't matter because by that time the damage was already done.   The kind that remembers that the cause of death was due to a heart aneurism cause by years of drug abuse aka his own doings is what killed him.   Take a vid of it and we'll call it The Suckering. Make at least a couple dollars off of Larry that lives in Forest Park.   They've either lived a very sheltered life or don't know racism if it hit them in the face.   Well shit ok I'll admit I was wrong. Still don't want the bullshit out here though.   Shit I'm a 27yo virgin but I'm not going to go out and fuck just any woman to get rid of it. Don't get me wrong I'd like to get rid of it shit what man wouldn't but getting rid of it by means of a meaningless one night stand is just fucked up IMO.   The difference is with the buses you have to transfer between buses to get downtown. With this it's a straight shot from new part of the county to the city. Thus making it easier to commit the crime and get back to the city in no time.   Bus   WHOO HOO GO ME!   Shit might as well.   Mmhmm you know why that is right? Because the criminals from the city are coming out here breaking into houses and robbing places.     Let the butthurt begin with this comment: I didn't like him. IMO he wasn't that great and his own doing is what killed him.   You did read the proposed stop didn't you?   Love Garfield so obviously loving this teapot. Where did you get it?   No Lambchops, No Peace!   I oppose this for the very reason that we don't need no more damn criminals from the city coming into the county. That is why St. Charles has been keeping it out of their area for years. For example look at the arrest reports from the Ferguson riots. A mass majority of those arrested were from the city so all this will do is give them another means of access to the county.   All I can think of is here we go again. First Josh and now Oscar.   Reminds me of The Pineapple from HIMYM.      MORTAL KOMBAAAAAT!!!!   Everybody is just over here kung fu fighting and you're over there butthurt over some jokes.   To me it's like googling something. Too many results that you don't know what you should click on.   He stand up and starts shaking hands until someone tells him there's still a chance of a straight.   Wait that was him? Well that explains everything now. lol      If this crap keeps happening they won't make it another two. With them being busy with the kids I wonder if they even know what is really happening in their places. I say make an anonymous call to the health department but that's just me.   Culinary Institute of St. Louis  It was just the standard industrial roll plastic wrap found in most commercial kitchens.   Theirs are mostly Crosley and Third Street Records(Jack White's label).   http://rs1img.memecdn.com/you-stay-classy-st-louis_o_2565061.jpg   Is this a chain we'd know or a local mom   pop spot? Reason I'm asking is because if it's a chain then this sadly doesn't surprise me but if it's a mom   pop then it's kinda shocking they would turn the blind eye at this.   I always thought the same but it's how I was taught in Culinary School. Still don't fully understand it.   This is the basis of seeing an accident and not stopping to check on the people because it's "not your problem."   Probably has been covered but TL;DR: Anybody else do a quick glance and thought holy shit Rob Lowe???   Whoever requested this I thank you.   Exactly! Hell the standard burritos could feed a small village for a year.   Yeah saw John Pertzborn post about it on twitter when it happened but for some reason it's just now making the news. One of the 13 year olds involved is pregnant so that kind of tells you something about her parents.   Took the words from my mouth. Also gonna add MOAR!!!  	108
 When I first started posting on a messageboard there were a few jerks who would make me steam. Then I met them. I don't stress too much about the jerks anymore bacause we have no idea what kind of fool we are arguing with. The guy getting my goat turned out to be some trust fund kid with serious addiction issues. He was so wasted when I met him the 2nd time, he had his pants on backwards. That is how I picture fools online now.   I came in to say the same thing. You could put a tag with the type or name too.   It's very interesting how people downvote on reddit. You ask a legitimate question and get DV's. Very odd indeed   I think it depends on where you get your tea. I drink Chinese teas about 90% of the time. This is a bit of a dilemna because I have no faith in most Chinese products meeting their stated guidelines. Especially organic products. I have had a number of Chinese teas, organic and none, that give me sore gums or sores in my cheek.   There was an aged oolong at duty free in Taipei that looked and smelled amazing. It was pretty expensive. I'm trying to decide if I get it on my way back through. Arghhhh   Tea is sort of like scotch in that the quality of the ingredients. Also in the processing. High grade teas are processed by experts whose skills are valuable and the quality of the leaf is much higher. Companies like lipton buy cheap tea and it tastes like it. I really notice the quality differences in Oolong    I am in Taipei today and on to Vietnam tomorrow. Looking forward to some exploring on Sunday. Thanks again for recommendations.   There are many people who view the stories in the bible as parables. Whether the stories are 100% fact or not means less than the meaning of the story and how we can learn from them.   But I'm not arguing from the position of a believer. Far East philosophies have always made more sense to me than western religions.   Talk to Dalai Lama   Moses: "I can part the Red Sea, but no one can look at it. I'll just write it down and describe it to you."   The way the religion developed was a lot different than other branches of Christianity. Luther, Ammann (Amish), Fox (Quakers), etc did not say they found gold tablets, magic hats, etc.  It was about interpretations of the Old and New Testament or which was focused on more. They branched off from existing religious groups.   I can't think of another religion founded in the last 300 years based on some magic/miracle happening that is accepted as being legitimate any more than people do Mormonism. If Moses came down and said; I got 10 Commandments etched in stone from God, but no one can see them. It may have caused some doubt among reasonable people. Even 5000+ years ago. Let alone 200.   That's pretty much what I do everywhere I travel, minus the drinking.  I'm not much of a drinker but I had some cachaca in Brazil and had a few beers at the Poulaner restaurant in St. Petersburg, Russia. Everywhere else I've pretty much stuck to juice, tea and water.   I'm looking forward to trying some street food and getting lost and letting Google maps get me back.   Thanks for the advice and recommendations.   Thanks for all your advice and recommendations.  I didn't realize the bay was so far.  I'll spend my day eating food and searching for some nice Vietnamese black teas.   I'll be in Hanoi on business soon. I arrive on Saturday which leaves Sunday to do something. I'll be working from 6-6 the rest of the week and fly out on the following Saturday. I'll have a couple hours each night to walk around but I'll probably stay within a mile or so of my hotel in the Old Quarter. That leaves one day to really explore a little. While I'd really like to see Halong Bay, I'd hate to miss exploring the city in what could be my only opportunity to visit.   I'd appreciate anyone's opinions or advice. Thanks      Sorry, I do not have a photographic memory so I cannot give you bibliographical information. You may want to argue with the German defense minister at the time because his view is fairly consistent with mine, but they were actual insiders, not people like you and me getting public information with a heavy dose of distortion.   No doubt. :-)   I appreciate your methods and I think it would be a pleasure to talk to you in person. The way you disagree without being offensive and actually adding useful information is unusual on the web. I believe I could learn a lot of new things from you.   http://www.outwardbound.org/classic/adult-expeditions/   We sort of do, it's called Outward Bound. I've heard nothing but great things about their programs   A diplomat with the German Foreign Ministry says that there was, of course, a consensus between the two sides. Indeed, the Soviets would hardly have agreed to take part in the two-plus-four talks if they had known that NATO would later accept Poland, Hungary and other Eastern European countries as members.    The negotiations with Gorbachev were already difficult enough, with Western politicians repeatedly insisting that they were not going to derive -- in the words of then-US President George H. W. Bush -- any "unilateral advantage" from the situation, and that there would be "no shift in the balance of power" between the East and the West, as Genscher put it. Russia today is certainly somewhat justified in citing, at the very least, the spirit of the 1990 agreements.   I'll defer to Germany's Defense minister at the time. I'm sure he is more aware of what was going on than either of us.   cold call telemarketer?  So in other words a total jerk with no real skills beyond taking advantage of the old and stupid and pissing everyone else off with your calls. You wouldn't have to fire me. I'd have found a better job long ago.   No, but I do remember the time. I've been a news junkie since the mid 70's. Iran Contra proved that I needed to go beyond the corporate news to find the truth. When the USSR fell, I had a lot of concern about what was going to happen to the nukes and military of the old USSR nations.  There was a lot of discussion at the time about NATO and whether NATO would move east.  I'm not saying anything some of the high level diplomats at the time said and are still saying. As the article states.    So what is your job in the Russian gov?  Are you one of those people in that building who do nothing but post on western media? I wondered how they stop people like you from having their eyes opened once they were exposed to an non state controlled media.   I never said there was. I said agreement. Do I think we know every agreement our nation has made with another nation? Not a chance. Do I think nations renege on agreements? Certainly. Do I think only the bad guys do it? Once again, not a chance. We antagonize every bit as much as they do. Whoever the proverbial they are at the time. Eisenhower had it right.   First I absolutely believe the Soviets are experts at media and public relations manipulation. By no means do I see Putin or Russia as a standard for others to dream of.  Last time I came back from Russia I told my manager I would do everything possible to never return. Their industry was pretty much commandeered by the KGB who pretty much became the Russian mafia as well.   I also think there was an agreement about NATO expansion. Was there a signed treaty. I really don't know. But it wasn't like they really had much of a working gov as they were collapsing and things were happening pretty fast on the international stage. Did the US intend to renege on an agreement knowing you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube? Once again, I have no idea.   Bush was Prez at the time and he was ex CIA, so there is no telling what games within games were being played.   I also have no belief whatsoever that we know all agreements made between the US and other countries. Kuwait and Iraq were not the exception to the rule. It is the standard. Lies, built on lies, built on lies, sprinkled with truth.  MOSSAD knows the truth but they won't tell.   (to add some levity)   http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html   http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315.html.   *Earlier this month, about 300 US paratroopers arrived in western Ukraine to train with Ukrainian national guard units.      At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned the move "could seriously destabilise" the situation in Ukraine.      One of the key points of the Minsk deal stipulates that all foreign armed groups, weapons and mercenaries should withdraw from Ukrainian territory.*   Like Iraq, there is a lot more to this than what both east and west are saying.  When the USSR broke up, NATO promised to never expand into the old USSR nations. And we've been ignoring that for the last few years. Also, I believe Putin wants to build Russia's influence back to what it was prior to the break up of the USSR. Chicken or egg first? You choose mostly based on where you get your info and what filters you use on that info.    Compare the timing of when the great buffalo slaughters happened and when barb wire was invented. Barb wire was after the fact.   I put a little honey in my tea, so I make a pint mug and then just pour a little into a cup. It keeps the tea in the travel mug hotter for about an hour or so by not opening it over and over to sip from.   IMO any tea you like that has some body to it, makes a nice ice tea.  I use cheap Darjeeling because the high mountain Darjeeling's I like are very light and don't transfer their flavor well cold imo. I also like Prince of Wales cold. But I will drink any tea just about, cold or hot. With all my travels, I get a lot of odd versions.   They had them where I stayed in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novrogod. http://imgur.com/gallery/9mkTz/new   Let the churches marry who they want and let the courts marry any couple who wants to get married.    They also were not compatible with cow ranching. It was pretty much the same with sheep in cow country.      A lot of Chinese teas are Suchongs which are quite smokey.  I have never noticed a smokey taste in any of the Dian Hongs (Yunnan black tea)   Clive Barker; all of his books are kind of erotic fantasy mixed with a nice stir of a twisted Stephen King. There is no shortage of gender angles in his stories either.   The same question was asked about 150 years ago when there was all the buffalo running around and the ranchers wanted to make cow the red meat we ate.  The killing of the buffalo was both to weaken the Indians and to strengthen the powerful ranchers business.  Cows lend themselves to ranching a lot more than wild game like Buffalo, deer, elk, etc.   L Ron Hubbard said if you really want to get rich you need to start a religion. And he did.  But we're the fools spending good money on stuff because it has the right label. It is all about image and they are good at protecting their image.   Only the libertarian group. The evangelical's, which are the core of the Republican base want laws to prevent things like prostitution and drug use.  Most conservatives are conservative and do not like change.   Yunnan blacks actually develop more flavor over time.  When they are fresh, they are so bright flavored you really do not get the subtle notes at all.  They compare them to red wines and how they develop flavor as they age. It's one of the reasons most Pu'er tea comes from Yunnan.   Do you drink bagged tea or loose?  Moving from bag to loose, you may want to stick with Assam's, Ceylon's or Darjeeling teas. (I don't have any experience with African teas so I am not sure what they are like.)  When I switched, all I drank was Twinings darjeeling and Prince of Wales which are both pretty hearty.  From there making the step to more mellow loose teas was easier.   When I first tried the Lingia I thought I did not brew it enough or did not use enough tea.  It blew my mind when it had as much flavor as it did, as light as it was.  It's almost like how deceiving Oolong's are when you look at the color and then taste it and get a mouth full of flavor.  Color has no bearing on taste with those teas.    It's from a company called WMF, they make all sorts of high quality cookware and accessories.     Switching up from my normal Yunnan black tea and having a nice SFTGFOP1 Lingia Darjeeling this morning. For a change of pace, it's tough to beat.      Interesting perspective. I believe it is the best book to read about the labor movement and the methods used to weaken the power of laborers.  If you know of a better book that is not all pro capitalist, share the title.  Incredibly enough, reading a wide swath of information about a topic is how you learn. Not reading one perspective over and over. Which is what most people seem to do.   Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States is a good book about labor and other topics.   There would definitely be punishment delivered   Looking out at the sky and realizing you are seeing into infinity has blown my mind since I first learned the concept.   I'd have to think they put in as many steps as almost any profession. Many of their steps are taken with urgency. I meander around a class all day. :-)   I train software in a classroom setting and I am on my feet walking around a classroom for 8 1/2 hours with a 1/2 hour to sit and catch up on email. Like you, and unlike a FedEx driver, we don't have a vehicle to sit in for 1/2 the day. I imagine emergency room workers put in a lot of foot miles too. I actually wear shoes that are very popular in hospitals because of their comfort for hours on end.   I almost find Shogun to be more of a romantic novel. The rest of them are historical novels. King Rat sort of stands on its own but it has characters from Noble House.   Thanks. 80-90% of the tea I drink is Yunnan black tea and they seem to specialize in them. I'll have to add them to the list and try them soon.   A girl I work with went back to China and bought a lot of tea from the tea market with her brother. They bought a bunch of small bags like that and sealed them like we do with seal-a-meal. The bag may be generic.  Once you open it and share a picture, people may be able to tell if it is a tieguanyin.   I really enjoyed Clavell's books on Asia's far east. I found Shogun a tough read, but the rest of the series is very good and gives you a nice flavor of China in the 17th and 18th century and even into the 19th and 20th in the last books.   I just read about there being over 100 variations of tea from Yunnan.  I have never noticed a sour taste. Real fresh Dian Hongs can taste very bright, but I don't consider it sour.  One of the things I like about Dian Hongs is how they never seem to get bitter.   I was searching for information about Wu Liang Hong Mao Feng and found the http://www.panthermoontea.com/black-tea--china-and-taiwan.html site.   It looks like they have some excellent teas.  Has anyone tried them or know anything about them?  	57
 That screen on the console on C series is a bit exaggerated, it could be integrated as in previous versions.         I do repost it with Ars Technica article today. Guess what?

 I'm a rising Junior in high school and am taking all my classes at a local community college next year. Part of the process for me was taking the CLEP college algebra exam because I took Calc 1 last year and want to go to Calc 2. It's scaled from 20-80 points. I winded up getting 75 and a couple hours later I got an email from Quest Bridge about them. Coincidence? Is this because of that score? Is that program even something too look into. I am in need of financial help for college and many of the schools I'm looking at are on their partner list.  TLDR; Is Quest Bridge legit?   I understand completely. It's like you could be talking with a group of 30 people and yet you still feel alone because nobody is on the same "wavelength" as you.   Thanks, this is what I needed to hear.   I've been relatively recently diagnosed and I feel like there is now this thing inside of me that is controlling everything about me. There were things about me that I used to like and now I just think I'm only that way because of my condition and it's not really me. Anyone else feel this way, if so how do you cope with this?   I'll be dual enrolling next year and the following year (my junior/senior year) and am going to take classes in C and C++. When I graduate I will be 18, is it possible to get in internship in CS the summer after my senior year?  	5

 Added!! :) Please return   Added, thanks!! Great safari!  	2
 gay porn   this exactly haha   You get 180 norcos per month?!?! May I ask how you obtain them?   Is that relatively high?  haha now your making me feel bad.  it's taken me about 10 years to get here though.   Yeah i think that is the best way to describe it although i don't really "nod" anymore since my tolerance has gone up with the amount i take :(    I could just take more norco to achieve that nod but i'd run out of my script way too fast haha   I am sure there are tons of threads on this, maybe not but fuck it haha I thought I would share my experience as it happens. I was bored and took a super low dose of Diphenhydramine (15mg) then 4 norcos about 30 mins later.  It has been about 45 mins since the norco dose and it feels a bit stronger than usual but not like out of control sedated.  I really haven't tried to potentiate my meds before other than tonic water and gf juice which I thought were very trivial potentiators.  What does everyone prefer to use for potentiators, or do most of you just think they are a waste of time?     yeah i saw that rashes are a side effect. i think she prescribed this to me because I told her I was having trouble sleeping and I have taken ambien before and didn't really want to get on it again.   yeah that is what my doctor said about it possibly helping me sleep.     probably not a good thing?   haha ok   oh ok guess i just gotta try it!    ok so it helps with wds?  have you taken it with any opiates? does it enhance anything or no.   so is it like ambien in way? i have had ambien so that would be a comparison point to me. dunno if you have.     My doctor is going to prescribe this to supplement my norco. I barely think I've even heard of this. Will it help with my pain?  Any input on it is appreciated.   crying is good sometimes!   no problem haha thanks for giving me an idea to vent on!   I can relate with a lot of you said in this post.  I am as well addicted to food and was anorexic at age 18-20.  luckily that passed quickly and I spent most of my 20s focusing on alcohol to where it became a daily chore just to maintain my buzz. that got old and i had a couple years of no real issues which was nice.  the last few years I have been bulimic and i honestly don't know why i even do it or how I started it. I don't do it so I can look pretty for other people, its strictly personal.    I have always been extremely anxious as well and I think that is part of the reason that I get hung up in these situations.  I also feel that having an eating disorder and being a male makes it a bit harder for people to understand- at least the people around me in my life.     i guess what I mean is that you are lucky to not have that craving/tendency/disposition/etc to be an IV heroin user like so many other people.    i've never tried heroin yet i do love opiates in general.  i'd consider yourself extremely lucky to have had 3 "disappointing"  experiences with heroin since I can't recall ever reading a story about disappointing heroin experiences unless they ended in death.     I got the REAL results back.  false positive.     i'm hoping its just a false positive as the only drugs I ever do are my prescriptions which are norco and paxil both prescribed by my doctor so yeah i'm just waiting to hear back from them.   I take paxil as well but it is prescribed to me by the same doctor so I would think that they would catch that.  no benadryl or morphine.   haha of course!!   I dunno. This isn't for work or probation but it would probably put another fork in the road on my route into the pain program in which the questioning doctor reffered me to.   yes she does she is the same doctor prescribing it!! haha   she responded saying that different meds can interact and and labs can come up as "false positives."   yeah this was sent over type not verbally and my doctors main question was why is hydromorphone in your system.    Well I get my tests done thru Kaiser Permanente which is like the Wal Mart of hospitals so I assume its a screw up on their end.  I already messaged my doctor back telling her I am more than willing to re take the test.  it sucks because I am trying to get into this pain program and I am already getting pigeon holed for shit I haven't even done haha!   had a urine test and it came back positive for Dilaudid which I have never done in my life.  I take norco everyday for pain and have a legit script for that. any reason why this would happen?  i understand i would test positive for some kind of opiate but my doctor told me today about the dilaudid and I was like wtf I have no idea.     I'm gonna with the easy one: dying in my sleep.  but runners up are a quick accident where it happens so fast i'm dead before I know it or being doped up to the gills and go out peacefully if i had some kind of terminal illness.   agreed! he just stuck out to me so far. i'm still not done I keep getting distracted haha.   watching it right now about 1/2 way thru.  not too surprised this takes place in west virginia.  the guy with brain cancer makes me a bit sad i feel bad for him.   Pissing in a river watching it rise   I still get the exact same ones!   mac dre! you from the bay?   haha yeah i'm pretty versed in that schitk or however you spell it.   yep physical therapy and yoga is gonna be the 1st thing they want me to do. i have done a bit of research.  fuck man i have already done so much damn PT.   i have the same feeling that they will if i am lucky at least get me something that will last longer than my norcos which only last about 3 hours.   here is the deal i've been with the same doc for about 5 years now and have developed a rapport with her.  I am currently being prescribed 120 norcos a month for legitimate pain that MRI's will back up. I take usually about 3-4 a day so I don't feel that I am abusing them since when I take them I can actually move around and be somewhat limber.  I actually have a bit of a stockpile of them cause i've been a good guy haha.  Anyways last time I met up with her she wanted to refer me to the chronic pain program. I have never been in a situation like this. Is this good or bad?  FYI I am going thru Kaiser Permanente in northern california so if anyone has any experiences please share. thanks!   haha thats a jacket.   haha thanks for the comments guys.  just thought i'd share.   norcos       wow. jackpot!! kudos to you!!   I'd be really surprised if they shipped to anywhere that you would need a script   That's a good deal. Did the person selling know what they had or just being generous?!?   hope you're not the one operating the boat.   Never seen these. Seen other generic whites but not shaped like the yellows    yeah i'm talking more like 5/500's. something with a lot of apap in it.   so it'd basically be like canada then with codiene more or less is what you are saying?   If heroin or opiates in general were legal to purchase in the US meaning you can go to Walgreens and buy opiate pills as you would like at anytime just like say ibuprofen then I believe possibly a lot more people would start using them because they would realize how much more effective they actually are than non narcotics when it comes to real pain. the problem with this of course is you have a small percentage of idiots who will of course abuse and od on said narcotics.  Natural selection perhaps?!?! I don't even have to state that crime would rapidly decrease if this were the case though.  For the record I am legally prescribed a small amount of opiate painkillers which I do take daily and responsibly.     OK good to know since I don't want to snort anything haha   I am still at around 3 norcos to do the trick and have somehow made this work for several years now.  Good self control/ tolerance i suppose although i have had to taper around to keep my tolerance in check.  I have only taken them orally.  Is it even worth it to snort them?  I have heard some people say its a waste of time but i'd like to hear people's opinions.   lol. hopefully i'll never be caught posting there!!   thats a weird subreddit never knew about it.   i might i just haven't ever taken one before so i get weirded out sometimes when i haven't used it before.  I know this sounds exceptionally funny coming from an opiate user too hahaha but i am weird when it comes to dumb shit like this sometimes.   And if any of you guys lived nearby I'd gladly give it up im just not gonna risk mailing it   Paying $80 for 1 tiny little pill no matter what it is just seems so frivolous   Haha I shouldn't have phrased it that way   I already stated my location in a previous post in this thread.  if you can find it then you win!! haha.   i'm not telling anyone at work what so ever. i do have a few ideas on who it could of been. plus the fact that its a kitchen that caters to down and out types of people could mean it was one of theirs as well so who knows.   for the record i don't plan on taking it. i frequent this forum and have a tolerance of 30mg hydrocodone daily. just thought it was crazy to find this under the circumstances that i did being a church and all.  best thing is 1st thing that crossed my mind: post this on r/opiates lol!!   thats what is kiling me is i want to know who dropped it!! i do work in a soup kitchen that caters to down and out types though so it could of came from one of them.   I just can't believe that i mopped the shit outta it and it was still intact. hahaha wow.  I wish 1 of you guys were here now so I could give it to you, I love my brops!!   northern california   damn thats crazy.  so these are the ones they discontinued?  I was thinking that they are.   I take norcos daily about 30mg and have had morphine in the hospital but I'm a bit worried about taking it since I hear that these are the  best ones and with my addictive personality and family history I might take it and never look back haha. I would honestly just give it to one of you guys so my curiosity doesn't get the best of me. What's the street value on these $30-50?   yeah its an oc 80.  so weird that i somehow found it while mopping up in a church kitchen lol.  its killing me to know whose it was!!     i work in a church kitchen and literally mopped up over this thinking it was a piece of candy.  never done these but have heard about them from this subreddit.  score?!?!  i don't know what i'm gonna do with it- i havent touched anything stronger than norcos.  http://imgur.com/t9pNREv   http://imgur.com/XUP6kk9   i saw a lot of people talked shit on my last pic post of 3 norcos in my grinder and thats cool doesnt bother me because it's people like me with self control that can stockpile their shit and make it through the rough and tough times.  good vibes everyone that has been cool to me.  http://imgur.com/XUP6kk9   i had an empty one in my car after buying about 15 norcos. Since all the guy gave me was the cellophane wrapping from a cig package to put em in I just threw em the tic tac container for the hour long drive back so they didn't get lost.  Will do it again if i don't have an actual pill bottle and recommend it as well haha!   lol i've actually had to do this before!!   i have done this several times on around 15-20mg a day habit for a couple years then cold turkey cause i ran out.  for about for days its uncomfortable but not that bad where it really affected me so much i couldn't function so i agree with your statement.   I did once on codiene cough syrup. one of the worst experiences of my life. drank about 1/2 bottle of the syrup and drank alcohol through out the course of the night. i had tried codiene cough syrup before but only in small doses and it felt great but this time around i honestly did not feel that buzzed so i just got bored and fell asleep.  next morning i woke up (luckily) and i felt extremely depressed/anxious and just crappy mentally. Like so much after a few days of feeling this way I got scared and actually went and saw a psycharatrist and told him what had happened and that i was starting to get very worried that i could of really fucked myself up mentally for life.  he said that basically what i was going thru was more or less normal and it was me withdrawing from the drugs. I have gone thru withdrawls from opiates before and this was nothing like it has ever been for me but yeah.  He gave me some valium which i only ended up taking 1 because it just made me feel loopy i guess and didn't really solve anything.  I'd say that it took the better part of a month to actually feel back to normal mentally.  Very scary stuff!!   yeah it might be related to different classes of people but i've only heard black people use the term up until this thread!   haha naw i know how to say it but i was just curious.   yeah if its a one time thing i'd think you be fine just don't make a daily habit of 4,500 mg acetaminophen but i hope you would know that already haha.    haha then you are the first white guy i have heard use that term!  i was assuming it was a regional or hood type slang.  good to know.   how come black people always call it this and i've never heard any other race use this term for heroin?  just a dumb question that i have wondered for a long time haha.   Haha thanks man my tolerance is definitely higher than what it used to be but i am still trying to keep it relatively low so i can be a productive member of society and not a complete burnout    Not snorting them   I still can't believe how worked up some of you have gotten over this hahaha   a simple pill crusher. and a wood table that needs restoration, just bare wood is all.   hahaha i'm loving what my dumb thread has started.  I am totally sober now. it was a bit of a joke to begin with.  	85
 I suppose in the future it might be a possible for him to do that, but at the moment I think he's probably better on a slightly higher dose. I'll mention it to him at some point as an option.. Thankyou!  	1
 Its normally $8.99, but it was their lunch special that day so it was $7.   That's it, didn't even know that they had a website, just found this place this week.    The mayo is actually the bit of green on the bottom layer since its mixed with pesto   St. Inigoes General Store in St. Inigoes, MD   Really? Whereabouts?   BTW, the place I got this is a little general store called St. Inigoes General Store and it was a huge surprise when I found out they served food this good.   Mozzarella   East coast, the Chesapeake Bay area, sorry   Its mozzarella, and it was delicious   I live in southern Maryland   $7, not a bad deal       Rumors today were that apple is releasing a gold colored iPhone for the 5s   	13
    First thing I would recommend is to change your perspective. Stop beating yourself up, and start being your biggest supporter. It is incredibly important and it's ridiculous how big a difference that can make in your own success.  The second thing is to decide what you want to do. It doesn't matter if it seems impossible right now, just pick a direction and go. I've noticed that I'm less distractible when I have a goal to focus on, and even if I get distracted I know which direction to realign with.  You don't need an exact plan, just know where you want to go. The path will form itself. Keep in mind that things will not change over night. It will take hard work and patience (A LOT of patience), but it is very doable. ADD does not make us dysfunctional, it makes us function differently.  You can do this.  	2
 Training for that big event would be easy and fun.     I dreamed of an ask reddit "what's with the names  *boyfriends  parents names*? sounds like their children would be the Devils spawn"   Having a mullet or rats tail kind of hair style.     My bf does this,  i imagine stabbing him every time. Love him though.   I have no memories from that year,  I had serious depression.    Exactly the same for me.  I used to gag at the smell.  Now I adore the glorious scent.    My bf and I  discussed these things too, as well as how many children  we want in the future,  which is usually not recommended by it just came up. Been two years,  going good.    Everything    I wanted an awesome long beard like my previous neighbour had/ still has.   Unfortunately I had to accept the fact that women don't tend to grow such glorious facial hair.   I know this kind of thing happens in the wild (sort of), but having animals in captivity suffer like that is awful, it can easily be prevented. people are stupid animals sometimes.    Must have been awful for the guy in the elevator too, seeing it happen but not being able to help. horrible.     Dog is an artist    It is genetic, but in the same way that other physical characteristics  are genetic,  like hair/ eye color,  height,  etc. But we don't say all people with  blue eyes are a different race to people with brown eyes.  Skin color is an easy and obvious way of separating people  into groups, and so over time we have become  accustomed to doing that.     This was asked recently and someone gave a good answer that was really easy to understand.  Edit: " Although there were many other females living at the time of Mitochondrial Eve, none of them were able to produce a direct, unbroken line of females to any present-day woman. In other words, all the other women at the time either died or gave birth to only males at one point in their lineage. Since mitochondrial DNA is only passed down through females, all these other lineages met dead ends if a mother gave birth to only sons. Mitochondrial Eve is the only female who produced a lineage of women that lasts up to this day. Thus every female alive today can trace their mitochondrial DNA back to this lineage."   I've never tried them, but I'm gonna assume I wont like them   I dreamed I was reading my shopping list to my sister.   'Now You See Me' was stupid, I'd heard that it was really great and was pretty disappointed when it was actually really shit.    my 20th, my friends were busy, I was house and cat sitting, the cat had irritable bowel syndrome, cleaned up liquid cat poop. cried. also, had no cake.    PROcrastinator    Chocolate and Oranges.   I don't understand how people can like it.    But not through and though   They congregate on them because they're easy to access perches.   And they do get electrocuted  sometimes.    I'm Australian,  I've never had to pay for air before,  unless I've  been stealing this whole time.    But I would assume the companies here cover the cost of the machine in other ways and companies there either don't or use it for extra profit.    The microwave in my place stinks like the indian food my housemate had a week ago.     Its been nearly 2 years since i lost my dalmatian  to a snake bite, still not over it.  Beautiful  dogs.   Unfortunately its because  people  don't tend to care about things that don't directly affect them,  even if its the death of thousands.   Ebola is a good recent example of this,  when it seemed to no longer be a threat to the developed world  we stopped caring.    Yes,  you will always observe light to be moving at the same speed regardless of the motion of the source or you, the speed of light is a constant of nature, you could never catch up to or overtake a beam of light.     Sometimes it's just a side effect, not necessary, but not avoidable either. Such as bombing industrial areas, ships etc to hinder the enemy, there will likely be many people/workers at the location that are killed as a result.    Killing also obviously reduces the number of people to fight against giving you better odds at winning.   In a lot of cases it isn't necessary but gives a strong message of power, and can hasten the end of war.  The bombing of Hiroshima  killed many in awful ways but possibly  prevented far more deaths by ending the war sooner.      About 16 hours because i had nothing better to do   We don't have proof of extraterrestrial life but we have proof that the universe can create life,  because we are here, it's not an unreasonable  assumption  that other planets can also support life.   We have absolutely no proof of a 'creator' and no scientific reason to assume that there could be.     http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/20/1413802984499_wps_1_Meet_the_girl_who_was_7_w.jpg  The girl in the stripey shirt is 36 weeks pregnant, you wouldn't know and she didn't , apparently. It can happen.   Edit: source http://dailym.ai/1rn4gDT   When my nephews were two i fed them lemons. They ate a whole half each.   In Australia the indigenous culture had been pretty much unchanged for around 60, 000 years, without colonization, its likely it would have  continued the same way, some indigenous people still choose their traditional way of life today.     It isn't actually an island, its not a large body of rubbish floating around  and it's actual size is only estimated, it might be smaller that what you say.    It is mostly very small particles, and the occasional larger piece suspended  in the water (below the surface) and not usually floating  on the surface. so only the larger pieces would be visible from satellites,  and they are scattered over a very very large area.    It is considered a miscarriage although it usually happens without the woman even missing a period, so she wouldn't have even known it had happened.  The causes for failed implanation  aren't fully understood, but may have to do with genetic abnormalities in the embryo or problems with the uterus, I'm just researching it now out of curiosity, i need an ELI5 for some of the terms used.     Can we call the fridge kevin?    Ants. World domination.   Small, quiet, underground, everywhere.    Having questions with no answers.      I cut a girls face with a fingernail about 15 years ago. She still has a scar.   It was accidental.   Any time a baby smiles at me in public. They need to learn that its not the done thing.  People don't go around smiling at each other.     I'm in Australia, never needed or wanted a gun and don't expect that to change any time soon.     The fertilised egg first needs to implant into the uteral lining for a woman's body to recognise that it is pregnant, this is when pregnancy tests will show up positive.    A friend of mine had a minor crash that could have caused no injuries at all, but she ended up in hospital because she had her feet on the dash.     I read the abstract or the conclusion first and then go through and read the first sentence  of a paragraph to decide if it's worth reading the rest of the paragraph. This had worked well for me,  I've never seemed to miss any important information  or struggle with assignmemts.    No,  sorry,  I take it back.    Not drunk, drinking water.    All held together with skin   In Bruges and Wild Target ?   And make as many sounds as evolution deemed necessary.    Trial and error, patience  and learning over thousands of years.    My psychiatrist  told me that many parents  are asking to have their children diagnosed as autistic when they actually  have adhd, so that they can get disability support that isn't available for adhd but still needed in a lot of cases.  I have no idea how much truth is in this,  but it might account for part of the rise in numbers.  This is in Australia by the way.    life is full of disappointments    Can't be sure, but I don't think there is a moth in there.    Gandalf, with Dumbledore as second in command.    I know a family who are precious snowflakes and have conditions so rare that no doctor can diagnose them, so now they are going to doctors interstate.   In my non-expert expert opinion, they show all the signs of anxiety, and a need to feel extra special and unique. The numerous doctors they have seen have tried to put them on medication for anxiety but they argue with the doctors and move on to a new one, and also refuse to see psychologists or psychiatrists because they don't know anything.    ok fine, no painful monthly periods for men. Hugs and painkillers win.    But the economy!    My dad saved two sting rays that were trapped on the beach, they both stung him numerous times, then he had to walk a few kilometres back to where he parked his car, bleeding the whole way.   We aren't a very bad ass family, but I was impressed.    5 second rule   this one is so irritating.    Do people really believe this?   Why does my ear hurt so bad?   Colour is correct unless you live in the USA.    My friends mother used to only wear her underwear, which was generally lacy lingerie and stuff, she was also about 50ish at the time.     That's how you get the milk- cereal ratio all wrong.    wife beaters/ singlets, both my male housemates are wearing them currently and it's just gross, I don't wanna see your sweaty armpits. put a damn shirt on.    I prefer the idea of men and women suffering together. And think of all the new jobs created to make and sell 'sanitary mankins' and 'manpons' (not sure how they will work). It will be great for the economy.    digital cameras   I worked for viterra in Australia    So this is why we couldn't pat kangaroos? damn the world   lost his dentures?   The Wrong Mans   I think circumcised penises are hideous. really, really ugly. I mean, they aren't that beautiful to begin with but at least let them have their sleeping bags to hide in.     I also like forearms   Darn.    I second this, I love Morialta.    $30 I got for my 10th birthday plus the brand new wallet it was in. I have blamed my sister, but she never confessed.    I grew up poor. I don't hate wealthy people, I hate that our society is built to create such huge inequalities, I also hate those who refuse to share their wealth even when they have too much to spend in their lifetime.    same, 26 is fast approaching and I'm freaking out about being so old. I wish I was 21 again.    I very much understand this feeling.  I constantly hear ' you need to love yourself first' and I know, deep down, that it's true, but when I feel like no one else can love me, I conclude that I must be worthless and don't deserve love from myself.   I'm working on that though, the replies in this thread are really helpful, and giving me some perspective. I hope we both move past this awful feeling.    this is perfect, thank you so much. I'm going to print it and hang it on my wall.  It's all simple, but exactly what I need to hear, and I'll remind myself of this every day.     As she ages you will probably be able to tell more who she looks like. at two weeks old, most babies look pretty much the same, give it time. and Congratulations.    They released that album, and I hated it.    how do I change?    That sucks, I'm sorry that happened to you.      I try, but sometimes in those really down moments, I wish there was someone to take over caring about me when I don't have the energy to.     nah, I'm good, thanks anyway.    it does make sense, hard to put into practise sometimes though.    I have a bearded dragon, not the same, but he is nice anyway.    Thanks for answering, and you make a lot of sense. I will ask myself that question, and work on finding an answer.    this is a good point.    I'm in Australia and I'm not sure that we have anything like this, but I'm going to look into it, thanks.    I'm in pain   because the Earths resources are finite, and it takes a very very long time for things to break down in landfill enough for them to be recycled naturally.    safety scissors all around   putting knives into toasters while they were on.  stuck my finger in a light socket, also while it was on, ouch.         Topaz= Dopey  Monti= Brontosaurus      I had a cat called Rupert that ended up going by Poop/ Poopy/ Poopy-doop.    thank you, I hope so.   cadbury top deck chocolate, mountains of it, I will die so happy, and wont have to worry about the calories.    I have never been the most important person to anyone. I've never felt like I'm needed, just me, for filling a space in someones life that no one else could. Everyone in my life has someone else that could easily take my place and it makes me feel so useless.   I know there are people who care about me and love me, but they also care about and love other people equally or more.   I feel like if I was in that sinking boat scenario with a few other people, I would never be one of the people chosen to live...  Edit: Thank you for the replies, they have truly been very helpful. In really dark moments, when it feels like no one cares at all, it's amazing to know that people, even strangers, are there to help. I'm taking on a lot of what has been said and I can already feel the difference it's making.    I think people would get tired/ bored of living for too long and suicide rates would go through the roof.    they aren't.   	103
 Heh..   Still waiting for my ticket. 2 weeks now, but, eh.. It takes what it takes.   I'm just a little worried tho, as I tested on Jan 31, and as of Feb 9, I received one of the VEs renewal paper license in the mail. (?!?) I contacted him, and mailed the paper off to him, but now i'm a little bit worried my stuff got lost somewhere..   ..     A commonly used device (Electrocautery)   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauterization   Is used by surgeons to excise tissue, and simultaneously cauterize the minor vessels feeding blood.   It works by literally passing a high frequency, high voltage (of little amperage) causing an almost jacobs-ladder type arc.         This can be a huge ignition source if any flammable gases or materials are present in the area.   Weird, but true.      Theres also http://lcwo.net/ ("Learn CW Online" Koch method) to learn at..   I just passed my Tech, and General last weekend (Still waiting to see it on the FCC ULS... F5, F5, F5, F5... Heh) But I'm super interested in learning code.   FWIW, I would suggest going ahead, and testing for your ticket. Being able to transmit, and interact with fellow hams may keep your interest in learning code, and if not, well, you can still chat with people.. Win-win!   Well said sir.   Treat them as QRM, and don't feed the trolls.   LOL.. Indeed.. I continuously learn tidbits in the comments.    Oh, and i'm a sir..   Well, either that or I had some kind of unfortunate accident involving my vagina, and internal explosives that I do not recall.      Uh, probably not.. We pretty much eat crap (at least in the international eye) as a business traveler, i regularly visit China, India, and Brazil.    In India, roughly 50% of the population is vegetarian..

Theres a *ton* of (believe it or not) potato dishes, but also eggs, chicken, and mushrooms.  ("umami" proteins) that shade into making a meager meal feel satisfying. (they're masters at this)    ITO.. (Indium Tin Oxide)      Transparent conductor..    ...Makes things like this possible..       ..The more you know!! :-)   Its amazing to me, how the latex of the balloon still slides away so quickly, even given the liquid water environment.    .   .   Always loved high-speed balloon pops. Did it one year while I had my photography studio. During a local "art" crawl thing, I gave away 8X10s of anyone willing to pop a balloon in front of the camera. The shutter/strobe trigger was a fairly simple device I built, that used a piezoelectric 'speaker' as the sound input device.  Timing was established by figuring out how far away I had to place the sensor, heh.    Erm.. We are "Soldiers"   Well, a well regulated militia.   2nd amendment, and all..

    Today, I lost my virginity. My boyfriend and I had attempted to have sex before but it had hurt too much to continue, so we had planned to wait a few more months. Naturally, I was preparing myself to handle what I thought would hurt like a bitch. Cut to romantic date night leading up to what was supposed to be a magical moment. I was terrified and positive it would be a bloody, painful mess. But for some reason, I guess due to the foreplay/lube, when he put it in, it barely hurt. And I, reveling in the lack of pain, exclaimed, "Is that it?!". I asked my poor boyfriend, "Is that it?" as he took my virginity.  Disclaimer: He has a big dick.    No phones, no internet.. poor lost animals :(   Hello! I love your music and saw your concert in Dallas last year and it was mindblowing. It was my boyfriend's first concert and probably his favorite, to date. We were wondering what your favorite collaborations have been and if we have any to look forward to in the near future. Thanks so much for doing this AMA!   not so much on the tip of my tongue since I know what it is but I can't find the video where Ken Jennings answers a Jeopardy question with "what be ebonics?". can anyone help?  	5
 I pretty much agree with you. The characters were pretty unlikeable across the board. And the main character struck me as an ass... other than generic sympathy for another human being in a life-threatening situation, I couldn't think of a reason why I should care what happened to him. Listening to the book on audio may have had something to do with my opinion, though. Occasionally, a reader's inflection and delivery can have a negative impact on my enjoyment of a book, and this reader had the sarcasm turned up to 11.  As for the structure of the book, it got very tiresome, very quickly. To its credit, I finished it pretty quickly and didn't really have to put it down. But, most of it lacked drama and tension, for me. There was no problem Mark could not solve (unsurprising, since all problems were created by the author to be solved), so it really boiled down to extended explanations of how the latest crisis would be overcome. Basically, this:  **  "Oh, crap. I'm in trouble. If I don't fix this I'm going to be dead."  "I have no idea how to fix this; I need to think about it."  ...chapter break...  "I have a solution. I will now explain it in painful detail for twenty minutes."  "Having explained the solution, I will now do what I just explained. Meet me back here in a couple chapters to see how it goes."  ...  "Surprise. It worked."  "Oh, crap. I have another problem. If I don't fix this, I'm dead."  ...repeat...  **   Sometimes the solutions were really fun and clever, sometimes they were too technical, and most of the time they were between the two. In almost all cases, it drags.   I can see why people like the book. But, ugh.   If quality weren't a driver of sales, then any game released during a "lull" would sell millions and take Sony by surprise.

The other games will still be available when you get around to them. There are too many games these days to be slave to the release schedule.   Probably about the same percentage of people as any other game.      Maybe I just haven't been following the news on this game closely enough. That article was the first time I'd heard any hints about the structure of the game narrative or some of the ancillary marketing stuff they're doing. Or recent confirmation that the target release date is this year. Seems like news to me.   This is not true. Based on the New Yorker article, there *is* an end-game arc. A mystery to solve, and gameplay that increases in difficulty as you get closer to the end. It's not just 'la-la-look-at-the-pretty-flowers.'

 Preferably nothing biased, just a historical rundown of how a religion was corrupted into extremist/terrorist groups over time, important historical events, people, etc. who shaped Islamic fundamentalism into what it is today.

All US presence beyond our own borders is removed globally. A doctrine of isolationism is implemented so far as it concerns our military and foreign aid. We don't send troops, we don't drone strike, we don't bomb, we don't sanction, we don't diddly squat.  What would happen?            The easy method is Batman's birthday, 1985 deduced from Batman #010, Year Zero Directors Cut. Bruce Wayne is Born. (Date inferred Willowood and Wayne Death correlations. Willowood fell into disrepute after Martha died when Bruce was 10, but it was likely not that long after, and the sickhole happened 18 years ago. This also correlates to Bruce taking off as soon as possible, 18, which is consistent with everything else.)   Thomas   Martha are murdered when Bruce is 10 in 1995. Damian is born in 1999 (Batman   Robin #0) somehow even though Bruce Wayne would only be 14 and doesn't leave Gotham until 2000 (Batman #0). Bruce returns to Gotham in 2004 (Detective Comics #0). He's now 19. Damian would be 5 going by this insanity.  In 2005, Bruce is a vigilante trying to save Gotham City from The Red Hood and his gang (Batman #0).  2006: Tim Drake attends Graystone Academy (in Middle School) as their top academic student and is taking gymnastics. He hacked the school's network and caught the principal embezzling funds and turned him in. At the exact same time, Jason Todd robbed a convenience store with a friend(?) who shot a scared woman. Jason in moral outrage beat his friend(?) down and allowed himself to be arrested. The Bat-Signal is lit by Commissioner Gordon for the first time. Dick Grayson's parents fall to their death due to Tony Zucco tampering with the trapeze equipment. Dick is then sent to an orphanage, The Wayne Care Center. (Batman #0)  That ***same year*** Dick Grayson becomes Robin. (Nightwing #1).  That ***same year*** Barbara Gordon becomes Batgirl.  So Bruce Wayne has been active one year as a vigilante and already has a kid sidekick and inspired a female crime fighter.  2007: Barbara gives up being Batgirl after only one year to focus on college. (Batgirl #0)  2008: Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* happens, officially NewFiftyTwoniverse Cannon. As a reminder, Batman is apparently 23 in this book. Damian is 9 and still unknown to his father.  2009: Jason Todd resurrected. When exactly he died or became Robin is hard to figure out, but it couldn't have been for very long. Damian Wayne defeats his mother in a birthday challenge and learns Bruce Wayne is his father. Batman is 24, Damian is 10, so yes, somehow Bruce fathered Damian when he was 14 with a woman he'd never met a good six or seven years before he became Batman. WTF?  2010: The events of Batman, Inc #0 take place.  2011: The "present" of the New52 launch in most titles which has advanced generally in real time since.  So Batman/Bruce Wayne is roughly 29 and has managed to have four Robins in a vigilante/costumed adventurer/superhero career of about nine years. By DC compressing decades of continuity to keep all these characters they've built and established, Batman has Dick Greyson as a costumed sidekick almost immediately, loses him when Dick starts the first Titans--vaguely referenced in Red Hood   The Outlaws--Batman almost instantly replaces Dick with Jason who must then die almost the next day, then he gets replaced by Tim who goes off and forms the current Teen Titans, and then Damian comes along, who Bruce apparently fathered at age 14 because that makes sense.  DC Comics has created a clusterfuck of plotholes in their new timeline.  ***EDIT***  To offer what would make more sense if I was running this shit:  Martha   Thomas murdered when Bruce is 10.  Bruce returns to Gotham at age 18 after training all over the world. He does the masked vigilante bullshit for about a year, has little luck, is about to give it up when ***BAM!!!*** the bat thing happens and he's inspired. Becomes Batman, a complete badass but inexperienced. Suit is too armored because he's not too good at dodging bullets yet, and he relies too heavily on Alfred and technology to get by. 19-year-old Batman is nothing like the Batman we know and love, but DC sells his stories in the monthly back-in-the-day series called "Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight." These stories are interesting because we see a flawed Batman who doesn't always win his fights, fucks up, fails, and hasn't mentally killed off Bruce Wayne yet. He's still trying to balance Bruce and the bat because he hasn't realized he needs to sacrifice his life to become the hero Gotham needs.  Five years later, Batman is getting insanely good. He's dropped a lot of the tech and armor in favor of lightweight, stealth, ninja shit. He looks more like a ninja than a stealth, militaristic man-tank. Alfred is there when he needs him, but Bruce is much more capable on his own and far less reliant on tech and gear. He's also established now. Criminals fear him and Gordon is with him rather than against him, plus, Gordon has been promoted through the ranks and is now commissioner. The Bat Signal scares the shit out of people and is a hallmark of Gotham. Batman is only 24, but 5 years in, Batman is already the stuff of legend. However, Batman has steadily taken the place of Bruce Wayne. Alfred reminds Bruce of an obligation. He attends Haly's Circus and witnesses the death of 10-year-old Dick Grayson's parents. Relates hard. Epic feels. Takes in kid as ward. Feels bad man.  Over the next year, Dick puts the pieces together. Witnesses Alfred doing his medical shit for Bruce after a bad night. Last shreds of doubt are gone: shitty fake rich dad man is Batman. Dick sees Batman as the means to get revenge on Tony Zucco. Bruce takes him under his wing, trains him, and Robin: The Boy Wonder is born. Batman is 25, Robin is only 11. They are the Dynamic Duo, forming one of the greatest relationships in comics. DC sells the stores of this time period as Robin: The Boy Wonder. Great comic. Such sales. When Dick is 16, they have a falling out. Five years of Batman   Robin comes to an end at Dick goes off to found the original Teen Titans. Batman grows dark as shit without Robin to balance him out. Batman is now 30.   Also noteworthy: the original Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, begins and ends in this time period. When Batgirl first appears, Batman is 26, Robin is 12, and Barbara is 17. Batman disapproves, Robin crushes hard. The three end up making a sensational team. When Batman figures out Batgirl is Barbara Gordon, he's crippled by guilt. Batgirl operates for four years, quitting at 21 only to be shot through the spine by The Joker in a home invasion because The Killing Joke is cannon forever. 30-year-old Batman is mentally broken by this incident, and it drives Dick away. He's losing his shit.  At age 22, Barbara Gordon becomes The Oracle, an essential part of Batman's operation and lending support to Dick's Teen Titans. Batman is now 31. Bruce and Dick speak to each other only through Barbara and are otherwise estranged. Dick is now Nightwing. At age 23, Oracle founds The Birds of Prey, passing on the Batgirl identity to either Cassandra Cain. She also works closely with her best friend and ally The Black Canary, Stephanie Brown AKA: The Spoiler, and Helena Bertinelli AKA: The Huntress. Batman is now 32 and a 15-year-old kid named Tim Drake has figured out his identity.  Tim Drake is obsessed with Batman   Robin. Batgirl, too. He's a boy genius, a black belt, the top student in his school, and has hacking skills second only to Barbara. He wants to be the new Robin, and nothing Bruce says or does as Bruce or Batman will change his mind. Barbara tricks Bruce and Dick into meeting. Bruce eventually reveals the Tim Drake problem, and Dick says he already knows. How? Barbara. Dick surprises Bruce by encouraging him to take the boy under his wing like he did for him because Batman needs a Robin, but it can't be Dick anymore.   Batman has a Robin again. Batman is 33. Tim is 16, the same age Dick was when he left Bruce's side. DC explores these stories in the ongoing Batman   Robin comic as well as Gotham Knights, a book featuring the dream team of Batman, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Oracle, and other Gotham vigilantes inspired by Batman like Huntress, The Spoiler, Catwoman, Batwoman, etc.  You'll notice Jason Todd didn't exist. No one other than Dick   Tim have ever been Robin, and if Damian Wayne is going to be introduced, it hasn't happened yet but could down the line, preferably around the same time Bruce is either about to die or retire so Dick can become Batman and Damian his Robin.  Realistically, Batman either dies in the line of duty before he ever makes it to 40 or retires to be replaced by Dick Grayson either way.  I'm sorry, but you don't just go through sidekicks like dirty laundry. It's ridiculous.               I once had a can of Easy Cheese but no Ritz crackers so...            I'm 33, I want to buy a house, my credit is terrible (599), and I have no savings.   Can I still do this? Is there a zero down option? Where do I even begin?        I'm 33 and I want to buy a house. I'm tired of wasting money on rent. That being said, I've found it impossible to save the kind of money to make a serious down payment. Can I borrow 100% of the cost and accept a higher monthly mortgage?   My wife and I just moved from San Antonio, Texas to Laconia, New Hampshire. We are currently unemployed, just about run out of money, and have no insurance. My daughter is complaining of pretty severe tooth pain, and there's an obvious cavity. What can we do?  ***EDIT***: Thank you all so much for your help! Just to let everyone know--and I appreciate your concern--she has been seen by a dentist and is scheduled for dental work. You people are awesome!   I left NH for two years, came back, and suddenly Molly doesn't exist?   So I have an idea. My wife doing what she does for a living (outreach therapist) gets exposed to all these kids who get flat out rejected by their own families for being gay. Some get kicked out, others are simply made to feel like they're less-than-human, others want to kill themselves upon finding themselves unloved by their own families, etc.  That's all a whole lot of bullshit.  So I want to start an orphanage of sorts. Anyone from anywhere in the US finds themselves in one of these shitty situations, they can move into the Jackson Pride: A Sanctuary for LGBT Youth. Until they're 18, they'd have a safe place to stay where they are loved and supported by a staff made up of LGBT and LGBT-friendly people such as myself.  I'd need a shitload of money. It'd have to be grants and charitable donations because I can't see any way to make such a thing profitable. Does anyone have the first clue where to start on a thing like this? This might be my calling.                                                I've tried eBay and Amazon in the past and found that  A.

Before anyone corrects me, I'm not claiming this is The Great Gatsby: A Phantom Menace. But...  Aside from names, it's basically what logically happens before The Great Gatsby.   Jay Gatsby is Dexter.   Comes from middle class family. Father owns the second-best grocery store in town.  Aspires to be part of the old money, upper crust elite.  Meets Judy/Daisy.  Loves her. Loses her because she's old money elite; he's not.   Couple of affairs.  Loser in love. Goes to war as we know Gatsby did. Never forgets her.  He returns. Gets filthy rich. Success. Still loves Judy/Daisy. Finds out from a friend that she's married now and the guy is a dick. Name is Joe Simms but he sounds an awful lot like Tom Buchanan. He cheats on her just like Tom. She doesn't cheat. She stays home with the kids.  He's still alive at the end and very much contemplating the Judy/Daisy situation.

Additional cast featuring Alfred, Lucius Fox, Commissioner Gordon, Rene Montoya, Detective Alvarez, Harvey Bullock, Harvey Dent, Maggie Sawyer, Leslie Thompkins, and Vicki Vale.  You don't have to get all detailed about each character's origins or how they ended up where they are, and it'd be largely based on Morrison's "Batman, Inc." run, which means it involves Talia's all-out assault on Gotham, a call to arms of all Batman's allies, Bruce Wayne is out as Batman's financial backer, Damian dies, and there's a fuckload of cameos.

There's actually quite a bit of evidence to support it, just as there is to support the queer reading of Nick.  Gatsby is described by Nick, "his tanned skin" and "short hair look as though it were trimmed every day" (Fitzgerald 50). The short hair and the appearance of daily trimmings could definitely refer to the grooming habits of African American men.  Gatsby's West Egg mansion is on "more than 40 acres of lawn and garden" (Fitzgerald 5), which is specifically interesting, because freed slaves were to be given 40 acres and a mule by decree of Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15. "More than" is stated, but instead of giving us that exact number--it could be 41 acres or 400--but we're given 40. It should be noted that 40 acres and a mule was oft promised, but a promise not always kept and inconsistently applied (Oubre 79). There's an obvious metaphor for a man who feels deserving of something he doesn't get, i.e., Daisy.  Gatsby would be unlikely to achieve the level of success he did in the roaring 20s if he were black, and some of the upper-crust white folk would be likely to notice or take issue with his race, so it's only a plausible theory if he were able to pass himself off as white. There is evidence for this, too. For one, the manner in which he makes his fortune is bootlegging during prohibition, and bootlegging is a sort of counterfeit product. That could be a metaphor as Gatsby is a counterfeit person. He pretends to be someone he's not, he seeks an imagined perfection of a flawed woman, he lies about his past, he's secretive about what he does and his intentions, and being a man of color could be just one more lie he's living. He's even changed his name from Gatz to Gatsby, something more Nordic-sounding.  Gatsby is quite proud of his heroism in Montenegro. Of all the places he could have earned a medal, it's one where the word "negro" is right in the name--negro/black, mont/mountain--and it's mentioned by name seven times immediately like Fitzgerald wanted it to stand out. Also, his valor at Montenegro was immediately proved true by the medal Gatsby carried around. In other words, Gatsby lies, but the "negro" part is the truth.  How do we know he lies? He just told us on the previous page, "I am the son of some wealthy people in the Middle West--all dead now" (Fitzgerald 65). We know for a fact later on that his father remains alive and is far-from-wealthy. Was his family dead, or was he dead to his family on account of his color? "I was brought up in American but educated at Oxford, becaue all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It's a family tradition" (Fitzgerald 65). He's awfully concerned with establishing a European heritage.  But here's the passage that really blew my mind with this reading:          ...a limousine passed us, driven by a white         chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I         laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in         haughty rivalry.          "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought;         "anything at all. . . ."          Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder. (Fitzgerald 69)  First, let's note that this happens as they are crossing Blackwell's island. Again, a geographical location is used that denotes "black."  According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, "Modish" means "Conforming to or following what is currently popular and fashionable." In other words, these are African American men who turned the social paradigm on its head and are being driven by a white chauffeur. In spite of a possible slave heritage, they are able to afford the luxuries of the time, looking at Gatsby, his ride, and his present company with a sense of rivalry. If these black men are able to realize the American dream, surely a man of African descent who can pass for white can achieve this success. Yes, anything is possible, even Gatsby. Even a black Gatsby.  There are smaller clues, too. After Myrtle is struck by a car, the incoherent speech of a man is "M-a-v-r-o----," which is interesting, because "mavro" is Greek for "black."  One the same page, a "pale well-dressed negro" described the car, Gatsby's car, as "big" and "yellow." Now back to the Montenegro thing, which literally means "black mountain," which may describe Gatsby, big and yellow may also describe him as "high yellow" was a term to describe light-skinned blacks, the product of mixed race backgrounds due to the golden skin tone (Dalzell, 2009). He may be a "black mountain" of a man, but he's also "high" like a mountain, but, although technically black, also "yellow."  Is this a meaningless distinction? No. It's not trivial at all. Tom Buchanan is an awful human being, and we're treated to Tom's racist rant:          Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard? . . . Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved. . . Well, these books are all scientific . . . This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things . . . This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and . . . and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. (Fitzgerald 12-13)  How are we supposed to feel about this? Well, Daisy openly mocks him and Nick says he's pathetic. Tom believes that the Nordics are the master race and that it's imperative for him and people like him to keep the colored folk down. Wouldn't there then be great irony on his wife's competing love with a non-Nordic person? A black Gatsby?  It's at least a suspicion on Tom's part when he puts the pieces together and outs his fears:          I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white. (Fitzgerald 130)          "We're all white here," murmured Jordan. (Fitzgerald 130)  Not only does Tom suggest that Gatsby is black, Jordan picks up on it and defends his whiteness! Why else would intermarriage between black and white even be brought up? He may have even suspected this for a long time before, pausing before he includes Daisy as a Nordic in the Goddard rant with a wink and a smile when he lays out the Goddard nonsense. Perhaps he sees her as sullied having had her history with Gatsby.  The trouble is, there's plenty of evidence to suggest that Fitzgerald was both a racist and antisemitic (Blogger.com 2010). That really changes the perspective. That underscores what Fitzgerald's true intentions were in the Goddard passage from the book, actually The Rising Tide of Color: Against White World-Supremacy, by eugenicist Lothrop Stoddard, published in 1920 (Turlish 1973). Fitzgerald was obviously familiar with it. It's even more interesting to note that both Fitzgerald and Stoddard had the same publisher, Scribner. As for the name change, Henry H. Goddard was a famous eugenicist (Thompson 2004). The plot thickens.  It forces one to consider that Gatsby is a cautionary figure, that negro men could be among us, passing themselves off as white, throwing lavish parties, living the lifestyle, wooing our women, acting as elaborate con artists, bootlegging, and involved in all manner of illicit affairs. Maybe that's the real reason he doesn't win in the end. Maybe that's why he's killed, as white men conspire against him. Maybe that's the real reason no one shows up to his funeral.

Run, bike, skateboard, Rollerblade, jog, dance, swim, climb, join a sports team/league, etc.       * Find a schedule that works for you and stick to it. Someone asks you to lunch at 12:30pm on Friday? Nope. That's your scheduled gym time. Take a rain-check.       * Sign up for classes. Exercise doesn't have to mean treadmills, ellipticals, or weights. Try new things, meet new people, and have fun. Try yoga. Try zumba. Try boot camp. Try core training. Try belly dancing and/or pole dancing if you must. Be adventurous.       * Have a run first thing in the morning when you wake up. It'll jolt you to life, give you more energy, almost guarantee you'll make time for a healthy breakfast, and once you're showered, you'll be good to go, probably in a better mood to boot. Go get life.      * Meet a friend at your scheduled gym at scheduled times or activities so you'd feel bad leaving them hanging. Tell that friend to give you a hard time if you skip a day or slack.      * Don't feel like going? Go. Tell yourself you'll phone it in today. Tell yourself you'll take it easy. Showing up is half the battle. Once you're there, you'll probably feel like you might as well get a good workout in if you're there anyway.      * Set realistic goals for yourself. Put them down on paper.   * Skip escalators and stairs, walk or ride your bike if it's not too far, park further away from the grocery store, and find other little ways to work in extra exercise into your daily life.   * Reward yourself for meeting goals/expectations, but not with cake and pies.   Do you prefer one above all others? Do some ethnicities do things or have characteristics that you find sexy or a turn-off? Were you consciously trying to have sex with a variety of races?

Hollywood is missing out on a great opportunity to make a superhero/comic book movie that is completely unlike the rest, and actually use it to satire superhero/comic book movies. It could have plenty of action, but also a lot of comedy, and more bromance than JD   Turk in a season of Scrubs.      A friend posted in our local (San Antonio) Facebook forum asking advice for overcoming writer's block. People seemed to like my response, so I thought I'd share:  You're over-thinking it. Stop. A*** A**** has great advice, but if you're not in the reading mood, don't do that either. Don't do anything, writing especially. If you're a comedian, funny things will come to you. You have a gift for being able to see the comedy in situations people experience every day of their lives, but they either don't see it or make the normal choice not to make a big deal of it. That's YOUR job.  If nothing is coming to you, don't panic. This is a great time to pull out your old jokes. If they're in a notebook, transcribe them to a Word document or otherwise create a document you can organize. Re-read your jokes. Try to approach those jokes from different angles. Figure out a way to connect jokes where some continuity may exist for good transitions. If you need better transitions, write those.  Think of that time some dumb drunk bitch said some dumb drunk bitch thing during your set. Now think of what you wish you had said to her. Maybe it's about her being a dumb drunk bitch. Now you have heckler ammo in your pocket.  Write and re-write your old shit and before you know it, you'll be writing new shit because you just inspired yourself to write and be creative.  If you car won't start, you give it a jump. That's all you need. The car is fucking fine.     My wife and I are happily married and new San Antonio residents as of last year. Our 5th anniversary is this weekend, and I'm hoping to take her out on a hot date. Money is not an issue. I just want it to be memorable.   She's an artist, very into dance, music, or any kind of art, really. It doesn't have to be anything like that, either, just a fun night out on the town.  I haven't lived here long enough to know where to go/what to do. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!   ***Tax exemptions for churches violate the separation of church and state*** enshrined in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: "If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional."  ***A tax exemption is a privilege, not a right.*** Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community, but there is no such provision in the US Constitution.  ***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return.  ***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: "no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused."  ***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): "Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income."  ***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup "faiths,"*** which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that "exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend "seminars." The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a "thriving cult of greed and power" and "a hugely profitable global racket," was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this "saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes."   ***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.  ***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a "megachurch" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.  ***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes "Pulpit Freedom Sunday," encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the "liberal media" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: "I'm going to explain to you what happened Nothing happened."  ***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, whose lavish "megachurches" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year. US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.  ***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, "when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place."   ***The "parsonage exemption" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.

His shoes always stank, and so did his feet. Then I realized, he'd put on socks after he showered in the morning, put on shoes, go about his day, come home, take off the shoes, and leave his socks on. If he went back out, same nasty-ass socks with all that same sweat and bacteria now going back in the same nasty-ass shoes.   Then I realized A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THIS!!!  Fresh socks every time, people, and when you're not wearing shoes, remove socks. Bleach the white ones.   Has anyone used a pet-shipping service they could recommend/trust?                                    **THE BEST**  Batgirl started off weak in my opinion but grew on my quickly.  Batman started strong and stayed strong. It's one of the best books DC publishes.  Batman and _________ (formerly "Batman   Robin") instantly had me hooked, but it's gotten weird since Damian died. Batman has been increasingly more and more out-of-character, but I'm holding out hope it leads somewhere.  Batman Incorporated... you love Grant Morrison or you hate him. I'm glad I toughed it out. It's a slow burn, but it's so worth it.  Earth 2 is one title I wanted to hate from the day they announced it. Turns out I love it and highyl anticipate each issue.  Legends of the Dark Knight is one title I was so happy they brought back in its original non-canonical fuck-all form. Yeah, as a collection of stories, it's inconsistent in art and writing, but when it's on, it's on.  **THE MIDDLE**  Batman Beyond Unlimited has actually been mostly good, but I've stopping collecting simply out of disinterest.  Batwing is one I've wanted to quit repeatedly, and I hated the look of the character from the beginning, but there was always something keeping me. Just as I was about to drop the title, they brought in the new Batwing, who looks fucking amazing, and now I'm curious again. Nicely played, DC.  Batwoman isn't going to be for everyone, and I kept getting confused and frustrated, but it rewards patience, and I still believe it's got the best art/panel layouts in the business.  Talon was actually pretty good, and I gave it a few issues, but I couldn't bring myself to give a shit about the character. He seemed like just another Batman knock-off, and there's plenty. Besides, I was amazed by how shitty he looked. They had so many cool variations of the Talons and that's the design they went with?  **THE WORST**  Ame-Comi Girls intrigued me, but I'm jumping off after the Jade issue. It's pretty stupid.  Batman: Li'l Gotham isn't terrible, and it's really cute, but it's not really my thing.  Batman: The Dark Knight started off awful and continues to be awful as of issue 19. I'm been wanting to jump off since the first shitty issue, but I keep hoping it'll get better. It doesn't.  Birds of Prey started shitty and then seemed to challenge itself to get progressively shittier with every issue. They succeeded. None of their teased plot twists were enough to keep me on board.  Catwoman I almost quit repeatedly, but I got re-invested with the JLA storyline. Kitty is on a short leash.  Detective Comics: I have to stop buying this shitty comic just because of its title. It should be the flagship title of DC (Detective Comics), but it's garbage. It's been confusing, muddled, shitty shit since the first issue.  Justice League, like Detective Comics, should be one of DC's star attractions. Instead, it's a monthly clusterfuck. They couldn't even commit to the core roster, like everyone expected, which includes Cyborg, a character so fucking interesting he doesn't even have his own monthly. Thanks for overcharging for the several pages of Justice League and then Shazam's never-ending origin story stapled to the back. Is he ever actually joining the team and/or getting his own title, or is this basically Justice League/Shazam forever?  Justice League of America, the C-list of the Justice League (assuming International was the B-list) has managed to do jack shit in 3 issues, even requiring other titles for back-story and exposition. Another issue or two and I'll decide if it's worth continuing.  Nightwing is a character I love and I still had to drop this title. It started off shitty, got shittier, improved, and then went right back to shitty. I guess I'll never know what happens in Chicago.  Red Hood   The Outlaws is a title I fully expected to love. I... can't... get... into it. I seem to enjoy Jason more when he appears in other books. He'd probably be better solo.  Suicide Squad is a title I started off enjoying and the cliffhangers kept me buying, but a comic can only insult my intelligence so many times before I give it the boot. Sorry slutty Harley Quinn. I liked you better in the jester costume.  Teen Titans is a title I wanted to love since I grew up a fan of the older Titans teams and enjoyed the anime-style cartoon, but what a shit-pile. I kept hoping it'd get better as it got worse and worse. I quit.  **HAVEN'T READ**  Batman: Arkham Unhinged  Injustice: Gods Among Us  _________________________________  What's yours?

He played harmonica and acordian,made willow crafts, was an acomplished wood worker in the old ways ect, but first and formost he was an American.  if anyone referred to him as a German he would let them know that he worked hard to get here and even harder to learn the language and pass the tests to become a citizen of the USA and he was proud of that.Whatever happened to that way of thinking?

Commenter is obviously from Japan where cat face octopus porn is commonplace.   Well said,few people understand this.   Gotta love The Post!   I hope this is true.   Yup, it works. I also put them in my tool box,furnace coal(not charcoal) will also work.   Hint: Save the silica pacs from med bottles and toss them in that drawer.   This made me laugh! My grandpa was German and his favorite joke was that the word for bra is keepzumphrumphloppin.Which brings me to my point,it's a JOKE fer chrissakes!   Hendrix was a master,I hate this kind of shit.    Top Gear= one of the best shows on TV!    As an American I would call this snooping. show up at 8pm unanounced and see if you can find something to gossip about. Dealt with it before and told people to not be so rude.    Yes I do. The design is perfect for what I use it for. More of a cooks knife than a chef knife.      " Hey chief!" "How ya doin there sport!" and "There he is!"   creature from the black lagoon.   I hate the cesspool of organized religion,but I must give this man credit for leading by example and practicing what he preaches.   Ha ha! I was going to say this and it was the first thing I saw when I went to comments. Well done, you beat me by three minutes!   laughed so hard at this!   dick head.   what kind of "artist" would agree to do this?   Cut throat Island.Hot babe,swashbuckling, epic ship battles, romance,what more could you want?   Kershaw or Buck.   Reposts.   Clean them up and then google their value.Old Case knives are always worth something, probably the Marbles too. Both are worth keeping.   This guy is just another Sharpten media whore,a cigar? ,Really? I agree that racism is alive and well in this country, but when I see this kind of shit it makes my heart sink. If you really care about the issue then adress it intelligently. BTW Zimmerman is some kind of Hispanic and the victem was black.These guys have seperate gangs that hate each other,no whitey involved. In the end it's the money that wins every time.      This man is a patriot.Anyone who thinks our government cares about the common man/woman is deluded. It's all about taking our money and giving it to the corps. Any dissent will be picked up by the nsa and sent into the prison system. So sad.   Two things you should never buy at a gas station: Knives, sushi.   Dying ain't no way to make a living.    Wadaya lookin at? Get to work slackers!   Repair clothes/shoes. Find wild plants to eat.   Hire Pinky and The Brain as consultants.   It's the little video game character standing on her shoulder that makes her hot.   Go to history and find your previous page.   ha ha, good one!   I myself have been predicting all this shit for years, and it's only gonna get worse.No matter who you vote for.   I bow to the master!   ha ha! I died there many times!   Where's Sonic?   brand names.    They do fund NASA in secret,the mission is to beam up all our paychecks to outer space and then use the money to fuck us some more.   Some people go out just to vent their anger on someone. That being said, go to a privatley owned  eatery where the staff are professional.    SHTAAAAP!   My ex would attack like a she-zilla and if I pushed her away it was,"YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME!" Did the same to her son and tried to have him arrested. Some loonys use that poor woman thing to their advantage.   Easy buddy! Not trashin anyones biz or Palatka itself,just a true culture shock story.I didn't name the place and there are alot of bars around there. Had some good friends there and miss alot of things about it, the prices at Millers,take a drive to Hastings and pick up free taters along the road,my friends at the Clock,the river(Georgia sucks!)Palatka song writers,pig races at the fair,tales of the Bardin booger,The Oasis(I got freinds in low places) and so on.But my original post is true,not rumor and not the only story I could have told. It's just how some people were when I lived there.      I lived in Palatka in the late 80's. Was in a bar and noticed there was a drive-up window but no driveway , asked if they were putting one in. "Nah, that's where the the nagers order then they goes n sits in the barn out there."   Hey,nice dress. It would look great crumpled up on my bedroom floor!   smoke a few one hits, watch some South Park and laugh out loud.   My hat goes off to you sir!   Monsanto moth,if it stings you they sue you for venom infringment.   If I find any more I will post them,Thanks for the interest.   Poor Billy Raye!   I love my Shuns,great steel,great looks and no heel,I hate the heel. The handles are also a joy. Would I use my Shuns at work in a super busy 20 seat tourist town diner? ARE YOU CRAZY?! They hang on the wall in their bamboo "Shrine" and I use them for special dishes. I also love my original Pure Komachi set,cheap but very sharp and look nice. I use these daily at home for light duty stuff. My home beater is an old high carbon forged that I had professionally reground. The point being, buy what you like and don't listen to self professed experts,most of them are not experts.If you like it get more,If not,well now ya know. I agree Vics are the best buy and always recomend them to my home use friends but they're not for me. "Far better than Shun for less"? DON"T YOU BELIEVE IT! Those are German brands trying to imitate Shun. As far as the edge holding debate goes,serious Japanese chefs sharpen their knives on a stone EVERY day. The knife I use at work?  A gaudy tv personality signature knife that I bought on a whim and turned out to be perfect for what I need at work. Ha Ha! enjoy your Shuns!   At work we use waitress abrbeviations as joke insults: "Hurry up ya feakin BBmuf!" " Yeah I'm commin Sesbag!"   Just watched this on Netflix and was fascinated. posted the youtube link so everyone can enjoy.      Spot on!   Douk-Douk knives are very nice for the price.   Money   Political influence.   Mall junk   Strap in folks, it's only gonna get worse. Those scum-bags don't even pretend to be working for us anymore.   Only two?   Saw the origanal Lynyrd Skynyrd band back in the day at an amphitheater with a huge lawn for outdoor seating.Security in those days was just some rent-a-cops to keep people from jumping over the fence.this was THE biggest party I have ever been to, probably 16 to 18 thousand people,booze,all the illicit stuff,everyone just having a rowdy good time and Skynrd were spot-on kick-ass JAMMIN! But wait...there's more! They played just about all their stuff except Free bird and Sweet home Alabama and said good-night,crowd is really nuts with encores, lighters,(remember that?) and rebel yells. They come back on and do a short set and finish with Free bird then say good-night again.Crowd is now going nuts again and this goes on for about 1/2 an hour, the stage is dark and people are starting to get ready to leave.A loud voice from the darkness says, "What song is it you wanna hear?"and then,dun dun dada da dun dun dada,and the stage lights up like a Christmas tree.A confederate flag big enough to cover the entire back-stage drops and they launch into Sweet home. I have never seen anything like it, it was raining beer cans, the screaming could drown out a jumbo-jet,just...nuts. One last thing, this was in upstate NY.    There is a theory that the roots mirror the branches.   Rough side with compound for general use,smooth side just as it is for an ultra fine edge.   People are good with a little A-1.   Eddie Haskel,what a douche.   What's red and white on the outside and grey on the inside? Campbells cream of elephant soup. What are the specks between an elephants toes? Slow running pygmies. How many phsyciatrists does it take to change a light bulb? Just one, but it takes a long time and the light bulb must really want to change.   Very nice!   Hobo with a shotgun.

       NSFL   So much more grateful than that damn moose.   Your stupid, I'm right *drops the mic   Just.....because?   That last photo was commitment    It was still a scramble. White didn't have full control, for that hold he would have had to be behind him for it to count, and it wasn't (but almost) a pinning combination, so no takedown.    Coaches discipline, teach, and lead. Captains unify.      That sounds awesome. Great suggestion, man.    My school has a great program with great kids and coaches but this year we just kept loosing on forfeits. Kids at out school kinda think of wrestling as the gross sweaty gay boys wrestling on the ringworm infested mat. Any tips to get more people to try the sport?    /r/poetry  No but seriously, that was beautiful.      BANG BANG! EXPLOSION!    Spoiler Alert!! Gosh!   To add on, it's a way of saying "we can look this stupid and still kick your ass" bad ass. Good job, man!   The wheel      Masterbate, watch porn. I am a man of many talents    CoD Modern Warfare 1       Let your wrestling speak for itself. It sounds like you're ambitious and if you really deserve the spot you'll get it. Don't quit, stick with it and your coach will respond to your dedication.    I have to disagree, Michael Scotch really stole The Office   Username checks out      In 1st grade my older brother convinced me taking a photo of my penis on my mom's camera was a good idea. Of course I did it and years later I found out that later that day as my mom was giving a presentation to the entire school board my indie production came to light.          I understand the message but please no. Suicide is never the answer, ever. It will always get better.   Youtubers don't make money off mobile device views so it is a "boycott" of them in a way.   Your comment Isreal-ly dumb.   *Scumbag Netflix            10/10 would up vote again.

 With the announcement of the OVAs, do you guys think we'll get a season 3 at some point? Producer Masakazu Ogawa said they were taking a "rest" for the time being, but do you think we'll get a season 3? Excited for the OVAs nonetheless. RAGE ON GUNPLA!!!  	1
 Oh, LordyI could write a thesis on this. Does anyone need a ZA thesis for their college final? I got you.  So, to try to distill it down to a bite-sized morsel, I already live in the middle of nowhere, so thats check one: be away from people. I already have enough basic essentials to last me a few months, so thats check two: dont get noticed until things calm down. Yes, I know. Not very action-packed. But hiding in a dark house with the shutters closed is realistically your best bet. Once the initial collapse begins to taper off, then you can get a feel for how things are developing and actually come up with a plan of action for how to proceed. But before that point, theres just too many variables. Everything else would just have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, using my best judgment for the circumstances.    Nicks got questions! Ill do my best.  1. While I dont have any solid story ideas already developed, I fully intend to return to the universe that I created for The Remaining. I think theres just too much going on there and Id love to dive in and address some of the other stuff that's going on, not only in the US, but maybe elsewhere in the world?  2. Actually the rights for the screen adaptation have been secured. They were secured a while back, and to be honest, Im not holding my breath. Hollywood is an amazingly fickle creature, and theres a strong possibility itll never actually be turned into anything on the screen. Id be pretty jacked if it did, though!  3. Did I have a roadmap? Lets see. How I approached The Remaining series was kind of like getting in your car and saying, Okay, Im in New York. I want to get to Los Angeles. I know at some point in time I will have to pass through some Midwestern states, and probably go over some mountains and bodies of water. And then you throw the atlas out the window, dash your GPS device on the curb, and hit the gas, heading in the general direction of west.  4. Fractured. That thing was a sonofabitch. Not only was it the longest one in the series, but it also had a lot of interplay going on, which, prior to that point, I hadnt really gotten into. It took me a while to figure out how to get all those threads to tie together in a way that not only made sense, but was fun to read. All in all, I love how it came out. But I probably tore my hair out the most on that one.  5. Well, without going into too much detail, Im shopping out a book right now called Wolves, and Im writing the first of a three-part series that I.have no idea what Im going to call. Wolves is a work Im really proud of and cant wait to get it out, whether its traditionally published or self-published. It really delves into some of the worst and best parts of humanity.  6. Yes, Id love to get those two short stories out. Ive been planning on starting a blog/website and posting them to there, butIve been procrastinating. Sorry.   7. To aspiring authors, I would say just write. Sit down and write. Write until you have a book. Don't worry about whether it's good or not. Just get it down on paper (or screen). You'd be amazed at the breakthrough of just finishing a book. Then you can worry about whether it's good or not. But first it needs to actually exist.   Yes it does! July 28th.  JL Bourne was a big inspiration for me, actually. Just the fact that he made it from posting these stories on his blog while overseas? I thought that was pretty awesome. And yes, I enjoyed the books too, although I wasn't quite expecting the ending...  	3
 What a waste of water. Sweet slice though.    TRIGGER WARNING   	2
 When should this be implemented? Anyone have an idea? Thanks   Fuck those cross-eyed rice-shitters and everything around them, backwards country, polluting the earth, not giving a shit about the enviroment, other countries, human or animal rights. Disgusting   He really wanted her dead..   I would buy Winrar (the company, not the program) and actually make the trail expire. *insert evil laugh*   Has to be a tie between Runescape when I was younger (the days played, holy shit..) or even worse, War of Legends, spend way more money on that game then I like to admit.  Glad LoL is not addictive in any way. Yeah..      'You know how sometimes your penis gets erect..' NOPE, I'm out!   Would be funnier if it said something along the lines of '420 Blaze errday!!'      I lost it at 'Tze baby tzuniiiiight'   I totally orgasmed all over the place. 3 and a half times..   Our football players are overall pretty bad but they sure try to make a show!(Belgium btw)   Is it just me or are lot of girls that work at fastfood restaurants hot? Over here they're all middle-ages woman or chubbies :(   Upvoted because internet   I have never been so dissapointed   I find this very annyoing 'cause every time I want to E over the wall with ezreal by example, I keep thinking I'm not close enough, thus losing some time (time I might not have)   TIL shyvana counters almost anyone   BEEP BOOP fuck the teemo?   Stuff like this gives us a bad name while we're trying our best to do the opposite. Thank you for showing this   Same here in Belgium, as long as you don't hurt anyone during your attempt.   I think it's safe to say that gonewild would like more, yes   To gonewild for the free karma!   I think of myself as a rational, people-loving humas being but when I see videos like that I can't help myself feeling this urge.. I want those people and people involed dead and honestly, I believe I would kill them myself if I had the chance to. I don't know if this makes me a bad person, perhaps worse then them, but that's just how I feel watching these things.   He's not even inhaling?   Upvote for Biggie                     [here you go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiMHTK15Pik)         Happy holidays to you too, kind sir!         Wow, thank you for this reply. I'll have a shot at it and perhaps keep you guys updated on how I'm doing. Wish me luck!   It's an honest question, since there really aren't any downsides, why would you choose not to do it, especially when the majority of people like it?  Thank you for answering!  Ps: might actually try this myself once, not permanent, just to see how far I make it!                       	46

 I can also add 100 dollars of my own money as well.  I want to be able to record my vocals and some live guitar/bass/drums.  what say you  :)      Saturday while I was on the highway all of a sudden my truck slipped out of gear revving the hell out of my engine. Now, It wont work in D or R. 1st and second still work manually. They kind of go into D and R and feels like it starts to go but not really. It moves a tiny bit. I went and pulled the codes  P0735  P1270  B1600  P0171  None of this looks good. In have had a strange electrical issue for a while. Says door is ajar when its not, engine light go on and off, blinker is sparatic and makes a gritty noise half the time. After all this went down now the blinker works absolutely perfect while it hasn't since I've owned it. Anyone advice on where I should start besides of course bringing it the shop. Im going crazy not knowing and nobody is around until tomorrow.                  I played every day for about 2 years while I was living out in Seattle. I sure miss it. Thought I would check on here to see if anyone was near me to play sometime...and where?         If so, how was the experience?   4 year degree, trade school or whatever.   Any financial aid?   Any tips?  Reason being I am tired of what I've been doing all along. I never went to school and there is no future (that I want) financially in what I currently do.     Along the lines of the ones we did in high school but maybe something that takes into account what we have already done so far.                   I'm talking about a 3 bedroom house with full attic and a shed that i just need to rig for year round heat.   i now only really have late nights etc for the recording.               I'll leave mine in the comments.                   Specifically 11/26/78   Why don't I see usernames on posts when they are links?             Check out the entrance to America's favorite past time. ;)    These guys give out an outrageous amount of fries when you order them.    Next and last clue at 1130   **SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**  It's the city where [these guys formed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe4EK4HSPkI)  Next clue will be coming around 11 am, ensuring anyone who wants or has the time to get in on it...can.               Just shoot us mods a message or make it known in this thread.   This year me and my SO both have parents in the midst of serious health issues whom both reside in separate states far too many miles apart.  Meaning I will be doing a much smaller dinner at home.  Location is Deep River        I can't. What's up with that?    Last week redditgifts sent us mods a message informing us that a user would be posting clues to the secret box in this subreddit, and to keep it a secret.   It somehow ended up in /r/hartford. Nothing against /r/hartford (they are a fine upstanding subreddit) but they have about 8,000 less subscribers.   To ensure that the rest of connecticut gets to partake in this I am doing my own.   **THE SUPER DUPER SECRET SCAVENGER HUNT THING**  To keep it relevant and not lose steam I am having it this Sunday (11/23). Be sure to keep your eyes peeled to /r/connecticut Sunday at around 8AM for the riddles/clues/etc.  The first clue will point towards the general area of the state and the next clue will be given after there is ample time for anyone from any corner of the state to make it to that area...ensuring everyone can get in on it.  I promise the box won't suck.                                                                        Even on the cleanest of settings I'm getting a nasty fuzz .   Almost so much that I don't even read them. It's just become a free ad space for them to promote whatever they are releasing.   In New York releasing a movie/book? Stop by and see Victoria.          I will be using an acoustic guitar, electric bass, electric guitar, drum set and a midi keyboard. I will only be recording solo. I already have  1. Garageband 2. Magellan 3. DM1 4. Funkbox 5. MusicStudio 2 6. Loopy HD  What I am wondering is what should I get for an audio interface and vocal/acoustic guitar mic? Thinking of getting a mixer for the acoustic drum recording. (want to make sure what I get is compatible)  I am going to use my bestbuy credit card to get the interface and mic.   Whats my best bet guys/gals?  Thank you. :)   Anybody found a really good realistic sounding drum app?            Been hearing how horrible this is going to be in the winter. It's 4x4 but that's only good for certain elements.   What is your experience/tips/tricks?  My only other 4x4 experience was with a 97 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo. Otherwise I have owned front wheel drive sedans.   It's from their song Sweet Home Alabama.                   I'm noticing how many people coming into this cancer wing just reek of cigarettes. So many sick looking people. Fuck cigarettes.   Obviously not every person who has cancer is because of smoking or vice versa. It's just what is in my face right now.          Whenever I click a vimeo link it just goes black or kind of freezes.                                  I got free tickets for it. What should I expect? Anyone?            fuck, though. I need my garageband open to record some bad ass shit that wont go anywhere.  not kiding.                  Need to catch up a bit                        Thats right. Give me a tag line and a name. Like this.  1. Crazy shit  2. CriT   The Fuck. Is Wrong With U!      Sitting here in my shed/workshop with a few drinks and a joint. Man, this album is fucking top notch. Been years since I gave it a good spin. It was that time when I could hear Beck starting to get serious with his songwriting, if you  know what I mean.                                           Anyone know what I mean?                     What do I need to make this work? I also have I an maudio fast track.  Thank  you much in advance. :)   What do I need to do to make this work? I've also got an m-audio fast track interface.  Thank you in advance :)   I use and love baconreader for my phone (galaxy s4.) I can't for the life of me figure out how to view my own profile in the iPad version.            Been using Microsoft and Android my entire life (I'm 35). I bought it manly for the use of and easy access to GarageBand. Android doesn't have anything close for me.   I'm new here guys. What do I need to know?   So far the main thing I have an issue with is the keyboard. I'm very used to swift key on my galaxy s4. Gotta say this thing has a very high quality feel.

I have been having smoking dreams in the past week or so. One so vivid that I recall telling people in my dream that I just gave up 11 months. I recall saying it was gross and not finishing it. I didn't even finish it in my dream.   I am on the wagon so I think that's why my dreams have been so much more vivid.   You guys get these dreams even almost a year into no cigarettes?                     I could clean up a 7 computer pretty well. What should I look out to get rid of on this one?         Dude probably looks pissed off while eating lobster as he gets a blow job.             Plan on getting a tablet for just this. Also a mic that works well with this?   Edit: **MULTITRACKING**               I just had a nightmare last night (not something I normally have) that I watched a friend from high school get mauled by a grizzly.   I haven't seen this kid in 20 years. I've never seen a bear in real life.   In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of friends from high school (in high school times) and there happened to be a bunch of bears around. We all notice one that snuck up on us. I bolted for the car and got in along with a few of my other friends. My other friend, Dan didn't make it and I watched him get torn apart by this bear right up against the car.   I woke up as the bear had begun prying/tearing the door apart next to me.   So discouraging. I need to massage the hell out of my calves and up my legs to my butt. My stamina is fine. I was barely winded.    VIN# JTEES43A482008044      Lets hear them. :)                  With all of the advances we have had over the years with computers why are we still using the ump behind the plate?            [Here are my stats](http://www.rundouble.com/user/fb:604245161/E4jLy5cB)  W2D1 was very rewarding and fairly easy. Today was a beast. I may be getting shin splints, I'm not sure. The pain was almost unbearable. Also, all of the other days I felt really good and after each workout and even sometimes got that extra burst of energy. Today afterwards I really hurt, felt exhausted and almost sick to my stomach. What am I doing wrong? I stretch before each workout. Maybe not enough?                  I have for many years claimed he is my favorite musician/songwriter. I was introduced to him through a friend who got some shit from some skater magazine back in early high school. That is where it began.   Long story short...it stuck.  This last show in Providence was the first time I saw him perform in over 10 years. Life just happens. We miss simple things. This performance reminded me to never let them slip by. I don't mean just Beck but any band/musician you are into. Just make it fucking happen.   I had such a blast, enjoyed every minute of the show and just became  even more of a fan of his catalogue.   Side note. I became a musician because of Beck and now that i have settled down and have some stability in my ,life I am slowly gathering equipment again to produce.             Scanning this sub and I'm noticing a lot of complaints.       I just barely made it but I did.    Lets meet up for a drink before or after and do a cheesy /r/beck pic for the sub. Why not, right?      We will be in town for a concert tomorrow night and have a hotel in the city. We want to spend the day at the beach and maybe even sunday late morning as well. I want to know from the locals which is the best for travel between the hotel and the beach. We arent coming from far (next state over) but thought I would ask you guys for the best advice. Thank you much. :)     	198
 Hold my sister, I'm going in!    Ah, the Ole Reddit Truckaroo.   So you're basically saying that the only difference between a creeper and an attractive mate is the money.  Gotcha.   Step 1. Break into your pool  Step 2. Drown  Step 3. Sue  Step 4. ???  Step 5. Profit.  Yep, I thought that one through.    So...like every other day on the Internet then?    Is that Bob Saget?   I usually masturbate in the shower, which still leaves me with at least 2 minutes to shower.     Reading is hard   So am I.   Nah, I usually beat off during the loading screens.    Why are you cooking beer?   Does that mean it just leaks out of your ass?    "Jason Derulo."  -Jason Derulo   Let's say you borrow 100k and end up not paying for it. The company that you borrowed money from would rather get some money than no money, so they sell your 100k debt to a collection agency for 10k.   Now the collection agency "owns" your debt of 100k and can come after you for that amount. Since they only paid 10k for your 100k worth of debt, they may try to offer you a "deal" by saying they will settle with you for 50k.   If you end up paying the 50k, you think you have a good deal and the collection company makes away with a cool 40k profit.   This is how many private loans and credit cards work.

The people telling you that you can sell your car with a blown engine for anything more than a few hundred dollars are deluded or misguided.   Try to get as much from the mechanic as you can and just take his settlement. Don't keep the car to try and sell because it will be more trouble than it's worth.    Not sure, but the word "user base" comes to mind.    Incorrect, the higher perceivable frequencies are more damaging.    No pussy is worth 18 years of child support.

It's when you finish in a girl's mouth and she comes up to give you a kiss. Except she still has jizz in her mouth and spits it back into yours.  Snowballed!  Fucking shit.   You monster!    Are you 5 years old?    I know it probably sucks right now but you have to look at this in perspective with your whole life. You sound like a young guy so you should have many years ahead of you. This event in your life is rather small compared to your whole life.   Learn from this and grow from this. They're not worth your trouble being bitter over this. Think about what you gained: the knowledge that life does go on after a "serious" relationship. You got rid of 2 shitty people in your life.   Chin up man.  You'll be okay.    It's very difficult to "force" genres on anybody. Especially when it's something as subjective as music.  You should try to stay true to music you enjoy or you'll find that you get bored very quickly.   Try building your own following and then try finding some underground promo groups that like dnb.   Hmm, I know exactly what you mean by being cliquey. You just have to put in time and get to know them without actively trying to get a gig with them. Build the relationship first before trying to ask for a gig. It's also difficult if they don't like the genre you play. You might as well go another route if that's the case.   About the cd thing. I find it more effective than telling people to visit your SoundCloud  (or whatever). Because let's face it, how many times have you met a dj that you liked and then remembered to visit there page the next day? Now imagine a dj you don't know asking you to visit their page. You'd probably politely say yes, but never comply. If you hand them a cd with your info on it, they might actually listen to it.   I make the same observations as you. I know a lot of mediocre djs who shamelessly promote themselves online and have managed to garner a decent following. I say shamelessly because their mixes range from awful to decidedly mediocre, yet their audience does not seem to mind, and neither do they. Maybe the audience is not knowledgeable enough to discern the mistakes?  Out of respect for myself and the art of djing, I hesitate to release mixes that contain amateurish mistakes such as trainwrecks, extended periods of off-key mixing,  or uneven eq-ing of tracks.  I'm not any way hating on them. We all have to start somewhere. I like to think that they don't know they are bad because they are ignorant to what "good" is. They don't even know that they don't know.   I think if your goal is to dj to a larger crowd then you have to market yourself. Create an online presence, network with other djs and promoters, attend club events and mingle with the crowd, pass out demo cds. If you are as good as you say you are, naturally you will gain a following because you are offering a superior product compared to the other (worse) djs.    Found dad.    She'll probably break that chair over your back, but yeah...   Too soon, junior.   Big dicks in your ass are bad for your health.    But I do porn   Well thanks for ruining the ending for op  	66
 Depends on what the stock tread depth is.  Some tires only start at 9 or 10.  I thought you shouldn't have more than 2/32nd difference between the front and rears, but you were already beyond that.    i'm sure the service dept can tell you.   Did he fall off a mountain a while back?   I've gone through 2 batteries in 6 years.  For some reason these cars are hard on them.   I remember when it was .59...per gallon!   I've been checking, the Sprint one has been on sale recently, but no mention of the Verizon one   Not on a new Verizon contract you didn't.   Minute physics has a good explanation of this.    Yup, well the sacked Stig that revealed his name in his book. Not the current one   First issue might be a battery going out, 2nd issue might be normal.  These engines have a little clicking sound under normal idle.  You can only hear it when the hood is up usually.     you can lurk for years you know...   Can't help you there.  Depends on how long you want to keep the car. It's 12 years old already, so if you want it for a few more, you can get the $40 and hope it works just as good, or if you want to have it another 12, then you can afford to spend the $80.   Looks like Rockauto.com has some for like $40. http://puu.sh/gF0uB/012c12b57a.png   A BMW is expensive.

Pretty sure piranhas don't eat bones   I do the same thing.  Not only is the clutch getting less work, your brakes last way longer too.  I'm at 65k miles on the factory brakes and they still have a fair bit of pad left   1d6 per 200 lbs x 10 ft of fall distance.  So if the bear weighed 1000 lbs and fell 40 ft, that would be 20d6.  The average damage from that would be 70 hp. (50-90 standard deviation)   ....tell me you're trolling   I'll get N6 for $250... with a new line anyway.  I'm sure it's easily worth that.   This might be good for Wal-Mart Army. "Even Fred Meyer people had a hard time finding any!"   See flair.  Pure city, 15-16 (lowest was 14.5), pure hwy 28 (65mph ave) at best (I got 30 over 100 miles once). so 20-22 mixed most of the time.   In almost all cases, it's cheaper to repair than to buy again.  However, it could be a money pit if you fix one thing, then that makes some other part fail, then you fix that....  Could be a cascading effect, but that's usually on like 25+ year old cars, not 10.   I prefer the coupes over sedans because it feels closer to a 350z than a nicer maxima.   If you have a rebuilt/repaired car, you can forget about recouping your $ in resale value.

Just the normal sound of the motor.   Yeah, it's fine. my 08 sounds the same.  I think it's the lifters or the belts   Q4 2011 = 23% Q4 2012 = 20.9% Q4 2013 = 17.5% Q4 2014 = 19.7%  So it's declining overall the last 4 years, but this year saw a bump with the 6 and 6+, but not to the prior share of 2012 or older.  And that's just q4 results.  If you look at q3, it's around 12%-15% each year.   I haven't seen a car list yet, but next month [Project Cars](http://www.projectcarsgame.com/) should be out.  You could look into that.   yeah, for Q4 2014 it was Android 76.6% iOS 19.7% Windows 2.8% Blackberry 0.4%  and other 0.5%   it's over 10 years old now.

[Literally](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/238/219/71f.png)   You sound like all taxes go to safety net services.    If you make $40k (almost 2x the median) each will use the same amount of federal services. $0 (until you reach social security age)   Well, a lot of the uber rich pay much less in taxes as a percentage of their income.  Sure they might pay a million in taxes every year, but if they make 6.6 million a year on investments, then that's less than someone that makes a $40k salary and has to pay $8000 percentage wise.   Ok cool. We have a friend that works as M$ and he said sometimes it's hard to get promotions or raises due to a lack of a degree   Which ever one you pick, have a franchise lawyer look over the FDD.  I was going to buy an anytime fitness franchise.  I had a great spot and decent lease pricing picked out.  Then I had a lawyer look at it and gave me some good questions to ask.  He also spelled out in plain terms how they will always get their fees even if the business goes under, even if it's through no fault of my own.  There was language in it that said they could put me out of business if certain things happened.  They had no obligation to do anything for me after the doors opened.  A big pitfall for food franchises is that they control who you buy your supplies from...because they own those distribution channels.   If they raise the price of food, then you can't go elsewhere to get a more competitive rate.  Anytime fitness is the same way.  They own the payment processor you use, the security and monitoring equipment companies, the back end software, everything but the actual fitness equipment. If they decide they want more money, there is nothing you can do about it.  And this is coming from the #1 franchise to own right now.  There are stats (I don't have right now) that say that there is only a 1% difference in being successful between a business that is independent and a franchise.    It was on the top of the pile in the garbage can   Unless you have comcast and use a playstation.   It's a joke.    It's a joke?   It might have been me.  The only memory I had in first grade was when I was forced to be paddled in front of the class after lunch because I lied about eating all of my sandwich (I tossed the crusts).  This was 1984 about 30 miles outside of Austin.   While actually working, is there anything weird because you're a female, and have you've heard/seen that it's hard or impossible to progress career without C.S. degree?     You sound like the embodiment of a George Carlin quote. "The rich make all the money, pay none of the taxes. The middle class pays all of the taxes and does all of the work.  The poor are there just to scare the shit out of the middle class.  Keeps them showing up to those 'jobs'. "   While actually working, is there anything weird because you're a female, and have you've heard/seen that it's hard or impossible to progress career without C.S. degree?    Just like Bill O'Reilly thinks that there isn't racism in this country anymore right? Why can't we just move past it?   Thanks for that. Good to see a reply, I was getting worried that there were no woman web devs on this sub   Nope, free. Companies that need web developers sponsor this program and that's where you intern.   you should check out all the other breweries Bend has.  Theres like 15+ of them just in the little town of 100k   There's also an approximately zero percent chance that random fucking people are going to start delivering packages. Has this guy forgotten what supply chains are and the importance of controlling supply chains? DHL are going to use their air fleet to fly packages around the world and will....hand them over to Joe Shlub to deliver them in his Prius? Look at the stink that Uber has caused with the taxi driver's lobby...you'd see governments fall before the delivery giants start allowing randomers to fulfil orders for retailers.

I know in the FAQ there are some links to general answers to these questions, but I'm looking for a particular viewpoint.  My wife has made it to the 2nd round of candidates for an academy that is targeting technically minded women. They take women with little to no experience in web development, and giving them a intensive 7 month course + 5 month internship at local (Seattle) tech companies to be a full stack developer for free.  I'd like to hear more about the industry (local Seattle would be best) to know what she would be getting into? Things like, pay, workload, expected hours/week, ability to still have a personal life/vacations, what kind of corporate BS (I know it's in every industry) you have to wade through, industry specific challenges (outside of actual project challenges), etc. A womans perspective would be ideal. Thanks in advance.   My wife submitted her application and has her interview with them next week. Can you give any more details on the program that aren't readily available and more importantly, what kind of results (job prospects) actually came of this?   Seattle Area code.

Maybe the people at XDA will be able to get it working reliably.     4-6 hours  I'm assuming that's SOT.  Also, is there any way to add Moto Assist to it?  That's a really neat app.   I've been waiting for Verizon to release this phone to get it for $200 instead of $650.  I went to look at one at the AT T store.   It had some nasty burn  in.  I know it's been there on full brightness for 12+ hours a day for months.  Anyone seen this in real world usage?  Also, What is missing from the this phone? The one thing I really like about my wife's Moto X (2013) is the Moto Assist app. The nexus is a Moto phone, so does have or can it get this app?  I'll be coming from a Note 3 (Galaxy Nexus before that) so I'm looking forward to the bigger size, Android 5.1, and similar battery life (I get 3-4 hours of SOT now).  I know people are raving about other kernels and ROMs but I'll look for just basic root and apps that utilize that well.   You can get vented rotors that help with brake fade.  That's the cheapest option. http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-rotors/  You can get "big brake kits" that up the rotor size and caliper piston #.  http://www.stillen.com/products/brake-kits/?varyear=2007 varmake=Infiniti varmodel=G35  Just depends on how big you want to go.  If you do track racing regularly, then you would see a real benefit with the big kits.  Otherwise just the rotors might help a little with "spirited" driving day to day.   Bigger brakes maybe?  Doesn't matter how fast you can go if you can't stop quickly.  If you don't want to go real big HP (supercharging/turbo), then consider an Uprev tune?  Should be able to squeeze more HP out of the current mods and give you a little better throttle response.  I'd only do this after you are done with engine/hp mods.   Unfortunately I'm not a mechanic, I just have a basic understanding of how the car works   Could be a throttle position sensor, or even the ignition switch if the fuel pump is working properly.  Lots of things need to work to keep the engine at idle   yeah, that 83 Bimmer must get you tons of looks....http://www.carpictures.com/pics/full/01G98440117472A/BMW-320i-black-1983-01G98440117472A.jpeg   AFAIK, the x models don't have a manual transmission option...for some stupid reason.   If the roads are plowed, and there aren't many hills...then snow tires + weight will do ok.  Add hills and/or not plowed, it'll be tough/sketchy for sure.   Yeah, I make a bit over 6 figures so what I owe is not a large % of my income.   one of them is an independant consulting gig where I get a 1099 instead of a traditional paycheck.  I should pay quarterly taxes on it, but I'd rather pay the $25 fine at the end of the year and keep all the money until it's time to pay in April.  That way the gov. isn't making interest on my money.   Lol, what's a refund? I owe like $7k every year   Not if the guy doing the trick is good enough at focusing his attention   A congress...Seriously   I don't know what I expected...

There is a big one on Maui too. Also in the north shore part.   Bottom part of the screen under the options to play, rate, save, etc   nothing has a hard date (that we know of) that is leaving.

Get a lawyer   There will be a date on the ticket. You need to plead guilty or not guilty on our before that day.  If you plead not guilty, you'll get a court date.   It all depends your jurisdiction. Some do this, some do traffic school.  Sometimes if the cop doesn't show up to court, the have to let you off. Other times the cops do not have to show and their testimony is filed when the ticket is filled   If you say you were speeding, in any form, you will be found guilty.  You admitted to it. The cop doesn't have to say a word.    Get a lawyer. If they are able to get you off, it'll cost the same as the ticket but won't be on your record to up your insurance for 3+ years.

If I remember right is a way of disposing oil that isn't useful or something like that.    won't improve it, that's for sure.  you might be able to up the price a few grand MAYBE. But mods have a terrible return on investment for resale.   Most of the V8's that you find in the competition's cars are more expensive by a good bit.

 Link for the app: http://bit.ly/1wjijh6 Link for the source code: http://bit.ly/1FgwuNF         I'm building a product based on the Raspberry Pi as the control unit, but I want to modify on the design by removing some components to make it cheaper. Thanks for the link!      It's ideal for rapid prototyping, I'm posting on twitter with only 1 line of code from Arduino, used before in our booth during a big event and the output was amazing.      Hey guys, Amr here from the makers of 1Sheeld, you can chec out a lot of examples by the community on Hackster.io/1Sheeld  Also you can check out some [projects on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/howto/1sheeld/) and let me know if you need anything :)   That's awesome, would you share an instructable after you finish? :)   Okay, what are the cheapest components to assemble it? do you have a good tutorial?         no i don't think it will be relevant to children, especially with the gun part!      This one is also amazing:   https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/barobo/linkbot-create-with-robots        	17
 it's called a peacock, and it's for draining the line after shutting off the water.  Grab a wrench, close the valve, then tighten the cap.   If you need a replacement cap they should sell them at the hardware store.     the cost difference between buying prepared food and actual food is *tremendous*.   Especially if you can piggyback someone's membership to Costco or something like that.  Even junk food like hotdogs is many, many times cheaper.  Good luck !    yeah, this OP.  For the price of a quarter pounder, slurpee and a jamaican beef patty you could probably get a couple *pounds* of fresh produce.   also check out /r/frugal.    Dunno about AU but in the US, there are options for "100% financing".  IIRC however you'll pay a higher rate in addition to paying mortgage insurance (which is just completely wasted money).    Go poke around /r/mortgages a bit ....      back in my day, you'd grab the family lawn mower and start cruising the neighborhood looking for long grass.  Or grab the rake and look for leaves.   These days, seems the equivalent is to put something like "college student looking for small labor gigs, 15$/hr" on Craigslist.     agents are little more than gatekeepers to MLS data.   This was precisely my experience when I bought my house.  The actual humans were useless.    First thing I would do is get a second opinion on the car.      SIESTA   From a PF perspective all I can see is "should I keep the money pit I have or buy a new money pit" .... but without supporting details this q sounds better for a used car sub than for PF.   It's impressive you've saved up 700 bucks on that low of an income, but I think you need more savings.  You're just a car repair or two from being broke and in debt.   Definitely do whatever you need to do to reduce fees. Fees, interest, stuff like that are just a waste of money.    Your rent is more than half your monthly income ... may want to consider trying to reduce that some.       They're pretty awesome, just be sure to start off no bar (seriously) then bar alone.  Definitely don't just stack 'em up and straight leg it;    /r/jobs/   great deal your sister letting you borrow her car.    * you have 5 bills, need another to get the existing hooptie fixed.   * 5 bills won't get you a new car * Sounds like you really truly can't get a car loan.   So Seriously, I'd consider plasma donation, day labor on an off day or any other sort of "I'm in a bind, I need 100 bucks and I need it now" type of thing.    * fix the hooptie with the 600 bucks.  * buy it a nice dinner, talk to it in a soothing calm voice.  * give it reassuring pats on the hood every day * hope like hell that bitch don't break down again.  * stop the concerts and beer.  * save 800 a month or close to it.  * cut grass, do whatever to save up another couple bills a month.  Seriously, go into super overdrive workaholic mode.  * ten months from now - w00t, 8k saved up.  * buy better car.  * keep saving 800 a month.  * didn't even have to ho.     well, with 950 rent and 600 expenses, you should probably still save at least 600 a month, leaving you an extra 850 a month.  That will get you pretty much any car you want, but i still you should check out slightly older wheels.  Remember too that you'll probably end up spending more money in expenses while living on your own, in a new city with new found personal freedoms.  And being so young your income isn't guaranteed (noone's is sadly)... so I'd say more like save 1000 a month, which will still leave you 450 a month for the car...that's probably around 15-18k.   Still more than I paid, and I make many multiples of what you do, but I have a family to support, college to save for, and you don't ... get yourself a 15-18k used Subie, get some good snow tires and have a blast.    yeah bro I dunno ... it's a bind for sure.  How are you getting to work now while the car's in the shop ?   I'd say give up on that car .... it's just the gift that keeps on giving ... to your mechanic.   Got any friends you can lean on ? Looked into carpooling ? If you can just get by for 5 months or so you'll have enough cash saved up for a better bucket.    Are you currently paying rent, or is the 800 just food, gas, entertainment etc that would have to be added to the 800 rent ?   Also, why a 2013 or 2014 ? a 2014 is barely used and won't be discounted much.  I bought a 5 year old AWD for only 13k that was super clean, has been super reliable...    What are your monthly expenses ? Age and financial goals ?    What time frame ?     Define "afford".      Props for buying a used car and literally driving it until the wheels fall off !   Can you get to work on transit now ?  What's the $600 estimate for ? Take it over to a car / mechanic sub and get it checked out over there.   Are you really able to save 800 bucks a month ? (You say you spend 1,200 out of 2k a month).     Loans: Yeah, "car loans bad credit" googles but they look a bit questionable to me.  Have you checked your credit rating recently to learn how bad your credit actually is or isn't ? Also, Credit Unions typically have lower interest rates than commercial banks... with bad credit you'd get a higher rate still, but getting one from a CU may take a bit of the sting off it.      I don't have hardware, but I do have scolios and thoratic kyphosis, and deadlifting has helped my back tremendously.  I am a new lifter, and only dl 35 pounds a side plus the 45 pound bar.  I recently transitioned to "normal" dl's but was doing straight-leg ones which hit my legs and lower back harder.  I may go back to them, because they felt like they helped me stand up straighter than the normal ones do.  Good luck !    As soon as I read "$100" and "trailer park" I swore a robbery was next.   which complex ?    Also, I miss bookstores damnit.  I buy stuff from Amazon all the time, but have rarely bought books from them.  I miss the smell of paper, the feel of it, covers, bindings.  I miss sitting in small little pockets of intellectualism, of research, or just of drawings or biographies and exploring, selecting, carefully choosing which new one to bring home as if they were puppies.    I really do miss bookstores.    The world in general just had a lot more mystique to it... information, photos, communication wasn't instantaneous and global and hearing of what was going on in far away lands, or seeing photos of exotic locales (such as in Nat Geo) was awe inspiring at times.  Now the world gets the same news instantaneously, photographs, videos, around the world are instantly shared and available.    It's really taken a bit of something away from it all for me personally, a bit like learning how magicians do their tricks.     It is ... they probably thought they were dodging laws doing that.   Biting your fingernails would be really, really painful.    Beat me to it.  Ha ! *beat*    Bet they smell pretty similar though .. and guess which one cost 100 dollars and which one cost 10.   Your Mother worked with [Chef] (http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/753/192/b72.jpg) ?!?     Hmm, good point about the bleeder.  There isn't one on the shutoff itself, but there may be one on the step down regulator.     Hmm, good question. I have no idea where the actual meter is, but the shutoff is right before the step down regulator.    the hose bib does have anchor holes, but the mortar joints are pretty soft... definitely don't want to try to anchor it.  Tried elsewhere on the house, didn't work so well.    I lost it at 0:01   Hi everyone,   [This is my main flower/ornamental bed that I want to irrigate.](http://i.imgur.com/YO01nZq.jpg)    There's no real defined plant areas ... not like say a row of veggies where you can put a dripper right by the plant.   Instead we have a huge mix of everything you can think of, with plenty of bulb flower underplanted as well.   Should I try to cover all this with emitters, or would I be better off using something that distributes water further like a tape or some of the mini sprinklers ? I do plan (hope ? ) to use 1/2 and 1/4 poly and not implement a full on old-school sprinkler system.   thanks again everyone !!    The dichotomy here amazes me.   Poor people who are so well versed in jungle survival the dude can reck a giant ass snake with his bare hands while wearing a rag around his waste, yet someone had a fricking digital camera and knew to upload it to LiveLeaks.   Yep, Bitch here too.  Bitch makes me curse, hate the Bitch but I always gotta run the Bitch.    The only thing I've ever really missed on a long trip is prescription medicine, particularly if going overseas.  Pretty much anything else you can buy locally.    Yeah, I guess ... Spotify can also recommend and you can browse various collections, but you aren't restricted to only that.    yeah I believe it :(  especially as this whole area gets denser.    Don't know, I'd presume standard firefighter stuff.   Saw the exact same thing while waiting on my flight a few weeks ago.  Noticed one person staring out the window, I looked, wet myself, called the wife letting her know my plane was going to be very, very late.  Then next thing you know an announcer on the PA told us what was going on.      Hmm, looks like the BWI Fire Department training building's weekly burn test.  Always shocking.    Pandora let's me explicitly pick and choose what I want to play ? I thought all it does is let me build a "channel" of stuff *related* to what I originally asked for.    can't use a sharkbite because it's going to a bibcock (garden spigot) which will spin around when you try to use it (been there, tried that on a different one last year).   when the whole-house shutoff is closed it leaks just enough water to keep the pipe full with slowly rising water.  Definitely had to keep a bowl under it while "repairing" it the first time, and definitely had to dough it.        it may be an anomaly in the reporting.  I saw the same shark tracking a short while ago that had it in the Assateague area bayside.    shit, 34 a dozen would be AWESOME.  I think I was paying like 60 something for enemic "larges" at Nicks' last year.   Pretty much had me daydreaming about a john boat again....    that's just Liberty.  And Triadelphia gives you a card, not a sticker.  You can buy a day pass or seaon passes.  the season passes shot up astronomically a couple years ago though.   Beware too that pulling a trailer, even just a yak trailer, through a tunnel/bridge will pretty much double your tolls.     LoL, 34 a bushel.  I'll take 100 please.   Don't know about iTunes Radio, but Spotify lets you search for, and play, exactly what you want.  As in I can search for a specific song or a specific album, select what I want to play, go back to a song, etc.  It's like having MP3's on your iPod.  Haven't looked at Pandora since getting Spotify.  Used recently Pandora at a friends house for the first time in years, couldn't stand it.    yeah, I dunno, 95 db is still pretty damn loud, and I'm closer to Merriweather than Centennial.  I wouldn't say it was 95 db... but anyhow.  I wasn't calling BS on /u/Kylearean, I was calling it on the new article.    But yeah, I noted it was louder than normal but it was EDM and I dug it.     Got a slow leak - 1 drop every 2 seconds - from a supply line.   I'd rather not resweat it because our house's main shutoff leaks just enough to keep this line full with water, so I'd have to unsolder a large section to get enough access to shove dough in it. unfortunately there's no faucets between the main supply and this one, so there's always a small amount of water coming up through the pipe unless I dough it.   can i just throw some epoxy putty on it ? can't tell if that stuff will work on an active leak or if it will only work on dry pipe.    just feeling lazy, really don't want to have to redo this whole job again for such a super slow leak. well, not lazy, just have a million other things to fix.  it's outside the wall btw, under the sink leading to a bibcock.    thanks y'all.       "Heard" it, sure.  I live in West Running Brook and I heard it too.  And it sounded slightly louder than normal, and I was a bit surprised how late it ran.   But 95 decibals a mile away ? I call BS on that.      Talk about trying to win on a technicality.  400 million, over 1,000 rooms in 2 MILLION square feet, but I challenge you to find a single gold plated toilet seat.   No sir, that would be a *platinum* toilet seat, not a gold toilet seat..     JUST DRINK THE DAMN THING   aw fuck I LoLd.   Craigslist ?    it's by far the most common injury, in the woods or otherwise.   LoL.  Exactly same thing happened to my wife 30 years ago, except it wasn't SnapChat, it was Kodak.  Yeah dude, just laugh it off.    /r/mildlyinfurating for not listing the parts in numerical order.    BUTTHURT   Saved a man's life.  Bleeding out from a severed brachial artery, kept him alive until EMS arrived and helped get the MAST and IV rolling.  No clue who he was, but he definitely would have died on that sidewalk in Silver Spring amidst a gawking crowd if I hadn't been there.  So ... Army Combat Medic training ... it works.    Don't know about nutrition, but they're definitely cheaper and much better tasting IMO.      Now, if you drink more water AND take two motrins ... shiiiiiiit.   Cure cancer.    yep, my app says that basically my last 5k was 34 minutes... just under the 11 minute per mile mark.   So, uhm, I'll just stop talking now ... but seriously, I do routinely run 3.7 (with a serious hill) and I've ran 6 before so I'm getting my distance there ... I'm just slooooow soooooooo slooooowwwww.   thanks ! This equipment is all so cheap that buying a bulk of PC emitters won't really change the budget ... so I'll use a kit for most of it, and PC's for the hill.  Appreciate the advice !!    Nope, perfectly valid comment, and I'm both a newb lifter AND a newb runner, and my 5k time is only 11s.  So yeah, actually 12 pounds to me is nothing, I already carry so much weight and run so slowly.    I disagree.  Certainly having more weight on you will provide a little more resistance, but I hover between 209 and 213 and make constant gains on both my lifting and my runs, and I'm gaining mass in my arms and chest for sure.   I do eat like a cow though, and take a lot of supplemental protein.      cauterization   fucking NSFL that man !!!!    Ah, you mean like [this ? ] (http://i.imgur.com/sXLbeag.png).   Of course, that would be brilliant... thank you !    thanks for your offer to help.  I uploaded a ricidulously crude Paint drawing [here] (http://i.imgur.com/oSzME1h.png)   I've been out for a long time, and sometimes it seems like everything about the Army has changed yet I suspect one thing has stayed the same... if I were back in, my patch would read "Take Two Motrin".      Hello !   I'm planning out a drip system for my yard, and I'm hoping to serve a long flower bed along the fence that's about 100 feet long.  Roughly 50 feet of this is on a steep hill - the hill itself is probably around 20, 25 degrees.   For the sake of simplicity I was planning on running a single 1/2 "main" from the garden spigot along the entire fence line, then 1/4 legs into the beds from there.  Should I be concerned that the pressure along the hill (and the top of it) may be too low and run a seperate 1/2 just for the hill ?    Thank you !    I betcha they get a whole wave of business of folks buying stuff JUST to try out the same day shipping ;)    I would start very vocally complaining about that to not only LaserShip but Amazon as well.  Obviously fast reliable shipping is something Amazon prides themselves on, and I'm sure they wouldn't want to see their new launch tarnished.    TIL: Sorbitol is an alcohol.    ah-ha a very sage caveat.  From the sounds of it, 'unhydrated' wipes don't really exist though, and you know honestly I was probably counting grams (ounces ? ) before really necessary.   Definitely interested in building an alcy stove though ... while I do remember be amazed first by my whisperlite in the early 90s and then by my canister stove, the canister stove and fuel definitely add bulk and weight that I just don't need based on my recent experiences.   thanks again for the warning !     I Lol'd.    They're very frustrating.  However, I remember as a kid having to stand in line at Hecht's for tickets.  Here's a breakdown of [where the money goes] (http://www.wisebread.com/how-much-a-breakdown-of-concert-ticket-prices) and in this post, a commenter also says that [sometimes the talent will sneak additional payments to them into the convenience fees.]  (http://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-usually-an-outrageous-surchage-when-you-purchase-concert-tickets-online).      Yep.       Man, why didn't I think of that- Drone SKEET - develop all sorts of crazy shotgunning skills.   There are some hideous smells in operating rooms, cauterization for one.   That smell stays with you for a very, very long time.    Yeah, baby wipes are the best.  I've used them to clean cookware, bathe as you mention, etc.  Been using  them since my earliest days in the infantry.  I took a couple more than you did, in a ziploc like you mentioned along with some stridex pads in a ziploc... one of them leaked a bit, perhaps  it was the stridex.  I guess I'm better off just doublebagging them than trying to find some replacement for them.    I only climb a couple times a year, but the action is alot of pullup type moves combined with lots of stepping up into position where you're standing on the toes of just one foot.   So lats, bis, traps, calves.  And then the biggie - the one you'll feel first and foremost that will gas out first and leave you hurtin... forearms.  Huge gripping action that I really doubt anyone would develop outside of climbing ... your forerams will be barking for sure.      Give it a try, most gyms allow single-day drop in fees without a membership,and you can rent the gear.    Depending on your goals you may still want to lift separately, and I would definitely do  cardio in addition.   this.  I think they tried to hint at a plot somewhere though... I must have blinked.  as a mindless action movie I enjoyed it, but it was every bit about the over-the-top action freakshow that I remember the original ones to be.   Searching for a new dishwasher myself, thanks for the details.  How is Maytag at actually drying the dishes ?  This is why I want to replace mine ... no matter how long we leave them in, no matter what we do, they come out wet still ...every single time.    avoiding fees as your primary requirement.   Good point.. upvoting.    In my opinion, joining a credit union is one of the most important personal finance decisions you can make.  My credit union offers better rates for cars, mortgage as well as savings and money markets than anything else I've ever found.  It actually even beats other credit unions... I've used commercial banks for a few things over the years, and it always just reminds me of how great my credit union is.  No comparison IMO.    Also, you never heard of credit unions fucking over entire economies, and I'm pretty sure noone in a credit union is making millions of dollars a year... just something else to consider.      Hogan rolled back the bridge and tunnel tolls ? Hooray.  I don't pretend to understand the real economic issues behind it, but watching the B T tolls rise sharply really upset me.    I think it's completely fucking bullshit that we have to wait forever for infrastructure improvements while our taxes continue to climb, and then when we finally get an extra lane or two they want to charge fees on it, and worse, the new trend is ezpass only, forcing you to do business with ezpass agencies and dealing with their bullshit fees and bureaucracy.  I think it's REALLY unfair to poor folks too.          it's really difficult to build a secure authentication system from scratch.  Except not.    Unfucking acceptable. Set it on fire then knock on their door.           nailing your dick to a table  Oh, he was airborne !    You are correct, which is why this is an earnest question.  I could also keep them packed in my bag while in storage at home without worrying about them drying out and having to repack  them, making packing just that much simpler.  Yes, small details, but ultimately getting lighter is about paying attention to many small weight losses.    Actually neither are just alcohol.  Baby wipes definitely aren't, and the active ingredient in strydex (and similar complexion) wipes is a mild acid.   Otherwise I'd totally just use alcohol; I plan on switching to an alcohol stove soon anyhow, so that would be perfect.    hah, lol, but nope, it's just grunt talk.    Sure enough, I just verified that I can buy stuff and have it shipped same day for orders over  35 dollars.  it's increasingly difficult to justify the expense and poor product selection of brick and mortars.    Don't fear the Reaper.   (Seriously,  you had to expect this at some point)   that's some fine sweating man.  reminds me of how I spent pretty much every weekend last year ...so glad to have finished that bathroom.   Yep, I'm serious here.  I always take acne wipes (like stridex pads) and baby wipes into the field.  Always. Whether as a grunt in exotic locales, or doing an overnight in a state park.   On my last trip they leaked a bit, and combined they were several ounces.   So, in all seriousness, everyone every heard of baby wipes or acne wipes that come dry as in "just add water" ?       His name alone has made me laugh since I was 12.    heavy and bulky is relative.   I absolutely consider them to be both.  Those fuel canisters certainly weight a good bit, and you cant take along just what you need (unless you have a partially empty canister).  unlike alchol, where you can, say, measure out exactly what you need for two cups o joe.  But then, this isn't /r/ultralight.    I did a couple days recently  Brought plenty of mountain houses, and big ole boiler like you're describing.  Used it exactly twice.  Realized the only hot thing I care about when humping is hot coffee in the morning, and I can take my time with that.   When I started off I thought I'd be cooking all these phat meals, having 3, hell maybe 4 meals a day, living it up.  Turns out when I'm humping all day my body really doesn't want to eat, and I ended up eating more no-heat protein (jerky, tuna) than anything else.  Still have to have my morning coffee but I can do that with a really lightweight, small alcohol stove instead.     Those [survivalist folks] (http://offgridsurvival.com/mres/)   apparently put a lot of consideration into buying MRE's. Personally I'd just buy a few off Amazon and call it a day.    Your relatives are going to hate you by the way.    NSFL   Hmm, 50/50 cotton poly. Not sure how well they would burn, which would be exactly my only use for them.     promotion worthiness to deciding if you're going to chaptered out or denied reenlistment. I intend to put in a Warrant Officer packet. In my packet, I have to hand in my last 3 NCOERs.        Hope that helps. Anyone else feel free to correct anything i may have missed.

 Do you have a recommendation for an app then? Tasker seems good for the automation I need like automatically turning on mobile hotspot and such? Standing by...         Of course there was an unannounced fourth stop, there needs to be some sort of cameras installed along all of the road ways as a back stop for evidence. Business Camera's don't seem to work to well. In Russia all vehicles come with dash cams.      Yup I saw that, what a jokster.   Kudos to them for all of the hard work. It doesn't look easy by the way.    Seriously what is their problem?    I've actually have been surprised with all of the tales. I actually get 100 MBs where I reside it's great.    It was only a matter of time, he deserves it. People need to stop with the crab jokes.    I tried this app and its great.    Is there a free APK?   Do you have instructions?   I would have to go with Ugly Betty.    Garmin Connect and Strava.          I would suggest those of you that are heavy users purchase this battery. Stand by time is easily 1 day and 16 hours plus. Screen time varies between 10 and 12 hours of heavy usage. The battery is pricey at $60 dollars but totally worth it.                                                            Price Match?

Immunity challenge: Each castaway held onto a rope handle attached to 25% of their body weight as of the beginning of the game.

At Tribal Council, Shirin told everyone that getting rid of her would be a bad idea and that they should get rid of Tyler.

On the reward trip, Carolyn, Tyler, and Will did their best to make sure Dan stayed loyal to them. Immunity challenge: Each castaway held onto a rope handle attached to 25% of their body weight as of the beginning of the game. If the rope unspooled and the weight dropped, a bucket of water dropped on the castaway's head and they were eliminated; the last man and woman remaining won immunity. Carolyn and Mike outlasted Shirin and Rodney to win immunity, again thwarting the majority alliance's plans. Though the majority alliance targeted Shirin, she lobbied Dan and Sierra to take out Tyler. Tyler searched through Dan's bag and discovered his extra vote advantage. Mike attempted to realign with Dan, his former closest ally, but was unsuccessful, and Mike considered playing his idol on Shirin. At Tribal Council, Shirin told everyone that getting rid of her would be a bad idea and that they should get rid of Tyler. Right before the vote, Mike unveiled his hidden immunity idol and gave it to Shirin, and claimed that Shirin was going to vote for Tyler and he was going to vote for another member of the dominant alliance, and told the other members of the alliance to vote for Tyler to ensure their safety. Ultimately, Mike did not play the idol for Shirin, but the dominant alliance called his bluff and Shirin was voted out, though Tyler and Will voted against Dan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_Worlds_Apart#11)   Ponderos is more exciting than the game right now.

Music files are still accessible because people still buy music files. Go use Microsoft MUSIC   you'll see that it's poorly implemented though...  WMC from Win 7  Win 8 was nerfed. It's hammerheaded to use now that I've upgraded.   WMC that was initially on 360   the WMC after the last update is shotty.   - It's one of the only apps not pinnable to homescreen (actively made difficult to access).  - Never appears in recent apps (again, so it's not convenient to use).   The scope of their business is not limited to other computer OSs. Now, that they are in the Digital Rights business, I stand by my ground that they actively are avoiding this feature.   So, no, I don't they are 'working' on making the XBOX One able to pull media files from a PC/Network. They are 'working' on going out of their way to avoid it. The reason we don't have it isn't because the people at Redmond can't get it to work yet... It could be done fairly easy.     Yes, I think they will eventually release it (read: begrudgingly). it will be because they have to due to pressure from fan base (thanks to threads like this) or else it's a feature all their competitors have, so they will as well.    jeebus, please have Anniversary DLC maps: we'll pay good moneys   Beaver Creek, Headlong, Terminal...

Sure it wasn't aliens?    define: "attacked"    While that stat maybe true, they are punishing the 5% who have legit video files. Kids record files everyday on their phone.   MSFT is forgetting their PC roots   too busy focusing on digital rights (  poorly executing that).   EDIT: some jackass doesn't know what the downvote button is for (it's for replies that don't add to conversation, not to be used if you disagree)   they're not working on it. it was on the 360   they slowly took it away (ended up being worse)  same as Windows Media Center. MSFT assumes all video files are pirated movies.  They used to be in the PC business, but now they are selling digital rights. They're partnering with studios to sell TV / Movies. Except they aren't as cheap or convenient as, say, Amazon.   Media files bought for 360 aren't accessible on the XB1. Other vendors sell digital rights for the lifetime of the user   on every platform for future generations. MSFT will have to make some changes if they are to survive this.   MSFT is actively preventing this. They market the Xbox One as THE media center but it can't even pull files from a PC/Network...   The fact that Sony doesn't is reason enough for MSFT to implement this... show some initiative MSFT!   not every video file is a pirated movie.    for starters, MSFT was initially perceived as a monopoly before they had any real competition. have huge success   you draw out the haters...   MSFT has opportunity after opportunity to do the right thing, but they usually balk. they make a bonehead decision   then their competitors do the right thing,   suddenly MSFT is on board. they 'see the light'   EX: digital rights. People who bought items for their 360 don't have access to them on the XB1. Most other companies offer digital rights for a lifetime per user. They also offer that license across all their platforms   future generations... You're seeing MSFT starting to change this strategy (like they usually do)  Also, you don't see MSFT being as innovative as expected. They allow other companies to take the risk with the early adopters, but then they swoop in with their service.  I'm not a fan of Apple. They make their apps (quicktime, iTunes) intentionally run shitty on PCs. People blame the PC (MSFT, Windows) but it's usually the apps they choose to install being poorly designed / supported. (IE is a crappy browser compared to others).   Speaking of, Apple people (read: cult) talk about how great the experience is, how well it runs, but Apple users are limited to what they can install. PC users have more freedom. If they don't install crap apps, they'd find windows isn't bad as an OS.   Apple uses propitiatory hardware   jack up the prices. You can get a PC laptop waaay cheaper than an apple laptop. Apple cables are expensive.    I think iTunes is crap. They offer DRM riddled files. Opt for the files without the DRM into it   they charge you more?   Zune was far superior to iPod. People still laugh when I give them a ride...      best commercial for ISPs ever   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ilMx7k7mso   If you are running Vista or XP, odds are that Windows 9 won't run well on that ancient computer. If this is some marketing ploy, the slow performance isn't much of a game changer. Also, odds are they don't know how to install new OSs or else they'd done it by now... only non-techies are running those OSs.   If you are going to reward anyone, how about those who have supported MSFT more frequently? Incentive to remain loyal customers...   Assuming this is true, why do companies offer deals to new customers   screw over existing ones? Grow a reputation of taking care of your customers is the best sway to get new ones   retain the old...   Hello,  I ran across your posts about this job opportunity.

 I can't think of a single instance in my entire life where I wouldn't notice an extra 35k.    You think it's illegal to sell what you see as unhealthy foods? Cause I'm not seeing that anywhere in your links.    If I were the company I wouldn't agree to that in a million years.    is a single anonymous phone call grounds for a warrant in a case like this?  Probably not in most cases, no.   In the event that you're not trolling, which I seriously doubt, stop posting about this and listen to your attorney.  He is the only one you should be communicating with about this.  Don't update any further.    And the argument that nobody agrees is hardly an argument.  If you have a group of experts that think you're wrong, that's an excellent argument.   PMs are frowned on here.    He would what, take your name and what?  *Even if you are released he can ascertain your age later and cite you at that time.*   Pretty sure that guy was being sarcastic.  Accusations of rape where no rape occurred are exceedingly rare.  Only have sex with people you trust and you'll be fine.   There is no requirement that any counselor treat any particular patient.  They are free to refuse.  If you truly want counseling, you should seek an different individual.   If they suspect you of being underage they can also determine your age.  Additionally, your "true full name" can be checked in any one of numerous databases to confirm your age.  Even if they let you go after getting your name you can expect a citation in the mail after they confirm your name.   You know they're free, why not take a shot?!   No, it would not.  They can absolutely detain you until they confirm your identity.    It is impossible to act on rules that have not yet been defined.  And yet the reasonable person standard has been used in the law since the 1800's and we all manage to get by just fine.   I'm just curious what specific principles of family law make the ethics of divorce lawyers so questionable.  I'm unaware of any study or other evidence that shows that family law attorneys have a higher incidence of ethical complaints than attorneys that specialize in other areas.   I've hired lawyers to do routine things three times in my life. Every time I end up angry at cost overruns and feeling nickle-and-dimed.  Maybe it's you.  In all three cases, the final costs have exceeded the lawyers' own original estimates by a factor of 2-3, even though none of the tasks had any surprises that might explain additional costs.  In your opinion.  Evidently the work was more complicated than either side thought.  I mean, seriously? $27.55? It took you twenty seconds to compose that and your secretary could have done it.  Lawyers charge for their time in 6 minute increments.  You should not expect to get any free work from your attorney at any time.  In the end if you feel overcharged your state likely has a procedure to dispute a fee.   Okay, so you have car insurance.  Have you contacted them?   "if you give me all your weed or something I'll let you go". And if you do give it to them, are they then allowed to still arrest you if they want?(MO)  Yes, police officers are not required to tell you the truth.   You're required to have car insurance in Nebraska.  And if you have a mortgage you're almost certainly guaranteed to have home owners insurance.    I'm a musician, a playwright (if I gave you my read name, you could see), and an actor. I understand art. I live art on a day-to-day basis. I can appreciate all types of art.   You certainly appear to appreciate yourself.   Not yet! Eagerly checking my inbox now!   I've heard that I could appear in court and try to get a plea w/ the prosecutor to negotiate it down.  A good idea.  If that does not work, then I should ask for a continuance and then lawyer up.   Please don't say "lawyer up."  If you want the best chance for a positive outcome, you should retain an attorney.   You can't pay a fee to "clear off points."  If you have previous points on your record they are still there and there's no fee you can pay the prosecutor to remove old points.   What likely happened is that you were charged with a violation that would have included points had you been found guilty. Instead the prosecutor amended the violation to unsafe driving which is a high fine but no points.    He may have lost the opportunity to do so by not giving the information he was ordered to.    The court ordered him to give evidence.   He hasn't yet.   She never asked for specific punishments so the court isn't ordering any yet.   The court will decide what sanctions later, maybe but not limited to either prohibiting any evidence refuting what she says his earnings are or prohibiting him from introducing any information found on the evidence he hasn't given her yet.    They are not medical doctors and do not go to medical school. You want to see an actual doctor.    ***Public*** contracts may not last that long.   BUSINESS IS DAMN SURE PICKIN UP!   This is not nearly everyone's experience. It's not an easy job but lots of lawyers are satisfied with their career.     Also, the trust possess more than a stamp. It also possess a Title II firearm.   ??   Any other way the neighbors can get to their house or garage?   Not much help you can get without at least giving your state.   What is your question?   How do you know that?   Obviously wave his magic lawyer wand and make everything go away.  Did you not get your wand at graduation??   It's very possible that the list of email addresses is considered public information and that a campaign can obtain it pretty easily with a records request.   Your chances of being accused of rape are minuscule. Just live your life like a normal person, don't illegally record people having sex with you, and only have sex with those you trust. Reddit likes to build up the "epidemic" of rape accusations. It isn't real. Relax. It won't happen.    What do you mean by legal leads?   You're using big words but in the end you're both just kids. You can offer no counsel to him that would be worthwhile. He needs an attorney if he's going to have the best possible outcome.    Yep. Municipal prosecutor and criminal defense (in counties other than those where the towns I prosecute in are located.).   I'm an attorney. I do both criminal defense and prosecution, I seen that video many times. I agree with it, but my answer still stands.    Assuming there were any legitimate reason to prove which child was older, your take into account the differences in time zones. The child born first is still older. You asked here, so legally speaking a judge would say that a child born first is born first no matter the time zone.    Is it worth 1.10 to make it go away?   And a judge would hold you in contempt unless your concern was reasonable. Just saying well there's a lot of laws does not make it reasonable.     'll be totally honest that's not a helpful answer.   Yes, it is.  The fact that it isn't what you wanted to hear does not make it any less helpful.   If you want it done right, you should see an attorney.  These programs are created for the widest possible audience and are unable to tailor to specific individuals.      16 year olds cannot vote, and also have many restrictions put on them regarding their ability to contract. Are 16 year olds currently oppressed?  No.  16 year olds eventually become 18 year olds.  There has to be a line somewhere between letting children and adults vote.  Children cannot vote because they are young.  They will eventually, by completely natural processes, be old enough.  A woman in the 19th century could not eventually become a man.   Yes, of course.  Attorneys have to charge for their services.  It's how they make money and stay in business.  Most people would never think of calling a plumber or an electrician and asking them to come and ply their trade free of charge.  Attorneys are no different.  In many states there may be some requirement to perform pro bono services, but you should not expect to approach a law firm and say, hey, can you do this legal work for free? and get a lot of positive responses.   Start with a letter, I suppose.  Just know that an attorney's time is very valuable and most people who seek a pro bono attorney won't find one.    I am seeking advice from anyone familiar with NJ and the municipal court system here. Is it appropriate to attempt to contact the county DA/ADA in advance of the hearing to try to plead?  No.  Wait until the court date.  If I go to court, pleading not guilty to the charges on the citation, and the municipal prosecutor refuses to offer a plea bargain, am I then able to seek a continuance from the municipal court judge to seek legal counsel?   You will go to court and get in a line to speak with the prosecutor.  The prosecutor may or may not offer you a deal.  The deal will almost certainly still involve pleading guilty to speeding at a lower rate, perhaps 14 over.  If you are unhappy with the deal, or are not offered a deal, you can request a postponement to obtain an attorney.   Obviously this is a false flag filled with crisis actors funded by the Jews on behalf of their reptilian allies in order to destabilize Bitcoin so that true freedom will never occur in our time. These are known truths.    No. Only the assailant is liable for assault.    I understand that I am ultimately responsible for understanding my insurance  That should answer your questions. You got the procedure done. You owe the money.    This is a fairly silly hypothetical that has little basis in reality. It's difficult to answer questions like these because they almost certainly would never happen or would never be an issue.    You will not got any other advice here expect do not break the law.    I suggest you stop giving stupid advice.    When this happened to my mother this morning she decided to take a card that was rudely discarded on another vehicle.   I'm having a hard time deciphering what this means.    She can try to fight the ticket but a retired police officer cannot represent her. Only a lawyer can.   Keep your insuranc company notified of any developments. They will investigate the accident and injuries and will provide you with an attorney if you get sued.    As a NJ muni prosecutor I can tell you there's no chance I would give someone going 30 over unsafe driving. If his history is good I might drop the speed down but going that fast makes you a menace.    will this be acceptable to be good enough for a drop?  Not even close.     So even though I can prove I had at least five cars lengths between me and the car, "following too closely" still applies because I didn't see traffic stopped and hit them?  Yes.  Since you hit the car in front of you, you were clearly too close to stop in time.   If you defend yourself, you do not have to be a licensed attorney, but you are expected to know many of the things a licensed attorney would know.   I would be shocked if you had the option for a jury trial in a traffic ticket case, but I suppose it's possible.  If you go to trial and lose, you will face court costs.  The prosecutor is correct in that you will need to know all the procedural rules that an attorney would know if you seek to represent yourself.     showed that Target was negligent in securing their information? I don't have any proof, but that doesn't mean I can't stir some shit up.  The purpose of the law is make people whole again and right wrongs, not to "stir shit up."   Sounds like you're either trolling or paranoid.  If neither of those are true, barricading yourself into your apartment will not help you.  Neither will running.  If the police do enter your apartment, do not answer any questions.  If you're placed under arrest you'll need an attorney as soon as possible.   You don't fill out a W2.  Your work *gives* you a W2 to show you how much money you've made and what you've paid in taxes so that you can file, by April 15, your taxes with the IRS/state.  It sounds like your friends is trying to have a little fun at your expense.   I understand I broke the mirror and should pay for it.  So do that.    You will be paying a big chunk of what you get to an attorney.   This is entirely untrue.  Attorneys are limited to what they can collect, and in most states it's 1/3.  I've had clients come in after trying to work with insurance and there's not once instance where I didn't get them more money, even after taking 1/3, than they were being offered by insurance before.  Without an attorney the insurance company has no incentive to bargain with you.    I was about to say, "and you're a LAWYER?", but you're not, and that makes more sense.  I am a lawyer.  You owe them for the two classes you signed up for.    You can do a lot better for about $10.  It honest to goodness boggles my mind that people think no one could possibly disagree with their opinion.    There are things on my computer that could potentially be used against me  Sounds like you've done illegal things, unless I misunderstood you.    There is no course of action that will improve your situation. Listen to your attorney. Buy a new computer. Don't use the new one for illegal activities.    You need your own attorney.  Don't discuss this case with anyone other than your attorney.  Don't speak with the authorities again under any circumstances unless your attorney is with you.    She just doesn't want to pay it.   Take a guess on how successful that's going to be.    the only way you could get out of it is if you proved that during the time of conception, you could not have had sex with her. For example, you were in jail, in a coma, or out of the country with lots of witnesses.   This still would not get you out of it.  	75
 I always wonder what makes the pervert agree to appearing on TV.  Sure they are predators, but me personally? I'd never agree to it being on national TV. What is the incentive?     Chroma stopped working on my N6 (international) two updates ago. Doesn't even get past the black Google logo. Went AOSiP and haven't regret it one bit.   125K voats. I guess we're uninterested.    And on the 7th day God created the Dutch?  Not too sure about the Irish though. Didn't that Butcher dude from Gangs of New York have something to say about that?    Ubertool is the proof you don't need to be able to draw to be absolutely hilarious.    That is a festival. That mud is not made by rain. Well,  maybe "rain". You know what I mean.    100K votes on change.com.   50000 more and Obama will tell us it is not his job to interfere with corporate affairs!    Well,  at least one part of your username is factual.    This hits a little bit close to home...      I'd say that cost about 1000$ per year.    A good propaganda officer is all an evil dictator needs.  After Reddit a certain person could fly straight to Pyongyang and have a fancy products job for a certain friend.    Nearly every chick on YouTube has this retard syndrome. It probably sells,  but it turns me off completely.    I was auditing a steel forging plant in Bangladesh.  Guys on the work floor in fucking flipflops.    How to be successful on Youtube:  1. Pick popular topic 2. Pick something easy to do (Get stick of cheese, roll in meat, fry). 3. Pretend you are borderline retarded and hope it comes across as quirky.   Ellen Pao is not exactly known for her honesty.    Obviously.    Seems like they missed both QA and the final polishing step. I'd contact them to have them resolve it.  Or get some buffing pads and buff away.   Well, that escalated quickly.   Firstly my "college level education"  is an MBA from HEC in Paris. Secondly I have to deal with C-Level management on a daily basis. C-Level management is very often involved in top level hiring and firing. I work for a F500 company and you better believe that our local managers are directly appointed by C-Level. Reddit is tiny as it can be and none of these decisions are made without C-Level involved.    Oh wow, aren't you delusional.   If I start a company with 1 other employee. I will be CEO.  Reddit is pretty small FTE wise and an employee with the title "Director of Talent" will most definitely be fired by someone at board level. This ain't kindergarten son, know your shit.    ADMINS: They embrace her like he's one of their own.     MODS: The mob is fickle brother. She'll be forgotten in a month.     ADMINS: No, much sooner than that. It has been arranged.   - Freely after the movie Gladiator   You rock! Subscribed to your channel.    BBQ Ribs. Some soy (tbsp per 2 lbs  5g net carbs), honey (1 tbsp per 2 lbs  10g of net carbs). Smoked paprika, garlic and a smidgen of cumin. If you're feeling naughty, 1 tbsp of liquid smoke.  Total carbs under 10 grams per lbs of ready product (most of it will drain off or burn off).  Let it marinate. And then either in the slow cooker or on the bbq for quite a bit of time. Awesome. Next to no carbs, still a sweet taste.   I'm having a bit of second thoughts about those carrots and peas. Peas are pretty carb heavy.    Sold out to Chairwoman Pao.   Bernard Maddof.   Pao has a history of fucking over other professional women in oder to get ahead. This surprises me the least.  Pao is the typical feminist, equality for all, superiority for me!   Ah yes. A hostile takeover. I'm sure that will go over well.   No problems. If you are ever in Frankfurt, drop me a line and I'll buy you a raw pork sandwich.   It can be, but doesn't have to be. Both variants are available. I have the smoked one in my fridge now, it's damn tasty.   Neither do I. But I do believe in "What goes around comes around".   Same here, paid by the firm. It was more than my net salary at the time...   Great Leader is allegedly also an investor. However I cannot find any real sources on this.   You are now Politburo leader of /r/latvia.   Yes, without much of a worry. Can you do the same in OSX?   No. No we do not. This is NOT something I ever want to see. I would rather have /r/watchpeopledie on default than ever see a post of Pao naked.   Gotta bail buddy out!   Requesting a video of Ellen Pao working on a computer. Name it "Artisan craftily destroying websites".   I think you've been living under a rock. Most of their services and products are top notch now.  Surface tablets are incredible. Windows Phone is actually working very well (albeit with a small app store). Holo lens is the same as black magic. XBOne, like it or not, is very good (then again, so is the PS4), Outlook.com works well. OneDrive is better than most alternatives. Office is still king in both home user and corporate environments and works very well next to it being industry standard. On top of that, Windows has been very stable for the past few years and besides thinking that a mobile inspired UI would work on desktops (later fixed) I have very little qualms about it. At least it's more innovative than regurgitating OSX iterations.   Honestly, I am still using either OSX "whatever version is latest because that is what IT put on my desktop" or Windows 7 because that is what is required by my client, so no clue about 8 and 10.   Then again, I am much more proficient in doing stuff in the Windows 7 control settings than in the OSX settings.  Might be preference, who knows, to each their own.   Automatic Lieutenant status.   Equality, freedom of choice, free will, bbq, the list goes on.  Also the kill count on Satan is much lower than that of god.   Ah, I see you have the "1200 euro/month luxury option".  I've lived in inner city Paris (close to La Defence) for 6 months. 430 sqft apartment. 3100 a month. I wish I was joking.   I really, REALLY wish I had a gym like this close by.  All gyms (and I've checked) in a 30 mile radius are McGyms focussing on fat chicks doing Zumba and Spinning and cardio bunnies running for two hours on a thread mill (believe me I live near a near-zero crime rate nature reserve without wild animals and paved roads throughout for runners and cyclists). I want something raw, no bullshit. A place where men and women can workout in peace and camaraderie.     Satan isn't all that bad. Remember, history is written by the victor.    Actually according to Dante the most "terrible" hell is pretty much an ice lake.   Ninth Circle (Treachery)  The ninth and last circle is ringed by classical and Biblical giants, who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery.[55] The giants are standing on a ledge above the ninth circle of Hell,[56] so that from the Malebolge they are visible from the waist up. They include Nimrod, Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy), Briareus, Tityos, and Typhon. The giant Antaeus (being the only giant unbound with chains) lowers Dante and Virgil into the pit that forms the ninth circle of Hell (Canto XXXI).    The traitors are distinguished from the "merely" fraudulent in that their acts involve betraying a special relationship of some kind. There are four concentric zones (or "rounds") of traitors. These rounds correspond, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of liege lords. **In contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery, the traitors are frozen in a lake of ice known as Cocytus, with each group encased in ice to progressively greater depths**.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)#Ninth_Circle_.28Treachery.29  The more you know!  	47
                There's a hell of a lot wrong with his study and the conclusions he draws - the fact that they were all instructed to play as violently as possible but the control group was bowling seems pretty suspect to me.           I'd love to know what people think of this - to me it just sounds like a blood infection waiting to happen            I love that you both explained he was in the wrong place and answered his question!                     Might be worth dropping by /r/aquaponics and seeing what they recommend    Cost-wise, it really depends on where you are - the price of land is they key deciding factor in how much it will cost to grow food in natural sunlight.  What kind of scale are you thinking about? Philips are leading the way in the tech for this sort of thing, so it might be worth [checking out their site](http://www.lighting.philips.com/main/application_areas/horticultural/cityfarming.wpd) for prices etc.   Yeah I never understand this desire - if you want them so much get empty frames, don't envy people who need to wear lenses to function!   Can confirm. Have a permanent, albeit mild, back injury from school trampoline classes.                                                       Ah I see! My apologies   Is this aimed at the article's author? Because I didn't write the article       Ok real talk time: some girls will be put off if you are shorter than them. But plenty won't, and there are plenty of girls in the world who are shorter than you.   You will meet plenty of women in your life who are not remotely bothered about your height. I guarantee it.    Pick something you enjoy doing and dedicate as much free time as you can to mastering it. Read everything you can find on it and seek out tips to make yourself better. Take on small projects related to it, and share the results with relevant communities/subreddits and ask for feedback, then use that to improve.    Get yourself out there - start a blog, post your work to illustration sites and generally build a name for yourself. Find projects looking for illustrators and offer your services - all in all, build yourself a portfolio and make yourself someone people want to illustrate their stuff.   Art school will help you improve your skills, but if you are already good you may find you can build a career without it. But if you don't put yourself out there and build a portfolio, school on its own won't be the answer.   Grades don't matter as much once you graduate from college - your grades reflect on your teachers so of course they are going to stress about it. Try not to let it bother you too much and focus on trying new things and working out what you want from life.   What you study will not define your future, only help you on the path towards it, so focus on picking something you will enjoy studying now and try out different types of work in your summers to help you figure out what you want to pursue later.   You do not have to make a complete decision about what you want to do with your future now. There is always time for you to change your mind.   Get tested - at least then you will know.   Can you teach it to yourself using info online?   I'm sorry to sound like an old woman, but what is swag?   You can always finish your high school degree later.   Is playing soccer what you want to do with your life? If so, you will probably regret it if you don't give it a shot.    I appreciate this is not technically legal, but can you torrent the software you need? There are no marks given for playing by the rules.  Once you get a good job with your degree your parents will most likely shut up - they probably don't understand enough about IT to understand what a potentially valuable degree you are doing.    Don't worry, just try out things that sound like they might suit you and use those experiences to help you think further about it - there is no deadline to deciding and nothing to stop you switching careers later if you decide what you're doing isn't for you.   This notion that you have to pick now and be stuck with it is outdated at best - people will certainly ask you what you want to do, but there is nothing wrong with not having a simple answer. (If you listen to the folks at /r/futurology you stand a good chance of living to 200, so its not like you're short on time to decide!)    Try not to worry and just enjoy it - who knows? Maybe it will last - a friend long-distanced between different continents with a girl he met as a freshman and ended up marrying her. If it does end, you'll deal with it and the experience may even help you forge stronger future relationships.   For now, though, make the most of it and enjoy the time you do get with them.      Go for it! I'm female and travelled solo for 6 months when I was 18/19. Stay sensible and you'll be fine!   What are your thoughts on 3D printed organs?    The weather this week was bloody awful! The tube was packed thanks to all the line closures!                                       Are you well enough to travel? If so it might be worth you taking a trip to somewhere that it is legal to buy (eg Amsterdam) in order to see if it helps                                             You eat meat because it suffers?   "Are there still aboriginals in the wild?" Few years ago now, but I still can't believe a final year anthropology student said this.   Have you been on the London underground? They are part of the heritage   Personally I'm holding out for ghost.   Me too! Although I will miss those rare comedy comments from the drivers.   Plus I'm pretty certain King's Cross will never be as deserted as it is in the video.                      Is anyone suggesting we excavate new underground areas? I can't find any mention of that in the article                        Given how much money some people spend on fertility now, I expect fertility will be one of the faster developments.    I love the way they thought everyone would still be wearing Victorian clothing                  Treat them as equal - don't focus on the fact they are women and don't act like its a boys club. Just encourage them in the same way as you would the boys.       As education increases, people tend to have less children.  This is particularly key - if we give people a basic income but don't improve education it won't have a big impact. I don't think it is the income as DerpyGrooves says, so much as the fact that people's (particularly women's) time is taken up with other things    I was lucky enough to see him in person a while back and was delighted to see that his beard wobbles when he talks.                                                             Me too - its a great article. Thanks for sharing - I couldn't find the link!   My SO had a similar experience when he developed Crohn's Disease - took 4 months with many, many visits to the doctor and one hospital admission before they realised what was up, by which time he had developed severe complications and needed an emergency surgery. If you need treatment and think it may be more severe than the docs are saying, demand blood tests!  	137
       Hey reddit! I am going to get a new computer this summer and I am wondering if a AMD Radeon R7 250X 1GB is good for Minecraft.

 The NY Times recently had an interesting and positive review of this exhibit.   http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/arts/design/yoga-the-art-of-transformation-at-sackler-gallery.html?_r=0   That is a great site -- thanks for posting it.    You probably already tried this, but the Russians have been developing an offshore IT services industry in the U.S. You can find a listing of companies here: http://www.software-russia.com/ Search global.   I'm not going to vouch for this company because I've never used it, but I know a little about it: https://www.workmarket.com/ provides contract labor. Unlike services such as oDesk (which might also be worth checking out if you haven't), Work Market is mostly an on-site provider. It skews toward technology companies, or firms with technology needs.   Your wife sounds like she has a solid background. Best of luck.    St. Stephens Loaves   Fishes sometimes needs weekend help for lunch.   http://loavesandfishesdc.org/   Is the "climate coverage soars" story offering a meaningful statistic?    Using Google Trends, I compare three search terms: "Climate Change", "Global Warming", "Lindsay Lohan".  Which do you think got the most attention in 2013?   http://www.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US q=climate+change,+global+warming,+/m/01pgzn_ date=today+12-m cmpt=q content=1      This isn't about the models anymore. What this is about is risk. If there's even a 10% percent chance that this model is correct, is it worth ignoring and taking comfort in other models that show less of a temperature rise?     New cars will have movie-theater style seats with cup holders, and eight car trains will include a Starbucks car. Not kidding.   The coop fee seems high. My experience with condo fees is if it's elevator building with 24 hour front desk and any type of common amenities, swimming pool/gym, $500 plus will be the rule. At $900+, even counting for taxes, I'd be wondering whether they added in the cost of an elevator upgrade, or some other really costly repair. And, if that's the case, I'd be wondering whether the building has adequate reserve. If the common areas appear a little rundown (rugs as past their prime, painting hasn't been done, wall paper looks old) think twice about a property. There may be bigger issues lurking, such as roof replacement, HVAC upgrades, etc.   Another issue to note: See if the unit owners are putting off repairs as well. For instance, if the windows are long past their prime, that's a building issue even if the owners are assessed the cost.  It tells you that owners aren't willing to eat the cost of the upgrade. Buildings will usually upgrade windows all at once to keep everything uniform.  After serving on a condo board for a few years, my view is any building that lets common area repair and upgrades slip may be badly run and possibly working with an under-funded reserve. An inadequate reserve can also explain the high cost.    End all contact. Provide no information. Move on.    Really good presentation!      Yep about the pizza. If you talk up Connecticut pies out-of-state you risk of being called a "pizza snob." But even the worse pizza in Connecticut* is better than the best pizza in most other places. (There are decent pies to be had in NYC and Mass.)   And you're right about the beauty. It wasn't until I lived in other places that I could really appreciate the landscape of Connecticut, but New England generally.         I got rid of my car several years ago. Immediately saved $1,200 in car insurance. Use a bike a lot.  Offsetting cost is Amtrak, mostly. I spend about $200 a month on train travel. But the same trip by car took a tank of gas, and the tolls up up 95 to NYC are about $30? It's up there.   Even though the car, for a NYC trip, is about half the cost of the train*, driving 95 is crazy, and have had multiple close calls. Now, I just sit back and get work done, read or watch of movie.   I don't think I'll ever own a car again.   *Cost of train to NYC: You can get Amtrak tickets as low as $50 to NYC if you order well in advance. I realize the bus is cheaper but can't stand it.    The tapes have no news value. They don't advance story. All they do is offer color. They didn't need the tapes to know this. They were well aware that the tapes would say absolutely nothing new about the events of that day.   I can understand why AP and others went to court to seek their release. Government, especially on the federal level, is taking an anti-press turn. But Connecticut has had good FOIA protections. I've brought some cases myself when I worked as a journalist in this state.    But in seeking release of the tapes, the news orgs weren't defending any principle. They were just pulling a lever available to them and the judge knew it. He had no way to block the release of the tapes.   This all goes back to the original decision by AP to seek release of the tapes. Was this a mechanical reaction on its part? i.e., 911 tapes are public information as a matter course and should be released? Or were they defending a principle?  I find it hard to believe that AP was defending a principle, since it's been well established that 911 tapes are public.   If AP had not pursued the FOIA, there would have no been harm to FOIA and its underlying principles. There was nothing to protect. Seeking the release of the tapes was a news judgment decision. The news value of the tapes was marginal, and the ill-effects of publishing them are potentially considerable. News organizations make decisions all the time to withhold certain content from their readers because it's disturbing, privacy-invading, so I don't buy the arguments that there was an absolute need to either pursue or publish these tapes.   Without any free press issues to defend, and there clearly was not one in this case, the release of the tapes is more about how the basic decencies in our country are falling away.   All this said, I fully understand that even if AP and mainstream news organizations decided not to seek the tapes, others would have so their release was assured. But we all have to make decisions for ourselves about what we're willing to live with.       $300 million divided by the city's population of 600,000 equals $500 for every man, woman and child in DC.   No problem. I'm sure people will be happy to pay.    It's way, way more than a couple of examples. You need to read through the blog. You'll find hundreds.   Check out their street harassment map. click on the icons  http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/programs/view-the-street-harassment-map/      This was a serious thing created in response to a problem that's probably worse today.   http://www.collectiveactiondc.org/  The fact is that many women in DC are routinely harassed to the point of abuse.     I'm not surprised by this. You ask anyone over 50, regardless of party, if things are different and they'll tell you yes.         Why the word "horrific?" and then an all-is-lost quote?   I gather from this data that the methane emissions have increased in the last year. The colors have moved from yellow to red. That's disturbing, alarming, troubling, certainly interesting, but it is not horrific.   Horrific is a sudden methane release that scrambles the climate and create new peril. (What will we say if there is a sudden methane release: Super-horrible-horrific?)  This must sound like nitpicking, and I'm guilty of being too focused on the language stuff, but I see this all the time in the headlines here and I think it undermines the scientific message. For anyone reading this board, the data alone is scary enough.    You're the winner here.    Great comment, OP. Truly. So, so much of the car vs. bike vs. pedestrian is pure rant, with everyone firm in their position and grievance.   I take it from your comment, as well, that it may not have mattered that the person was on a bike. It could have been a pedestrian, such was the glare.    The new high-rise construction near the beach is a sign of a big disconnect.   These high rises will be temporary housing. I wonder if the pricing will reflect it: Nice place to live for 10, 20 years and that's that.       I'll respectfully disagree with your premise that that china is incapable of genuine innovation. For sure, they aren't building next generation 3-D printers or some new technology, and they haven't yet shaken the IT market. But they are doing everything they need to do to learn, and are building solid foundations. An analysis that discounts their potential may be more Western bias than anything else.    China's innovation push is impressive. In computing alone, they have been building the world's fastest supercomputers. Those systems are using a mix of China-origin parts and U.S. tech, notably the chips. But China is making its own chips and is on path to build high performance systems that are made entirely from Chinese produced tech. This is very impressive, and China may be spending more right now to build the next generation of supercomputers than the US.   I've been very impressed with China and the OP's story, and the comments in it, is very consistent with a policy China outlined years ago. China is going to deliver some impressive tech in due time.       I have so much respect for those Sisters. They are wonderful, loving people.    Why is this being downvoted? It's absolutely true.      We are going to get creamed this winter.   Dodged bullet #1: In August, NOAA updated Atlantic hurricane season outlook predicted that the season "is shaping up to be above normal with the possibility that it could be very active."  Dodged bullet #2: We had a nice summer. According to Capital Weather Gang: "Weve had just five days at 95 or higher  all of those in July. Consider last summer we had a record-tying 28 95+ days. Weve had zero days at 100 or higher. Last summer we had 8."  You don't get to dodge bullet #3.               The headline on Guardian's piece is a little weird. I mean, "found guilty?" It's officious. How about, Conservative media outlets are full of dishonest, intellectually lazy, reporting worms who will sell their souls to keep their masters happy.    You want scary? How about touring Congress?    The L-2 bus, from Adams Morgan to L Street, was light this morning @8:30 a.m.   There were two reporters interviewing people down by the Smithsonian Metro exit. There were hardly any people around.   The national mall is empty.   A double decker tour bus that passed by had few people on it.   Things seems less busy overall, except Connecticut Avenue/K/L streets. Many going to work.       Good for him. Hopefully, the folks at OMB live in DC and want their trash picked up, libraries open, and DMV running.    They have no choice but to defy the government. They need to make clear that DC will protect its citizens. It will collect the trash. It will open its libraries. It will run basic government services that it citizens need and pay for with their own tax dollars. Gray should be willing to go to jail to defend that.       I worked as a daily news reporter for nearly 20 years, and contacting families after a particular death was the worst part of the job. It feels like a horrible invasion, but Washington Post reporter was being accurate when he wrote that people "might be surprised to learn that many people caught in this mayhem actually want to talk to reporters." That's a true statement. People often want to talk about the people they lost, they want others to understand the value that this person brought into the world and the love they shared. It's a affirmation of life. It's the reporter's job to tell the story about what's going on in our shitty world. If the family doesn't want to talk, you respect it and move on. That said, these were the last stories you want to do because it affects you deeply. I've seen fellow writers break down in tears after undertaking these types of stories. It's the last damn story you want to write. When you work as a reporter covering a communnity, you care about that community, the people in it, and you want to chronicle their stories, and let others know what their neighbors are facing. In my mind, this is a noble and difficult pursuit and sometimes misunderstood, but the Post reporter here, I think, handled it well.      	45
 Obama said it was "up to the Iranians to choose their government, but sometimes their governments acts poorly". That was Obama's way of staying away from the Green Revolution controversy but claiming he was taking a stance, That is a joke. Those words had no different impact than if he really would have said "trust your Mullahs" (which he didn't). But explain exactly how Obama's mild lip-service was anything but a tacit support of the status quo in Iran. http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/318891#.T0xSqdSGBFs.facebook   Were you allergic to nuts?   President Obama didn't support the Green Revolution in Iran at all in 2009. He sided with the Mullah's and told the people they should listen to and respect their supreme leaders. That was a blown opportunity.   That picture and headline made me laugh big time.   I demand an explanation.    That's funny you put the nickle there because I was not actually getting it until my brain processed the coin. Very good.  	6

 Most of my experience was satisfiyng my domme sexual fantasies and desires, but there were also other tasks I loved to do, like going to the shop or helping her painting the room. Once she ordered me to write some tale very quickly in the typewriter while she was having a shower. She knew I like to write, so she wanted to make me practise and improve. That was nice.  I'm too lazy to cook. Maybe a domme that forced me to cook, learn more recipes and be more disciplined in my daily life would be great for me.   This is androgyny at its best. Makes me question my heterosexuality. Such a gorgeous human being.   Nice to know. I have been in a couple of dominant relationships. I've been dominant and submissive. Definitely I prefer to be submissive. You feel so great when you please your master! You have him/her in your mind all day long thinking about ways to please him/her, and that fills you with love. I miss that in a certain way.  Also, Honeybee, that's a cute nickname.  Have fun!   Does that collar mean you are into domination?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pcYag8oGik  I wanted you. And I was looking for you. But I couldn't find you. I wanted you. And I was looking for you all day. But I couldn't find you. I couldn't find you.  You're walking. And you don't always realize it, but you're always falling. With each step you fall forward slightly. And then catch yourself from falling. Over and over, you're falling. And then catching yourself from falling. And this is how you can be walking and falling at the same time.   Germans have some word for this, for sure.   Oh, guys, some day I will share with you some pictures, maybe even a video, of the place I work. I work in a big public library. It has some of the most creepy spots I've ever been. Places out of public access. Some huge, long basements where you have to go down all alone, long silent corridors, an attic where the light turns off automatically after a certain time and let's you there in the middle of the almost absolut darkness and silence.   He said something about somebody being absentee. You know who.   And people browsing Reddit and playing LOL and Counter Strike.   Same thing happens with the term Lolita, generated after the book and the movie.   ... and one that actually we don't want to see.   So I guess if I elaborate and tell you I got hurt because of having too much sex, due to friction, and that this happened to me with two different girlfriends, you wont believe me.  Also, actually it's the first time I post in this sub.   They are called webcams   Health reasons. I got a wound in my penis fucking with one of my girlfriends, many years ago. Everytime I fucked, the wound got open and then heal again. So, the foreskin closed very tight and strangled my penis. Everytime I wanted to fuck, I had to pull the skin and open the wound again. It was painful. So I had to cut it off.   I feel guilty, but I laughed at the lightning striking the grave. It's like God himself had something against this poor guy.   Fucking while still having stitches. That's something I have to try. I have masturbated while having stitches in my dick after my circumcision, though. It was painful but also hot. I'm a little bit masochistic.   1. All races are equal. This has been stated by scientist many times.  2. How do you explain poor white people in first world countries? Are they like a special kind of white race people?   I'm not american so i didn't knew about this guy. I'm watching some videos now. Thanks.   Wise words   If you are thinking about killing yourself, maybe it's time to change some things in your life.   Did he fart at 8:43?   No. He is an artist.   There is also some spanking in Adventure Time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9zDtTTRsfE   Maybe listening to his voice will make you feel good. You could phone him now and then or ask him to record special voice messages for you or even an audiobook. Imagine listening to an episode everytime you miss him. Wouldn't it be cool?   http://40.media.tumblr.com/9092a3ae870f6eedf82fa4c94f1aaa7c/tumblr_nil5i9YP2G1qj6ugyo1_500.jpg   I meant he is a little out of tempo in that video.   Now you are being rude. You are taking karma too seriously.   How do you punish your subs when they cum without your permission? Something easy would be giving them a good spanking, but, if they enjoy that, it would be more like a prize. Something humiliating, maybe?   Well, there was that thread with midget clown porn recently. It was deleted but, what was that?

He makes On GP. Very noisy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rd_TZbUYWA   How is that?   Thanks for sharing this. I'm disocovering the pleasure of reading in this subreddit other people's experiences and games.   I'd recommend you these albums:  Lightning Bolt - Wonderful Rainbow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JpHoAnaPK0 (brutal live performance) Techno Animal - Brotherhood of the Bomb  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIZ6G1usPXc  Food for Animals - Belly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnrYHvKq3IA   But where did they get the voice sample?   I don't know the story behind the "Quarantine the virus, god block" line. Where is it from?   You mean favorite moments in their songs, their career or their performances?   Stefan has a much softer voice than I expected.   Vine doesn't work in some android phones. Maybe that's your case.   Hey, that's Cersei!   She is gonna get so horny while telling you her fantasies and visualizing them.   This, please. Anyone?   Of course, she had to record that video in a dark room only lighted up with candles, with some more dolls in the background. She couldnt record it in a totally normal room at day light.   That's a terrible CGI work.   This movie is based on the premise that the deaf guy can read the lips perfectly, but actually doing this is very hard and you only get like the 10% of the oral information. I know this because I've worked with deaf people for some years.   When does the quantity of policemen start to be too many policemen?   Yeah, I know there is a lot of fucked up people in the internet. But at the beginning of this video you can see how this guy cleans a knife full of blood with  panties. That's obviously a joke.  I admit I had a moment of doubt when I played this other video and saw the obsessive mural made of cute girls photos.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPBpe1P6pZU  Like, who the hell would be so dedicated to set the scenario for a video? But also you can see labels on the boxes: "Justin DVDs (Bieber)" and "Justin DVDs (Timberlake)". He's clearly acting.   I doubt this guy is really pertubed. I think he is just making art and humour. He is acting. If you watch the whole video it gets quite absurd, its just like a creepy short film.   someone set up us the bomb!   On one session my dom forbided me to close my eyes. I just keeped closing it because I was feeling such a pleasure.  Some time later we switched and she was my sub. I forbided her to speak, a different way of having control on somebody. The thing was she had to speak in sign language. I was a sing language interpreter then and I was teaching her, so it was like practising for her. It was incredibly cute to see her so quiet and trying to communicate with me with her hands.   You are a genius and made me laugh. Thank you very much.   I played my No Love Deep Web record while practicing a method my therapist taught me for releasing my anger and anxiety. It consists in hitting a phone book with a piece of plastic pipe while you scream.  So, No love was blasting, and I was hitting the phone book as hard as I could, following the ryhtm of the beats, shouting things like "I'm not gonna be sad!" and "I'm gonna be happy!".  Later I got interested in magick and occultism, so one day I tried to practise my own purification ritual. I wrote in my arm "Do what thou wilt, shall be the whole of the law", and in my leg "Love is the law, love under will" (both quotes from The book of the Law by Aleister Crowley). I cut my hair while listening to Beware. Cutting my hair had always some kind of symbolism, like leaving the old stuff behind and starting a new phase.   I can assure you I felt quite powerful, like I was doing something really meaningful or, at least, different, as Manson spoke in the intro. Then I took a shower.   That moment when Come up and get me starts... Damn. If I was there I would have an orgasm.   Did a picture of this graffiti exist, or did I just create a fake memory?   If the band see this, they are gonna love it, for sure.   thanks   GIG APORSIH?   There is nothing wrong in not being absolutely original.   I just realized that people have posted a lot of button-related haikus:  http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/3243us/my_button_haiku/ http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31ebgd/i_wrote_a_haiku_about_pushing_the_button/ http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31ik4e/a_collection_of_buttonrelated_haiku_ama/ http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/317gxb/the_button_a_haiku/ http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/319rqp/presser_haiku/ http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/317tut/a_haiku_from_a_troubled_nonpresser/   I can't remember how mine ended. I guess I just stopped imagining them.   Ok then :)   Is really anybody gonna read all the bands we list in these posts?   Cool. I didn't knew this one. Thanks.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/325urf/if_the_next_president_is_white_the_united_states/   It was probably just the office ghost cheking r/thebutton.   No. Germans are "Textura".  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter   Me and my best (girl) friend are huge fans of AT and sometimes we meet and watch the new episodes. After that we use to discuss and get to the same point: the show is getting more adult. AT started as a children show, but it got a lot of young adult fans, and they have to adapt to that. Adults want more complexity, more mature themes, deepness, sub-plots, story arcs.  But I wouldn't worry. I think the show will always preserve its touch  of innocence and be children likeable. Even in the most serious episodes, a lot of fantastic and absurd things and jokes happen.   Don't be such an ass. He is just trying to have a deep discussion about a show he likes. That's what boards and forums and subreddits are for, besides posting memes and jokes.   Well, people keep saying "Oh my God" even when Nietzsche stated very clearly that he is dead.   Is this really something to look at while you are stoned?  	69
 28 yo single male. Making a decent 6 figure income since 21 yo and now putting away about $4k or $5k each month. Savings are mostly with Edward Jones (well balanced portfolio) but also present in JP Morgan (mutual fund), Fidelity (vesting company stock and personal trading) and Chase (cash).  Right now I have zero debt but am looking for a house in an aggressive and expensive market. After doing so I will be about $200k in debt with the mortgage. I'm really not looking forward to it, but it seems better than throwing $2000 of rent into a financial black hole each month.   Based on historical prices it seems likely, as to my knowledge we haven't really seen any major events that typically precipitate a huge price drop. Additionally Saudi Arabia's recent decision to not cut output goes against its previous behavior in similar conditions. Some people may say Japan's sinking economy could be a factor, but I feel that China's growing economy and oil usage should easily counter that...  If it is orchestrated, it's a good move, Russia is bleeding from this at the time they need it most.      To put the violence in Mexico into perspective: the number of deaths from the Mexican Drug War since 2006 is estimated to be 4-5x higher than the deaths (including civilians) occurring in the ENTIRE Afghanistan War since the US invasion in 2001.      The post has been removed from the frontpage. I suggest everyone message the TIL moderators and ask them to have a sense of humor and allow it.   Op, now that the story is climbing you should delete your post. People will continue upvoting the other fake post because they'll just assume it's true without looking at the article.   Interesting fact: When the government came up with the Navy Seal teams they gave them names like "Navy Seal Team Six" even though there were not six teams. This was to throw off enemies to make them assume more teams were available. The base location for the team was "leaked" out during the Cold War. The location leaked was Thompson Falls, Montana.  So basically a non-existent city which is a side effect of the cold war is still in feigned existence today. It's pretty cool actually. It'd be even cooler to know why they continue to cover it up though.  **Edit:** Removing the article link as requested by the mods. Apparently people were getting malware warnings. My apologies!    If it's in a fuel cell it isn't really 'burned' right? It's a chemical reaction without combustion that produces water and electricity.   A 7% functional 'cure' rate on an illness that has seen few new marketable treatments in the last several decades? This is absolutely amazing if it shows similar results across common patient populations.        Have a nice day.   I really don't care what you believe. You are a self proclaimed "anarchist" and likely contribute nothing to society. You complain about people whining, yet you take whining to the extreme by contributing nothing towards the solutions of the problems you complain about.  Have a nice day.   When referring to my own opinion of the protests and how my opinion is not swayed by race, yes I think I can confidently say it's not because of race because I say it isn't. Are you suggesting I don't know my own thoughts?   I wonder if you have voices speaking to you. When I saw this http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/kiro-7-confronts-self-proclaimed-anarchist-accused/nczb9/ things became a lot more clear about what you represent.   Care to elaborate? Your message makes no sense to me...   I don't agree with these protests, but it's not because of race like you seem to imply. You do realize that most of those protesting in Seattle are white right?            You sound really really cynical. I hope you never have to rely on a police officer to help you, it might make your head explode.   It's because of escalating racial tensions all over the country causing people to post things they wouldn't normally post. It's not limited to reddit. For example a black friend of mine on Facebook just called for a purge of all whites, and some white friends of mine are posting about lynching blacks. People will regret what they said when things calm down. Right now it's a tinderbox.   Yes. Didn't realize it was the final game that had the riot though. My bad. Still I don't think anyone predicted the Stanley Cup game would result in a riot.   But apparently you chose to ignore the many disturbances that occur after other non-championship events:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Vancouver_Stanley_Cup_riot   **Just an update**: I-5 through Seattle has been shutdown and crowds are swelling as the protests have turned violent. Teargas/flashbangs/pepper-spray have been deployed and protesters are splitting off into large groups marching in different directions.  **10:48PM:** Windows at Wells Fargo Bank have been broken  **11:02 PM:** I-5 has now been re-opened and traffic is flowing freely. Fireworks being thrown at police elsewhere in Seattle  **11:10 PM:** Protests igniting in Capital Hill. All available cops are being asked to assist in riot gear.  **12:10 AM:** Things seem to be dying down in terms of spread. Some protesters have spray painted businesses along Pine.  **Update at 12:35 AM:** Protests have really died down. Only about 60 protesters left.   I was referring to Ferguson, but perhaps that was misunderstood.   Who said they were rioting? As of right now it's just a peaceful protest. Which is why I called them protesters in the title, and not rioters.   They certainly aren't given a pass, there is just less of a coordinated response because they cannot easily be predicted.    I mean a lot of those causing riots after sporting events are likely intoxicated, so that alone is a pretty big difference from these Ferguson related protests.   *intoxicated people   There probably would have been riots either way, some people are just out to start conflict instead of deescalating and looking to find ways to prevent similar situations in the future.      Hello race war! Raceeeeeeee war!!!!!! RACE WAR EVERYONE!!!!!!!! RACE WAR!!         But you won't be at an equal pressure because you'll have A LOT of extra weight added by everything that isn't "normal air". The vessel would sink down into the atmosphere and the pressure inside would be much different than that on the outside before the vessel becomes stabilized.   Japan was one of the most aggressive countries in modern history. They just recently started firing back up their offensive military machine to face potential future conflict with China. A well armed Japan is one of the last things anyone should fuck with.      The only thing he's mentioned to me is that he looks for suburbs with good schools. I don't know what effect that really has though, other than reducing the chance of lower class renters.  When I've been looking (but have not bought any yet) I'm using Craigslist to find how much rents are in an area, and then using sites like Zillow to find the areas where the difference between mortgages and rents are the most extreme, but still affordable to me.   I'm in the same type of situation. I'm 28 and pulling in about 100k after taxes each year. But I also feel like I am being paid for my life, as outside of work I don't really do anything. I'm almost 100% work focused, and I don't want to live this way for the rest of my life.  I've been aggressively saving/investing for a house, but around here a decent house close to work costs about $700k. My plan is to pay much of it off in a down payment, and then have a minimal mortgage, that way I have bigger incoming cash flow that I feel I can spend on 'fun purchases'. That however, is still not **wealth**.   Luckily I work with many many others my age that make similar amounts of money or more from their day job. It allows me to get a lot of comparisons into what works wealth-wise, and what does not. At this point I'm convinced that one of the best ways to generate wealth outside of owning a business is to own property and rent it out.   I have a friend the same age as me that currently owns 3 properties in the suburbs and rents them out. From those he's paying about $3,000 in mortgages each month, but getting about $6,000 in rent. Excluding repairs and maintenance, that's an **extra** cash flow that nets him $3,000 each month in addition to his regular work pay. To me that is wealth... Because if he were to quit his job he'd still have income to live on while he searches for another job. PLUS like me he's 28, so I would not be surprised if he continues to add another property every 2-3 years. That's wealth generating income that can increase relatively fast, and it's also a real world example of someone our age gaining wealth so he will not have to work into his 50s.  So my advice would be to look into owning property in an affordable area and renting it out, as I know it is a wealth generating method proven to work by one of my friends with similar income.   Ummm. No. Have fun with your anonymous mask though!      They keep missing one too. If I'm going to call any country a terrorist state, it's going to be Saudi Arabia.   Probably not the wisest thing to say as the President of a nation that only has ~3 million people.  I don't understand comments like this from heads of state, it's only going to escalate things.

RAID is often used when data integrity is important (for example backups). If you have a bunch of SD cards in a array and have failing cards, you're going to have to rebuild the array often or face total failure.   TL;DR: If you have a RAID setup with fault prone nodes, you're going to have a bad time.   You can, but the SD cards are usually much different/lower quality flash memory. They don't have nearly as much tolerance for failure and the number of write cycles is typically much less due to the type of memory used.  It'd be a nice 'fun RAID' perhaps. But I wouldn't use one to hold the keys to life.   You can buy them today, so it's already reaching consumers. I may buy one for an off-grid cabin because unlike many other batteries these aren't chemically dangerous, and they claim they have very long lives with minimal degradation.         "Hot Wheels is proud to announce our new 89' Geo Metro model with separable exhaust!"    I sometimes wonder if this administration is TRYING to stir up racial tensions.

When someone mentions asymptomatic I think a lot of people associate it with other contagious diseases where there can be carriers that spread the disease without exhibiting any symptoms. A very dangerous and alarming prospect. Like typhoid Mary.   Really? An "Asymptomatic" flair on the post? It's like it was only added to cause unnecessary panic. It's well known that Ebola can still be detected in semen weeks or months after infection. This guy was symptomatic at one time, and defeated the virus. He already went through the extremely contagious phase when he was still in Africa.

But I think it would be cool if there were some X-Prize like "Reddit Prize" for huge scientific/technological/consumer breakthroughs that may affect many Reddit users.   It would take someone to manage it. But it would also be incredibly awesome and allow Reddit to really give back to society.   Perhaps you'd like to fly there and show them how it's properly done in a war-torn country?   Inspections are still done, they are just done while the money is in escrow and the buyer/seller agree that the buyer can walk away if the inspection finds something that changes the buyer's mind. It is rare for buyers to waive them completely (and stupid in my opinion).  My agent told me the reason agents are pushing against pre-offer inspections is because the market here is so competitive a lot of buyers were getting upset when they'd pay for inspections and not have their offers accepted post-inspection. I was also getting upset, as I have paid for inspections on 4 other homes which ended up going to other buyers with better offers.   Not yet. In my region there is a push against pre-inspections because it was beginning to become way too taxing on potential buyers.   I could probably do this, and claim it's due to a defect, as long as they don't call my bluff and offer to address it.   I can back out, but I believe I will lose my earnest money which is $20k unless I find a defect with the house.   I can't help but to feel a bit cynical about his words. His party just lost a mid-term election, and NOW he decides to be so vocal about opposing net neutrality?!? If he believes so strongly in opposing it, where were his strong reactions before he had to save face?  It's fucked up and quite honestly it makes me a bit depressed at our current political state of affairs. It's all such a joke.     Even fire rated bricks tend to crack over time when exposed to both fire and outdoor elements. For $6 they'll still probably get a lot of good use out of the pit, and from my experience even after the bricks begin cracking, people don't care that much as it's all about the fire.                     That single tall tree a bit from the left looks like it just gave up.   "I'm this tall! I don't want to be any taller!!!"   Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is the "Sweat Trap Bike Ride".   A CBO study in 2007 concluded:   "The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants"  Since then there has been a larger flood of illegals that can be considered 'dependents', so I believe it would be an even greater difference today.  [Source](http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/12-6-immigration.pdf)   He was wrong... But seriously, it's the US's fault that people don't want to live in Mexico? The Mexican Government is full of corruption, and Mexico was chaotic before the Drug War too. Shifting blame to the US is pretty uncalled for here.   It's not direct harm. But it is indirect harm as services are used for free that those legally here help pay for. It hits hospitals especially hard, and others are forced to pay more because of it. It's well documented and understood, and it's not fair to those who obey the laws.   If this happens I don't think Obama will be acting in the interest of the United States. Those who knowingly commit illegal acts that harm others (stressing US infrastructure in this case) should not be rewarded.     There is an article somewhere online written by a hostage that was set free by ISIS. He was sold by the FSA (which is considered 'moderate' by the US) to ISIS. Later on he was held by a mix of ISIS and FSA fighters, and some of the FSA fighters told him they received training from the US military, and that they simply lied when they said they would not work with ISIS.  I truly believe the best thing to do at this point is support Assad in limited fashion, and setup ways to hold his soldiers accountable if any atrocities are committed after that partnership begins.   If people are willing to do the work and you aren't asking for an employee, but rather a service provider, why shouldn't they? Even though this 'ad' was a PR stunt... There are companies out there that do nothing but remote security system monitoring for businesses (even if not using their equipment). It's not inconceivable to think you could hire one for relatively cheap.   I would say don't do this. I work at a company where quite a few of my coworkers are timid/shy, and a couple of them have stared at my eyebrows before during conversation. It will make me seem more intimidating, because it makes me annoyed. Nothing is more annoying then talking to someone who is staring above my eyes, because it makes me self-conscious of whether I have a mark on my face or something.  My brother and I actually did this when we were younger to ANNOY each other. If you have a brother/close friend, try it. Hold a conversation with them but only look at their eyebrows. They will become very uncomfortable and/or angry. I guarantee it.   Hey, leave your love life out of this!   I have friends that hate on the US all the time, and in particular they repeatedly claim the US has the most violent cops in the world. They also say they want to move away from the US... part of me hopes they buy a ticket to a place like Brazil.   Balls of steel. At that point the helmet is really just for decoration.   Yes, but none were in circumstances to make me cry. All those that passed on were elderly and in failing health, so I think I was mentally prepared for it.  If a close family member killed themselves I think I would cry too.   You could take proactive steps that may help minimize the future progression severity: Eating healthier, sleeping healthier, exercising more, and staying mentally active.  	87

This was a joint investigation between local TV station WPTV NewsChannel 5 and The Palm Beach Post.

Now break up Comcast like AT T was in the 80s    You are implying that the state of Louisiana cutting taxes caused to the GLOBAL price of oil to fall. That is ludicrous and I never said such a thing. If you can't understand that I didn't not see the point in continuing to argue with you.    I never claimed that cutting taxes are to be blamed for falling oil prices, I have no idea where you get that idea. The only thing I cited was that the tax cuts made things bad, low oil prices (a completely different issue from govt funding) made things worse because it means lower revenue than what they would have had if the prices were higher. To be clear low taxes didn't cause low oil prices, and I never claimed as such. Low taxes on high oil prices brings in more revenue than low taxes on low oil prices, that is it. Also I never said that there can't be cuts, my issue is that so much has already been cut how much is there left?    also I never laid all the blame on low taxes, I lay the majority of the blame   Well that isn't because of a tax cut, is it? I mean, can you show me how LA tax cuts have cratered the world wide price of oil? If not, then placing all the blame on taxes is just silly.  Of course falling oil prices aren't because of taxes. The point is that Jindal was banking on high oil prices to help the state out of the huge hole they put themselves in and didn't have a plan B just in case.   Again, raising taxes is only one option/tool there. The other option/tool is to address the spending that has increased $2B from 2012 to 2014.The fact that they choose not to question the spending side of the equation doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it is automatically all because of less taxes.Call me crazy, but I doubt that the tax increases somehow magically caused spending to rise by $2B in 2 years, but I'm happy to look at what you've got.  First this statement doesn't make any sense to me. The state is in a $1.6B budget gap, you don't get that way by just increasing spending you get that way by cutting revenue as well. You can't get out of this mess by just cutting everything, you need to raise revenue as well. If you cut everything you end up with shitty road, schools, government services etc. You keep sighting this $2B and yet I can find that figure in the document you provided in another comment (could you at least cite a page or pages, I don't have time to read a 120pg document). Also how could tax increases cause spending to rise? More to the point they didn't raise taxes at all, they cut them or let them stay as is. This contributed to the mess they are in.      Year after year, Louisiana didn't have enough money to cover its expenses, yet Gov. Bobby Jindal refused to roll back income tax cuts or ever-increasing corporate tax breaks. Instead, he raided reserve funds and sold off state property.Jindal suggested job growth from his economic development wins would replenish those assets once the recession ended. It hasn't  and money from the lucrative oil industry has taken a nose dive with crude prices. Now, the Republican is running out of short-term patches and is struggling to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole just as he tries to build support for a possible 2016 presidential run.  [source: The (Baton Rouge) Advocate ](http://theadvocate.com/news/11576704-123/out-of-tricks-how-louisiana)   Most blame the $1.6 billion budget gap on Jindals rigid refusal to raise taxes, which originates in a pledge he signed with Grover Norquist, sultan of the GOPs anti-tax wing. For years, Jindal has been siphoning money from dedicated funds or one-time payouts to make up for the states lack of revenue.Now, even members of his own party are criticizing him for his management of Louisianas finances.  [source: The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/03/19/louisiana-is-so-poor-that-it-cant-afford-to-hold-presidential-primaries-in-2016/)    It should be noted that Louisiana got in this mess because they cut taxes by a huge amount when their current governor, Bobby Jindal, came to office. Now they are hesitant to raising them to stop the bleeding and no deal is in sight at the moment.    The city knows this, that is why it only applies to city employees and companies that have contracts with the city. They can't protect their citizens but they can protect their employees.    given how they voted in Hobby Lobby I don't have much confidence in them   WE NEED MORE TAX CUTS TO FUND THESE SCHOOLS!

In the United States, a car title loan, also called an auto title loan, vehicle title loan, pink slip loan, or simply title loan, is a type of secured loan where the borrower can use their vehicle title as collateral. Borrowers who get title loans must allow a lender to place a lien on their car title, and temporarily surrender the hard copy of their vehicle title, in exchange for a loan amount. When the loan is repaid, the lien is removed and the car title is returned to its owner. If the borrower defaults on their payments then the lender is liable to repossess the vehicle and sell it to repay the borrowers outstanding debt.

Alabama needs it for its nuclear power plants along the Chattahoochee.  Florida needs lots of water because the more water released from Lake Lanier the more rich nutrients are realized that shrimp feed on at the mouth of the river in the Gulf of Mexico.

I think it was mostly finally seeing that Delta doesn't need tax breaks and looking for money that didn't involve a tax increase. Though a part of me thinks that this was conservatives retaliating against Delta for blocking the "religious freedom" bill last year (though that's just speculation on my part). Regardless the reason it's quite obvious that Delta doesn't need them.    Pressure can make a difference. It's better than nothing, though I would prefer a veto.

    He shows u few examples that were effective by blocking roads.   That's great.  It still does not show how it is **the** most effective way to get results.  Why is this such a hard concept for you to understand?  Yes it did  Really?  And what is that?    Like u know the most effective way  Did I say I did?  stop bullshitting or tell me ur genius plan to for the "most" effective means of protest  Bullshitting?  I'm merely asking a question and am making no claims to know the **most effective** means of protest.  If I did make such a claim, I would have the evidence to support said claim.  as of now, peaceful protest doesn't seem to get media attention  Is the goal media attention or getting something done?  As it stands, violent or disruptive behavior certainly doesn't seem to be doing anything.  I mean, aside from getting media attention.    once few people gets stuck in traffic, all of the sudden he cause gets media attention  And?  Did it accomplish anything beyond holding up traffic?   it works and there is no denying  And we somewhat come back to square one.

So, you don't have any evidence to support that blocking traffic is **THE** most effective at getting results?

If that's the case, let's make it rain in new laws because of something that **might** happen.     In pretty much every country on earth blocking traffic is par for the course in protests. And it is usually the most effective tactic.  Effective in doing what?  Getting results?  If that's what you're implying, I'd love to see some evidence to support that blocking traffic is the most effective in getting results.   John Locke from Lost.   Yet, while there is in fact no way to prove this, I doubt Iraq would be in this current situation (at least at this level) if we hadn't gone in on false information, obliterated their infrastructure, and made promises that we never kept.  We'd also still have thousands of U.S. military/civilian personnel among us as well.   So while there is always this talk about who won the war/lost the war, it never should have happened in the first place.  There has to be a cause to create the effect.      Anytime I now see a bill with a name like this, I immediately assume it's full of some high level of crap.  How many people actually read the bills as opposed to just reading the title?

Relevant text:  Thomas Harris has given few interviews, and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid 2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life Mexican doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in Monterrey city, in the state of Nuevo Len, during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s, when he was a 23-year-old reporter. The doctor was serving a life sentence for murdering a young man, supposedly a "close friend", mutilating his body into several body parts and putting them in a very small box. Harris, who would only refer to the surgeon by the fake name "Dr. Salazar", described him as a "small lithe pale man with dark red hair". He added: "There was certain intelligence and elegance about him." Harris had gone to Mxico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a US citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to "Salazar", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. "Salazar" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been.      Feed him bacon.

Relevant text:  The Quintinshill rail disaster occurred on 22 May 1915 near Gretna Green, Dumfriesshire, Scotland at Quintinshill, an intermediate signal box with passing loops on each side on the Caledonian Railway Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (now part of the West Coast Main Line).  The crash, which involved five trains, killed a probable 226[nb 1] and injured 246 and remains the worst rail crash in the United Kingdom in terms of loss of life. Those killed were mainly Territorial soldiers from the 1/7th (Leith) Battalion, the Royal Scots heading for Gallipoli. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire.  The crash occurred when a troop train travelling from Larbert, Stirlingshire to Liverpool, Lancashire collided with a local passenger train that had been shunted on to the main line, to then be hit by an express train to Glasgow which crashed into the wreckage a minute later. Gas from the lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed the three passenger trains and also two goods trains standing on nearby passing loops. Some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the bodies that were recovered were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery. Four bodies, believed to be of children, were never identified or claimed and are buried in the Western Necropolis, Glasgow.  The cause of the accident was neglect of the rules by two signalmen. Both men were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of culpable homicide after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.  A memorial to the dead soldiers was erected soon after the accident and there are more recent memorials at various locations. An annual remembrance service is held at Rosebank Cemetery.

The first tea bags were hand-sewn fabric bags; tea bag patents date as early as 1903. First appearing commercially around 1904, tea bags were successfully marketed by the tea and coffee shop merchant Thomas Sullivan from New York, who shipped his tea bags around the world. The loose tea was intended to be removed from the sample bags by customers, but they found it easier to brew the tea with the tea still enclosed in the porous bags. Modern tea bags are usually made of paper fibre. The heat-sealed paper fiber tea bag was invented by William Hermanson, one of the founders of Technical Papers Corporation of Boston. Hermanson sold his patent to the Salada Tea Company in 1930.  **The rectangular tea bag was not invented until 1944. Prior to this, tea bags resembled small sacks.**      Relevant text:  It is hard to grasp just how small the atoms that make up your body are until you take a look at the sheer number of them.

They are the only known living animals that have a skull but no vertebral column. Along with lampreys, hagfish are jawless and are living fossils; they are basal to vertebrates, and living hagfish remain similar to hagfish from around 300 million years ago.  The classification of hagfish has been controversial. The issue is whether the hagfish is itself a degenerate type of vertebrate-fish (most closely related to lampreys), or else may represent a stage which precedes the evolution of the vertebral column (as do lancelets). The original scheme groups hagfish and lampreys together as cyclostomes (or historically, Agnatha), as the oldest surviving class of vertebrates alongside gnathostomes (the now-ubiquitous jawed vertebrates). An alternative scheme proposed that jawed vertebrates are more closely related to lampreys than to hagfish (i.e., that vertebrates include lampreys but exclude hagfish), and introduces the category craniata to group vertebrates near hagfish. Recent DNA evidence has supported the original scheme.

Relevant text:  The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles, set up in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood who immigrated to the United States after the Central American civil wars of the 1980s.  Originally, the gang's main purpose was to protect Salvadoran immigrants from other, more established gangs of Los Angeles, who were predominantly composed of Mexicans and African-Americans.  Many Mara Salvatrucha gang members from the Los Angeles area have been deported after being arrested. Namely, Jose Abrego, a high-ranking member, was deported four times. As a result of these deportations, members of MS have recruited more members in their home countries. The Los Angeles Times contends that deportation policies have contributed to the size and influence of the gang both in the United States and in Central America. According to the 2009 National Gang Threat Assessment, "The gang is estimated to have 30,000 to 50,000 members and associate members worldwide, 8,000 to 10,000 of whom reside in the United States."

I'm looking at this as a hobby, and this is just me cutting my teeth, and in the future they're probably going to have way higher end gear.  I'm not expecting amazing results, and I fully expect a few mistakes, but I'd rather screw up cheap bargain-bin parts than really nice choice components. I see this guy being a schlepping instrument, that will be retired to a nice case on a wall when I build another one with really nice parts.  Plus this lets me trace the body blank on to some graph paper so in the future I can hopefully make and route the body myself.   Free cookies in exchange for potentially saving someone's life. Worth it. Not like I need all that blood anyways.  Plus as a male, there's [a body of evidence](http://www.webmd.com/men/features/too-much-iron-in-your-blood) showing that it's actually a good idea to donate blood frequently to prevent iron buildup in your bloodstream.  So, free cookies, saving someone's life, and extending your own.   Perhaps; there are many, many ways to add pauses - for dramatic effect or otherwise - I suppose anyway...   Thank you so much!    So, followup questions - if a neck has a 56mm heel width, am I looking for a body that has a 56mm neck pocket? Or can I sand that down? Or am I getting the measurements completely mixed up?  Also, is it safe to assume a neck will have a slot for a truss rod?  Sorry for the peppering of questions - like I said, kind of still trying to figure this out.   Simple but good example: Food service.  Not paying sick days essentially forces a low income earner (the sort of person who would be working at a food service job in most cases) to choose between taking sick days to get better, or sucking it up and going to work. They don't have the option of choosing to go to work or not because they likely live paycheck to paycheck - losing a day of pay could literally mean no food on the table or not paying rent.  So, they go to work sick. While there, they then expose food and other workers to their illness. They also are less productive while working. Other coworkers become sick, and you lose even more productivity as the sickness spreads through your workforce. Customers potentially get sick, and if it's bad enough that customers track you down, you are exposing yourself to massive lawsuits.  Between a multimillion dollar lawsuit worst case scenario and giving a worker the day off with pay when they are sick - well, which would you rather pay?  I have a personal theory that many people have a difficult time understanding indirect consequences of actions, or maybe they understand them but have a harder time comprehending the spidering-out chain of effects that their actions create. Because sadly, there are dragons in those effects.   Honestly - I built a pinewood derby car in high school, and a stool in boyscouts. So, basically none.  I kinda thought an electric might be a good way to start, especially since outside of hardware and wiring it looks like I could put one together for less than $100.  I've also wanted a bass, and it looks like they have a few bass necks, which could be fantastic.   Well, was the tech wrong?  See also this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbTB3ASkdOo   Hey everyone! I am looking to build out my workbench first, but after that I want to start on my first guitar build. Originally I had considered doing a ukulele build first (kits are cheap) to get my feet wet, but then some folks pointed me towards the guitarfetish warehouse sale.  Ultimately I want to build acoustics, but I feel like getting my feet wet with ANY guitar build will be a great way to start. Is this a sensible approach? Or should I just spring for an acoustic kit and ignore the electrics?    https://www.brawker.com/  I think this exactly what I saw before - I thought it was just for amazon but I remembered incorrectly. Thank you!!!!   Hey everyone. I think I remember seeing a service like this before. Specifically I want to purchase a guitar kit from either Blues Creek Guitar or Stewart Macdonald, but neither accepts bitcoin (and I haven't been able to get a response when sending emails suggesting it).  So, it sounds like I need a service where someone would purchase the kit for me in exchange for bitcoin. I know I've seen something like this for amazon, but what about the WWW at large??   She is beautiful!!   Have you had any issues with space/toy/food aggression? A lot of dogs that are crated that long see some issues    Luckily, educated progressive people are far less likely to utter the last words, "Hey ya'll, hold my beer and *check this out!*"   You are correct, but it's important to note that those rules apply specific to "[public accommodations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12181)".  I still don't understand how the protection of sexuality isn't covered. If I was a gay guy banging another gay guy, and a business finds out and says they won't do business with me, they are essentially discriminating against me because my partner is male and not female. So it's essentially discrimination of sex via a proxy.   You seriously may have just secured my wife and I's retirement. We've talked about retiring in the Netherlands for years, and it appears this is EXTREMELY common there. It could even be enough to secure citizenship because you have to live there 5 years and show financial stability. Seriously, you rock!    I will check it out, thank you!!   Hey everyone! I am a complete newbie, starting from scratch. So far I have the Bernstein book (I literally picked it up this evening) but I was wondering if there are other books I should take a look at? My ultimate goal is a small setup for raising tilapia and growing plants, most likely similar to this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv1y4STXVWg  Any advice would be really helpful. I'd also appreciate advice if this may be shooting a bit high to start :)   You are both pragmatic, and a good dog owner. Rate up!   Which is why, to this day, I don't use dishwashers. My first apartment had a dishwasher, and I just put dishes in, and they never came out clean. My roommate advised me that I had to wash and scrub them down beforehand.  If I have to wipe them down with a wet cloth already, i may as well make the cloth wet with soapy water and just spend 2 seconds more scrubbing and be done with them.  The machines don't serve much of a point to me unless I have a sudden massive amount of easily cleaned dishes (cocktail parties are a great example)   It's the reverse here. My wife will usually grab things as soon as I set them down, often before I'm done. I usually don't mind unless it suddenly leads to problems like scorching (because I couldn't stir fast enough), or nice sear marks turning into burn marks (because she stole my tongs).   This is good advice, but requires you to have downtime as you go. That's not always the case. Especially if you are doing things that readily burn and require constant stirring. I'll give OP benefit of the doubt :)   It was Peter Coors. I'm still trying to scrape up more. Looks like he eventually stepped out but I was able to find this so far: http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2015/01/14/business-entertainment-notables-pull-out-antigay-groups-event   Pretty simple - this happened a few months ago, but magically it seems to have disappeared off of the internet. Can anyone find any articles relating to this event??   Just throwing this out there, that's an awesome pace. That's a sub 2 minute half-mile which is wicked fast.   Do they support bitcoin?   Nothing, this sub is just stacked with contrarian idiots who downvote for stupid reasons.   The proper term is Frenched, achieved by the process of Frenching. Talk to any chef and say a cut needs to be frenched, they will know what you mean. Use any other term? No such guarantee can be made.   Do fulfillment centers exist for food products? I have been working on starting my business repackaging and selling spices. It's easy for me to do at home and ship, but can I tell the fulfillment center "here's a 50lb bag of cumin seed, customer ordered 1oz of ground cumin, please grind 1 oz of cumin and ship?"   Any idea how precise the scale needs to be? I have an older kitchen scale which is a bit finicky but can handle measurements down to ~4 gram precision or so.   If this is true, Drs. Sheldon Cooper and Leonard Hofstadter will be devastated.   Hey everyone. I have been curious about this for awhile. The actual act of buying/selling is easy. My big concern is making sure that packages get out to customers in a timely way.  I am still starting, so any volume that I would generate would be miniscule, and likely way too small for a fulfillment center to be interested.  Did you pay for custom packaging? How do you handle boxing and adding packing material? This stuff, if you go to office max or even the post office is absurdly expensive. Enough so that I lose any kind of competitive edge. The post office offers free shipping boxes, but the flat rate is really high - $9+.  So far I have just been saving boxes and as much packing material as possible from Amazon. Some guy I know also tried getting a bunch of free boxes from USPS and inverting them until he found out it was a felony :(   I don't either. It was always instilled in me early on that your pet is family. Not just "a pet." You've taken them in, they are with you for life through thick and thin.  Then I read about people just throwing dogs away and.. I just don't understand it.   Congratulations!  Please remember to vote every chance you get. Not just for presidential elections. Sadly lots of folks forget that and we end up with a bunch of idiots running the show.   Not sure. I think the fact that people aren't driving the train, they have a big metal shield blocking them from really comprehending what happened literally a few feet away. Kinda like hearing about a murder on the news - it's ethereal and doesn't really have much impact on you most of the time. So instead to them it's just lost time that they're stuck on the train.  If they actually saw the body or if they're on the front of the train and they see the person hit, that would probably change their tune a bit. But maybe not.  The drivers and ticket takers are always really on edge though - it hits them pretty hard (as you would expect).   Well, it may not be quite what you are looking for, but I have been on several trains where a person has jumped in front of the train (you didn't specify the kind of accident). Usually you just feel the train screech to a halt. The ticket takers start going nuts and run to the front of the train. About 10 minutes passes and an intercom message plays that there appears to have been a fatality, and to please be patient. At that point you realize you are stuck for the next minimum of 30 minutes until another train can be redirected towards you. They pull the trains side by side so you can't see anything, and then move you over to the other train.  Other passengers usually flip out about how "selfish" the person was to screw up their day, and you question why exactly it is wrong to punch complete strangers for being such assholes who can't realize that their minor inconvenience was a day in someone's life that was so bad that it made them jump in front of a train.  There have been 2 times where I have seen the body. There's a lot of blood, and not much recognizable as a person.   When her only defense is that "she feared for her life" and the DA himself says that he never once pointed or directed towards her, his hands were empty, and she waited 4 seconds between shots into the back of an unarmed man, yes, exactly.  That's why she's been charged.   FYI, the camera from her tazer shows that he was struggling to remove the barb from his back when she opened fire. The DA himself said the video evidence is damning considering his hands were empty and he never once gestured towards her, and it clearly seems he was trying to remove the barbs from his back. She also waited 4 seconds between shots. Because,  you know, apparently the guy she shot once in the back was still a threat.  As for not responding immediately - let's try something. Have someone shoot you in the back with a tazer and start barking commands at you. See how soon you can start responding.   My god, of all the breeds, I think pits/staffies have the absolute best smiles.   Yeah, they "try to make it better" by threatening to stop policing if anyone criticizes dangerous officers, a la the NYPD. Police will gladly hold the public hostage the second someone tries to wave accountability in their direction.   Cop just indicted in Pennsylvania for stopping a man for an out of date registration sticker, pulling him out of his car, laying him face down, and shooting him to death in the back.  And the rest of the police that everyone says are "so noble" will be gladly paying into the union coffers to finance wave after wave of appeals to ensure that this officer eventually gets their job back with back pay, or at the very least, a full pension.  Because not a single goddamned cop actually wants to police themselves, just us "normals."   For a damn image. I know what I searched for.   No, I googled a creature from the game. I did not "google a spoiler."  At worst, I expected links for the beast to pop up. I did not expect the very first link to show the name of the beast's identity.   This may be the best comment I've read today!   Good dog!!   Um, that when I google "infamous beast" that I could find a picture, and not have the first result show me the identity of the beast?   I understand what you are saying, but I have to disagree somewhat. You're ok with raising for food lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 50 million years ago, but not lifeforms whose evolutionary path diverged from ours 10 million years ago (dates are wrong obviously, but I think you understand my meaning). I don't agree with that distinction.  As for the land - most studies of the least harm doctrine have asserted that a mix of both animal and plant agriculture minimizes the actual loss of life. Remember that when land is used for plant agriculture, there is still a staggering loss of life. Native plant species are cleared en masse, and that often leads to mass starvation of native animal species. Rerouting waterways for irrigation can cause further damage in similar ways. The act of preparing soil, tilling and harvesting kills massive numbers of soil-dwelling mammals. The word pesticide is a portmanteau that means "killer of pest animals." So, even if we switched to pure plant agriculture, animals will still die as a direct result, even if we haven't raised them for it. And sadly, it's often in larger numbers than in animal agriculture (I'm only talking about direct impact, not indirect where the numbers go all over the place on each side of the fence).  There's not a simple answer to this one, as much as I wish there was.   I'm familiar with it, actually! Very good sci-fi movie.  Honestly, I suppose it isn't that far off.  Still, it's far better that the animals be treated well than forced to put in restrictive enclosures. I mean, ultimately, they are being raised for food. At some point, they will die. There is no way to sugar coat that. It's the brutal truth. But at least while they're alive they can be treated with dignity and given a modicom of respect, you know?   You realize the keystone document for justifying the war in Iraq declassified and released by FOIA request a few days ago, and shows that you are completely and utterly wrong?  https://news.vice.com/article/the-cia-just-declassified-the-document-that-supposedly-justified-the-iraq-invasion   Hey, first, I am a meat eater. So I want to get that out of the way. I also do my best to support small local farmers. I also hunt when I have the opportunity.  Do you feel that a lot of videos similar to yours that are heavily publicized purposefully forget to mention that this is factory farms that perform these practices, and NOT all meat processors or, worse, farmers?  I have family who work in the farming industry, and take their animals to be harvested at small processors. The animals are treated extremely well until the end. But watching most of these videos, it seems like names are often replaced with blanket terms. So instead of "Smithfield meats does this" it is advertised as "Farmers do this!" or "Meat processors do this!" Instead of showing the more truthful message that this isn't how it's done everywhere, the videos seem to specifically omit names to create a sort of "everyman" out of the industry.  PETA is notorious for this.  I understand that the bulk of Americans get their meat from factory farms (and these videos ARE necessary to prevent abuse), but painting the entire industry with the same brush also hurts those small farmers and meat processors who really do treat animals properly until the end.   Dear god someone needs to make sure this is the top post on this thread. Please. Contact your representatives. Get involved. For once congress is doing the right thing!!   Always question a woman who can sprint in high heels.   I know several cops. Most of them perform the minimum amount of range time required because they'd like to actually spend time with their families when not on the clock. Sure they may visit every now and then to hang out, but it's usually more camaraderie than it is for focused training.  Remember, cops aren't intended to be soldiers, they are intended to be civil servants. Not all of them want to be dirty harry. The problem is when you place someone who hasn't had that much range time or, more importantly, live fire training in a high pressure situation, their trigger fingers can get itchy - hence police racking up over 5000 civilian deaths since 2001, while only 1800 police officers have been KIA. In January of this year, 176 civilians were killed by police in the US alone. That's more than the average number of officers KIA for an entire year. That's why we're seeing sweeping criticisms coming down from the justice department because of how bad training is for cops to deal with those situations.  If we insist on arming cops with firearms (which is the only sensible course since civilians can have guns in the US), they really should require live fire training.  I wonder what ratio of those 5000+ civilians were shot by a cop who was a combat veteran, vs cops who weren't?   Everyone is happy until their sweetroll is stolen. -Skyrim guards   So, where would one apply to sling lead down range and shoot poachers in the face? I understand and totally appreciate the approach being taken. It's the right thing to do.  But seriously, shooting poachers in the face sounds like a great way to dissuade them from poaching.   Just an advanced warning, do not google "infamous beast" or go on the Infamous wikia wiki site and type "the beast." It automatically redirects you to the identity of the beast, and kind of ruins the surprise.  I was trying to find a picture, and, boom, spoiler. Since it was a disambiguation I didn't even get a spoiler alert.   Stop pumping the gas pedal. Wait 30 minutes. Start the car. My Mazda MX3 was from 92 and still had problems with the engine flooding.   Didn't they give the vaccine on sugar cubes? Or am I thinking of another disease?   We used to call them "knuckle busters" because they had an edge on them that you could bust your knuckles on.      Molds are weird. Some science fir you...  If you have a layer of good mold, and a spot of bad mold, the good mold CAN overtake the bad. Or vice versa.  The real problem is that mold spreads through something called "mycelium" which is kind of like a plant's root system, except far more efficient at moving chemicals from point a to point b. That is a big concern. If the bad mold produces any toxins, they can absolutely get picked up by the good mold and transported through most of the mycelial network.   So even if you cut off "bad mold" the "good mold" may now be toxic.   Worth while is really a matter of opinion depending on what OPs goals are. I would assume teaching is a big part of this, and going right to refined bismuth cuts out a lot of good learning opportunity. Yield of product may be less important than yield of knowledge.   Can you provide plans or further info? The wife would love this and our current strawberry cultivars are horrid producers   I have to agree on this. The majority of AB's stuff is killer. BUT some stuff just hasn't worked out. The original pizza crust from Good Eats is hit or miss (thats why he later redid it on his blog). His salted caramel recipe is honestly not that great, but served as an excellent springboard for me to get into candy making.  They're both good. Usually between AB, Cooks Illustrated/ATK,  and Serious Eats I can create more or less exactly what I want 99% of the time.   Does someone want to start a warchest for any potential lawsuit?  If it never happens, we can donate the proceeds to a GLBTQ+ charity or civil rights org.  Also, OP, be VERY careful using any of his old site's branding or design. I would look into getting a lawyer to CYA.   If OP just uses facts based on the voting record and sponsored legislation, it isn't violating any laws.   A buddy of mine lived in Japan for several years. You are totally correct about their culture, especially so far as work goes, being very uptight, precise, and stressful. However, Japanese folks on the whole are also incredible at cutting loose after the work day ends. Japanese bars are a sight to behold after work.   Pretty simple question I hope. I have an extremely long commute to/from work (about 2.5 hours each way). Along the way, just about every day I see several old pieces of furniture on the curb.  After seeing the prices of some hardwood, I can't help but think this would be a great way to get free source materials.  My biggest concern though - pests. For instance, if it's upholstered, there is a chance that it could harbor bed bugs (they're rampant in our area). If I put it in my car, the bed bugs could take up residency there, and from that point it would just be a matter of time until they made it into my house. So, upholstered stuff just isn't worth the risk given that problem.  What about wooden furniture? What kinds of pests could I be bringing into my house if I brought, say, a desk? What mitigation can I do to ensure I don't bring anything unsavory home?   Oh my god, I was actually thinking of this last night. And here it is on reddit. /u/Niferwee, get out of my head!!   Just want to bolster this. In any time you are dealing with chemical exposure to living things, some are going to be more robust against the chemical than others. This is why in humans, when talking about material safety we refer to it in terms of LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the people exposed). The same applies across all living things. Those who survive are by definition more robust against that chemical (for one reason or another). If they are capable of reproducing, at least some of their offspring will likely inherit this trait.  This is a textbook case of how evolution works.  See also this article from wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance   To be clear, I am talking about endgraun like one would see in butcher blocks. It occasionally pops up in electrics, but I haven't seen anything similar for acoustics.  Does the glue and changing hardwoods make a muddy sound? is it overly brittle....?  Just curious.   I do remember a ton of Russian/Polish/Moldovan places in Brooklyn  too (I had a ton of friends from Moldova). Great food, but watch out for those expiration dates! :)   That's great - but I think you're missing that Acadians WERE French. They were some of the early settlers on North America, and they brought Beignets with them. They then migrated southward where, etymologically speaking, Acadian transformed into "Cajun." So, like I said above, the French can still probably claim Beignets, but just not in mainland France. They're the state food of Loiusiana. Whereas in France... they're just another pastry. The level of emphasis placed on them is considerably different. I'm not saying this out of disrespect to the French culinary tradition, but Cajuns place beignets on a pedestal the French simply don't.  Further, France didn't "invent" them per se. The French beignet, like most carnival doughnuts, is an evolution of the Roman pastry scriblita.   You would think that, but check the wikipedia article for beignets - while the french invented them, New Orleans is the place that's famous for them (specifically Cafe du Monde). Heck, just google "beignet" and you'll see what I mean. They're the state food of Louisiana.  And remember - Cajun culture IS French culture, at least originally - Cajun came from ["Acadian"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians), early French immigrants to north america. So technically the French are still the most famous for it, just not from mainland France.   This is going to be a long post, sorry! I agree it is most likely a variation. My point is people are going after OP because it isn't "authentic," but this is one of those cases where you really have to question "authentic". Lots of other doughnuts aren't entirely authentic - especially not this style. It's a carnival style doughnut (made with all of the crap you had to clean out of your pantry before lent so you wouldn't get tempted). Just like fasnachts, beignets, kinklings, malasadas, and so on.  So does it match what you'd see all over Poland? Probably not, but that also doesn't mean there isn't a single baker there who doesn't prepare it differently. For example, here's yet another form, pczki serowe from a polish baker, in Poland:  http://sprawdzonakuchnia.pl/wp-content/uploads/ewpt_cache/960x640_50_1_c_FFFFFF_cfe767548249254abeae462fa0b2627d.jpg  That's still Polish pczki but appears completely different. Like I said - all of these pastries are variations on a theme: big fatty pastries that you eat to clean all of the lard and other naughty goods out of your pantry before lent. They show up all over Europe, so I'd expect to see massive numbers of different variations. Just because one family does it different from the norm doesn't really make it incorrect, just different. Most of these doughnut recipes were dictated by what was in the pantry. If one family was incredibly poor they may not have had fruit/cream on hand regularly, and so developed their recipe not having any fruit or cream. If one family was wealthy but still wanted to participate in lent, they may have had to cut the pczki so they could stuff everything from the pantry into them (a la OP). Most families would probably fall somewhere in the middle - stuffed fruit inside of the pastry, matching what most Polish folks are used to (a la the traditional pastry you mentioned). That's how these recipes developed. They're a big festival food that served a specific purpose (cleaning out the pantry) so variations are bound to happen based on all kinds of factors.  The whole "It's right!"/"It's Wrong!" argument in a recipe like this is like arguing there is a set ingredient list for ratatouille. In reality it was a dish made by poor people who made it with whatever they had on hand. Fighting for authenticity is a fool's errand because the ingredient list was determined entirely by what was in the garden.  I agree that there is a common notion of what the pastry should be, but that doesn't mean that other family's recipes for the same pastry are inherently wrong - they might just have a different evolution than the popular one.   TIL that most cultures have their own fat tuesday donuts. I have only ever heard of having fasnachts on [Fat Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_%28doughnut%29) but apparently these guys serve the same purpose for the Polish culture.   And if the dough is anything like fashachts (which, based on the description it is), it is going to be relatively high in calorie (about 500 calories) - they're made from potato starch water, flour, sugar, milk, egg, salt, yeast and lard, and then deep fried. That is just the dough before you add any kind of filling. In the case of fasnachts, they're usually either served plain, or covered in powdered sugar/sugar glaze/granulated sugar, and often people cut them open and spread molasses/table syrup on them.   At my old job, I was lucky to be across the street from a Polish deli. The food was cheap, and incredible. I also noticed that as I went back the portions kept getting bigger and bigger :)  If you are ever near Philadelphia, north Philly has a ton of Russian/Polish neighborhoods that you would love.   Relax. Pastries don't always look 100% identical for a number of reasons, and it doesn't always have to do with "legitimacy."  For instance:  [Boston cream donut](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/DD-Boston-Cream-Donut.jpg)  [Original style donut](http://www.krispykreme.com/SharedContent/User/32/321a995f-f001-4062-9767-9670b1b13ed1.png)  [Italian zeppole](http://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Zeppole-3-500x334.jpg)  [Filled italian zeppole](http://stickygooeycreamychewy.com/wp-content/uploads/HLIC/aa9fdd834089b1e79a38413e4e3e8da5.jpg)  [Biegnet in New Orleans](http://hostedmedia.reimanpub.com/TOH/Images/Photos/37/300x300/expsi15704_TH.CW1973175D02_18_1b.jpg)  [Biegnet in Paris](http://voyages.ideoz.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Berliner-boules-de-berlin-beignet.jpg)  All of these are donuts/zeppole/biegnets. They're just either different family recipes, varieties, or regional interpretations. I mean, New Orleans is supposed to set the standard for beignets, but every time I've been to Paris beignets look extremely dissimilar, and the dish in New Orleans evolved from French Beignets. Both are legitimate. Same goes with the donuts and zeppole.   These look like a weird cross between whoopie pies and zeppoli. I approve!   You got it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo   Nope, not yet. It's on the "to buy" list. I can borrow one from the father-in-law. My tool set is rather limited right now, though I am looking to expand. Googling router sleds - this could be perfect! I wanted to make a way wider than normal cutting board and 16"+ planers are incredibly expensive. This seems like it would solve that. Thank you!   The issue wasn't so much the cost of the wood (I can talk to the wife) - the issue is more that every plan I've found requires a planer, and outside of a cheap one I found at harbor freight for $280, the prices for planers quickly soar. I know I can plane by hand but I'm really concerned about how even I can get it by hand   Thanks! I had actually posted something similar on /r/luthier awhile ago and just got rated down. Didn't leave a good first impression, so I figured I would ask here :(  I will definitely look into a workbench! It looks like a really useful first project, and I'm pretty sure it can be assembled without too huge of a spend.    You are *technically* correct, the best kind of correct!   Hey everyone. I really want to begin woodworking, specifically with an eye towards instrument making. However before I start getting into really expensive tonewoods, I want to make sure I have an ok collection of tools and have some experience woodworking under my belt. As the title says, I am a complete newbie. Beyond a pinewood derby car, cutting some crown molding, and shop class in high school, I don't have much experience at all with woodworking. I want to change that.  I had wanted to start by making an end-grain cutting board, but when I saw the price of hardwood (moreso when my wife saw it) there was a very loud lack of enthusiasm. In addition, every plan I've seen required a planer which I don't have. I was looking at the prices of them and it seems like a hefty jump for a first project.  So, can anyone recommend some simple projects for someone who has very few tools and very little experience? I don't mind picking up one tool, so long as it can be purchased reasonably.  I have a 10" miter saw, a table saw, and a jigsaw (outside of the normal tools like hammers/drills/etc). Any advice would be really appreciated.   Yeah, ive seen it spelled out as AP cake, or apea cake. We used to have it all the time - I grew up in Oley, near Reading :)   This is not only delicious looking, but it is freaking beautiful. The downside is it seems like it would be a bitch to serve.   Damn, you are old. Thank god I'm not that old.  Until may.  ...damn.  SCREW YOU LITTLE GIRL!   What the title says. I grew up in PA dutch land, but for the life of me I can't find a decent apea cake recipe online. My family doesn't really have one. Most of the ones I find online have a ton of extra crap that simply doesn't exist in Amish versions (seriously, they don't use nuts, they don't use raisins, etc). Any family or otherwise decent recipes would be very much appreciated.  For those who aren't familiar, Apea cake is an extremely dense PA Dutch coffee cake.    Ive found stevia is good in things that work well with an herbal flavor, like hot tea or herbal soda syrup. Anything where the taste is not herbal, it sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way.  Try it in a cup of coffee, then try it in a cup of tea and you'll see what I mean    Demerara (sp?) Sugar is essentially cane juice that had the liquid evaporated. Not all sugar is the same.   Lamb and veal. Until I eat them. Then I stop feeling bad.  Also, I catch a train near a large pork processing plant every workday. Being stuck in traffic behind a livestock truck packed full of pigs always keeps me keenly aware of where my meat is coming from and why you really should try to buy from small farmers.   Not sure what's going on with this sub lately - people seem to be way more prickish than usual and it's kind of a downer.  Your meal looks killer, and good job for sourcing everything locally.   Actually, they are. They're a cold weather crop, just like most brassicas.   "Full-grown sprouts keep well on the plant in cold weather, making them a great winter harvest item for gardeners in the South (planted in fall). In cold climates, gardeners often bury Brussels sprouts plants up to their tops in hay or leaves in late fall, then pull off the little sprouts as needed through winter."

White pekins breed quite quickly and have an excellent food/mass ratio.   Honestly, save up for it. They're amazingly useful. The accuracy is scary - so much that you'll often doubt the readings you see.  Edit: Seriously, wtf is with these rate downs?   As an American who desperately wants to get out - yes.   First, I'd see if you are near an Indian grocer. A lot of times they have spices in whole form that can then be ground fresh in the home. Whole spices last MUCH longer than ground. Plus at ethnic markets you can buy them in reasonable bulk for a fraction of the price. For instance, instead of buying ground ginger (which could already be a year or more old when you pick it off the shelf so it has very little flavor), go to the indian market, pay a fraction of the price for whole dried ginger and throw it in a spice grinder when you need it.  The same goes with turmeric, dried chilies, cinnamon, black peppercorns, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, etc - there are a bunch available. Just eyeball what you think you'll need and grind up a little more. Grab a few spice containers (or save the ones you have now) to put leftovers in.  You end up paying less for a more stable product that produces superior results.   Root parsley is amazing. It's like carrots, celery, and parsley had a 3-way baby. It's definitely worth trying if you can find it.   Yeah - a friend of mine is a large produce distributor and he introduced me to them when they received some samples. Basically he told me to imagine being a mad dog licking a battery. It was actually a really good way to describe it.   Well, thankfully politicians are going to protect us by maintaining excellent whistleblower laws.  Oh wait.   LOL, I actually have several times. I think they're neat, and they're impossible to find in our area. There is an amazing "secret" cocktail served at the Chandalier Bar at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas that is centered around them. It's called [the Verbena](http://blogs.kcrw.com/goodfood/2014/03/this-cocktail-actually-alters-your-tastebuds-and-makes-you-a-supertaster/).   Ahh, I too have to deal with the non-dairy non-gluten vegetarian challenge every time our friends get together. Here is a personal favorite (recipe based on the 2nd issue of Co-Operative magazine, but with some personal flare). The whole thing takes maybe a half hour with prep.  **Citrus Curd**  * Finely grated zest of 3 citrus fruits (at least 1 lemon) * Juice of those 3 fruits (again, at least 1 lemon) * 3 large eggs * 2 free range egg yolks * 175g caster sugar (just throw regular sugar into a food processor for 1 minute, don't waste money buying it) * 100g unsalted butter cut in chunks  **Optional meringue:**  * Reserve the 2 whites from the yolks above * 100g additional caster sugar * pinch cream of tartar * 1.5tsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp of water  Bring a pot of water to a boil, and grab a large mixing bowl that can be set over top. A double boiler works well too. Whisk together the juice, zest, 175g sugar, eggs, and yolks and place the double boiler/bowl over the boiling water, making sure it is not in contact with the water. Add the butter and keep whisking. Once the butter has melted, keep stirring until thickened (the specific term you are looking for here is nappe, when the curd can coat the back of a spoon, and when you can see trails where the whisk has been). This should be about 175 to 180 (do NOT go beyond that).  Use your eyes and see if there are any chunks of curdled eggs. If so, strain through a sieve. Serve into single serving ramekins or cups. Allow to cool.   **Optional:** Before serving, whisk the reserved eggwhites with the cornstarch slurry and a pinch of cream of tartar until they are at soft peaks (cornstarch will prevent the meringue from sweating if it sits out for awhile). Add the remaining 100g of caster sugar slowly while whisking. Bring to stiff peaks. Place a dollop on top of the curd and and hit with a blowtorch to brown the meringue. Be really careful if doing this in plastic serving dishes. It may also be a good idea to use pasteurized eggs if you take this route.   Scale. Kitchenaid stand mixer. Thermapen. Bread machine. Induction cooktop. Food processor.  The scale and induction cooktop are must haves, the rest just make life faster and easier    Cooking is just a set of simple techniques you combine. There are very few "single use" techniques out there.  Also, there are no set ingredients on provincial food. Poor people used what they had. Don't worry about "authentic" ingredients because poor people didn't usually have the luxury of being choosy. Trying to be authentic usually makes dishes inauthentic.   Chickpea tuna salad. Mash up canned chickpeas with a potato masher or fork. Treat like tuna and make "tuna salad". Serve on pitas or rolls.   Hey everyone. I am growing these in the garden for the first time this year (my garden is going fallow for a year to get rid of some pest infestations and give some fungal problems a year to die away).  I fully expect to have a ton of the buttons on hand - I'm sowing a ton of seeds. However I can find very little on how to store the buttons for the long term.  Can they be dried? Can I freeze them?  I will probably xpost this in /r/gardening because it kind of straddles discussion about gardening and how to store an ingredient.   Eh, not my thing but if it gets a few more folks to make music, why not.  Sure it's lazy, but I can see some folks being interested if they have muscle problems or just lack the confidence.   One does not simply.... see what a helicopter can do.   Thank you so much, you've been a big help!   After more research, I am thinking of picking up some cheap "project" or otherwise broken guitars on ebay to get started. I figure it will let me know the lay of the land, and I can start to build up the tools organically as I fix things. Maybe I can even make a few bucks once I get better at it.  Again, thank you a lot.   No idea :(   Ordered on the 13th of January, ship date is between May 27th and July 2nd.  After getting frustrated by reading people who placed their orders a week ago get ship dates a month sooner than me, I called amazon to find out what was going on. Apparently their order systems are overloaded and aren't really built to handle this sort of massive backorder. They're working to resolve it, but if you ordered in the past 2 weeks your shipping time may be off quite a bit.   Groovy! At the very least, it'll make the bottom drop out on the SEK-2000 kits :)   Hey everyone. I really want to take a stab at a kit guitar to get started. I've been looking at Blues Creek guitar kits, and they seem to have fantastic support.  I know I need to get some hand tools, but the one thing I am most concerned about is either buying or building a binding jig. Is this necessary? I'm trying to make my first build as affordable as possible because there's a good chance I'll cock it up somehow :)  Are there any other required tools that I really need to get started? I know i need to get a jigsaw - I have a tablesaw to build some of the jigs if necessary (even if they won't be beautiful).   I ordered mine on January 12th, and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Wtf.   First, I'll probably get rated down for this, but frankly my karma is skyhigh and I really don't care.  Is anyone else a bit frustrated with how this rollout is going? I ordered as soon as I realized an invite was available to me (it went into my spam bucket for a few days), and was given an estimate of May 27th to July 2nd. Now, I see posts [like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2ygdx9/question_about_wait_time_for_echo_invite/) that show an estimate from May 20th to June 15th. I placed my order on January 12th. Why the hell is a user who ordered a week ago receiving a unit ahead of me?  Last night there was a post that Amazon is [making refurb units available](http://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/2zn7s4/fyi_refurbished_units_are_available_for/) but there are still tons of users who haven't even gotten new units yet.  If they have refurb units available, why aren't they making it an option for users who have been waiting for months now? Especially when they're going to let new buyers seemingly get bumped to the head of the line.  On top of it, when I and another user "dared" to comment on that thread about how it was frustrating, we both got downvoted to hell.  This rollout is incredibly frustrating, and it seems like people on this sub are perfectly happy to downvote anyone who mentions it.   Not to threadjack, but did he mention anything about 2012 sets? Sammy promised 4 years of updates, and 5 years of support. So far the only specs I've seen on the SEK-3000 are that it supports f-series and higher. I have a 51" e7000 and can't find much of anything about it.   I wonder how it would fare in conjunction with chamomile?   Trey and Matt got tired of it, thats why they started southparkstudios.com so you can watch the series for free.   Good. Fark them and any other idiots who think that suing the people who support you is a good idea.   Alone in the world is a little catdog :(   Yup, its open to all. They will ask if you have a business or if its for personal use. They are literally next door to another store called restaurant depot that requires an affiliation. Guess which one usually has a full parking lot :) because it gets them lots of business, I dont think they have any plans to change.  I go there to get stuff like trays, cooling racks, bone cleavers and other knives that are meant to get beat to hell, pizza peels, graduated food storage containers, etc.  About 3/4ths of the place is equipment, 1/4th is canned goods, mixes, yeasts, etc.   Kinda frustrating that they have refurb stock when I am still backordered from late may to late july.    Dear OP, I'm guessing you're across the world from me, but if I am ever in the same country would you mind giving me a ride? I'll pay for fuel and help you with the preflight checklist. I love flying. I especially love flying like this.   Yeah, that's basically how it tastes. It's an interesting cheese because unlike most other cheeses that are made from curd, gjetost is made by simmering leftover whey down for hours until it turns to sludge. The caramel flavor and sweetness comes from the whey caramelizing. It should be sliced really thin. It goes great on crackers or with toast for breakfast, but I'm a cheese geek, lol.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost   Hmm... well... what has he been most interested in? Is he looking for recipes, or science, or techniques? "The Professional Chef" from the CIA is a killer book if he's interested in learning techniques along with recipes.  If you don't have it, see if you can get a copy of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook (or if you're really lucky, a copy of the Boston School of Cooking Cookbook - they're the same thing, but the Boston one is the much older name).  Another thing you could try - see if there are any library or charity book sales in the area. A lot of times you can find tons of cookbooks for cheap - you can grab a bunch and see if any tickle his fancy.   Google "donburi" and go wild. They're fantastic dishes that are entirely centered around rice. Usually, it's rice with some kind of enchanting broth or gravy poured over it.  Also, learn to cook some Indian food :)   It sounds like you're talking about gjetost, and I've never heard of someone not liking it before. That's sad :(   obligatory http://www.quickmeme.com/img/c4/c4cb618674597b62f6c5069d6d78117ac72140dd022a30b7cdd23feb2ac7c966.jpg   Mama mia!  Seriously though, it goes excellent in soup. Make some chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Slice escarole into 1/4 inch strips and add into broth (you can also wilt it in another pan, but meh to extra dishes). Season with salt and pepper.  If you want to go really fancy, you can add some pasta, chunk up some parmesean/ramano rinds, and small parbroiled meatballs (place them under a broiler for about 1-2 minutes, not long) to your soup. You'll have essentially created a very simple italian wedding soup.   Your recipe seems correct. However you are missing one last step - you have to "fluff" couscous after you have cooked it. Take a fork (or rice paddle) or two and start to toss it around in the bowl and then transfer to another container.   If it seems really dry, you can boil more liquid and pour it into the couscous and re-cover for a few more minutes. Then fluff again. This becomes important when you're making really large amounts of it (like if you are using it to stuff a crown rack or something) because the ratios get weird.  It's really easy stuff to work with. Try not to overthink it :)   Depends how it's been made. If it's fairly plain, I'd say, mash it up add an egg or two, a tbsp or two of milk, and 2 slices of white bread that are ground up (you may need to adjust this). Shape into disks and fry. Improvised latkes. Serve with sour cream.  Or trade it to some of your college buddies in exchange for beer. Then drink the beer.   It's also great for other college activities. Going camping for the weekend? Bring your skillet. The best part about cast iron is the damn things are nigh indestructible.   If you are near northern NJ, the Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton PA area has a chain called "The Restaurant Store" that doesn't require an affiliation. Should be about an hour and a half from you. I'm lucky to live about 10 minutes away.  http://www.therestaurantstore.com/  It's worth the trip if you want to stock up on stuff.   Another reason you missed - you can't put nonstick cookware in dishwashers. Most decent sized kitchens will have industrial dishwashers these days.   Cast iron. It doubles as a weapon that can be used in self-defense.   *twitch*   You slap him and take it back. Knife abuse is not allowed on /r/cooking.   Yup, this is pretty much all you need to do. Usually I do this after using my ice cream maker anyway (because my kitchenaid mixer ice cream maker sucks and I really miss my old donvier handcrank one).  Usually I make it first thing in the morning, and set a timer every 30 minutes. When it goes off, scrape it up and stir it. Repeat until it's a nice smooth texture. Your goal is to prevent large ice crystals from forming.   I'd pick up the Good Eats series for him. If he already has it, pick out a few of the Americas Test Kitchen/Cook's Illustrated/Cook's Country season cook books.   Interesting, I'll take a look. Honestly, a lot of it comes down to semantic arguments. There were gas chambers. They were used. People were gassed to death. Whether it was carbon monoxide or HCN, it doesn't really matter. Fact is, folks were murdered en masse.  Edit: Interesting - it looks like both were used. Auschwitz/Birkenau used HCN, most of the others used exhaust. I guess it really supports the reputation of auschwitz being a death factory :(  	145

Uranium needs to be about 90% pure to work in a nuclear weapon and only 5% for a power plant   They have been enriching it to 20% - The agreement is that will stop  and they will only enrich it past 3.67% for 15 years   They currently have 2200 pounds of the 20% enriched. They have agreed to give up 97% they already have.   It is enriched by centrifuges.  There are two types.    One is designed in the 70s which runs on very old outdate software comparable to an Atari game.   The other is a high tech version that is much faster   efficiently  Iran has none and will not be allowed to have any of these.   Iran currently has 19,000 of the old inefficient type.   The deal specifies this number be reduced to 6,000. And only the old and inefficient ones   Iran would be allowed to conduct research and development on advanced centrifuges. But not produced or possess them.    Two ways to make plutonium:    Spent fuel rods used in enriching uranium can be used to make plutonium. Iran does not have this reprocessing ability. The deal specifies they cannot seek to gain this knowledge or ability and bans such processing plants.   The second way is a reactor that is specifically designed to produce it. Iran currently has one such reactor that is not yet operational.    The deal specifies this core from this facility be  destroyed or removed from the country    Anything produced from this facility is required to be shipped out of the country.   The other underground facility would partly converted to advanced nuclear research and the production of medical isotopes. About two thirds of its centrifuges would be removed. Foreign scientists would be present. It would have no fissile material that could be used to make a bomb.   This was one of Israels biggest concerns    Unprecedented levels of inspections including on site inspectors, camera and Seals. Uranium is tracked from the time it comes out of the ground, through the processing until it is stored in cylinders. Ability to see what they are importing and exporting. Inventory control.   Inspections anywhere in the country that could investigate suspicious sites or allegations of a covert enrichment facility. (details still be worked out)   The issue of when the sanctions are to be removed still looms as one of the potential obstacles to a final agreement on June 30.   UN Security Council resolutions on Irans nuclear program will be lifted simultaneously. A transparent procurement channel will be established, allowing Iran to get what it needs for civilian nuclear development while giving assurances to the world that the materials will not be diverted for non-peaceful use.    International cooperation to help Iran in research and development.     #When nothing goes right..., just sit back and enjoy what's left.  *Backpackwayne*      #Any child can make a mistake -  It takes a man to admit hes made one   #Everyone Falls - But that doesn't negate the climb  (a train_subject8344 original)     #APRIL FOOLS!!! - Can't get rid of me that easy. :D   #Don't Worry if Plan A Fails.

Thank you so much. :D               This year /r/SantasLittleHelpers brought Christmas to over 700 families proving together, we  can create miracles.   * **[SantasLittleHelpers Christmas Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aJPNO4KPIk feature=youtu.be)**   Happy Birthday Sue - We couldn't do this without you.  **WE LOVE YA!**    http://www.troll.me/images/pissed-off-obama/you-happy-birthday-playa.jpg   You may notice our **New User Registered** flair featured in red. This means the request is being made by an account younger than 60 days old.  We strongly suggest you take extra precautions and try to find ways to apply help more directly rather than sending cash.  We hope this tool will assist you in making more informed decisions.    ----------------------  **Other tips and tools to promote safe giving:**   * **APPLY ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY WHEN POSSIBLE!!!**  We highly recommend you pay the bill or buy the item instead of sending the money to the OP - This assures  money is going where they say it is** (EX: If someone is asking for help with a utility bill, pay that bill rather than giving the OP money)    * **ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING GIVING** - Dont be reluctant to ask  OP personal questions by PM - You wouldn't give a perfect stranger  help without  asking them a few questions - If the OP is reluctant to supply the information  by PM,  we recommend you do not give - It is up to the OP to supply you with the comfort and proof you desire and require - Get this information **BEFORE** you give!!!  * **This does not give anyone the right to  harass someone or subject them to a public trial:** - Be polite and respectful and do not make unfounded accusations. You do **not** have the right to put someone on trial - If you have concerns, contact the mods and be prepared to present proof  * **USE COMMON SENSE:** Take a moment to gather information about the requester. - Look at their overview page and history -  Gather any information  needed to pursue someone if they do not live up to their end of the bargain before you supply  assistance - Once you have given, you will not have that opportunity   ----------------  **EDIT:**  * * As pointed out bt our moderator u/rhubey,  if you help someone by paying a bill for them, talk to someone from the billing department or customer service to make sure they do not keep your card information on file as the default payment card. This will avoid your card ever being used again by accident or even on purpose. Thanks you rhubey for this excellent advice.      I want to have a few rules appear in the box when you make a post in my subreddit. (r/assistance). You know so people can not miss it.   Is there anyone out there that might be willing to do this for me?     /r/SantasLittleHelpers brings Christmas to hundreds of families every year who wouldn't have otherwise been able to join in the giving. The only thing as awesome as the giving itself, is to see the results as pictures come in from all over the world of families opening their present on Christmas Day.   Here is the video from Christmas 2013:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyt_JwBDeQ  We are looking to do the same and are eagerly searching for one of you fine and talented individuals who is willing to put together a  video for Christmas 2014.  We have hundreds and hundreds of photos and have a background song already picked out. Is there someone out there who would be willing to help us out?   Don't do anything stupid and just stay inside. Be ready for the worst. We are here for you.    **STAY WARM NOW!!!**      I am making this request on behalf of /u/justaluckyshot, one of our mods and a good friend. Yesterday he lost someone very dear to him and the family needs help with the funeral costs. I can provide a paypal address if you care to help.  Justaluckyshot is famous for helping folks out here with car problems of all kinds. He has helped so many and I am asking for help in his time of need.      So what do you all think of this new show that is replacing Stephen Colbert?                         Is there a log that will tell me who has been deleting entries on a spreadsheet and what those entries were?  There are about 12 people who have full access. I believe one of them is deleting entries that they shouldn't be. I would like to find out who and the information they have been deleting.   If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know.  Thank you.      At work I have this guy constantly telling me to relax. Actually I am very relaxed but this certain comment does kind of irk me. I'm looking for a comeback that doesn't come across like I am angry the least. Just some sort of jab to shut him up.

 I hope it does too. This week has made my holiday/brithday.    I have only been in Dubrovnik so far but I am going to Split next Tues. So far Dubrovnik is one of the most beautiful places i have been too with loads to do and I have only been here for three days. The city has a massive hill to the left and beautiful sea and islands to the right so gives it a look that is very hard to find in other scenery's. It is also very cheap over here as well so would highly recommend it for travelling. I could message you when I get to Split and let you know how it is over there if you would like?   Sophie Turner "Sansa" and Natalie Dormer "Marjorie" are reportedly shooting nearby as well so I am keeping my eye out too see if I can ambush them as well.   They may be. I spoke to a set worker yesterday and he said they will be filming around Croatia for the next two months.   Pile Gate is great, did you recognise that the little path just through the gate was where Joffrey caused the riot in Fleabottom?   If anyone is interested, I also put up a photo of a Season 4 set piece with the "Red Keep" in the background which I found the day before about 15 minutes away from where i met Brienne.   Yeah her character is meant too be unattractive by Westoros standards. She is in fact really thin, with a soft spoken British accent and so friendly. Yeah she is about 6"3. When we saw her we double taked as she did not look like Brienne apart from the height but she is really tall.   No I would be skeptical too. Me and my gf just managed to book the right place at the right time. Adds a new level of fun to a holiday.   It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been too. Once you get past the loads of locations they use for GoT, there is still plenty more architecture, history and natural beauty to admire. I really recommend it and it is quite cheap.      	10
 I've heard the same thing.  Though I haven't yet had the opportunity to use an H6. I've also hesrd the User  Interface is much cleaner.  In that price range the Tascam you suggested might be your best bet.   What mics are you using?     I've had many similar experiences on set and all I can say is it gets better. In class projects tend to be crappy. You get stuck in groups with people that have no ambition and no interest in learning any of the skills necessary to make a good film. My experience at film school was that there are two kinds of students that go there. The ones that go to class and the ones that go to set.  You'll start to build up contacts of people you like working with at school and your projects will improve as you start to weed out the lazy kids.  I'm not a director,  just a sound guy, but knowing who to work with is incredibly important.    Also saw you were in Midwest and I'm in Chicago and completely agree with your analysis of Columbia College.   I should make the correction that screen writing students hate feedback. The profressionals know its part of the industry.     Both and joke and true. The only person who hates feedback more than the sound guy is the writer.  	4

 If I see more of these types of posts.... dear lord shoot me   Yeah, but it does make a difference when one team has a Guan Yu and the other team has nobody to heal.   Also if he does this, try to save him but don't let him rope you in and get you killed also.   Khumbhakarna, chasing enemies who can't do any damage to you and yawning them over and over is so amusing   Don't forget you can place a ward around the corner so that when the time comes, certain gods will have vision, such as Neith having vision for her ulti   But then it's a Hercules support who doesn't need that petty health pot.   On top of that, people with actual issues (such as recently my power went out) would suffer for something they couldn't help, which isn't really fair.   I miss old Freya when you could build physical items and crit with her.   I currently have him to mastery 10 and personally feel he is not as fun as the other Guardian's, the thing going for him is the moment when you get a shield off that saves somebody at the last moment.   Don't worry, Athena is just as good.   And unlike 4v4 because it's chaotic, the game games go faster, as apposed to just farming, one side team wipes and then it's gg.   Kali 1v1   It appears it was developed by Ymir, so it must be good!   What game is it?   Would be awesome if they tested out an all chat like in LoL, then you could talk to each other and compliment them easier. But would need to be used for a bit and get feedback.   Well I play Aphrodite Solo, I prioritize warlocks sash so that I get get the stacks early and sometimes I like to start with a bumba's mask since the mana regen on that can really help, but otherwise I'd go with a shroud.   Would be great if somebody in the community could do this to work with you and create a proper launcher image as not much can be judged with that, although it doesn't seem like a bad idea.   Looking at their team, I'm guessing they ran Apollo and Artemis duo?  	18

He asks, "Wouldn't it just be easier to bury him in the black suit that he's wearing?"  But she insists that it must be a blue suit and gives him a blank check to buy one.  When she comes back for the wake, she sees her husband in the coffin and he is wearing a beautiful blue suit. She tells the director how much she loves the suit and asks how much it cost. He says, "Actually, it didn't cost anything.  The funniest thing happened.  As soon as you left, another corpse was brought in, this one wearing a blue suit.  I noticed that they were about the same size, and asked the other widow if she would mind if her husband were buried in a black suit.  She said that was fine with her. So...

 God. Damnit.  I will find you, and I will play Barbie Girl RIGHT AT YOU    /r/whatsthisbug might enjoy this one.    I just said "If you want me for anything, I'm super active on Google+"  Got the one circle notification a week later. If they don't want to join, let 'em be.  I still have my FB open, but I connect it to nothing, just in case some distant friend wants me for something.   Motivated me to lose weight.  /r/loseit   /r/keto   and /r/getmotivated got me going. Now it's just a case of keeping at it.   (Sorry for the thumbnail there, it's all I've got on the guy, a photo of the sign taken while out running)      I drink a lot of Jack Daniels + Apple Juice when I go out sometimes. Stuff's killer.  If I'm feeling particularly flash, I go for White Russians. (Kahlua, Vodka, cream and milk)  Abide.   Applejack. Followed by my own art. Followed by more ponies.  Yeah, that's me alright.   Conehead slays me every time  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORQFk5GcgFI   (Replied to Fic7i0n41 :) )   A bit of both, really. My home city was ravaged by a plague, forcing survivors to flee.   During my escape attempt, I was confronted by a wolf. I didn't really learn I was cursed until my 3rd transformation, at that point, I had gained some control over the beast inside.  I have since made it to another city, but the situation here is so tough, I'm merely making ends meet by doing odd jobs here and there, before leaving the city at night, just in case.  And, for my dietary needs, I have been eating a lot more meat. Rarer, too. Comes with the species, I suppose.   I'm 25, and I'm a female, if that counts for anything. Only one other person knows of my curse, and she's sworn to keep it secret.   Feels good having a local lad win the gold! Went to school and hung in the pub 2 minute down th' road from my current residence.   We're ripping it up in the Velodrome, eh? They were right with "Home turf advantage" Never seen the brits go mad for it like they have been doing for the past week and a half   Obligatory /r/asexuality plug   22, Male, Warehouser/Game Designer in Training   That's pretty easy, It was one of my first.  I was hired by a Canir - A canine-looking race of people - to find her husband - who had gone missing a year or two ago, who was a Human. Now, I'm not one for interracial relationships - but hey, who am I to argue?  Anyway, after a month or two I found the poor guy begging in one of the slums on a Purseus station. He'd come here to get some "Augs"  Unfortunately, the guy didn't read the T Cs correctly and got filled with untested Augs. Became a Guinea Pig. It was like looking at a Picasso Painting. Didn't want to go home to his partner, so he spent years on Purseus. Took him back after a lot of persuading.   He wasn't the only guy affected by these cowboy implanters. Station #7 is filled with them.  But what got me the most, was despite his grotesque appearance, his partner still took him back without so much as a second look at him.  Love is a helluva drug. But you won't ever catch me with Augs, even though every other D in the Universe is rocking them.   I change it up.   Sometimes, I'll wear a button-up shirt open, over a plain t-shirt or just a plain graphic tee, either wearing jeans or cargo pants. Skate shoes or steel-toed work boots.  I have long hair, pretty much always tied up in a Ponytail (I'm Male)    They're pretty common out in the far reaches of the Andromeda, but the areas close to the transporter gates are squeaky clean, although the songs you speak of aren't really well known any more. It's all about the thumping basslines and the wacky synthesiser in most places.  Don't get me started on the "Dames". You wouldn't believe how many times I've been tailing a guy and he's sent a fine lookin' lass over to "see" me. More often than not, it's a distraction. They're easy to spot when they're only a distraction. Comes with the job.   Toan is pretty robotic, really. He's a little boring, but he's really helpful! I should really get a fun AI one day, just to see his reaction.  Travelling times between galaxies are pretty instantaneous, the gates enable this - it's just the travelling _to_ the gates that take time! Most gates are a few days travel from the more popular areas, thanks mostly to FTL travel.   So in short - Average is a few days.  None of us really know how the gates work, though.   Male, 22, English. As of 1st August 2012 - I am 265lbs and 6ft 2in  Might be a good motivation to actually fully jump on board!   Can't talk too much about my latest quarry, hell, don't know much about him myself yet.   It's the year 2150 in standard Earth (Not like that means much anymore..), though the rest of the Universe has their calendars set at 6630.  I have a small frigate I pilot alongside my ship's AI, Toan  Ask me Anything!    I may have misheard that, but did he say something about "The President of the United Kingdom"?  Edit: After a re-listen on my home speakers rather than my crappy work speakers, he says "Leaders, past and present of the United Kingdom"   Oh, cool. It was such a strange find for me, I've never seen anything other than a normal Moth.. It looked like a fuzzy ball with wings.   Not entirely sure where it might have come from, though - it flew out from behind a box in the back of a courier's van.      [](/pinkiefear)And now, reading your post, I have realised the exact same thing. I have dragons all over my shelves... but ponies are situated on my monitor, on my wallpapers, on my phone, on my shirts.  [](/fluttersrs)Those blasted sneaky ponies.  [](/twicrazy "I wouldn't have it any other way!")   [](/05)She was missing for half the episode, doesn't count!   [](/20)But she was kind of super awesome in that episode to be fair, but she really didn't have much screentime in S2 overall, I thinks.    [](/00) Yes! Season 2 didn't get nearly enough AJ-centric episodes.   I'm heading in this weekend. I'll be in a cowboy hat. Lurking with two cosplayers. If you spot us, wave!   Oh man. I played with First and Only in the Rochdale area - they had a mill before the place was closed down for demolition, I think.  Anyway. It was the last game, so it was fancy dress day. I turned out in full pirate gear. Sash, frilly shirt, headband. The works.  We had a guy who looked similar to the Sniper from TF2, and the only other guy I can remember was a guy in full 80's disco getup.  Lets just say, to anyone observing on the outside, A pirate with a latex knife chasing a guy in a disco getup looked pretty hilarious.  Or serious, if they didn't know gaming was going on.   http://jamey4.deviantart.com/art/Derpy-Hooves-Raining-Tears-287325411  There's the source!   Any chance of sharing the skins? I'm interested in that music one.. Vinyl is best.   Pretty much lurking all day.   My dog, once being presented his dish of food, will wait until I have left the room before he proceeds to eat.  I tested this. I put his dish down, and stood on the other side of the same room. He just looked at me until I walked through the door.   I feel like I've accomplished something now.   Not directly, but Commander Shep in ME3. The ending I got... I cried   It all depends on the driver of the car - in the UK, we insure the car for certain people to drive it.   For example, if it was just my dad on the policy, it might cost about 700 for him, because he's been driving way longer than I have, and he's in the lesser risk age group.   It really is a rip off - but build up a decent no claims and it'll go right down.  Up until this month's renewal, I was paying 2,200 for my insurance - I drive a Toyota Aygo. A reliant robin could probably go faster than me on long straights.  Seems like I'm plugging, but Insure the Box have brought my premium right down - my renewal this month is 1,011. Sure you're getting tracked, but I look at it this way - if it gets nicked, the insurers probably know where it is.   Yeah, I saw that.. "Wait, he's done it _again?_"   Radio 2 is awesome, though I just tune in for Ken Bruce and Jeremy Vine. Evans and Wright annoy me a little bit.  Moyles just sends me in a frothing rage if I'm stuck in the office and someone has Radio 1 on.   Our company has an incentive: Go an entire working year (For us - Oct 1st to Sept) and you'll qualify for... An extra day on your paid days off.  I'd much rather take a sickie or two..   Interlink/DPD aren't too bad - don't know the costs, mind.  We use them where I work and everything arrives in one piece.    She's usually posting naked pictures of character's she's voiced.  Tara is the troll queen of Twitter.   Right on. Hopefully it was theirs! No idea why it'd be in Bolton, though!   You're form Farnworth? Awesome, as am I.   As I said in the title, long shot. This is the closest I can get to Bolton on reddit!  Was heading down Hacken Bridge Lane in Farnworth. (Connects Little Lever to Bolton, pretty much) and there was a lady looking a little confused pulled over by the side of the road. There's an albino Ferret bouncing about the place.  After a little while, the little guy jumped in the lady's hand. A quick box was made and she took it home - She said she'd call the RSPCA once she got home.  The little guy was definitely a pet. He was scared, but very friendly and ran all over my back and shoulders.  If you know anyone who's lost a Ferret, the RSPCA probably has him/her!   There's some at various car dealerships, but north of the city, and within the city itself, I haven't really seen them. Though I've not really actively looked for them.   First use the Every X minutes too, but before I thought "Fuck it, I'll get a car", the service I used to catch to get to work was on a "One every 10 minutes" service.  I was waiting for nearly an hour once. (Got to the stop about 8:15 - bus got there about 9am)   I think they retconned the Thermal clips into the ME lore, rather than have it introduced as a new tech.  Of course, I'm probably talking out of my arse.   Gravy on _everything_  Yes! Even _Ice Cream_!   We let 'em have it this year. We all got distracted by the shiny thing on fire outside this time   Please! At least Pies can hold gravy without walling apart!  Speaking of gravy - have you all learned that Gravy is amazing on chips yet?   Yeah - Well. We have all the pies! We don't need none of your nancy southern shitey food.   Not sure, really - I'm not too in depth with the technical stuff - might wanna check for a virus or something.. Might have fuddled with your settings or something. But yeah, /flushdns pretty much makes your DNS server get its shit together.  Glad it worked for you! Didn't work for mine, though! Your DNS server is what "decodes" www.google.co.uk into 74.125.131.94   Bash that IP into your browser, and it loads google. If your DNS is malfunctioning, if you put in a website's IP, it'll still load fine.  If your computer's DNS is screwy, there's a few public ones you can use, too. Normally a flush usually fixes problems.   My aunt's latop has this issue as well. If you can, try flushing your DNS - might be that. Might as well renew your IP while you're at it.  go to cmd:      ipconfig /release     ipconfig /renew     ipconfig /flushdns     I walk down here occasionally. You get to it by walking through Moses Gate park. It's probably a good mile and a half to reach the canals, but it's a really nice walk.   [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORQFk5GcgFI), last night  Didn't stop for 20 minutes.   I played the Beta Weekend #3 and I'll probably be playing when I get home for the final weekend beta  From what I played last week, it didn't seem too bad - the combat was a bit standard really, but I liked the "Class" mixing you could do. I was running around with a hammer and a shotgun and was doing pretty well.  I did a solo dungeon and it was more based on infiltration and disabling security rather than tanking and spanking your way through the place. If the group dungeons kept this up, I could see it being really interesting!  My main issues were with the combat and the quests.   When an NPC offers two kinds of the same quest, it gets annoying having to run back to the same guy, then probably run back off to where you came from   I had a waterproof MP3 player a while back. (I've lost the charger cable since, and it wasn't your basic MicroUSB port)  I'd recommend this, though! http://www.amazon.co.uk/Speedo-Aquabeat-1GB-Waterproof-Player/dp/B0017KRAFK/ref=tag_stp_s2_edpp_url   He deleted the entire story. :(   Surely you checked inside? What was in? I am curious.   You owe me a new monitor. I just punched mine out of instinct.   I was driving back to work after a quick trip across Manchester. I was using the Motorways, as it was about a 20 mile journey.  I was about 500 meters to the exit slip road I needed to take, and the road I was on was a sweeping right turn and my tyre burst.   I tried as hard as I could to keep the car straight by gripping the wheel as tight as possible and trying to hold it right, but the damn thing was rocking harder than a metalhead at a Slayer gig.  Eventually, one of the other tyres blew, and I was sent careering into the barrier seperating the two directions at 60MPH. Head on.  Hit the barrier, but it didn't totally stop me. My car did a full 180 and hit the barrier with the back end. This stopped me.   I was now facing oncoming traffic, whizzing past me at 65-70MPH. Luckily, the lunch rush hour was done, and a fellow road user had pulled up on the hard shoulder when he saw me fling off the road. He waved me over, I was good to quickly drive over and hang on the hard shoulder.  Come to think of it - I was lucky to even start the car and move across lanes without getting taken out again, never mind surviving and having not even a single scratch or injury.   but I h(av)e no urge to have sex with them, at least at this point.  That's generally the basic definition of Asexuality - A lack of Sexual attraction/desire  Asexuals still have a _romantic_ attraction, and are labelled much like their "Sexual" labels. (Hetero, Homo, Demi, Pan), (Just replace [X]Sexual with [X]Romantic)  Aromantic Asexuals on the other hand have no desire for sex, nor relationships. They'd much prefer to have no relationships whatsoever and just do their thing through life.  That's the best way I can put it - if anyone else can explain it better, read theirs! I'm fairly new to the concept of Asexuality myself - only known about it for a few months (I also identify as a Hetero/Demiromantic Asexual)   Looks familiar. May have done a little parkour training there in the past. May go lurking later.   In my school, we had the normal kids, the chavs, and us. We hung around the same building every break we had. At first, There was just the 5 of us. We were pretty nerdy.   We just hung around talking about games, and D D stuff. We were also into metal and rock, so we were outcast from the rest of the kids, who were mostly into Dance and R B and all that kinda stuff.  Anyway - 5 grew to 10, which grew to 20, which grew to the point where a few years after the inital 5 had left, the entire building would be pretty much swarmed by kids who were like us. They had to be dispersed at one point, I think.  They called us "The O-block crew"   http://mylittlefacewhen.com/f/648/  Good question, Rarity.   I'm overweight. Been so for about 6 years. I'm 19stone (266lbs - 120kg), and I'm 6'2". 22 years old   I was an avid swimmer in my younger years and took part in meets and races. Due to this, I had a ravenous appetite which I appear to have kept for the last 8 years since I quit swimming to pursue studies. One minute I was a healthy weight, next I was just getting bigger and bigger. Luckily, the fat has spread around my body, rather than being focused on one part - though I'm very concious about my thighs when I'm sat down.  I've started to cut down on my intake, as well as go for long walks with the dog. I can walk for miles and miles just fine, but I can barely manage 1 minute of running.  I'm trying the C25K program, but my lungs despise me for it, though I'm going to keep pushing!   My ideal weight is about 80lbs away.   I had this, but not as severe! I was lined up for this surgery too, but managed to outgrow it before my 16th.

When I get a minor brainfart, I always remember Vertical coasters rock because they go straight down.   Worked all day. Stuck in a van in Manchester. The Van had no air conditioning.    Tell me about it. Feels worse when you're in a metal box stuck in traffic with no aircon!   Oh wow. I remember seeing these in summer and they looked just like that. Kinda glad I didn't touch it now.  These are way off a beaten path, though, Guess that's why no-ones bothered with them.    Picture taken last year while out walking. Little Lever, UK.  'Scuse the dog, he's nuts.      Oh no. Here goes all my free time. Well, what was left of it anyway.   This one might need a bit of backstory to understand  Okay, so, back in September 2010, I had a tyre blow out on me on the motorway. I spun out and collided with the barrier twice, car was totalled.  Shortly after, I shaved all my hair off (It was a big deal, it was halfway down my back, had been growing it for about 6 years) I think I might have had a slight mental breakdown.  Anyway, I work with some very lax guys, not at all afraid of offending.  When I turned up to work with no hair, they fell off chairs laughing. Serial Killer [Raoul Moat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Northumbria_Police_manhunt) was all over the news, and I apparently looked like him.  I am now nicknamed Raoul.   I'm not sure what it's called, I played it last year at Download Festival  It's fairly simple. Stick a 1/4 filled bottle between 2 teams. The teams can be any size. Try and get the space between the teams about 20ft.  Each team takes turns throwing the "ball" to try and hit the bottle. If you hit the bottle, your team grabs your cans, opens 'em and starts chugging. The other team has to run, stand the bottle up and retrieve the ball and get back to their line, and shout STOP!  It's made slightly difficult, as the "ball" is off shaped (We used Toilet Roll wrapped up in Duct tape) and is prone to bouncing all over the place. Also, if that wasn't bad enough, if you somehow knock over one of the other team's cans, you gotta run and pick that up.  First team to get ALL their cans chugged is the winner!   Should anyone invade the pub, put on some Queen, and attack the intruders with cricket bats. Run around them to disorient   ... That sounds like something my boss would do. Was there any chance that this man was shiny-head bald?   He sounds like an awesome shopkeeper. Where is this fine fellow located?   I think she was too busy "Blasting off aga^a^a^a^a^in" to be remorseful [](/fluttershy)   They played part of a new track when I saw them in October, it sounded totally awesome. RR have reached.. 12th in my all time most played, and I've been keeping that record going for about 5 years now or something. Kinda scary.   Manchester Ritz. I'm so excited. :D  It'll be my 5th time seeing them within a year.   Ah, Per Andreasson. Total dude. Spoke with him a few times after shows. Goin' watching them again on Tuesday! :D   Aha! Dude, that's awesome.   Hmmm,  Feck it! Surprise me with the flair! :D  (Holy shit I actually saw this before the allotted time passed.)   Me and my sis were helping my dad pave the new bit of garden he was working on, so there was a huge pallet of bricks, and a huge bag of sand. I was throwing bricks onto the bag of sand, and my sister was running back and forth from my dad to where I was throwing the bricks.   I was throwing faster than she was carrying, but I stopped for a minute to take a breath.  I start throwing again, and I hear this pained scream, and "MUM! MUM!"   It's my sister, running at my Mum with her middle finger raised. I'd thrown a brick right onto her awaiting hand, and it had made a pretty nasty gash right on her finger where the edge of the brick had landed. Needed stitches.  (I was about 13, sister about 9)   It's pushing the mile limit, but [Naughty Needles](http://www.naughtyneedles.co.uk/) in Bolton on Halliwell road is a good place, though unless you're after a small-ish tat, he's always pretty booked up.

Used Default femshep though     I occasionally do a run to London, from Manchester  One day, heading back up the M40, just listening to the radio:  "Hey, I'm on the M6.. wait, when did that happen?"    Yeah, I guess so. :P But I can only really see myself falling for a girl, so I generally put myself under the Heteroromantic tag.   Personally speaking - I have no physical attraction to anyone. It's a really hard thing to explain. In order to "Fall" for someone, I have to talk to them, get to know them, before I know.   Sounds a bit odd to me. Though you can't really judge until you get his story direct from him.  But yeah, feel free to message me later, I'll try and answer any questions you have to the best of my ability. :)   Alright, at my computer now, I can type without driving myself insane.  I can't really explain asexuality, since it's all I've really known sexuality-wise. All I know is, I have no attraction to anyone really. I can walk down a street of the hottest people in the world, and I probably wouldn't bat an eyelid or turn around, stare at chests, etc. (Well, maybe a little)  There's the various types of asexuals - Aromantic Asexuals (No interest in sex or a romantic relationship) and then there's the various Romantic Asexuals: Heteroromantic, Homoromantic, panromantic, etc.  I specifically identify as a Heteroromantic Asexual - I desire a relationship, but all that relationship would ideally consist of is hugs, cuddles, maybe some kisses, and generally sharing life together.  I know for a fact that won't happen unless I'm extremely lucky.  Some Asexuals in relationships might maintain an active sex life just because of their partner's needs, but won't pursue them to return the favour, so to speak.  That's probably the best way I can explain it. there's a subreddit ([/r/asexuality](/r/asexuality)) and [AVEN](http://www.asexuality.org/home/) (Asexual Visibility and Education Network) which can give _waaaaay_ more info than I can.    Asexuality isn't quite as clear cut as it seems. Everyone varies. But to answer your question, I personally lack sexual attraction and a lack of sexual drive. It's quite hard to explain. I can elaborate when I get home if you want? Typing on a phone is kind of awful   Yeah, sounds like it. I'm asexual and I'm only ever really roped into checking ladies out when my friends notice "Dat ass."  Damnit guys, I'm trying to eat cake here.  Also is your friend me? Sounds like it.   Hey! I drive one of these. I think it's a cool little thing, but that might be the MPG talking.  	109

 Yeah. I would have much rather reupholstered the black chair in the background, but I only have one of those :/   I also do work as a photographer, and am close enough to Gainesville to pass it off as Gators bullshit. Got my bases covered, brah.   Moving into a house in a month, no longer give a shit about current apartment.   Before and progress pics. http://imgur.com/a/xLubv   Awesome! We must hang out!

I'm kinda worried about keeping it outside just because the chairs are Gator colors :/   College town. People move constantly and don't bother to put stuff on craigslist and throw out perfectly good stuff. There's an entire industry around here of people picking up furniture around big move out times and reselling stuff on craigslist.   That table was pretty pristine. Just did a quick sanding, primed, and taped out the design and painted. Chairs just had to be sanded, painted and reupholstered.    One of the many luxuries of cheap student apartment living.

 I think the more interesting thing here is knowing that it's an adenosine receptor blocker that's affecting mood and memory, not so much that it's caffeine. Caffeine does a myriad of other things (blocks some important receptors, agonizes others), but knowing that Adenosine 2A receptors mediate these effects on mood is critical to drug development of new, more specific agents. Perhaps this leads to an entirely new class of antidepressants?   Every process in your entire body is ultimately regulated by only 4 ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl-.     Amusing, yet extraordinarily accurate. Unfortunately, I think "Overselling" has almost become commonplace...that is, if you want a chance at funding. Yes, sometimes what we do as scientists is esoteric and incremental - but that doesn't mean it isn't exceptionally important.  But hey, we can't all cure cancer with every grant application or paper. It's too bad we don't always just say that.   Baroreceptors, in this instance, likely have nothing to do with it...That's part of a autonomic circuit used to regulate heart rate and cardiac output relative to changes is BP. To my knowledge, there aren't any baroreceptors in the ocular arterioles.  Ocular vessels narrow due to something called "myogenic tone", or "pressure-induced constriction". The smooth muscle cells in these vessels are able to sense stretch caused by increases in pressure and constrict accordingly. No neural innervation is required; even a single isolated smooth muscle cell would constrict when stretched. The development of this myogenic tone protects the extremely fragile capillary bed from rupture due to high pressures, since capillaries themselves are extremely thin (1 layer of endothelial cells only) and non-contractile.  Pressure COULD get high enough to widen vessels instead, since the myogenic capability of smooth muscle reaches a plateau...but that pressure would need to be pretty dangerously high for that to happen.  I could wax poetic about how this increase in tone ultimately leads to remodeling of the vessel wall, decreased distensibility, and vascular dysfunction, but I won't...unless you want me to. (c:  	4
                   I didn't bother to carry on a discussion with him or any of the others.   I had better things to do with my time.   I had to work my way through a whole list of people who needing banning from the internet that day.                         Well, my their definition, anyone to the left of Hermann Gring is an out of control communist.      Agreed.       I was able to find [this one](http://i.imgur.com/FNkGCM6.png), which is a bit tame.    I think when the admins shadow ban people, their messages often get removed.   Or maybe it's the report button that does that.  If you report a submission in a subreddit, it auto-hides.  So, the same may happen with PMs, but PMs don't appear in your [hidden items](/u//me/hidden/).     But if you were an average user and got a hate-PM like out of the blue, one might panic a little.      2+2 obviously isn't four.  It's a potato.  Only evil anti-Nazis think otherwise.     I'm sure /u/ani625 is correct about people trying to dox the spam-submitter.   So, that would be why they were going through there history and deleting old comments and submissions.    There is like a big formal letter write up that is being PM'ed to people who the conspiracy lunatics don't like.    It gives you like 72 hours to admit you are wrong everything, and then delete or kill yourself, or they will come after you, your family,  your employer, your next store neighbor, your siblings, and the clerk at your local mini-mart.   It's stupid but looks like a terrorist threat.    I've reported these idiots to the admins several times.   And they admins shadow ban them.   But if somebody just did a simple spam-report and then got that write up, especially if they do not have any experience with these lunatics, it might scare them.    So, deleting their user history could make sense to them.   Myself, I just don't scare easily.   Not after years of sparing with these idiots.         Those people are very....    insane.    I'm steeling this write up from a great gentleman named /u/creesch.    [Relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1357/)  *I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.*  ---  Freedom of speech is a legal concept and a natural right of man that allows you to be free from persecution for espousing certain view points.   The thing is though that freedom of speech and expression are not a absolutes. Even in the US there are laws that technically limit freedom of speech and expression:  Slander, libel, copyright, hate crimes, sedition and treachery for example.    Then there are also other more basic rights that come before freedom of speech and expression and thereby limit them: the right to privacy, the right to have safety from violence, the right to fair trial.   But that is all besides the point, reddit is a private company, so we venture into another area that a lot of people seem to misunderstand. On reddit free speech is often warped in this concept of "right to be listened to". While in reality the only thing it stand for is allowing you to be free from persecution for expressing certain viewpoints.  It does however not oblige other people to provide a platform for that speech. That is why schools can have and enforce rules against, for example, hate speech. So a school can discipline a student for distributing racial material but that same student can't be arrested by the government for distributing that same material.                                                                     I'm on Firefox.  Is there a reason mine already claims it's running version 3.1.1?     It says it was last updated on May 15th.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	150
 IT depends on what operating system you're using. If its Windows 8/8.1, you can initial a full Reset from within the OS.   If its Windows 7, the recovery console SOMETIMES appears on another monitor after reboot (as it is loading the default drivers). but this depends on the manufacturer as well as the hardware.   Good luck! Let us know how that goes or if anything needs clarification.  Alternatively, laptop screens are surprisingly easy to replace, especially on most HP laptops.    Canned air is generally more effective at dislodging dust in the nooks and crannies. That being said, I have never heard of anyone causing ESD damage, but I have seen people physically drag a vacuum attachment across sensitive components and damage them.  Basically, you're fine with the vacuum, just don't whack stuff with it :P   I agree. Any theoretical performance increase is completely negligible. The only difference (this is purely based on my observations) is that 3.5" drives fail slightly less due to the data density not being as high. I manage many computers, both desktops and laptops, and the smaller drives seem to physically fail as well as get corruptions much more frequently that the larger drives of same capacity. Like I said, I have nothing to back that statement up other than anecdotal observations.   If you can get into Windows still, go here:   C:/  Users  "UserName"  AppData  AppData is hidden, so unhide your folders if you cant find it. Now you should see three folders: Local, LocalLow, and Roaming. In each folder, there are lots of other folders and then random files. Delete all these random files that aren't in folders. A lot of them are benign, but this is the most common place for virus' to hide.   Good luck! Let us know how it goes or if that doesn't work.   As others have said, you were probably touching the heatsink which should be substantially cooler than the CPU.  I would apply some thermal paste. Most thermal paste is only rated to last a few years and given that you're running a 6 year old C2D, it's probably all dried up now. RadioShack and Best Buy carry it for $10 or less and its fairly easy to apply. There are several youtube video's explaining techniques and how-to's, but q-tips and alcohol are super useful when cleaning the old paste off the CPU and the heatsink.  Additionally, you may have bumped the heatsink while messing around in the case. I did this several years ago where I SLIGHTLY popped one of the 4 heatsink lock pins and the CPU was overheating within minutes. In this scenario, I would still re-apply the thermal paste and re-attach the heatsink. (If you remove the heatsink, you kind of have to re-apply thermal paste, especially if its old and dried)  Good luck!    Basically... you can't :(  There are some crazy work around and occasional success stories, but its a huge pain. For $10 more you can get one on Amazon (or get a 320GB for $45)  http://www.amazon.com/120GB-Hard-Disk-Drive-Generic/dp/B004GIGA1A/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8 qid=1406606362 sr=8-13 keywords=xbox+hard+drive     If you're using Windows 8/8.1, File History is an awesome feature that backs up your entire Library every hour and is super easy to use.   What was your reason for not using the recovery partition on your laptop?   Depending on how you formatted/partitioned, you may be able to still use the factory recovery image. If you are trying to go from 8/8.1 to 8.1 Pro, you can type in "add features" on the Start screen and then follow the prompts to enter your 8.1 Pro key. It will upgrade without requiring a full re-install.  What brand is your laptop? Most laptop brands have different tricks to get into their recovery console.   In an offline scenario such as a boot disk, the command would be   sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\  /offwindir=d:\windows  Where d: is where Windows is installed.      I'd say 15-60 minutes,  but however long it would normally be before your computer crashes when playing games would be a more accurate time.   Additionally, you could purchase a simple stand-alone mic. They are cheap and often perform better that headset mics (I have the A40's and prefer a $10 desktop mic)   As others have stated, it sounds like a hardware, not software issue (but it still could be!) The two most likely cases are the card is bad or the card is overheating. There is also the possibility that your power supply isn't giving the card enough power or it could be a memory issue. Lets troubleshoot to try to narrow it down, shall we?  Possible Issues:  -Overheating  -Bad/Defective card  -Graphics driver issue  -Power Supply issue  ~~-Memory Issue~~   1. How old is the card? It is important to note whether or not it is still under warranty. I'm going to assume it is, so we don't want to void the warranty :P  2. Pop the case open and see if the fan/heatsink area on the card is dusty. Clogged heatsink = overheating. Canned air is generally much safer than a vacuum cleaner if youi have to remove any dust.  3. If there is no dust, or you cleaned it, let's run a test to see if the card is overheating. There are several ways to go about this. I like [Furmark](http://www.geeks3d.com/20140313/furmark-1-13-0-download-gpu-burn-in-stress-test-opengl/) as it is quick, simple, and shows the temp during the test so there's no need for extra monitoring programs. Most CPU/GPU's are relatively safe up to ~100*C, but realistically going above 80*C means there's an issue. Your card in particular should be around 65*C at full throttle. Run the programs "Burn-in Test" and monitor its temps. Run the program for as long as it normally takes to crash while playing games.  4. If your card is staying nice and cool or doesn't crash during testing, that means your card itself is probably fine. Next, lets update your drivers. [This](http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows%207%20-%2064#amd-catalyst-packages) download should get you the most up-to-date driver directly from AMD. This is a much newer driver than is listed on your cards page, so that could be the issue. Once you have the new driver loaded, restart your computer (even if it doesn't tell you to) and start playing your games!! If the issue goes away... awesome! If not, lets keep troubleshooting.  5. We will assume its not a memory issue since you ran Memtest already, and power supplies are difficult to test without a multimeter or power supply tester. This next step is kinda skeevy, but works. If you have a Best Buy, Walmart, or any other store that sells graphics cards, buy one that is preferably in the same series (R9 2XX) and play on it to see if the same thing happens. (These big box stores will let you return opened cards within their return policy.) If you do get a card in the same series as your R9 280X, it is using the same driver, so is purely testing whether your card is bad or not.   If these don't work, post your results and we'll go from there. Good luck!   Try this on the Mini DisplayPort   http://www.monoprice.com/Product?seq=1 format=2 p_id=8118 CAWELAID=1329456194 CAGPSPN=pla gclid=Cj0KEQjwrqieBRCln82Rgufz7I0BEiQAPNjAI8Ps5kvbe-WlFBG0K4t8vrLgS9i8fLyahnmuz2FnpLwaAqN78P8HAQ  That would give you your S7 screen and two monitors. The Toshiba DynaDock can also do this.   A couple things to try...  First, see if there's a voltage corrector. Its a little switch that you can select 120v VS 220v. If its on the 220v, but you're using a 120v socket, you'll have some issues.  Secondly, you might be short a cable! You mentioned that you plugged in the 24-pin cable and the 4-pin CPU cable. On some pictures, it looked like your motherboard might actually take an 8-pin CPU cable. Check and see if there's just one square 4-pin socked on the motherboard or if it's a rectangular 8-pin socket. If this is the case, you'll need a completely different model of PSU and it might be cheaper to get it directly from Dell as most PSU's with 8-pin CPU cables are on the higher end and more expensive.   Good luck and let us know!   I agree, this sounds very much like a driver issue. It could be the driver is just corrupt or needs some TLC, or it could be that LoL and the driver aren't playing nice.   I would uninstall and delete the driver from Device Manager as well as any Catalyst software and completely re-download the driver. If that doesn't work, try doing the same procedure with older drivers.  Good luck! Let us know how it goes!   I would update/re-install your**[ drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/75991/en-us)** if you haven't yet. If that doesn't help it could be a hardware issue.   If its hardware, it could be your card overheating or just going bad ,your power supply overheating or going bad, or even possibly RAM.   First, I would heavily dust out your case, especially around the PSU, card heatsink, and CPU heatsink. You can download a monitoring program (I like **[Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy/download/standard)**, but there are several) and a stress test (I like **[FurMark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/)**, but again, any is good.) and see how hot everything gets; your card is listed as 105c max operating temp, but ideally they would be around 95ish while stressing. You could also attempt to re-apply the thermal paste if it does seem that heat is an issue.  To test RAM, **[Memtest86](http://www.memtest86.com/download.htm)** works fairly well. I would start it before bed and see how its doing in the morning as it can take a while or run indefinitely.   Your PSU can be tricky to test unless you have a multimeter or ideally a power supply tester. If your video card isnt receiving enough power when it needs it, bad stuff happens.   Let us know if that helps of not!   It should work, but depends on a few things such as where you got the trial from. Some variables such as volume license keys, Upgrade vs Full keys, etc could cause compatibility issues. Worst case scenario, you'd have to re-install Windows .exe they provided.  If you do run into an issue with it upgrade/full, let me know because there is a registry tweak to get around that.   Good luck!   It seems like your computer might still think that your headphones are plugged in, or something similar. Assuming you're using a newer Win7/8/8.1 PC, try right-clicking the volume or speaker icon next to the clock and select "Playback Options". In the windows that appears, it should show you all the different device possible (On mine for example, I have HDMI, Astro Headset, Digital Output, and Digital Optical Output). In your situation, you would want to select "Speakers" and then click "Set Default" below.   If that works, there's a good chance that your 3.5mm port is damaged, but you can always use the above steps to manually change it. Hope that helps!   If I recall, "doubleclick.net" is what Google uses for ad tracking. Basically, if you've every Googled something, you'll have that cookie on there. Like others have said, its harmless.   Since it looks like you're using Chrome, you can try turning off the "tracking" setting by going to the Settings Menu (3 horizontal lines in the upper-right)  Settings  "Show Advanced Settings"  and under the Privacy section, tick the box "Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browsing traffic"  Hope that helps!   There is rarely a single program that is universally good at protecting you, but if a nice "toolset" is assembled, it can greatly help. All of the listed programs are free!!  **[MSE or Microsoft Security Essentials:](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201)** This is your base level protection that hopefully catches the really bad stuff. It get shit on a lot, but it seemingly offers great protection against some pretty nasty infections. It automatically updates with Windows and almost never bothers you gives pop-ups unless if finds something. *Note* : Don't install multiple, always-on, anti-virus programs and uninstall any old ones you don't use (Kaspersky, Norton, McAfee, etc). They can "fight" with each other stop working properly.  **[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/):** This is a scanner that you have to run.

WAY too loud, woofers were distorting, and you could barely appreciate the music. I get that certain genres beg to be blasted, but this is not one of them.   http://www.youtube-mp3.org/  Its not FLAC, but its not bad   My 2008 Ford Focus SES with ~90k started having trouble shifting around 30-40 mph (although I'm not sure exactly what gear 3rd or 4th would be my guess.)  From a stop, the car accelerates without issue, but maybe 30% of the time when I get to 30-40 mph, the engine revs up to about 5k RPM. I take my foot off the gas and gently push the gas again and it will normally get into gear after 1-3 attempts at "pumping" the gas. I have researched this and found "Some 2008 Focus vehicles equipped with 4F27E automatic transaxle and built on or before 1/29/2008 may experience no 3rd or 4th gear. Possible diagnostic troubles codes (DTCs) P0733 and/or P0734. The cause may be a direct clutch snap ring out of position caused by the reverse clutch wave spring." It seemed like this was only happening on almost new cars and im not getting any CEL, so I'm not sure if this would apply to my situation.  As for the vehicles history, I've owned the car for about 2 years and put about 25k on it. I have not done any transmission maintenance (I'm not even sure if that's a thing!) but I've gotten the oil changed 3 times and hit a deer a month ago ( the issue was there before though). At around 75k miles, I had terrible engine shake while idling, and the dealership replaced the engine mount.   As far as troubleshooting and repairing myself, I'm very mechanically inclined and have no problem diving into stuff, but I have never gotten into cars, so my knowledge is very basic.  Any help, insight, or advice would be very appreciated... thank you!!   Ad**d**ress.   If you have Office 365, then yes. If you purchased Office for Mac then no.  As it has already been said, Office and Office for Mac have two separate licensing keys, hence they cannot be swapped between them. Office 365 on the other hand can be installed on PC, Mac, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.  If you DO have Office 365, or are unsure, go to www.office.com and login (upper right corner) using your Microsoft Account (you need a Microsoft account to have O365 so if you never made one, you probably don't have it). Once logged in, click on My Account in the upper right and the page will populate all Office products associated with that account with a large green "Install" button.  If you're still unsure, what version of Office are you running? Office 365 will only be Office 2013 so if you have '03,'07,'10 then your copy is not transferable.   Depending on how often you use Office and in what capacity, you can try using the webapps on www.Office.com. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for free and unless you're using higher level functions (macros, etc) the webapps are basically identical to the full program.  Hope that helps!

 I remember watching this movie in preschool, so it's from 2001/2 or earlier. I vaguely remember it being the Muppets but I could be wrong. I think it had a monster in it and maybe also a princess kissing a frog for it to turn into a prince.  What I remember most is the evil character dying at the end and a crow flies out of her. Kind of morbid. I've been trying to find this movie for the longest time,  but can't.   I would say buy a Kindle. I know I'm supposed to pimp out Nooks but Kindles are so much better. I guess I'm not that worried about Amazon putting us out of business if I'm promoting their product. Eventually, B N will close because it just cannot compete with Amazon. But since this is only a part-time job I don't really care.   I always prefer paperback. Its cheaper and easier to read in bed. There definitely have been books that customers have come in looking for but they're so obscure that it doesn't even come up in the database. I can't think of any books that are banned from B N; I'm pretty sure we do sell State and Revolution, Communist Manifesto, etc. Actually, I think we are against banning books and have had a Banned Books Week where we promoted banned books.   Looked it up and apparently it's only one in Austin. Honestly thought it was a chain.   	4
 Was anyone else expecting the dinosaur to have a massive dong?      I'm calling bullshit on this. But even if it is true, I took a quick glance at your post history and no fucking way am I taking advice from a racist piece of shit who regularly posts to /r/CoonTown. You can take those bigoted thoughts and fornicate you're rectum with them.   "You're eyes can be so cruel! Just as I can be so cruel..."   Thank you OP, for posting this.   I agree with you to an extent. But you'll find if you delve into it that people being spared by reason of insanity is a very rare occurrence. And is the exception rather than the rule. The entire situation with Gein is kind of a Catch-22, his victims deserve justice but at the same time is it right to kill someone with the mental capacity of a child?   Ed Gein was born in 1906, the psychological trauma he endured from his mother as well as the severe isolation imposed on him carried on through his childhood up until well after his mother's passing.  At the time psychology was, in all intensive respects, in its infancy. Hell, the World Health Organization (WHO) didn't announce mental health as an important aspect of healthcare until 1946.  Brock Chisolm quoted saying: "Surely the training of children in home and schools should be of at least as great public concern as their vaccination.... Individuals who have emotional disabilities of their own--guilts, fears, inferiorities--are certain to project their hates on to others... [S]uch reaction now becomes a dangerous threat to the whole world....  So yes, while we do have pills that aid in fixing chemical imbalances and easing the mental problems of those afflicted. We also have a completely different attitude toward mental disease as a whole, and modern therapy reflects that as well as everything we've come to understand in the last 100 years.  Its easy for people to bash on mental health methodology and say they just throw pills at people until they become docile enough to tolerate, but that's not really the case. And I can attest to that personally. I've been diagnosed by two psychiatrists, both determining I have moderate OCD as well as other problems that are comorbid to it. I spent most of my life in a state of misery and fear, but now that I'm seeing a wonderful therapist and have a psych who's helping me find a proper medication regime, things are really starting to look up.   Only two murders, the rest of the corpses were dug up from a local cemetery. The car he used to transport them was sold in an auction after everything came out. His home was burned down, but the culprit was never caught.   I'd be gay for Bowie.   Fucking hilarious.   You'd be surprised what someone who's spent their life hunting can do with a sharp enough knife.   He also had nipple belts, shoeboxes filled with female genitalia. Skin masks, skin chairs, skin lamps. He would make bowls from their skulls. He drew the line at necrophilia though, albeit just because he couldn't get over the smell. He would gut them and leave them to dry in his barn.  His is a really sad case. For all the horrible stuff he did, he was very mentally ill. When he was caught he spent the rest of his days at an institution, and the people who worked with him said you could never hope to meet a nicer person. Thankfully psychology has advanced since then and we have the means to help people before they deteriorate to this point.  Edit: For anyone interested in reading on him I highly recommend this book. The author is very well respected in true-crime circles and is very credible. Word of warning for the squeamish, it does contain some photos of the gutted bodies he had hanging in his barn.  *http://www.amazon.com/Deviant-Shocking-Story-Original-Psycho/dp/0671025465   Yeah, as well as Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

 This might get buried, but I wanted to share my Christmas tradition with you guys now that it's officially the Christmas season. Since high school, my friends and I have done this crazy marathon.

 Radical Face - Welcome home, Son. When the chorus kicks in, still gives me the same, happy feeling every time i hear it. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a4iiOnzsc)    Really loving all the subtle things in this season so far, the zealot in the dish, the cheese throwing, the balance joking (reaper changes, super long range on nexus cannon) Just gives it that little extra!   Because getting laid is of course the only purpouse of playing guitar.   Does anyone know if the startale video where Legend is trying to become a pro player is on youtube? I cant seem to find it, really enjoyed it when they played it during a tournament.   do you happen to have a link to that VOD?   TIL op_is_sea_gm_fyi is a fellow dutchmen   I think Huk and Ret aren't talking about the same thing, huk complains about him getting denied to compete in both code A and WCS NA/EU while players in code S are allowed to do this, Ret is giving his opinion about koreans playing in WCS NA/EU in the first place. 2 very different things   basically your MMR (the hidden ranking score system blizzard uses) has to be steady in the league you want to get promoted too. What this means: when you face, and win from gold players regularly you will get promoted soon. It can be a bit random sometimes though.   thats pretty sweet!   Well as its a new game the timing aren't figured out yet. So i think you can get into diamond now with decent mechanics, i play a reactionary style most of the time.   So I (diamond Protoss) just started playing around a bit on the unranked ladder as Zerg (my zerg skills are bronze/silver i think).  I got matched vs a platinum protoss player and lost quite badly. after the match i noticed that his league symbol changed to diamond. So after a quick chat i found out he queued for the ranked ladder, and got promoted to diamond after the match. I think this is a bit unfair. **What do you guys think?**  TL;DR: Opponent gets promoted on the back of my diamond protoss MMR, while I played offrace on the unranked ladder. Fair/unfair?   Amsterdam is 4 meters below sealevel, so a flood is pretty likely to happen somewhere in the future.   I used a build like this in WoL a lot, but it indeed does work vs 3 hatch openings in HotS. I don't have an exact build order, but here is roughly what i do:  FFE, if you can gateway before cannon (scout no early pool) 2 gasses gateway 100% -- cyber core. zealot (send to watchtower/third base if you  chronoboost in probes until cybercore is finished, after that only chrono boost cybercore +1 att @ 100gas (chrono when you can) stalker. 3 gates @50% cybercore stop probe production 3/4/5 more gates forward pylons should be hitting around 8:30-9:00 i think.  Hope this helps!   Hots started out really rough, got placed in silver after beeing plat in WoL. But after laddering for a week im back, [better than ever!](http://imgur.com/NarmerN)   whoopsie, missed that post/sticky. Sorry!      Same happened to me, got placed in silver and ranked up to plat in a few days. Sad thing is i was plat already in WoL. Oh well lets aim for diamond my brotoss!  	17
 I played MW2 a lot over the weekend in anticipation of MW3's release, and after hearing that MW3 multiplayer was basically MW2.5 I was pretty excited. However, as soon as I popped in MW3, the first thing I noticed is some of my favorite guns don't "feel" the same. The long range accuracy of the UMP45 isn't there anymore when you "feather" the trigger. The M16 isn't as accurate. MP5 still isn't back to its COD4 glory days. Overall, I think the guns have more kick, and have trouble staying on target like they did in previous games (MW2). I still love the game, and my KDR will probably increase after getting used to some of the subtle changes in the guns, but I was wondering if anyone else noticed some of these changes?    I thought Black Ops was probably one of the biggest disappointments I have had, and almost put me off Call of Duty all together. If this isn't like that game, I am happy.    Not at all. The Vet and Noob video was amazing.    I don't think you read the original comment. Receiving something from someone with the knowledge that it is stolen is a felony. Previously, the OP stated that his copy of the game was acquired by "less than legal" means.   Yeah, I got it too. Thought it was a joke.    You know receiving stolen property is a felony, right? Not saying that I wouldn't do the same thing in your shoes, but I certainly wouldn't be advertising it by playing on Live or posting on the internet.

Anyone have a date on the patch yet? 360 here.    [Why the hell not](http://imgur.com/VIMuW)   This is what needs to happen: Elementary school teachers need to be competent at math. They can't simply "love working with kids" and "enjoy telling stories and doing arts and crafts." You need to know your shit. You need to know everything about everything because little kids ask questions that are creative and insightful and completely off the wall.   This. Yes, we need to pay teachers better. Yes, we need smaller classrooms. However, we also need to reform what it takes to become an educator, so we have teachers that are above average in all areas (i.e. reading, writing, match, science), as opposed to barely competent in any. There are a lot of great teachers out there. I was lucky to have a few that shaped my life forever. There are a lot of really bad teachers out there too, and we need to make it more difficult to become an educator to weed these people out.    At first, I read this as, "Why don't you fuck more students?"   http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ls9in/a_friend_of_mine_was_helping_a_girl_jump_her/c2v6mcj  Pretty sure you are wrong. That was another post in this topic, but not the OP.    As I said before, I was on obm.ohio.gov and I was not able to find specifically what I was looking for.   I have been trying to find a breakdown of the yearly budget for the State of Ohio. More specifically, I am looking to see what percentage of revenue was spent on public employee salaries as opposed to other areas. I have been on the state website, but so far I haven't been able find anything useful. Any ideas?   If I really wanted to understand the entire story, would it be better to start at Uncharted or Uncharted 2?   Even though I know what this is referencing part of me was hoping it was a Dark Souls reference after I saw the first part of the tattoo.

I sure as hell wont be taking anything you have said to heart, or even remembering it when I wake up tomorrow.   I am going to assume that you have not experienced any of the type of catcalling I am referring to.  That single occasion wasn't the only time I have experienced something like that. I have been called a slut because I didn't respond to one man. I have been told I am ugly anyway because I didn't respond to another.   So excuse me if I make a few assumptions about men who call out to women on the street. They aren't all out to rape me, but even if it is just a wolfwhistle, it is very clear that they just don't understand how stressed out it can make women feel. What if that simple appreciate wolfwhistle I ignore is just the prelude to something more horrible? I stick by my saying "most men" because if you are a man, you would have little idea of what it is like to have strangers ogle you, call out to you, or whistle at you since you were 13 years old almost *every* time you walk down the street. I have spoken to people about this and it is common for men I speak to about it to brush it off, calling it a compliment. I did not say most men DO call out, and I did not say most men threaten to rape me, I said most men think the mild forms of catcalling are OK. If this generalisation offends you then...well that's not my problem.  On top of this, I really don't appreciate you telling me "I hope you don't have sons". I probably will have sons and I will certainly make a point of teaching them what behaviours I feel are unacceptable, which I feel includes any kind of public singling-out of women based purely on their looks.  For the record, I never once went on about "the patriarchy, the patriarchy", "rape culture" or "male privilege". I simply shared my personal experiences. They aren't wrong and you can try all you like to dismiss them, but I will use them to teach my children what is acceptable and what is not. If you think that will mess them up, then I don't want to think about what you will teach yours   [More like this]( http://i.imgur.com/n8hWuBA.jpg)   Now kiss!   Morticia was my mum's idol.

I was getting catcalls early in my teens because of my big chest, even when I was in school uniform. At first I was flattered, then annoyed, then eventually I found out what happened if I ignored these men...I was threatened.  Once, I was walking home from uni and was catcalled by a neighbor down the street. I ignored him...so he threatened to rape me.  What. The. Fuck?  I had to change my walking pattern home. I usually walked through a park with little lighting because it saved me 15mins...but I had to change that because some fat wank didn't get his ego stroked when I ignored his caveman-like advances.  It makes me sick, and I hope to one day have sons and show them just how horrifying this behaviour is. Maybe change will come eventually.   IMHO, you are an asshat   Goes to show how little time he has for those type of shennanigans   "Here, lemme just-"  "No!"   One time, sitting out the front of my house in rural Queensland Australia, I was absentmindedly staring at the trees across my yard when suddenly, one of the branches moved.  For some stupid reason my brain instantly decided there was a monkey in our tree, but then I remembered I was in Australia, so it changed and decided it was our cat.  We don't have a cat.  It took one more moment, during which my brain contemplated the possibility of ninjas in our tree before the branch moved again and I realised I was looking at one of [these]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Tawny-frogmouth.jpg).  I am not a smart woman sometimes   Tis but a fleshwound!   Dueling Domes   Do you cut an X in the top? I cut a shallow X in the top of mine before I steam them.and they take even less time   I would even be OK if it were a cartoon. They vould really do the funny scenes then without blowing a budget on CGI   Cutting Circles?   The discoverer of the "messages" is never going to be believed again.   "Guys! Alien signals!"  "Pfft...yeah dude. Right. Sure it isn't the toaster this time?"   OMG that makes me so happy! Thank you      Regicide can apply to other members of the Royal fam, tho....so I might get a little out of the way before they get me.  If you can get me on that throne, I will give you the best appartment in the city!   I don't know much about the exact lineage, but if a whole lotta members of the Dutch Royal Family all died at once, I could ascend the throne.  ...now excuse me while I go commit mass regicide   *And nor do I   That's not laziness! That is just being practical and efficient   Woof.   We bought a good one....my house is just very long. There are 5 rooms between our bedroom and the study      Kangaroos are larger mostly, and because they are so large their legs are more out of proportion to their [bodies]( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000jBZey4p.gYg/s/750/750/AUS-05-11-05441.jpg). Wallabies have shorter, more compact legs. Wallabies are also a little more drab in their coats, and slightly shaggier. A roo will be almost shiny   Leprechaun orgy   Who let this guy in?   People just don't make stuff like this anymore. It's gorgeous!   Gping on Chat Rooms and having creeps try to cyber me   Wood you guys cut it out!   I can't help but giggle at dogs with nub tails, even though I know they aren't natural.   Happily though, docking of tails and ears is illegal here in Australia   I have no idea how someone could ever clip those ears. Look at them!!!   I have been told he is a Dobermann   Ha ha ha nice toes! He doesn't look impressed  But yeah, maybe the same breed!   I'm not certain sorry. He is my friends' pup      I like the cute one who looks from one side to the other   No-one....that you know of   Cool! Thanks :)  Did you use a cotton?   Love it! Defs going to give it a go.  Question, do you find the "neck hole" to be too big? It looks like it might slip off your shoulders there   ...I do   Probably coz it's a French word      So the principal can kick her ass, right?   IM PENGUIN?   I just watched the episode with Little Dude and was struck by the strong resemblance between him when possessing the bun guy and Susan Strong  Maybe a coincidence, and I haven't got any substance to this theory...but I feel like there is a link   http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130205230054/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/d/d3/Adventure_Time_-_Little_Dude_007_0004.jpg  http://oi45.tinypic.com/16iihdh.jpg   Are you kidding?  It looked just like [this]( http://www.malteseworld.com/images/Holly's%20Show%20Girl%203.jpg)   This has been my aim from the get-go. Persistance pays off I suppose   It feels...nice.  The comment in question was a good one. Nothing weird, NSFW or /r/nocontext worthy, so I can feel good about it I guess?   Marvelous!      I was sure it was a gif for a good 30secs   I see what you were going for, but....no   D:   You got it. I do enjoy a bit of embellishments when I tell a story. I most definitely would have kept the pup if I could have, but I would have felt insanely guilty if I never made an attempt to find an owner   He is the better half of us. I am sure I would have eventually tried to find the owner, but at that first moment, I was tempted   :(   While I can't warn you off our Foxihuahua, because he is a gentleman, I can say that you do not want out Foxi Russell. She is a bitch. [Total bed hog](http://i.imgur.com/LyZIAz7.jpg), needy, annoying and dumb as a brick.   Please don't steal my dogs :(   My dogs are bonkers for popcorn. I am afraid that one day they will discover that *other* people have popcorn too and will totally bail on me   Good work! Keep it up   I'm no saint...I was sold on keeping the little fuzzball   I have only been with 2 and I am married. More would have been nice, but I have made my choice.  15 is hardly a big number, and even if it was, so what? Life is fun, sex if fun, people are fun....go have fun!   It is a puppy thing usually. Older dogs don't get them as much   A comment I wrote a while ago to another post:   One day, my husband and I were out the front of our house when a little streak of white came out of nowhere and disappeared under our car. After a little bit of coaxing and calling, I pulled out the smallest, most frightened ball of fluff ever. Poor little pup was shaking so bad. He didn't have a collar on, and he was so cute and frightened I instantly decided that he was mine. My husband, however, was more practical and insisted I take him to a vet to check for a chip. Reluctantly, I did, and unfortunately there was a chip. It was registered to an address right around the corner from ours.  With a heavy heart and an armful of wiggly, fluffy puppy I went home and then set off down the street. As I turned the corner I saw a girl in her mid teens sitting out the front of her house, crying. As I walked up she looked at me and then her face lit up with the most joyous smile. With no hesitation I handed back the fluffball and the girl burst out with tears of joy.  Man, I wish I could have kept that puppy, but no amount of tiny puppy kisses were worth having to see a heartbroken girl mourning the loss of her new friend.   TLDR, found puppy, found microchip, found joy in returning it to its owner   Edit: I am going to be one of those people who say "Holy cow! My first gold!" Thankyou anonymous stranger for popping my gold cherry!   "I don't think you're a waste of space."   Way I see it, if you are asking "Do I need a lawyer?" you *need* a lawyer   Marvelous   I like that one where he looks at Littlefinger like "Dafuq, did you just that?!"      We had a hoarde of staffies growing up...buff dogs are the best dogs :P   Looks at those muscles! What a sweetheart   Not once, in the whole song   And here is the owner being reunited with them:  http://imgur.com/JLG7tgG   Oh my sweet summer child. If you think this story is going to have an LSH ending, you haven't been paying attention   But she gives away free shit...so she must be OK   Was it teetertottering back and forth? Because I am imagining that now   Great explanation!   ERRYBODY LOOK LIKE ANTS!   Wasn't it because he was very sick?   Mmmm. Yes, indeed. Quite   But then it does give us little gems like "Not today"   *And there are many paths to tread*   Now I imagine a pie with a sausage poked into it and it is just silly   Thanks for the new background!   n   Cheerleader - Omi  'She don't make me feel like cheatin'"  Wut.   No.   My husband scared me the other day by coming home early, while I was in the middle of vaccuming. I didn't know he was in the house until I turned around and saw him standing in the doorway of the room I was in.  My immediate reaction? I screamed and fell to the floor.  Yeah, great reflexes there train_subject889. You'll do real well in the Zombie Apocolypse   Condition: Fabulous!   Potato gems.   If there is a person in this world who doesn't like potato gems...I don't want to know them!   That would make a good swaddle   My husband would probably react by punching the thing that scared him like this, so it would end badly for me   I asked God why he took my mother away from me...and no one answered   I throw in some variety when I do it:  Take him as deep as you can and hum  Massage the bottom of the shaft with your tongue as you suck  Give his balls some attention. Fondle, tickle, or even just cup them  Put your hands on his hips and rub/massage him or pull him towards you   I have lived longer with my mum dead than with her alive...and I am slowly forgetting everything I remember about her   Look at that adorable half-assed attempt to be vicious!   ...rarr...rrrrarr   This advice is the best advice.   You don't need a partner to be happy, you need to be happy to get a partner.   Oh man, I would never tolerate a biter. It's not cute, it's bad parenting.   My foxihuahua is friendly but territorial. If he doesn't know you, you are the enemy and will be barked into submission...but if you are friend, he is all over you. You WILL be his best friend, whether you like it or not.   Poor chihuahuas...they get such a bad rap! I have a foxihuahua and he is, like 50% good manners, 40% timidness and 10% vibrations.  Here he is looking fly in his puffy coat:  http://i.imgur.com/NPHOr7d.jpg  His name is Marty McFly   Hagrid is that big, awesome uncle that everyone wishes they had.   The image of him carrying Harry out of the forest, thinking he had died just shattered my heart.  If he had died in the books I would have gone on such a rampage   Sounds like normal highschool drama to me  ...except for the murders   I love it but can I suggest that the L be taller? Kinda looks like an i   Kinda would have given away his whole ruse though...if someone discovered that he used the name of the guy he supposedly hated and killed?   I figured that the gargoyles just let Harry in, despite that not being the password. He earned it   Aww, sorry :( Have you tried Amazon?   No. 4 Nothing but eyes in a box   Yump yump yump yump   Whackos?   Simpsons reference.  Lisa boycott's Homer's BBQ and suggests they serve no meat   I think you can in Europe   They wanted people to do that   I lack the urethral dexterity to pull that off   Has anyone been able to find the perfect thing to say?   Oooh that's a nasty one. Practically a death sentence!   I heard she said that he cancer was in her brain....then her liver, then her uterus, and then her blood.   How did no one pick up that she was a bullshitter earlier?!   Nah he just kept puffin   Look at that tum tum!   :(   That is sad. We at least had some time with our little one. His parents held him a few times, but I only got to on the day we went in to say goodbye. He wasn't awak though   Cardboard boxes are the best!  	137
 Sweet thanks! If you don't mind my asking, who do you buy from? I'm leaning towards onemedstore but I kinda like the discretion provided by bitcoin.   I think the more concerning failure rate is for the 7ft wall test   Eh kind of. MEPS is supposed to filter out those that are medically unable to serve. They don't really check your physical strength or anything like that there.    I'm planning on buying 30 to start and then I might purchase 90 if I like the stuff and that should hopefully past me through the school year at which point I'll see about getting a prescription from my doctor back home.   The three sizes intended for envelopes are  35.5 in  5x5.5 in  11x5.5 in   The problem is that for several of the tests the failure rate for men is at or below 1%, whereas for women it's in the 10s or 20s. Fiscally speaking, it would be irresponsible to pursue this if half way through training a quarter of the women get dinged out.   I took it freshman year of high school for about six months but I remember it not doing much for me. Gave me headaches though.    What dude your post history involves grow advice, questions about tor, and references to smoking weed several times.       Bro. Double double and animal fries.   Yaaaaasssssss   The article I found said that he mostly did this over the course of his senior year so I think it's safe to assume that he was 18 for at least some of it.   I'm shocked!  SHOCKED I SAY!   OP deliver with pics   Younger than 16 is actually very serious and should be treated as such. We're talking about a freshman in high school. What you neglect to mention, or didn't read, is that he did this to **10 different kids**, not to the same girl ten different times, and he intended to share the films. By your own standard he's getting off easy at 2.5 years per victim.  Edit: I should add that I didn't know this guy. I graduated from SEHS this year, but the general attitude among seniors was that freshman girls are off limits. They're basically kids. Hell, some of them aren't done with puberty or have even started it for that matter.    Yeah I'll definitely talk to a transfer counselor to get the specifics.  I think my total GPA is still above 3.65 but I'll have to double check. If I kill this year I can raise that though.       So I'm currently attending SBCC (Isla Vista FTW) and I love it here but after spending some time exploring the UCSB campus I've decided that that's no longer my first choice for transferring. I'm also really enjoying my investing class so I figure I might enjoy a business related career.   So here's the thing, I've looked through my credits and I've taken almost all of the courses required by Cal. I just need to take a 19 credit load next semester to finish up the reqs. Of all of the UC transferable courses I've  taken I've gotten mostly A's with a few B's mixed in there, but my non-UC transferable courses are mostly B's. The transfer website says that they only calculate your GPA based on your UC transferable courses. Can someone with experience in this tell me if my non-UC transferable courses are going to hurt my chances? I'm not sure if what they're saying on the website means that they totally ignore those courses or that they look at them but don't consider them as much in their final decision.    Like armodafinil is OTC in Canada?    Could you capture some low light footage tonight?    Weed maybe but that's because it literally grows on trees. Everything else is far more difficult to get than alcohol in my experience.    I'm not sure I understand your complaint. I summarized the situation and provided the relevant quote.       That's not disregard. Disregard would be seeing a school bus full of children go into a lake and say fuck it someone else will eventually call the cops and go on with your day. This is pure unadulterated psychopathic hatred for humanity.   Here's anothe awesome pond in Oregon.  It's called blue pool and you can go cliff diving there. I think it's about a 45 min drive + 5 mile hike from Eugene.   http://images.everytrail.com/pics/fullsize/478294-IMG_0142.JPG   Oct 4th I believe   Oh and just a reminder, the gopro hero 3's software and some if its hardware was absolutely terrible when it came out so let the camera junkies mess around with it for a few days and give feedback before you pull the trigger.    Comes out on October 4th so we won't know for sure until then but it's essentially a very bland gopro. Just press the top button and it'll turn on and record. Hold it and it will take time lapse shots. Records in 1080p at 60fps or 720p at 30fps and auto adjusts for light conditions. If you just need something to cover your ass in case a driver does something retarded or you want to record track days then this is a good choice. If you're looking to record fancy videos for a documentary or highlight video or whatever it will do but the GoPro hero 4 or Hero 3 will give you a broader range of recording options.   Why? For most division one starters on good teams football *is* a major. It leads to a job, and one that will pay more than you'll earn in a life time at that.     How the fuckity fuck fuck can someone get a fucking education when they spend an entire semester training and practicing to play fucking football  By putting in work. All of these kids playing div 1 football know what they're getting themselves into. Likely their varsity teams in high school had incredibly rigorous training programs. Some of them like Jonny Manziel take easy course loads because they know they'll go pro. Some of them like Colt Lyerla do that and fuck up. And some of them like Marcus Mariota, arguably the best div 1 QB right now, put in work. Marcus Mariota earned a general science degree in three years. Now he's taking a lax course load for his senior year so that he can get drafted.   Here's a list of Oregon players from the 2019 season that were honored academically.   http://blog.oregonlive.com/behindducksbeat/2010/11/oregon_football_lamichael_jame_19.html   Why?   Saying wtf doesn't have to be out of disgust. It could be a quizzical wtf. Honestly tho, how much time do you people spend on reddit if you're critiquing semi off topic posts and slight misuse of memes?   Polaroid also came out with a $99 action camera called the Cube.    http://www.polaroid.com/cube      Honestly it depends. Girls in high school have a much easier time getting laid. If the teacher was disgusting or maybe even just average looking I'd probably be singing a different tune, but if he was a moderately attractive guy I wouldn't. I know my high school self would've jumped at a chance to geg with a teacher because I sure as shit wasn't getting any elsewhere.    That depends on if there's an implication of consequences for not having sex. It'd be rape for my boss to say she'll fire me if I don't fuck her, or my schools president to say she'll expel me. But if either of them just say "wanna fuck?" It's not illegal. No matter how unprofessional. If this kid had been 17 these teachers would be out of a job. Not facing jail time.    There are only 12 US states where they have to be 18 before it's legal for an adult to have sex with them. In the other 38 it's either 16 or 17. This is not some terrible crime that's only legal in the hick country. In most states the only thing wrong here is a lack of professionalism.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America   16 is not a child. That's the age of consent in most states.    It has as much to do with the attractiveness of the perpetrators as it does the gender. If these women were hags it'd say race. If it were some bradley cooper looking motherfucker it'd say sex. Honestly though, what heterosexual sixteen year old male would turn down a three way with these two?  http://tribwgno.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/destrehan-high-with-both-teachers-2.jpg?w=840 h=441   I had a mole shave about a month ago and I need a recommendation for a product that will fade the scar faster.

What was irrational about my comment? The fact that modern medicine means that you can end mental suffering without suicide?    There is not a single person on earth that has thought about suicide, seeked help, and regretted not going through with it after the fact. Medication, therapy, whatever. There are things that work to combat depression in the modern realm of medicine. And I don't give a fuck what people say, suicide is fucking selfish. No matter how much you believe otherwise there will be somebody that is seriously affected by your suicide and you may have unknowingly sent them on the road to suicide.    Because they're not even facing a problem yet. It's a fucking preemptive measure. Euthenasia should be for true incurable pain and suffering. Not depression and sadness,  and definitely not expected depression and sadness.   There are very few reasons for which I think assisted suicide should be allowed. This, this is not one of them.

He's also putin's pawn now.  http://m.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/the-lies-edward-snowden-tells/360893/   Is there a way to order 2 different options in the same order or do I need to make separate orders?   Snowden is a narcissist and a traitor. He has been caught lying about so many things that I don't trust a word out of his mouth at this point. Oh yeah,  why would a patriot seek asylum in fucking China and Russia?  Those countries are the exact opposite of the ideals he supposedly stands for. Fuck snowden.    A bit about me: I currently go to SBCC and live in Isla Vista. After talking to my transfer counselor I've learned that I can probably transfer to USC and start as a sophomore in the fall of 2015 if I take certain classes this spring. USC was actually my second choice behind UCSB but I didn't get into either and I decided to TAG into UCSB rather than attend one of the four years I did get into.    * Enough about me though, what I'm wondering is, how is the greek life at USC compared to the scene on DP here in IV? Am I going to feel let down by it after I've experienced Halloween and Deltopia?   * Coming from a middle class family that hasn't done anything spectacular,  what are my chances of actually getting a bid from a good fraternity? (My cousin is an ATO so that could be cool).  * Does the USC campus have a college town vibe or does it feel like you're in a big city?  Thanks!   if you want a device to get things done, to not play with - Blackberry is what you get.  That was true like 5 or 6 years ago when the blackberry waa making the only widely produced phone that resembled a smartphone and had a full keyboard but nowadays it doesn't matter. Iphone, Galaxy,  it doesn't matter because they all have business apps, full keyboards, and ease of use. If you just want to do business then any of the major smartphones will work for you just about equally.    Comment graveyard turn back now   Uhhh guys someone should look into this guy      Boobs   I crashed my bike today and now my confidence is a bit shot.I haven't ridden regularly for about four years and I bought the bike on Thursday to get around school and I've ridden it pretty much everyday since and I've loved it! However, tonight I was going for a ride and asi pulled away from the stop sign I stood up and pedaled which threw me off balance and caused me to crash in the middle of the street. Honestly I'm lucky I was under a street light so the oncoming car saw me and stopped. I managed to get away with a few minor scrapes on my elbow and what feels like a bruised rib. My main problem is I'm embarrassed, my confidence is shot, and I'm a bit scared to go riding again. Any advice?    I think you mean santa barbara/isla vista   shit that isn't a crime  It is a crime. Public use of marijuana, much like alcohol, remains illegal in Washington. They're being dropped because of the way they were written and because he was targeting.    Because the last orgy you went to ended with you shitting on a couple girls   You and your boys should spray paint "rapists" in big letters on their house using acrylic paint.   They're not cops.   There's another factor, reddits cop hate circle jerk. A picture of a police car parked in a faded handicap spot got more upvotes than this and people were calling on OP to send the picture to all of his local news outlets. It was fucking retarded. The kicker? the spot wasn't even legally considered a handicap spot anymore.    I'd like to be able to do what iphones can and have access to the camera without unlocking the phone so that if I give it to someone to take a picture I don't have to worry about them snooping through my stuff.    Coming from an Oregon kid, eehhhh. The metrosexual hipster motherfuckers get pretty into soccer but outside of the Portland metro nobody really gives that much of a shit about soccer.

Not everyone has the mental capacity to bring on the next stage of civilization. And we've only been in this stage for 20 or so years.    Yeah? And what will they do instead?  Sit around mindlessly watching TV until their unemployment runs out?   Get rid of needless jobs like truck driving.  I am not looking forward to that. Between the 3.5 million semi truck drivers, 233k taxi drivers, 650k+ bus drivers, and the rest of the driving jobs in the US, commercial self driving car technology is an unemployment time bomb waiting to explode. This is the one technology that I truly think needs to have sanctions placed on it for commercial use.   Another one here   That's the issue. I can't be there for him. We go to different colleges now and his new "experienced" friends came up with the idea to try edibles. I'm honestly worried about him getting that high with people stupid enough to give a first timer an edible. I gave him advice like eating a full meal beforehand? only taking a bite and giving it time to kick in, but I can just tell that this is going to go south.   So my friend has decided to get high for the first time, I personally don't have a problem with this. I do have a problem with his method however. For his first high ever he will be using edibles.......... I told him that this is a terrible idea and he should smoke for his first time because it'll be easier to control his intake level but he refuses and says I'm iver reacting.    Planned parenthood for the win   Where do you live..?   Fuck I miss oregons friendliness. It's just not the same down here in socal.   Mine resistant has become a buzz word for the police militarization crowd. When looking at MRAPs the key word for police is armored. If you're rolling up to an active shooter situation in a squad car you're in for a bad time. The fact of the matter is that even a .22 can penetrate every part of a car except the engine block.   [Here is a video if a .22lr and common pistol rounds being tested on a car door](http://youtu.be/lkYBd9p3b8M). Whether it fits your agenda or not you need to admit that it's well within reason for police departments to own an armored vehicle.    So where are the people that launched the original story alleging police corruption to the front page less than 3 hours after it was posted? Where are the 4k+ upvotes?   That's just ridiculous.  Everyone knows that the Internet was invented by Bill Gates and Steve Job when they were in college.    WNW3's wife? My guess is math or science   I'm not sure how I feel about my teachers being on reddit   I barely knew Canyon but he seemed like a chill dude. I'm sad I didn't get to know him better before this happened. Hannah on the other hand I did know pretty well, and I can honestly say that this could not have happened to a nicer girl. In the seven years we went to school together I don't think I ever saw her wrong somebody.       Hey quick question, is the helmet DOT rated and approved to be worn as a motorcycle helmet?   10th grade science teacher?    Gotta go over to /r/eyebleach after seeing that. NSFL this OP.   Those ROE went into effect in 2010. I call bullshit.   That's backwards retarded and completely misleading. Those rules of engagement are to some extent unique to the US, and were set by Obama. Before 2010, when the Taliban was still using gunfire as a common tactic, it was fire on people that were threats, especially in close quarters areas. Something else to think about:    http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/5/increase-in-battlefield-deaths-linked-to-new-rules/?page=all   http://rt.com/usa/battlefield-deaths-rules-engagement-change-862/    Now, I have friends and people that I love that are cops. If you expect me, them, or anyone they know to support them being restricted to the rules of engagement that soldiers in Afghanistan are binded to then I demand that their equipment be upgraded to afford higher levels of protection.    Not really. Nobody even needed to reload. They all probably just dumped a 13ish round mag which would be reasonable if they were by themselves. It takes a matter of seconds to shoot a magazine that size. They may not have realized that all of them were shooting in that time.    If you wamt to do that then you include all, but if you want to use at as a measurement of the probability of the success of your marriage as the guy I was replying to was, then you don't. Got it?   If you're going into combat with a bunch of 180lb men you should be able to carry at least one of those men on your back. The current standards for men is what the army has decided proves that you are in good enough shape to do that and anything else that gets tossed at you in a war zone. War is not about fairness. It's not about letting a 100lb feminist play dress up and pound her chest while saying she can do a man's job. If she truly wants to go to war she needs to be able to prove that she can pull her own weight and the weight of anybody that gets in a jam while they're out in that war zone.    Before some of yall get all confuzzled. Ranger school is not RIP/RASP, meaning it does not get you into the 75th. Ranger school is a leadership school and it gives you the Ranger TAB whereas someone in the 75th has a SCROLL.   I don't have an exact number but the general rule is once the deed is done it's time to be gone.   That happened.          So I'm making my first weed purchase tomorrow and I'm wondering if I'll need a ziploc or jar or something to contain the scent once I bring it back to my dorm. The RAs have a see it, smell it, hear it policy for checking people.          So I've moved to a new town for college and I've been having a bit of trouble making friends and the few friends I have made are pretty straight edge. But I've always had a bit of an interest in weed so I'd like to try it for the first time. I've met a dealer but he's a bit of an asshole and definitely not someone I really want to spend much time with.      I'll update with pics later, but essentially there's a pink area that extends out to where the plastic surgeon did the electric cauterization and then there's a grayish area where the original mole was. I'm slightly worried that the doctor may have missed some and that it'll regrow.  Edit: kind of grainy but here are pics  http://imgur.com/a/1sGcV                           Like a little yellow *30* days left type counter on the shows page. I say this because I was re watching The Defenders and got halfway through before it was taken down.                Where does one go to join these leagues?   I'm still sporting the 'ole high school mop top. Never really had short hair before so I need somebody that can figure out what would look good on me.                             Just spotted a female, early 20s, walk onto my neighbors front deck and lean over the railing to do something, she then got back on her bikd and rode jn circles in the intersection while swearing to herself before traveling south down Washington st.                        So here's the deal, I've got a mole in the middle of my face and it's always bugged me and I want to get it removed before I go to college. I had an appointment with a dermatologist and they referred me to a plastic surgeon because they couldn't get the scar to flow with the natural lines of my face. The plastic surgery place was slow to get back to me and it's now a week and a half from the time I leave for college and I'm just now getting the appointment set. I originally wanted to have the procedure done here abd then have a doctor in my college town remove the stitches, but it seems like that might not even be possible at this point,  so if I had a consult here would the doctor be able to send his notes to a doctor in my college town so I could have it done right when I arrive or is that unlikely/illegal/impossible etc?  Edit:  Conversely, is it possible to have the procedure and consult done in the same appointment?    I was helmet shopping and the store owner was hard selling me a high viz kabuto kamui. The price is around $250 and it seems like a decent helmet. It's got the eye glasses insert port things, a drop down sun visor, an antifog insert, and a quick clip chin strap thing.   Apparently the company is new to the US so the products are being sold more cheaply than they normally would. The guy at the store basically said that they're only a step below Shoei.  Is that true? If it is then it seems like a pretty good deal but I'm not sure.    A couple weeks ago I overhead a conversation at the DMV but it's just now dawning on me how amazing this guy is.   So I arrived at the DMV and took my number. Usual DMV shit. I've got like a 90 minute wait time. I go take a seat and end up eavesdropping on a conversation that's happening behind me. It's this 20 something black kid talking to a 40 something Hispanic dude with a fairly thick accent. They're shooting the shit and doing the normal small talk thing and the hispanic guy gets around to asking the kid what he does. The kid says that he usually works construction but hasn't been able to find a job lately. They talk a bit about construction and then the hispanic guy tells the kid how to apply for a job at McDonald's and how it's a great place and whatnot. At this point I'm sorta rolling my eyes and thinking what the fuck is this guy talking about. The kid says he's applied everywhere and no one is hiring. The hispanic guy says to apply to a specific McDonald's location and that he can get the kid some hours. At this point the kid asks how he can do that and the hispanic guy replies that he's the owner of that location. The kid asks how that came to be and the hispanic guy says that his family immigrated to California ehen he was about 10. During high school he knocked up his girlfriend and took a job at McDonald's to pay all the bills. He worked at McDonald's for 20 years before he was promoted to manager and after 5 more years he had saved up enough money to purchase a franchise location.    I'm blown away. I look at my life and myself and I know I couldn't do that. I couldn't work at a fast food restaurant for 20 years to support my family. That man is a better man than me and he's only ever worked at fucking McDonald's.       So I picked up a high viz kabuto kamui today for $250 and now I'm off to check out bikes. The guy said that it's one of the better helmets in the price range, which I believe. He also said that it's of Shoei quality but since it's new to the US it's not as pricey yet. Not sure how true that is, but I'm happy with my purchase!    So the basic strength test is that you need to lift a stretcher loaded w/ a 150lb person with help. That's easy enough with deadlift training but I was talking to some EMTs and some people over in /r/ems and they said that deadlifts are all fine and good, but more often than not you're not going to have time or room to use proper DL form and I'll be carrying the stretcher in awkward positions on stairwells and stuff. So that said, I'm doing Coolcicada's PPL right now, but I want some suggestions for a workout that will strengthen all the little muscles in my back so I don't snap it if I'm lifting a 210lb dude from a weird position.    I just moved to town and I'm looking for a place to gamble. Primarily hold 'em and blackjack. How is the gambling there? Are they fair (or at least as fair as you expect a casino to be) or is it kind of shady?   I'm looking for a place with a large selection, particularly of helmets, but most of the places in the area seem to be smaller gear stores attached to bike dealers. I know I can order from revzilla but I prefer buying helmets in person   So I'm in a car doing 45 on a four lane road and I've got a car in front of me, a motorcyclist slightly behind in the lane next to me and a car in front of the motorcyclist. This van is coming up behind me doing 55-60 and the car in front of me decides to slow down to turn right. Well, the van doesn't see us slowing until the last second so to avoid rear ending me he swerves into the left lane still going ~55. The motorcyclist somehow sees him at the last second and guns it while swerving into the space in front of me.  If that motorcycle didn't have that reaction time I would be telling a different story. Stay safe out there.                        I did everything you're supposed to do. I showered after every workout. I changed clothes after workouts. I dried my shit off after every shower. But one day I fucked up. It was a particularly hot day (95ish F) and I did my usual mid day cardio workout. I was in a rush so I skipped my post workout shower and went straight to my next location. I then went to my afternoon weightlifting sesh and ran into my buddy. We got to talking and I ran out of time so I skipped the shower again. The next day I pop in the shower and **HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS WHAT THE FUCK.** My left thigh and the left side of my balls were burning like a mother fucker. Now I've gotta spend 2-4 weeks using antifungal cream on my junk before my shit stops burning or I can have sex that isn't painful and embarrassing.    Be careful ladies (yes you too) and gentlemen. This stuff sucks.  	165
 Bullet 10, page 8 of the Senate report clearly states the CIA manipulates the media to, in turn, manipulate public opinion. Evidence that this exact type of article cannot be trusted without supporting evidence. Evidence anonymous polls are unable to provide.      Laughed hard            Almost 2015 Trying this hard   Reading about the Pioneer plaque, and Sagans contribution to it. Then I started thinking to myself "How would we translate that same type of  message if we saw it?" Do we know the location of other stars relative to pulsars?   Thanks!      I can only speak for myself when I say I personally follow this because I'm stunned there's anyone left in the political process willing to call out the banks. It's encouraging to know not everyone has given up.   "So let me say this to anyone who is listening at Citi  I agree with you. Dodd-Frank isnt perfect. It should have broken you into pieces.  Amazing.      I would strive to be worthy of returning as Glenn Howerton.      If corporations are people, and Sony is paying hackers to DDOS sites on the web, the DoJ and the FBI need to start opening cases against Sony immediately.         You are advocating terrorism. How you sleep at night is beyond me...      Making this issue out to be a Bush vs Obama issue is disgusting and beneath this nations reputation.   Obama wrote an executive order banning these techniques, an order Bush COULD have signed in the form of a bill passed by the House and the Senate but he chose instead to VETO a bill requiring CIA to conform to the Army Field Manual when utilizing interrogation strategies.   Obama has allowed drone strikes, NSA wiretapping and many other atrocities, but don't try to tie CIA torture around his neck. This one is owned by the Bush administration generally and GWB/Dick Cheney specifically. It is a stain on our country the likes of which has not been seen since slavery and any attempt to justify it or distract from the topic is indefensibly atrocious.                   I hope each box comes with only a fortune cookie. Inside the cookie, a random quote from Ted Cruz.      LOL!   Quite the opposite. You may have made it better.   Cannot unsee         Picture?   I collect things people think others shouldn't own. It's a weird hobby sometimes. My unopened series one bin laden versus USA handheld video game is probably near the top of the list. No idea of value, but just for sheer "WTF", it's my prized one.   Also, how much do you have/want? What is your prized possession in your collection?   That is astoundingly selfless.   The TLC channel to go bankrupt.          They definitely frighten me.   I'm thinking a Fleshlight                  "Emma Watson has extraextramarital affair with Emma Stone"   "Now That's What I Call Not Music" Volume 1?   "George W. Bush states videotaped encounters with gay escort were a  'misunderstanding' "    "I have a meeting in the morning so I can't be out too late."   I love Warren and agree wholeheartedly on this topic. However, she should divorce herself of Manchin immediately, he could not be a worse partner. The guy is worthless.                     Calling in sick to my job in NYC, then watching the events unfold that morning on September 11th, 2001. Really messed me up. Office was next to WTC 7, and I never went back. Quit that day.       Compare George Zimmerman to Ted Bundy and he looks like a boy scout. It's not the volume. It's the act itself IMO   That makes one of us.      I'm interested to see your source for that definition, because I can't find anything stating a stereotype must be based on observance. In fact, the stereotypes of southern Americans being inbred would be virtually impossible to observe unless you are incredibly perverse and have a lot of time on your hands.   How would a poor black person afford KFC? That is an expensive place to eat. And don't get me started on Popeyes raising their menu prices.   Yes, because no stereotype ever sprung to life out of ignorance and fear...   West Virginia. All of them.      Until you collectively start punishing the ISP's that are paying these douche bags, you're not helping anything. You need to hit Comcast and Verizon where it counts. THE WALLET.  "I don't have any other options" you say?  Then you're contributing to the problem.   How is Russia dependent on the US dollar? Not sure how that works. Their banking? Industry?  Sorry, genuinely curious about that.  And the shift from our currency isn't just these two, it appears to now involve Qatar, even Canada.(http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-10/petrodollar-panic-china-signs-currency-swap-deal-qatar-canada).                             War on Soda   Nice to see something funny posted to r/funny every now and then.   I could wear that quote on a shirt.   I was thinking Pasteur, but whatever fits.   "Comcast welcomes the FCC ruling."   Since you invited it, I'm afraid you're a defeatist. Fortunately, as history has shown, it only takes one person to create the change millions say is impossible.            From Terminator II to Edge of Tomorrow and tons of examples in between, I have always seen characters discover keys to a vehicle by opening the sun visor. Does anyone actually keep keys there? Where did this start?      It's in the sky. It's an object. I can't identify it. It's a UFO to me until you reverse any of those points.      Best script for a montage ever.   One of my least favorite words in the English language.   We tend to make it theatrical. Each argument has some ridiculous genesis, so the endings typically have to be creative and have a bit of flair. If it keeps up, by the time we're 50 we're going to be hiring full time script-writers.         So, completely different than the US? ;)  Similar for me. I think the concept of electoral college needs to go, centralized banking needs to go and I think we should elect Presidents for one 8 year term without ability to run again and Congress for one 4 year term without ability to run again so they get in office, focus on the work and then get out without having a few years of campaigning overlapping with "work".     LONG answer, sorry in advance but -   Similar situation with me, as you saw in prior discussion. My heart still feels "abnormal" and it's been 10 months. A heaviness or squeeze...I can't explain it  but I feel like I am cognizant of every heartbeat and this is new to me since my heart attack/myocarditis dx.  I had the flu last December, then a week or two after recovering, I was drinking with my wife at an event and felt sudden pain in my heart. Significant. I was half drunk  so I actually joked about it with her. "Wow if my arm starts to hurt I'm in tr- OW FUCK". I took way more aspirin than I should have and went to the ER, they doubted me until they saw lab results blah blah blah.  Long story short, staying at Johns Hopkins, the cardiologist told me myocarditis is difficult to positively diagnose and even more difficult to treat since many times the root cause of the issue is unknown. While still in the hospital, I receive a call from the wife of a friend of mine who I had not seen in several years. Come to find out he had a heart attack post myocarditis diagnosis and was in intensive care.35 years old. I'm 34.   His wife asked me for advice about what to tell the doctors, what to have them look for since I seemed like I was about to be discharged and he was in a hospital in another state.   The next day, he died.  Fast forward to now, and sometimes I think I'm losing my mind. I still feel each heart beat, I'm fucking terrified of getting the flu again and it feels like the medical community as a whole knows fuck all about myocarditis or what to do to prevent it. Every single doctor I've dealt with has a different opinion.  I love Johns Hopkins and I do feel it's an amazing medical center, but even their internal staff have differing opinions on what it is and how it should be dealt with. Some told me it will resolve and I'll be fine. Others told me it can be chronic and I have to weigh myself daily to watch for fluid retention or congestive heart failure symptoms. Some told me it was "just one of those things" and I'm fine. Others told me it could significantly impair me for the rest of my life.  One doctor (Hopkins is a learning hospital so you get a million docs) told me this summary "Myocarditis is so incredibly rare, it's essentially winning the worst lottery you can think of. And I have a better chance of guessing tonights winning numbers than telling you if you will go through this again."  What I have learned of myocarditis is : It seems to strike a disproportionate amount of healthy young men between 18-35 (obviously it affects more than just healthy young guys), it's possible to survive it with minimal scarring or damage if you take aspirin or blood thinners the moment you feel a true onset (at least that's how it went for me. Heart MRI showed "virtually no scarring"), it causes anxiety, depression, insomnia etc, it feels as if it changes the way my heart feels in my chest, there are many cases of chronic myocarditis and there's no definitive way anyone has explained to me to be declared "cleared" of it or to be certain it won't happen again.   Sorry for the lengthy rambling, I am at work on break and this is something I'm incredibly passionate about. I wish you the best in health, you are so much younger than me and I felt like a kid on the telemetry wing, I can;t imagine how this is impacting you. Feel free to message me if you ever need to vent, I'm as sympathetic as anyone. Take care.  tl:dr - myocarditis is largely a mystery in healthcare and it messes with your head              Humanoid figures that communicate in Gilbert Gottfrieds voice.   I'm curious how they managed to keep this buried until now. Then they only admitted it in regulatory filings. They didn't even come out and admit this happened until they absolutely had to.      Hearing scheduled to start at 09:00 Mountain Time in Colorado.            TIL SJW's post more exaggerated stories on Reddit than any other website I visit.      chemistry.about.com/cs/howthingswork/a/aa011604a.html  "Why the flu vaccine doesn't work"  This is coincidental correlation in OP article. Please stop posting this garbage, it makes those of us who are pro vaccine look like assholes. The flu vaccine is one the least beneficial health tactics ever, and yes I'm counting thalidomide when I say this.  It invokes a false sense of trust that makes people like OP and the thousands who upvoted this article feel "safer" when they receive it, when the science says otherwise. Denying the science behind the ineffectiveness of flu vaccinations is like denying the science behind climate change - you are intentionally skewing data to see things the way you want to see them.       I'm sorry, I don't speak stupid. Is there someone that can translate this? Thanks.   For some reason, there doesn't seem to be any books to add. I looked everywhere, but you cannot add books to your Juggalo.      Horrible moderation (ie Bathia). Horrible layout. Inconsistent policy enforcement. Overall it just fell apart. The failure to keep up with the times led to it becoming a joke. And I was a first/second year Farker, I used that site for nearly 8 years before abandoning it because of the above mentioned things.   Obviously it doesn't remove water from existence lol as I stated, this is based on an assumption the water would be reintroducted into the same running units as it evaporates.    Air conditioning dehumidifies and draws moisture from the air. Could millions of air conditioners in a condensed area impact rain cycles in any way? Making the assumption that the water that precipitates and falls from any of the units then evaporates and enters a unit again.  Thanks!        	118

Here's the full movie on YouTube http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l5DZhDH8eew      Very true, noth parties have been giving up some garbage politicians. Also the good politicians from either side are completely overshadowed.    People that are too far left or right in politics. They just babble nonsense constantly.    Term limits for congress. Make lobbying illegal and strictly enforced.             Zagina   Or the shuffling of papers is louder than dialogue.  That always bothered me.    True, they're border line failed state.    Maybe they borrowed it from a friend            That's one way to stop a riot, just drive through is.    There used to be some legitimately good republican politicians, now day's they're all just psycho.    Bernie Sanders is one of the only politicians that's for the people. Regardless of what he runs as independent/democrat he has my vote.          I'll have to use this on my wife.    Squid jerky.    It's never ogre   Can't have a military industrial complex without it.    Now they know most politicians aren't actually for the voters.       I think that's just a woman knowing she's hot thing. Continue the criticism until people are enlightened.    Does it ever bother either of you knowing your SO is with someone else?   So Picasso's wife just walked up and said "you look pretty cool, take this box of art." Doesn't sound like the best defense strategy.    I could see why.

 Superb. I'm not a huge Fishbone fan but this is a great song and a great performance.    Sadly, I think you're right, things are going to have to get worse before they get better. 'They' will fight and the fight will be ugly, but that's the only way things will, eventually, get better. How many more men will have to be destroyed by family "law" before we, collectively, wake up? Not sure, but marriage is certainly taking a serious hit and the more men that opt out the better  http://www.the-spearhead.com/2010/01/08/the-end-of-marriage-2/    It occurs to me that the (disputed) Gandhi quote: "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." is very much applicable to the Men's Rights movement. Twenty years ago, the men's rights movement basically didn't even exist, or existed in a very small, marginalized form. Today, it seems as though we're transitioning from the "laugh at you" to the "fight you" stages. Make no mistake, it's still a marginalized movement, but it is a recognized movement that feminists now feel the need to fight (i.e. Warren Farrell at U of T). There are more people every day who are realizing that the current feminist-dominated culture simply isn't working. Let's keep it up.    Is it just me, or does that picture from 1999 say it all? Fraser's face is all "Please help." and her's is "I'm gonna take this motherfucker for every dime he's worth."

If you like that, check out Trinity and Beyond: The Atomic Bomb Movie. A history of nuclear testing, with stunning footage, a superb soundtrack and narrated by Shatner!  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_and_Beyond  Truly awesome movie.       Shoah.  Ten hour documentary about the holocaust with no historical footage, mostly interviews with survivors. Incredibly difficult to watch, but essential.    Oh man, this is a very difficult movie to watch. Really don't think I'd want to go through this twice, but it is a masterpiece.    He did it last Thursday:  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/182fth/i_am_matt_taibbi_politics_writer_for_rolling/       Richard Wolff helps explain the situation:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZU3wfjtIJY     ....and will find that after a thorough and exhaustive re-examination of all the facts, that they were completely and totally right in the first place.     Because oil.    "Slavery with a chance of medical care." Good one!    Actually, the manliest thing he ever did was work with the brilliant but psychotic Klaus Kinski...more than once!    Google: Self-driving cars in 3-5 years.   Feds: Yeah, sure, totally...as soon as we work out a scheme of kick-backs, illegal campaign donations and tax schemes so we can get what's ours.   Pizzey.    1971 Dodge Challenger from [Vanishing Point](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA4ymmXa8rs).   Tarantino's scripts are fantastic, and always worth checking out if you like his films. Check out the script for Django Unchained and Kill Bill, esp. I think they would've been better movies (especially the ending in Django) if he had stuck to his scripts more closely.    I can quit anytime I want.    Quite the contrary. You're going to see how feminist theory influences Family Law first-hand. I worked at a state AG office for two years, it was a real eye-opener as to how feminist theory dominates public policy.    Don't even get me started on The Black Eyed Peas....   Logic...critical thinking...rational decision making...game theory....identifying logical fallacies....I apply lots of the philosophy I learned every single day.    [Tuco in the bath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCB3fnXDzew)    My two favorite shots are both from the same movie and come immediately after each other.

Fucking beautiful.   Hands down, my favorite performance of all time is Eli Wallach as Tuco in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. As a performance, it is simply magic to watch. The character is so well-realized it's easy to forget that there's even an actor there, all you see is the character. I will never get tired of him or this movie.         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc8WN3q4VKs     "Is it worth learning about Nietzsche at some point in my life?

Ha, true about both sides of his personality. I heard about it from When We Were Kings where Plimpton talks about trying to get it into the GBOWR as the shortest poem ever, and it seemed that in the context, in front of a crowd, it was more a "we" thing. Whatever, good job with the design!   Awesome design....but pretty positive it's "Me, We" as in we're all part of the same human family instead of "Whee!" which is a little too silly for the greatest of all time!   It's not what you did, it's how you did it.    TIL Mark Zuckerberg is even an asshole on his business card.    Holy crap, Minecraft is huge!!

That's this American white man. And they have proved it throughout the country by the police dogs and the police clubs. A hundred years ago they used to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken off the white sheet and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs, and they're still doing the same thing. And just as Uncle Tom, back during slavery, used to keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhound, or resisting the Ku Klux Klan, by teaching them to love their enemy, or pray for those who use them spitefully, today Martin Luther King is just a 20th century or modern Uncle Tom, or a religious Uncle Tom, who is doing the same thing today, to keep Negroes defenseless in the face of an attack, that Uncle Tom did on the plantation to keep those Negroes defenseless in the face of the attacks of the Klan in that day."                                                        	190
 Terrible, in my opinion.    Try to log out   long into Uplay. May work.    For the Playstation Sotre, or what?   You can Google for the 1.01 version of this app (.ipa format) and transfer it to your iPhone/iPad.    I'm personally a great fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise and owned every single game in special edition's, and I confess that some games (especially Black Flag), weren't that great and even terrible.   However, Unity is absolutely grand. Sure, there're a few FPS drops (On PS4, I don't know how are thing on the PC), and there're a few bugs but overall I found this game amusing and interesting. I can see the amazing work Ubisot has put into this game and honestly, after playing it almost 20 full hours, I simply cannot understand the terrible reviews this game received.  This, in my opinion, outranks Assassin's Creed 2 which I used to consider one of the best action-adventure games ever. I agree with everything said and I think the devs should be praised AT LEAST for the enormous effort they put into this game, even while some may discourage them for the bugs, story etc.    Geez, this is so beautiful.    Oh yea baby! We're golden!    [Johnny Garrett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Garrett) was probably innocent (he declined to make a last statement though).   It makes me feel bad. It's crazy, even with the website that mentioned their last statements, how even such murders seem so human and sympathetic.  How can someone look at those meals, trying to hang onto every single bite and taste, knowing it's your last. It's something I could never understand.    http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_info/tignergeraldlast.html  Perhaps it is terrible for me to consider those people human. It makes me wonder how many of those people were actually innocent. I guess that's the worst thing about the death penalty.

It went smooth (;    It feels slightly worse on my iPad Mini 2, so I wanted to know if you also notice a difference. If so, what's your device and how bad is it?    Is it dangerous to update if my device is Jailbroken? What will/can happen?      Internet.    Good luck! I heard that pot isn't that hard to leave off. It's not physical addiction.   This experience touched my heart so greatly I had to share it. It was posted in Hebrew, online, yet since I'm an Israeli I decided to translate it and share it with you.   A few days ago the little one asked for pizza. Fucking pizza. Four or five dollars, depending on whether it is with or without additions. And you try to convince her that we will eat at home and a fried egg is a thousand times more delicious and you will make her a cool face with a cucumber as a nose and a smile of pepper on the plate. But she wants a pizza. And you try to coax her, because you have looked at the wallet. You have three dollars and twenty cents. Eighty cents are missing to reach one slice of pizza. And you curse yourself for every beggar and a street musician you ever gave your cents when you still had money, and you remember how you allowed yourself indulge a few days before with a mini-croissant at the bakery by the house and it was a croissant that was sold by weight and cost two dollars and a half, and you're flooded with feeling of guilt. With those two dollars and half in your wallet you would buy her the pizza, and even put her additions above it.  And it is humiliating to think about it. Humiliating that you even grieve yourself over eighty cents, and even more than you don't have eighty cents to buy pizza for the girl. And you already think in your head to perhaps ask the pizza seller to be forgiving on eighty cents and to promise him you will return tomorrow, and plan to take of your parents money at night and then drive to him in the morning and put a whole dollar on the counter and say thanks and keep the change because he was so nice.  But meanwhile you are with the kids in the middle of the street, and the girl wants pizza. And you explain that you want very much to take them because they were lovely and the best kids in the world, but you don't have money right now (because you didn't really think to ask the pizza seller a discount: to put your problems on him would be exaggerated), and then her older brother tells her: "Daddy doesn't have money for pizza. Let's eat at home. It would be fun, I promise". And he asks you in worried eyes if you don't have money because they have asked too many things in the past, and you say that not at all and force out your strongest laughter, and tell him that it is completely fine to ask and that they are the most wonderful kids and allowed to ask for everything they want and if you can you would give it to them, and with all his syllable you feel you died a little more inside. And you are so happy that they both get to you more or less to the waist and you lift your head and look to the heavens so they won't see the look on your face. And then the little one says "OK", and does not seem to really care. Then she says, "I found a bill of five dollars this week, and I put my pot at mom. Can I give it to you and then you will have money?" And she asks that in the best look and most innocent and sweetest and most meaningful there is and you die even more inside.  Then thousands of nails being fired at you at once, and digging into the flesh and the heart wishes to explode, and it is hard to breathe because the chest twitches in quick breaths of pre-crying and you swallow and rise your eyes as much as possible until there is no more lids to try to keep help the tears do not escape out of the sides of the eye and feel the tip of the nose begins to leak. And you walk, all three of you on the street, and small hands holding your hands as if you are an island of stability for them, and you feel the exact opposite of island of stability: you are humiliated, because you never occurred to yourself to not have change for pizza when your daughter will ask. Because you never thought would go down the street with two children that one day would understand how much you don't have to give them. How much you cannot provide them with the little pleasure they wanted: something not too expensive. A slice of pizza.  I may translate more if you're interested.

 It's so hard to get excited for games anymore. It's almost as if games have no desire for to be played more than once. Where is that game that desires hundreds of hours of my life? Why do they no longer satisfy me as they once did?   cuz that would be gross :P   thats what makes it so sweet, just dominating those fugs   The trainer should have known, Break dancing-type is super effective against cat-type.   SOB!   I Sin at times. Pornography, drug use, gossip etc. I'm not proud of it but I do. The Bible secures salvation for those who believe in Christ. Why is it at times I feel saved, and when I sin I feel guilty and no longer feel saved?   kool      If by grammar, you mean't Nazi, then yes.    I'm almost felt bad for him. Not sure why. Something about really fat kids has always saddened me deeply. I was chubby when I was little. Never that big. But that level of fat, plus a pounding to the face is too much for me to handle.    Don't thank me. Thank the kids who ate shit to bring you said pleasure :)   Yup!   Does it all go to research? Is there any profit made from this large amount of funding?   Were there little kids aboard?   I know I love the kid taking his first steps and subsequently his last before a stampede of canines lays him out. I also love making it to the front page with zero effort lol 420blazeitfagget      Jesus, the guys not dead...   Where's adam gonna go?   I thought Adam started Rev3?

Why does it need cameras?   I work more than 40 hours a week. I feel like the excitement in my life consists of waiting until my days off to do something fun. I have no real direction or goals. Every one says you should get married and start a family, but will that really solve anything? What would you suggest I do?   Yeah, but he's not talking about you and your perseverance, of which God has provided you. He's talking about himself and crying out for help from the people he used to trust. Have some sensitivity and pray for this man.     TIL that cartwheel kicks are the strongest kicks   When they target people. Who do they target them for? Like, who's calling the shots for all the surveillance?    so true. i wanna die   ya pizza shit   Or maybe they didn't change at all. Maybe, the United States' motives changed and these gentlemen were just in the way.    lol tho it goes without saying this is a joke, I shouldn't have to explain to a Christian the importance of "not getting offended". If this extent of mockery boils your blood, I'd hate to see how you'd react under legitimate prosecution.    Hwoah...      Which one's which!!!! ahhhhhhhh   They would've worked harder if they had themselves a SNIGGERS bar!   Yeah, just like Instagram right? Mark has made it clear that he doesn't just come in and fuck shit up. He bought them, but they aren't disbanding. He's not taking over every last little detail. This can only help Oculus.

I'm writing a short story right now, and as much as I love it, i only ever get to it maybe once every so often.   But awesome narrative nonetheless!   Haha, I liked the chauvinism. Is there more?   and what doesn't sound interesting about that??   You're right. I'm not gonna send this paycheck to her after all.    Yeah, if you enjoy mainstream music that legitimately follows a formula and sounds identical. They all attend the same conferences and are considered the "standard" of Americanized worship. It's nonsense to say a certain brand of music worships God any more absolute than another type with the same intentions.       Yeah, "Christian Music" sucks, the Kirk Cameron specials suck. It all sucks and is not entertaining in the least. How is a non-believer suppose to watch crap like this and suddenly wanna be on board the baby train.   no, the second shots were bean bags. The initial shots were bullets. the man is dead.       My heart goes out to all families from every nation that lost someone, but at this point, its the media's obligation to move on. We have huge issues occurring throughout Eastern Europe and Russia, and by now, this plane is more of a distraction than anything else. Also, Joe Scarborough and all news people who blatantly won't stop talking when someone with something relevant is speaking should all be boiled in a pot of their own bullshit that spews from their mouths.      i love how its just like,  *bite*, "AHHHHHH!!!!"   Yes, question it. It will either strengthen your view or otherwise. I'm anticipating the former.   So last night it was planned by coworkers to go out for a birthday and get thoroughly drunk, as is common practice.   Leading up to last night, I was feeling all these convictions that I needed to get away from that and just tell them I couldn't go. But I of course was afraid of their judgement of me, since I see them more than 40 hrs a week.  In the morning I was invited to a campus Christian ministry gathering and started to really feel convicted at that point to not participate in the later part of the day's activities.  I end up going out and we had all been drinking for about 4 hours at this point and randomly at the one bar, I run into an old Chrisitan friend. We immediately discuss things about Jesus and he begins telling me all about the low points he had been going through since I last saw him. Depression, guilt and thoughts of suicide. He had since gotten back on track but as we kept talking I felt more and more convicted to just leave the bar and my coworkers and just pray.   So we end up going outside and praying for one another and now I'm Going to attend his church this morning.  As I was driving home, I saw a guy hailing my car like a taxi and I picked him up, cuz what else better do I have to do at this point.   We end up talking and I come to find out that he too had been struggling very hard with alcohol and we started to talk about Jesus. He explained to me about how far he had strayed away from his faith and how everything we were discussing came at the perfect timing of God, as he had no other explanation as to how we came together so specifically at this time at this place.  We prayed together and he and myself were so strengthen by Jesus that night. My coworkers may hate me for just leaving them, but that conviction to leave on whim had led me to someone God needed to build up that night (myself included). They may not understand me and may even shoot me down, but Jesus understands and I couldn't be more thankful to participate in the work God has provided.   yeah, i thought we were gonna play in the future. too bad they love MONEY so much!      Snoresville    "Shoots", what is this IGN?   Eeeeeeeevilllllllllllll         its better than the other ones   War is never good. Ever. Only to defend one's self. Our current occupation of Middle Eastern countries to combat "Terrorism" is a myth and strictly based on Corporate Imperial Consumerism.  We as a country need to take a stand now to ensure that our leaders in Washington never lead us into the horrors of War again. As for what we are involved in currently, we must bring an end to it.  Far too many of our young men and women are being destroyed physically and emotionally due to the exact same circumstances that your grandfather and all the men in this picture have experienced. We must take a stand.     yeah, pastors need to be good examples but obviously they screw up to. let's just pray for him and show support. Show him the love of Christ's forgiveness.    Well, when your differing beliefs aren't actually found in the Bible, you can see where the discrepancy would arise.    Boner.   oh, maybe. didn't think of that i guess. my bad. But Catholicism has some pretty differing traditional beliefs generated by the church such as Purgatory, Confession to a Priest, and Praying to the Mother Mary, all of which are pretty different from conventional biblical beliefs.    Yeah, thats what I said.    how do we destroy them?   Because they're referring to the different sects and that is what Catholicism is, a different sect. Though for some reason, of all the seperate sects, Catholicism is the only one that would most likely correct someone that they're Catholic if called Christian. I personally feel there shouldn't be this amount of differation, it creates segregation and superiority complexes.   that feeling you get when you just wanna go there but can't   not at all. post 9/11 media conditioning. You are the Pavlovian dog of fucked up videos.     same exact thought, except expecting explosion. EX EX EX   Gilbert Gottfried    wish they woulda made the mech battles as good as Hawken   you're evil   haha I actually had to check the context of what I said to see if I came off gay lol. But no, I am not gay. My opinion is just, Jesus said "Don't cast your pearls to swine". As in, your most precious treasure lies in the truth that we find in the salvation of Jesus Christ (His life, sacrifice, and resurrection). All you can do is live that life style and present that truth to people, nothing more. If they deny you, you do what Jesus instructed us to do, "Wipe off the dirt and move on". We can't force the message of the Gospel down someone's throat if they have no desire to hear it. So when I hear a Christian say that our country or world has a homosexuality "issue", all I can do is giggle. Our entire world is cursed with Sin - none bigger or smaller in God's eyes. So for us to label something as a particular "issue", insinuating that it is something that can be eradicated through our own doing, would be rather insulting to God, don't you think? It's like stating that a certain cup filled with poison is more dangerous to drink than another particular cup holding the same type of poison. The size and shape may vary but the only difference is that some drink from one cup and someone else, another cup. We all drink the same poison and it all leads to death.  What I'm eluding to is that, we can't pick and choose Sins as greater, and more detrimental to Christianity as a whole. The only way to lead others to LOVE, is to demonstrate love through our actions. Christ showed this through his life. He interacted with all sinners, acknowledging that all have equally fallen from the righteous that God demands. We must follow this example and love all those outside of Christ's forgiveness equally.   Yeah, I just really don't feel like "Gay Issues" are an issue in this country. A person will choose what they want to be either way. You can only control your own life choices. Not your kids, not your significant other's, not anybody else's - just your own.    I still have dreams about my dogs being alive quite often. The first portion of the dream is me freaking out that they're alive again. Then I wake up. One day when we fall asleep from this life and wake up to the Lord we will see them again.   alright, headed back to r/gaming         source vid!

Cool story braj.   And SCENE. good job, Reddit.   Romans 8:31-39 New Living Translation (NLT) Nothing Can Separate Us from Gods Love  31 What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, wont he also give us everything else? 33 Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No onefor God himself has given us right standing with himself. 34 Who then will condemn us? No onefor Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at Gods right hand, pleading for us.  35 Can anything ever separate us from Christs love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? 36 (As the Scriptures say, For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.[a]) 37 No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.  38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from Gods love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[b] neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrownot even the powers of hell can separate us from Gods love. 39 No power in the sky above or in the earth belowindeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.   lol      Yeah, but I think he's referring to wrongful condemnation. When you condemn someone for something that is just generally silly to be condemning for and not edifying to the person or God or leading that person to God.  I think it's okay to condemn the wrongful condemners because in reality, you are just trying to spread the truth as you perceive in the light of Christ's teachings.   He is attempting to disclose that the condemnation that he sees others bringing upon others is not "in love" - when Jesus did and told us to do everything in love.    Or....we all are....

You called him a fat ass who died by his own doing. You have no opinion here if you can't see whats right in front of you.   The fuck are you sayin man? You are literally out of your damn mind if you think what you just said is truth.   Yeah, you put it in a deep sleep and press your sonar gadget to wake it up when you need it to defend you...also, notice in the trailer there was a particular bat-like appendage that came down and hit the pavement around 2:07. Looks like Godzirra is gonna be fighting something...   movie qual   Why do the soldiers blindly obey commands?   If it ain't free, it ain't me.   The one that circlejerks about gaycats   well, seeing as im one of the first. its hard to hide among the crowd   Depends on one's interpretation of death as a "bad thing". To some Christian's, death, while trusting in Jesus as their Savior from sins, is actually the best possible scenario because then they would be taken to Heaven with Jesus.     Word up!   At one point I think the game dropped below 5 fps. Or maybe........4 fps. FPS means Foopas Per Scrotum^2 , right?   Thanks dude, same to you. Wanna read my short story so far and give me constructive criticism? If so, shoot me your email and I'll send you the doc.    I guess, I'm not even sure what we're talking about at this point.   The context is referring to John the Baptist. He lived in the wilderness and was a voice preparing people for the coming Messiah, Jesus. Pretty straight forward there. Not sure where you're pulling these differing interpretations from.   I don't see how those two lines vary.   So a friend from school just photoshopped this stupid picture   Maybe me and the Rothschilds could swoop in and set up a nice little banking system for ya? Whaddaya sayyyy?   I'm just saying, our existence, spiritual, fleshly or otherwise operate along the same patterns and laws as was originally breathed into being. As time has progressed, different vocabulary and interpretations have been generated to explain similar operations. There can only ever be one truth, but the Fallen Ones only purpose until judgement day is to lead mankind in the direction of deception. The theory of aliens, though feasible within an evolutionary view point, does not seem to correlate with the Biblical scripture that we hold as The Creator's Word. The incidences in which "extraterrestrial" and "extra-dimensional" entities have been experienced tend to share many qualities with that of conjuration and demonic activity: The use of channeling, sexual abuse and penetration, as well as modes in which they traverse (in and out of the space-time continuum or otherwise). I am only presenting these things to you that you not fall into confusion should you be alive when this day comes. Keep your eyes to the Heavens and be prepared for the return of our Lord, Jesus Christ - today and tomorrow.    Most likely Inter dimensional angelic hosts will pose as aliens as in to deceive the human populace with hopes of reusable energy and longevity of life.   gaygay*   wtf? i didn't even hear about this game once?

 This is the nature of the game and sports. Some of the best players of the 90's made less in their entire careers compared to average players of the 2000s.   If Romney decided to come back in, would he be a big favorite?   Good for her! Women will vote for Hillary for the same reason Barack Obama got almost all of the black vote. She's one of them. I'm not saying it's logical, but it's how people think.   Does it seem like teams are overpaying players just so they can lock them up and not pay them when the new CBA takes effect?   because certain people were raised to be prejudiced and not like brown or black people   People like to vote for people who look and sound like them.          Not that bad? Just the wars and disastrous tax cuts that lead to a near depression economy make him horrible to me. And there is so much more too.    Why doesn't he tell ownership if you don't pay me now I refuse to sign with you ever again? I'm only playing to keep my stock up and sign with another team when the time comes.   will Aaron Rodgers be there?   What did you expect signing all those AARP expendables?    if biden announced though he'd be second :/    LeBron won't like this   I'm sure fox execs are yelling, get those damn interns to find something! read them again!    Bush is known for his endless wars, tax cut for the rich, and destroying the economy. Obama got a lot accomplished and has a strong resume in the history books!      That's kinda cool! will you be like matt damon in elysium or borg in star trek now?       Interim title fight over regular title fight? really?             Steroids will now be allowed as long as you don't inject during the match. Half time is ok.    I think it's more of the banks and corporate puppeteers than Hillary per se         who is the main event now???      This should be obvious to everyone. I don't even think he's that racist. I think he's pandering to the voters in the party.   she's supporting hillary now and doing her dirty work   We just need enough of them not to, but I know you're right.   Until she starts up again. Give it time. There is a lot of time between now and the primary election. She deserves criticism. She came out of nowhere to attack Sanders. Not his positions, not his policies, but the man. Why did she do this? Who is she working for?            So, what about the issues? what about substance? Oh right, it's easier to just attack a source and not talk about those things like claire mccaskill.   oh yeah? people in western europe struggling to escape? like germans want to run away from their universal healthcare and free university education?    why don't you worry more about content than sources? there is no desperation, it's a hail marry to begin with             Why are you making an ad hominem attack? Why don't you just address the content? Some politicians are more in touch with people than others. Reliability is a fair issue.   Voting record bruh. I'm good.    She's not that liberal. She is a corporate democrat. She is a warhawk. She has a voting record. Are you familiar with it? Her backers are banks. She voted  for the war. And they are not lies or smears. They simply asked people who they thought the mansions belonged to.    We can and we should. We don't because Wall Street owns all of the republicans and half of the democrats, those like Hillary Clinton, Claire McCaskill, everyone who voted for the trade deal, and the President himself.    You mean Hillary Clinton's campaign donors?   To me Hillary is no different than republicans. She's a corporately owned and a warhawk. Sometimes conservatives are right about issues and in their criticisms.    I think it's important to consider material based on the content rather than making an ad hominem judgment. Wall Street is paying for her campaign.    No, of course not, just like I would not vote for someone only based on their sex. But it raises important questions. Can she relate to me? Where did she get all that money? IMO no she can't and she got that money from her Wall Street friends who pay her millions of dollars every year for speeches and are paying for her campaign.    Because they concentrate their wealth at the cost of everyone else. Us "wingers", what does that mean again? Well, anyway, we believe in equality, social mobility and the [American Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q).             All the revenue streams you listed will not be realized by a majority of fighters.    We need to catch and surpass Hillary Clinton's 990k.   exactly! i wish someone with skills would do some Sanders Dragon Ball Z animations    they obviously spent the minimum money on this project and don't care at all about the fighters  they're robbing them and insulting them   It's indicative of Reebok's leadership. Any competent company would have oversight and checks.       she's not going to be a VP         He talks about it more in the actual 60miutes story, but I can't seem to find it. He basically said they have horrible leadership, a bunch of clowns working for them. I think UFC's kits are further evidence of that.   They're a horrible corporation on the decline. Listen to what the [Crossfit owner said about Reebok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKnMQKU_-b8).    are we doing a betting pool? i'm going to say 12,000   what if it's larger than 9,500?   crossfit is ditching reebok once their contract is up  the owner hates reebok   that sounds about right               This is telling of the quality of Reebok. Crossfit will leave them when their contract is up. Reebok is a garbage brand and they have some of the worst higher ups in the clothing business.    I wish. I can't afford that either. If only there was a free event.    I can buy 4 of the pride shirts or one ugly Reebok shirt? It's not really a choice.   it is possible they'd have to pay WWE if they used CM Punk?   i was trying to be funny   they own his likeness, i'm sure they knows they'll be using his name long after he's dead    ;)   female presenter gets [roasted](https://twitter.com/theMMAcommunity/status/615897111754768384)   this guy [sums it up](https://twitter.com/acmalin927/status/615898673658986496), the uniforms take away individuality    there is a [Georges](https://twitter.com/fishisoff/status/615898902256947200/photo/1) top too      very lol   was there even one fighter who looked genuinely happy?    That design could have been thrown together in under an hour. I would never wear Reebok's ugly clothes.    this kit was disappointing    that smacking noise he's making with his mouth is very annoying   happens sometimes   typical UFC  the problematic start is symbolic of their fight kit and the reebok deal   You're right. He doesn't have to reach all of them. Just enough of them at the right times.      The USA is not the UK. And Labour is much further to the left than Sanders.   fox news will spin this and say we have to begin bombing Iran ASAP   they got citizens united and still get to execute people, you can't win em all bad guys!    If only there was protection. We need to protect American jobs. We can have a strong economy if people make livable wages, like in all of those well paying manufacturing jobs that have been shipped overseas   Americans should not have to compete with slave labor.                   let's see if he can it up with the new testing policy, his cycling windows might have to get larger, but jacksons is good at what they do   This isn't new. This is what she does. People know what she is before training with her. And her fighters never break down mentally in a fight.   are these kits like a big chunk of the supposed pay ufc fighters are getting? do they get some coupons or vouchers for meals at the soup kitchens too?   beer goggles bruh  and that voice! omg, I want to be Matt Hamill   as it should be, champs can't miss weight, none of this Paulo Filho BS   If the Dems can win the next two presidential elections there is a very good chance the court could be drastically reshaped to be progressive 6-3.   Say the Rebels win. What are the chances they turn on Irael in a decade or two?   How do NATO allies feel about this?    great video!         If the average American can what?   Get rid of the cap on social security taxes. This does not affect the average American at all. If you expand medicare it will bring costs down. Those are the primary social costs.   And take it easy on defense spending, corporate welfare, and tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. And stop the banks for gouging everyone.    That's dishonest, so republican style for sure.   But it wasn't socialism that ruined Greece. It was Greece that ruined Greece. A country can function only so long when people retire young, nobody pays taxes, and everyone wants services.   Western Europe shows us what democatic socialism is.    **Boxing**. Heavyweight champion of the world! **Klitschko vs James**  He has great footwork, balance, height, and reach.    or vice versa?    i bet he  could practice for a few months and play on any team   what particularly? granted, he's very fast, but he's too big to be running sub 10second 100's or sub 20 second 200's   Imagine Megatron but even bigger. LeBron is crazy fast too!      there are many people whose parents lose it   you want the 2nd pick for a first rounder next year?    he's 11 to 1 so you're wrong :)   Barack campaigned as a progressive. He ended up governing as a center of right moderate. He didn't even try to get the public option. Somehow he's called a socialist by the right who more insane every day with the tea party. The Jewish guy who is a socialist democrat is the only honest candidate. He puts American workers first. He doesn't have corporations and the banking industry backing him like Hillary Clinton.   I think you're making a good choice.    there's like a 2% chance of that happening    thank you, you were right   He should not take VP if offered. Why would anyone want to be her VP? We all know Bill will have more power than the VP. Also, Bernie does great work in the senate.    Muslim? Since when? And gay? Did you see some polling somewhere that you would care to share with me?   Personally, I'd like to see an atheist become president but i'm not holding my breath.   he panders to racists and is now #2 for the GOP   and free speech is something the government can't hinder, as far as the company you work for? oh yeah   It's not rehosted. Rings of fire does the program.    and he has decent feet! dirk 2.0      Kristaps Porzingis   The answer is not that simple. The race is dynamic and there are many factors we have to consider. I'm sure it will depend on each particular state.   can't reach more catholics if people are drowning and dying off         [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ)  	139
    I guess it's all a matter of body theory and personal identity theory. I think Hawkings is Hawkings. He has his own mind; he just happens to be placed in a non-functioning body. It ultimately asks the question: Is Hawkings famous for his discoveries or disabilities?    ehh that's arguable. Computers have taken over the extent of which he can communicate in society, but haven't taken him over personally.      Just anything that makes you feel.    I'm looking for songs with a lot of emotion? Just raw, honest, weird stuff with deep lyrics and raw emotion. Any suggestions.      	7

 Are you at Felix neck?   That's a pretty cool Heat map   One big answer?  Pages and pages of codes, regulations and laws, all using the English system.  They are unlikely to be changed because converting these values into metric is messy.  "This building code requires 2.74 meter high ceilings, and the stairs must each be 16 cm tall." or "Companies are allowed to dump, 30,564 liters of sewage into the neighboring stream."  There is a massive amount of regulation that needs to be taken into account.  Also there are dangers involved with changing the units people are familiar with. Imagine the height limit signs on bridges that prevent trucks who are too large from hitting the bridge. Mistakes would constantly be made during the transition period. It's just not worth it.   The truth is, the metric system has replaced everything that matters. We use milligrams for our medication and most scientific research uses metric. NASA sure does. How we measure our drinks and weights really don't matter in the scheme of things, so we don't use metric. Metric's advantage is not important enough to replace the small stuff.   	3
 My point was that there are some SOME :D important questions there and noone give a f**k about those people   Booooooooring....

I can't express how much i love the 'police report' story   Really a great story!   *apologizes for not standing up for himself*   I would be really interested if you maybe made a bunch of these police recordings, maybe with different events and stuff.   I just got a chill. The chances that this is a real story hit me at the end...   I used to play fortunate son back in arma 2 domination   Confusin what is real!!   Nice rifle!

 We were going for the small subtle changes.        I'm cheering for the martians.  Slaine is the man!   Mosquitoes, they suck.   Feed me, seymour.   Am I the only one that thinks Slaine is a good guy?    That book KICKS ASS!   I chew, but that is disgusting.   Now is a good time to.  You won't regret it, even at full price.   I'm still trying to beat TLoU on grounded mode.  It's incredibly difficult but I love it.   Ya s1009RR just looked generic to me.  I really liked the R nineT, if had the money I would buy it today.     Ya know it's the middle of winter I guess I'm just itching to go on a ride.     A Russian wedding without at least 3 deaths is considered a dull affair.   Well I guess we're both going to have to live with this disappointment.   Jeez ya'll a bunch of bitches, who cares what the lingo is. The bike is pretty damn cool.   I've been wrong my entire life.      I'm not gonna lie I'm rooting for slaine.     Bryan cranston- the things they carried.  I had chills the entire time.   "Let justice be done, through the heavens fall".  Everything about that show is badass.   I like that.     She ages like wine.   "Don't believe in yourself! Believe in the me, that believes in you!" - TTGL   Ya I started watching jo jo's buzzar adventure instead.   I don't know but OP's mom sure had one.   Casey Anthony: babysitter.   Third shift Amber ale.   Thanks.   So go poop.   Well, you got 1 upvote from me.   Everybody poops.   Is it funny? Exciting? Dark? Surreal? Gotta give me more.   Looking for a new anime, anyone want to give me their opinion?   They shouldn't let Jay Leno wear that much make-up.   That's a girl?   I'm terribly sorry for your loss.  I can only imagine what you may be feeling right now.   The pipe is a Bassani Covington Hot rod.   Bassani Covington Hot rod      I loved the light novels.  I must have finished them in like less than 3 weeks.  Does anyone know when volume 15 will be out?  	40
 That is hilarious dude. I've seen that movie twas pretty bad, but if she's who I think she is she wasn't so bad. Glad you got away with it all. What did they expect from you!    Yes this. Without a doubt with the new online harassment laws in place you can certainly tear her a new one with very little effort.   If you didn't know who Nicole Aniston was why did you say it? I smell a vintage porn perv!   After re-reading I see you didn't drink it till you got there. Fair enough then :) still an alcoholic though!   Tl;dr socially inept alcoholic drinks and drives, and doesn't kill anyone ..... kudos.   Lol clearly. But at least you retorted with a comprehensible answer excluding you from being an idiot at least :D   Ah makes perfect sense then cause that shit was nigh on perfect!  	7
 since when was a dickbutt a waste of time?   OP cant tell me what to ignore!   I'm also transferring to the master race. this guide helped me so much thanks! (also have some gold)   I work in the middle of the Australian desert for most of the year, it's between 30-50 degrees (Celsius) every day. only been to the snow once and it was amazing! would move to somewhere it snowed if I could   had my bank account hacked somehow... lost all my funds, don't get paid for another fortnight, have a mortgage to pay and bank will take a month to get my money back... 2015 can suck a dick   I would eat that :) hope it tasted nice   nightshift at work (currently am there)   /r/dadjokes needs you!   thanks. sorry to hear that you were bullied badly for it   "don't worry I wont show anyone"   as a child I was always on the bigger side (it never really bothered me) my nickname in school was "fatty" (legit) still it never bothered me. after I left school I never really stepped on scales to weigh myself un till I turned 20, I had no girlfriend and struggled to get girls when I went out with friend. I weighed myself and was 115kg (I'm Australian) after that moment I told myself I would lose it and get fit. its been 3 years now I'm down to 80KG and have had a lovely SO for the last 2 years.   so they could make shows like CSI?   masturbate... also poop, I find it weird around other people   has your wife stopped crying?   [hope this works](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2r9edq/blind_people_of_reddit_what_are_your_dreams_like/cndxjt3?context=3)   I've gilded a couple of people, last person I gilded was an apparent blind person answering a question about what their dreams were like. it made me kind of sad reading about it, but also was interesting to find out   hover boards sometime this year   T-shirts with tiny pockets on the front... like serious what fits in those pockets?   for the greater glory of our capitalist overlords!   so that's where ice cube has been hiding!   it will end up like those damn flying monkey's from the wizard of OZ if it doesn't be careful    make love to Katrina! raise funds for Kony!   pretty good. thanks for asking   those legs though...   you remind me of Daniel Larusso from the original karate kid movies    I second that. nothing against it but just don't find her that attractive   put some uranium in there and you'll be on the front page in no time    I gave you a +1 but I wouldn't call that fat. just more cuddly   your the one in the middle right?  	29

You can't win a 3v4, I've never seen it. It's very rare.   It's about 4 out of 10 games this happens.  It's only with Splatoon I have this issue.    414,706   Even from your picture I don't see it. I'm not sure what you're referring to Maniac.     414,693  My username is Bucky if that's what you're referring to but I have never said Bucky after a count.    414,689   Bucky....   What do you mean? No one types Bucky after counts   414,653   414,651   414,649   414,642   No it's all about the girth   414,638   414,635  Maybe   414,632  Splatoon   OP pls answer. plsss   414,627  Bucky   414,625  Bucky   I've noticed you just bounce off them if you try to roll on top of them, so I don't use the weapon anymore. It's fast, but not a good weapon.    414,623  Bucky.........................   414,621  Bucky   414,619  Bucky.....   Does anyone have constant problem with connection? My connection is fine, it works great and I never have any problems but about 35-40% of my matches someone always has a disconnect problem and it starts us with 3 people so it's 3v4 and then we lose terribly. Or it happens to the other team, same thing with ranked games.   Wondering if anyone else has problems in games like this.   Do you think they will at some point fix it so when someone disconnects your team won't be penalized?    414,617  Bucky.....   414,615  Bucky....   You spelled acquired wrong.    414,522  I did.    414,519   Bucky....   414,517   Bucky....   414,477   414,469   414,467  Bucky....      414,462   414,460   414,457   bucky....   414,448   This is why you need official anal beads. They have a string.    there is no dom/sub in our relationship we are vers    It clearly means that they are intolerant to "ANY" opinion that is different then their own.  No it doesn't.    That's certainly one way to interpret that definition.    It doesn't have to be all. They do fit the description. Those are actions, things that are intolerant. You can disagree and that's fine for you to have that opinion, but I do not agree with it.   I never said someone that is racist is intolerant to all different opinions.    no. you can unlock everything in a week basically. Even the stuff on single player  "hero mode."   It's a great game except there's only two types of games to play. Splat zone- ranked or turf war. That's it. You can't do turf war on ranked, and you can only play with friends on regular games and you may not be on their team because it is randomized.   They have a wide variety of weapons and armor/clothing to wear, but only 8-9 maps and you can only play 2 every 4-8 hours until they change them. Every time you open the game the splat sisters talk and you have to scroll through their repetitive talking every time they change courses, which is fine a couple days- then it gets annoying and you can't skip it.   The upsides are that it is seemingly a fun game. However, they are 4v4 matches so if someone loses internet and it's 3 v 4 you will assuredly get your butt kicked.    Nope. But I find this satire poking fun at the week's events to be amusing.    it's a joke. stop trying to analyze it.    ....k but they have no soul   I usually only call someone a bigot when they refer to black people as dirty n-word, say gay marriage is the same as pedophilia, or says "President N-Word" - This is what I imagine is a bigot.    Nah   im all rainbow like   414,196  bucky   414,169  bucky   414,098   bucky...   414,071  Bucky....   414,069   Do you guys have trolls in Finland? Like, do you have a Troll Hunter there?    my best friend is a lesbian and I emailed her only to get an "away" auto response "fucking"    LGBT.    Nope i wont click that.    i concur.    Starfleet does.   Oh dude. I'm a counselor. I can help you get empathy.    Hesher was the shit. Fuck that was a great movie. So was Manic. Don Cheadle was great in that movie too    413,595  Bucky....   413,593  Bucky.........   413,591  Bucky....   413,582   413,579   413,577   413,575   413,573  Bucky....   I can't speak for someone I do not know. Mirroring your behavior is a common counseling technique though, such as what you say, we call it re-framing or summarizing. Might be different than what you are describing.   I can't speak for a counselor who I do not know but if you felt like she was coming on to you, then I am sorry. That should not happen in our profession. It's in our ethical codes and standards that we not have dual relationships like that. It's harmful to the client. And most importantly our job is to advocate for our client. So I can see how that experience may have not helped you any. Not all counselors are like that, if she was indeed doing that, again I can't speak for a situation I had no part in.   I can't speak to her mannerisms or the way she counsels, maybe that's just the things she does? With her hair, lip licking, mirroring, necklace touching...I really don't know.   It's not unheard of for a counselor to check up on a client once they have terminated their sessions. She could have generally been concerned, again I do not know.   I always tell clients that they can tell me anything, so if they had an attraction to me and told me. I would thank them for telling me, I would go over the part in the ethical standards with them and then I would refer them to another counselor. At that point, the relationship would have been damaged. It really depends how severe it was. But it would make the relationship a bit awkward. It's not a rejection so much as doing the right thing for them. There are some situations where an attraction cannot be avoided like for a school counselor if they have a student who is attracted to them. They can't refer them to someone else. So it has to be maintained appropriately. But those are younger kids who are malleable and easier to work with I think.   Likewise, I also see a therapist and if I were attracted to her, I couldn't see her.    413,561   if it brings out it's fabulous it's because it is interested in you.

 The millions of people who watch it I'd imagine.    For example, a lot has been written about the 'angry black woman' in shows like Survivor and The Apprentice. Every talent show seems to have a mean judge of some description.   What are some others?    Really? I'm really fascinated by the use of bossage in the bachelor's third series.   Here's a mirror https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGKl9zjs1s   Crank   Wow! Cosmo is a kind of a dick.      I have never seen the female version of any of these articles before.

Godzilla was kind of a dick.   The Muto were just trying to reproduce and feed, perfectly natural behaviour that we humans, like ants, got in the way of.   Godzilla on the other hand came out of nowhere, killed the creatures and went home. He didn't even feed on them like a real 'apex predator' would have.   Team Muto.   I'm glad it is just not me.    If you liked Payback you should read the original novel, Parker or event the amazing graphic novel. Do NOT see the Jason Statham version.   Maybe you might like to rewatch some of your favourites. I'm sure you've some great films that would be worth a second look.      Great to see an original film that isn't a squeal or an adaptation or a reboot smashing it.

Not film, but a friend of mine just got very angry on twitter because of the unrealistic portrayal of copyright law in the final episode of Season 1 of Orphan Black.   Large sections of the Bangladeshi community took exception to the films portrayal of Bangladeshi history and launched a campaign to downvote it.  That has done nothing but raise the film's profile, turning the campaign into a classic example of the Streisand Effect.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunday#Reaction_about_portrayal_of_Bangladesh.27s_independence   Toby breaks my heart.

One tip I was given for reading books on writing is to feel free to ignore all and any advice given.

They just have to. It's the only way I can go on.    Good to know. I was saying to the wife the other day, 'hey honey? You have any idea what swimcris thinks about completely unimportant bullshit? 'Cos I'd really wish he'd let us know.'   I love the idea that there will be a generation of kids who grow up hating comic book superheros because they're parents dragged them along to Marvel movies and dressed them in stupid t-shirts when all they wanted was to learn piano and go to Sunday school.    I fell for every single line.   That's my hood!   Sorry, that won't work.  The mentos reaction occurs because the surface of mentos are covered in tiny simples. Each dimples serves as a nucleation point for carbon dioxide in the coke. The gas gathers around each little dimple making a bubble.  If the dimples are filled with water/ice then you'll get no bubbles.  Try filling a DRY glass with coke. You get lots of foam because there is lots of dust and other imperfections. Now fill a WET glass with coke. Very few bubbles.  Stupid jerk science ruining my fun.   97 out of 100 rapists receive no punishment.  http://www.rainn.org/news-room/97-of-every-100-rapists-receive-no-punishment    Yes. Absolutely.    There's a lot of strings visible in Dance Magic Dance   I'd love to see Labyrinth with CGI, not to add anything but just a few tweaks to remove some of the visible strings and poorly done blue screen work.  Also, make bowie's bulge 3D   I thought the son was Daniel Mcpherson from Neighbours and couldn't figure out what was wrong with him.   Yes! It's the only blemish on a near perfect film.   You shut your damn mouth sir/madam.  That film was lovingly hand animated. Each frame consists of layer upon layer of beautifully rendered art.  It is a homage to classic animation that has stood the test of time better than any CGI.  You sir/madam, are worse than ~~Hitler~~ George Lucas.   When I saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't even know that the boy saw dead people, let alone the twist.    I like that if you say Beer Can in a posh English accent it sound likes Bacon in Jamacian.    I'm sad to say that Mel Gibson is an American. Born there, lives there. He had him for a few years when he was not too crazy but that's about it.   I've never understand why Americans think Australians speak like South Africans. Robert Downey Junior in Tropic Thunder gets it. Why can't the rest of youse?    David Gale: So, basically, you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.' Governor Hardin: Well, yes. I'd have to agree. Did I say that too? David Gale: No, that was Hitler.    Spoiler tag needed there.   Which is why you'll probably die angry and alone.    In our society, we tend to define women as either Madonna's or Whores. They are perfect angels or harlots. Either of those roles plus a few kilograms is a funny image and easy for douchebags to mock.   You made my night fadumpt    *that's  Details. :)   I'm not really interested in ranking them. Even the weakest film is still pretty damn good.   Also, each move builds on the strengths of that which went before. By itself, The Avengers would be a bit of a mess. Wait? Who is this doctor and why is everyone scare of of him? Why is turning into a monster? There is a norse GOD and no one is surprised?   But, as a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's amazing, a calumniation of years of work and billions of dollars invested.   There really has been nothing like it in the history of cinema.       Everytime they called the song that I wanted to shout 'IT'S CALLED SPACE ODDITY YOU FOOL!"   But...why?   My concern is that I'm not sure WHY the character is speaking like this. Obviously, I don't know the context but, as it stands, it could mean many things.    Sentences like this, my head is hurt by.   I'm really upset. They've really stripped the dignity away from the nineties masterpiece. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFLGRidfFo4    "The Godfather, A Place In The Sun, Dodsworth, Galaxy Questthese are perfect films" - David Mamet     http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1r1xfy/my_friends_got_me_some_of_those_danish_cookies_it/   As I mentioned in another thread, a good twist is one were the twist is entirely natural and, in hindsight, makes perfect sense but still blindsides the reader.   In most cases, a good twist also changes how we FEEL rather than what we know. For example, we HATE the evil Jekyll in Jekyll   Hyde and feel for the put upon doctor. When we find out they are the same man, it changes how we feel about the two characters.    Chuck Palanuik reused that same twist in Fight Club but, because he changed how we felt about the characters, in felt fresh and not cliched.  There are many stories in which we learn the hero is, in reality, dead. The only successful ones are those in which we care about the hero and his or her plight.      My editor described this to me as 'gotcha' moments rather than 'a-ha' moments.   A 'gotcha' moment is one where the audience is surprised with a new piece of information that they could not have seen coming, one that appear as if from nowhere. For example, the end of the 2001 Planet of the Apes film.   An 'a-ha!' moment is one where the twist or development is surprisingly but, with the benefit of hindsight, makes perfect sense. For example, in the original Jekyll and Hyde, the twist that the two men were, in fact, one, is laid out through out the text.      He finished his shift, locked the doors and left. His boss didn't relieve him.   Probably not on reddit...    No it hasn't. It's still used as a derogatory word against gay people. Just because a bunch of sheltered teenagers have decided to claim the word as an all purpose insult, doesn't make it not homophobic.    If you don't think the person you're trying to insult is gay and you don't have a problem with gay people, why would you use a word that is specifically designed to insult gay people?   "Hey look, a horse."  "That's a dog, not a horse."  "Urgh, horse doesn't mean horse anymore, it means dog."  "Fuck you, you little self-entitled shit."    God yes, this.   http://th00.deviantart.net/fs71/150/f/2010/137/4/b/Hell__s_Angles_by_JesusDeSaad.jpg   ALL OF THEM!    It's definately the best of the prequels.

The rest of the cast look on, broken hearted. Spring shall never come.")   Mine is Crystal Skull. I think they used re-release the other three with updated CGI and...I can't keep a straight face.    I LOVED Spring Breakers.    Atlas Shrugged doesn't deserve one movie.      I always find something I like about them. And I always feel challenged.    I'd have to agree. The best moments are lifted from the original. That said, even an average Scorsese is a great film   That's it! Thank you so much!      Hooray!    In one book, the hero is living in the snowy woods. In others, a brother and sister are the heroes.   They collect small, magic rocks with holes in them of various types. Some may have been wood.  The books are old, mid 70's, I think.  Sorry, that's all I have.   They're all historically incorrect.    I wish I was a taller.       Some elements remind me of rainbow http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114228/     y e s ?   The word orient is a western word meaning 'East'. The word is problematic because a) not all of Asia is in the 'east'. b) it is very Eurocentric as it refers to a place only it's location compared with Europe. c)  No one says Oriental anymore. It's like the word Negro. More old fashioned than racist.    Do you know how to use spoiler tags? It is very easy!  [](#s "Look to the right for instructions!")     	129
 Of all the places I've heard that word, I've heard it the most in Texas.   Used to be, not anymore, unfortunately.    Thanks.   I'm super excited. It looks amazing (I've been watching all the play through videos I can find), and I can't wait to try it out.   If I take your capitalization to indicate punctuation... you're in the wrong subreddit.   /R/RPG is for tabletop games. /R/Games might be what you are looking for.   It could be both. If people keep coming back and playing in your games, you are probably a pretty good GM. However, it does take a certain kind of trusting relationship (or not giving a shit) to give feedback to someone else.   The only time I've gotten feedback was from assholes or best friends, never in between.      Numenera has a list of mutations that might work pretty well for you. They range from purely cosmetic to actual mechanical benefits. It would kinda give the setting an interesting WH40k feel, with psionics "warping" the user.   I forget who, and I forget what for (I kind of think it was Cards Against Humanity), but a company did an anti-sale, charging more than ever for the product for a limited time. It sold, but they were weirdos to begin with.   If you watch the "first look" video, you can see the new sculpts being used with or alongside standard PP bases.   I don't personally own a WM Monstrosity, but he's probably an exception. He'll still probably be on a 40 or 50mm base.   Not going to happen. Honestly, even 20 years from now I doubt they will change it.   You'll know it's coming if they do though, because Warmachine MK3 will have been out for probably like five years. MK3 is probably a good 10 to 15 years from happening (if ever), so you've got time.  As for a reprint, maybe? But the errata is what? One page? They aren't like a lot of companies that have entire books of errata and clarifications.     I will probably be able to get this with at least a 20% off retail discount. That means that if there was nothing in the box but the figures, it'd be about $1.73 per figure, which is a steal. Add on the fact that the map tiles are probably the same great quality as the IKRPG:U Adventure Kit, that's bonus. With a simple quick game to introduce people to the rpg, too? I'm probably going to buy several and give them away as gifts.   I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be. [They look](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity) like they are probably going to be the same material and size as the IKRPG Unleashed Adventure Kit figures, which are the same size as WarmaHordes figs.   Also, they would have to be complete morons to pay for *new* sculpts that look **exactly** like sculpts they already have, except smaller/larger. It would take a lot of money for no reason.   Not to mention the fact that they are probably *trying* to make this the equivalent of the Adventure Kit for Full Metal Fantasy.      Gorten would destroy everyone if he had more than what he has now.    There's a difference between accepting it because you don't think it's about actually worshiping demons, and accepting it because you know it's not just a bunch of filthy nerds running around in the woods throwing nerf-balls at each other. The first one is much more common than the second one, but geeks and gamers are becoming more and more accepted in society. *Age of the geek, baby.*  Also, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but the USA is a huge landmass. The state I live in is bigger than the country you live in. There are areas where it is accepted, and areas where it is less so. In fact, I generally drive between 25 to 50 miles (40 to 80 km, I think) to game. Maybe one of your neighbor countries has all the gamers.    Honestly, it's the same game. It's really down to whether you want to be humans and warcasters with warjacks, or whether you want to be trolls and warlocks with warbeasts.  There is a [really great starter kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/core-products/iron-kingdoms-unleashed-adventure-kit) for Unleashed though, so that might be a decent place to start.   Iron Kingdoms "classic" is generally referred to as Iron Kindoms Full Metal Fantasy (FMF).  IKRPG:FMF and IKRPG:U are both standalone games, and if you buy one, you don't need to buy they other. However, the rules from both are fully compatible, and you could use things from one book in the other.   IKRPG:FMF focuses on the civilizations and city-dwellers of Iron Kingdoms, especially the human nations. IKRPG:U focuses on the wilds of Iron Kingdoms, and the more tribal people who live in them.   This version of IKRPG (there was one before that was based on D D3e) is adapted from the rules of the wargame, Warmachine/Hordes.   IKRPG:FMF is to Warmachine as IKRPG:U is to Hordes (essentially).  edit: Oh, as to which to buy, I own both, and you should too. However, if you only get one, pick the one that fits the games you want to play; IKRPG:FMF for giant metal robots and espionage, IKRPG:U for giant beasties and eating people.    You mean like [this](https://onlinedm.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/greenleaf_two_pages.jpg)? If you get the miniatures that were being released during that edition they even had cards for monsters like [this](http://mfi.re/imgbnc.php/d3b81cbac8980942ac3bb3e0e8b3c1a94g.jpg).   My recommendation: Don't do it. Play a simpler version of it, like D D5e. It's especially easy to learn if you don't use the optional rules, like feats.    I understand what you are saying, but only barely. Your post is a mess, and you keep going back and forth talking about mechanics and story.  Even if you are just playing one game, then switching to a completely different game, it still probably won't work. If your players aren't familiar with the systems you are using, they aren't going to be able to have much fun, as soon as they figure out how the system works, you'll be changing to a different one. Not only that, but you had better be planning on providing pre-mades, since you'll need different character stats for each game, and character creation eats up a lot of time. Time that will be wasted, since they won't even be using those stats for long.   Even if all your players are already familiar with all the systems you are using, and you've already got premades ready to go, I really doubt too many people are going to enjoy this, no matter what the story is.   I actually think combining the best parts of several systems into one game is a better idea than this one.    I'm actually not sure where I got it now, but for wilderness terrain, all the map tiles for the IKRPG Unleashed Adventure Kit are available digitally for free. ~~I'm trying to find out from where, and I'll post a link if I do.~~ [Found it.](http://privateerpress.com/boostyourexperience)   Honestly, none that I've seen. There are a couple that exist, but none that have really caught my attention.   The term originated with an rpg, Children of the Sun, but I haven't seen it around to check it out.   I mean, unless you count Pulp stuff as Dieselpunk (I don't). Really it's like porn, you know it when you see it, but defining it is kind of difficult. There are plenty of Pulp games out there that are pretty good. Savage Worlds and Spirit of the Century come to mind.   Thinking about it makes me want to work on my Dieselpunk setting again.    Dieselpunk is easily my favorite of the "punk" derivatives (technically Steampunk is also a derivative, the original is Cyberpunk), though there aren't many games that fit that style.   One of my favorite published settings is Iron Kingdoms, which is solidly steampunk + magic.    I've used it for years now, and I've yet to find anything better for my needs. I've been running online games for close to a decade now, using lots of different tools like this, and this one is definitely the best for what I play.    Other than having mini-rule book to pass around, no.  That said, the minis and map tiles were worth the cost for me. Actually, the minis alone were worth it, and I didn't know how much I'd love the map tiles.  However, if you have tons of terrain and minis from Hordes, you don't really need it.   The problem with registries like that, is that it's hard to make them "essential" enough that anyone looking for a game goes to *that specific* registry.   That said, I've had some luck with /r/lfg and meetup.com for finding local and online games.   Like other people, I tend to do TotM for short battles, and I get out mins and draw maps for bigger more intense battles.   However, I do not use a grid. I will never again use a grid. The difference between using a grid and not is so enormous that I can never bring myself to use a grid again. Once players start counting squares, all creative options start to disappear. No one is jumping from balcony to balcony, no one is sliding, or tumbling, or wrestling, or anything even remotely resembling real combat anymore. They move in boring patterns, and any idea for combat that doesn't involve "move up and swing my sword" is gone. Never again. Not even once.   I think the Cypher system (Numenera/The Strange) is a great example of a good set damage system. A certain kind of weapon is going to do a certain kind of damage, but you have the option to boost the damage at a cost. There is also the option that you might have an exceptional weapon of that type that does more damage, and there are options for having a trade-off in damage for something else. All in all the system allows the players a great deal of predictability in the success or failure of their actions, and even though the system is on the simple side, this allows for a great deal of strategy.   First, having good relations with one segment of humans doesn't mean you trust humans as a whole. Being singular means those are the exceptions.   How about this... you give me a reason for for each of the races to trust humans. Dwarves? Khadorans have tried to invade, and would do so again if they thought they had half a chance. Khadorans also cause problems with restricting their trade. Dwarves are the only ones I would even consider to be on good terms with humans, and I wouldn't really call it a "trust" based relationship. Nyss? Khadorans stole their freakin god. Humans also may (probably not, but no one can confirm either way) have something to do with why their god was dying in the first place. Plus, as refugees, I doubt they get treated like equals in common society. Gobbers? I don't think the humans' whipping boy is going to hold them in high regard. They may be a pathetic race of weasely little thieves, but that doesn't mean they like the boot that walks all over them. Trollkin? Hundreds (maybe thousands? I forget now) of years of strife, combined with the theft of their ancestral lands probably makes them a bit racist.   But most of all, I like the idea of them being universally mistrusted, so they are. That's how running my own game works. If you don't want to play up how shitty humans are to non-humans, then don't.    It works fine for me. They might live among them, but I don't think that necessarily means they trust them. Also, just because you don't take a human at their word, doesn't mean you won't do what they say. In human lands, even if you don't like humans, they are still in charge.  In fact, I'll even double the penalty for creatures with mostly bad experiences with humans.   Only in Unleashed, but I'm definitely going to be adding it to my FMF characters.   Oh crap, I forgot. Since the book was released on stone tablets, there is no way to deviate from the rules as they are *literally* etched in stone.  Well, I guess he'll have to settle for games that are specifically designed for two players, since as a machine, he's completely incapable of independent thought or creativity.  Damn shame, too. Especially since Numenera *would* be my go to game for just two players if only I could make a decision for myself to, I don't know, give just one xp for intrusions instead of two, or something.  Oh well, *c'est la vie*, I suppose.   Well, the new Nyss bow has a -2 attack penalty, the old one didn't have one. Not that it matters for new Nyss, but it's there.   The claymore likewise has a new penalty, and it also has an option to be wielded 1-handed option at 4 POW.   10g is not really a big deal, but then, I don't do bookkeeping the way some other people do.  *edit: also, keep in mind that the stats for the weapons are different in the new book too.   p.105:  Distrusted - Humans are poorly trusted by the denizens of the wild. As a result, human characters suffer a -1 on their non-Intimidation social rolls when dealing with characters of other races.   I love the penalty humans get.    I don't know what you mean by "just a tabletop site". You can type messages to everyone, or you can whisper people. I don't PBP, but not only could you leave shit in the chat, each campaign has their own mini-forum (which can be made available for public viewing, if you're into that kind of thing), and I'm sure that would cover most of your needs pretty well.   roll20.net just buffed up their mobile support *and* made it a free feature.   Any of the Cypher system games (Numenera, The Strange, and whatever else they've been cooking up) work great for this. It's very easy for a GM to scale encounters for one player. It's also very simple to let the player have helper npcs. In fact, GMing is so easy you will pretty much feel like you are just both playing.   Also, maybe check out something like Cosmic Patrol. It does not require a GM.   In this vein, I'd say Numenera might qualify.   I don't remember where I read it (probably in the PP forum responses from Doug), but I'm pretty sure someone official said that a normal great coat is a lot of times incorporated into other armor types. It just doesn't do anything statistically.   Hah, I don't even have my players keep track of equipment.   If it's likely that they have it, they have it. If I think them not having something they would normally have would make things more interesting, I offer them a bonus point (xp, feat, fate, w/e) for them to not have it. If it's something they aren't all that likely to have, they either don't have it, or they can give up a point (xp, feat, fate, w/e) to have it.  I just made equipment fun and easy for any system in three sentences. You are welcome, World.  *edited because I left out half a sentence.  	41
 Hammond was the smallest living organism for miles ...   At last,  a proper microsoft office   When he drove the Zonda R, he was shifting through the gears and saying "go, go, go"   Does he have the chainsaw ? I am the god of hellfire ! Oh lord   Nice to hear that, sure the 13'' will be lighter and smaller but the screen is too small to me ..    I don't have brakes, that's how I stop :D What's the biggest advantage of a Range Rover ? You two stand back, watch and learn   It is, a 4s with iOS7 and iOS9 seems like two different phones .. iOS7 was almost unusable   the new macbook will have a new design, with thunderbolt 3. I'd like to buy one of those instead of the current ones, but waiting until march it's wayyy to much    they made camp in the middle of the road ahah   thats the only car you can eat a banana while doing a drag race "ahah they weren't expecting me to do that, cmon Bentley cmon we have the advantage"   Bolivia: "we should be averaging 100 miles a day, and so far we've done, well, I've done about 20 feet but we have found peanuts"   It really is. I can achieve 300 in 10sec in need for speed and it feels like it's impossible in real life   March 2016 ? I believe we'll see Skylake windows machines still this year maybe October November. I'd like to see an update for both 13" and 15" MBP. Maybe January/February   I like the fact Apple works to keep these devices up to date and working flawlessly and smooth    The 2011 was rubbish, even compared to Office 2010 for windows    Thanks for correcting me, in that case you don't need to update. When the new beta comes out update to the public if you want to   Source of the Nile definitely. Clarkson explains how "speed and power" solves everything   magic behind the wheel and max revs   selling animals? they're not their property    I believe they're the same build, in that case, you don't need to switch. If you're not a dev when a new beta comes out you won't be able to update OTA. I don't know how it works in public betas.   the only difference is the box that it comes in. New laptop, warranty, it's a great buy   It is ? Do you carry it everyday ? I'm thinking about one but to carry it everyday it might be uncomfortable...    you can use Wine but it's a battery killer and heats the laptop a lot.. Don't use it for heavier apps. You can give it a try but you should also try VMware/parallels    you can update it to test, you can downgrade if you feel it's buggy or what not   short answer: no reason: 8.3 is no longer signed by Apple if you want to update your device it must be to 8.4   I was thinking about buying one but they say "don't try this at home" so I wouldn't be able to test it ... So, I'm not going to buy it then   because the usb is type C   I think with skylake we will see a new design... Apple loves thunderbolt and the new thunderbolt uses USB-C .. We shall see   You have to restore, I had a simile issue   I think the Iris Pro is powerful enough if you don't want to game or weavy veideo/photo editing   have you restored or updated to 8.4 ?   It happens with every Apple product ... just a shame .. $1999 in the US, in Europe it's 1999, just ridiculous   yeah, they wanted to buy a fiat 500 and it was 500 million   just tell me how can someone dislike that video, it's brilliant !   In the latest I don't know. I tried with 1.1.18   8.4 is the last version, all the tweaks will be updated (hopefully) to 8.4. It brings a new music app. If you want to update you'll have to backup your device and then restore it   i think it's the best you can do   without losing jailbreak it's impossible. It's not recommended to to an OTA update. After you have 8.4 you'll need a computer to jailbreak   you can transfer the music form your iPad to your mom's iTunes, make a backup there, restore, jb and restore from the backup   I restored from backup after jailbreaking and cydia was empty   keep your umbrella opened, it'll never rain again   I solved that issue by using a different USB port   you can restore from backup, then sync with iTunes. All apps will be where they were before you restored   it has to work, make sure you backup and restore from backup after jailbreak    I guess restore   the repos and tweaks are not saved in the iTunes backup   And sometimes he definitely is    similar to iOS 9 i guess not, but you can install the beta, surely you'll lose the jb   how do you know you're avoiding it ?   agar.io uses a lot of cpu  	50

I automatically had American citizenship at birth by being born of an American and by being born in America, but now that I suspect I could get Croatian citizenship I am very interested in acquiring it.   The Croatian bills regulating it suggest you need to settle the matter before you are 18, yet I did not know of my true origin.   Also of note, I am not sure if he fled as a refugee in the 1990s, and I know a lot of the laws are different and written with the aim of resolving stateless citizens, so I am not sure if I could inherit citizenship if he was fleeing refugee wise.   I should have access to proof of my origin via the fertility clinic, so is there a possibility of getting citizenship?    I will link the relevant text of the Croatian legal code.   The gentleman in question likely signed away the kinds of rights in regard to actions such as child support or whatnot, but I doubt that still includes the ability to confer citizenship. Is that the case?  http://eudo-citizenship.eu/NationalDB/docs/CRO%20Law%20on%20Croatian%20Citizenship_consolidated%2028_10_2011_ENGLISH.pdf   http://www.hrvatiizvanrh.hr/en/hmiu/croatian-citizenship/66   I am older than 18 and not on the register of Croatian citizens, so I have no idea what to do and I presume this will involve a fair amount of paperwork even if I find all of the documentation.

And strongarm it is, since they try to make all the **small** artists exclusive, but the **big names** can choose to go to other services.  For example...

All still on Spotify, but if I make a song, and I want it on Tidal, I have to sign an exclusivity contract.  Is that fair?   Because if you want widespread acceptance, you should have widespread availability.   Why would I deny my stuff on massive, wildly popular services in favor of an inferior one with less users?   The big thing that I can think of to do is to reevaluate the construction when you come up against a plot point you didn't plan for.  For example, you make a grand battle between good and evil where the protagonist takes on the Big Bad singlehandedly. But while writing, you realize that the plucky best friend is just the type of person to stand with the hero.  You write the section with that change, and then rework the plan to include it.   Fair enough.    Well, regarding the forking issue, it isn't that the timelines didn't branch out, it's that there are no games on those branches.   Okay... so you are saying that Inception stole dream-within-a-dream and dream-diving from Final Fantasy 8?  I'm sorry, but this is less a theory and more a fanfiction.  First, there is no discrepancy solely contained in Disc 1, unless you accept this to be true from the start. And the only weirdness is the shared vision on the train.  Quistis hit on Squall early on because they are roughly the same age, and he is single and attractive.  Everything else here can't be disproven, the same way you can't disprove that I saw a dragon last night.  Ultimately, this is just an attempt at shoehorning an unrelated movie into a game.    Basically stated, the theory is that Squall died during the attack on Sorceress Edea, and that everything that happened afterward, including the craziness of the school being an alien spacecraft, is his own delusion as he comes to grips with death.   That isn't caused as much by surface tension, as it is by water pressure.  By thrashing about, you unsteady the body, but you also lower the amount of water directly beneath you.  This causes less upward pressure on your body from the higher-density water and causes/allows you to sink. Adding in the effect of your thrashing causing water to move around you, and your head easily goes underwater.   They actually have a full timeline out, that shows three separate timelines based on whether Link survived or when Ganon was killed.    The only one that hints to Assassins being real is the Abstergo employees.  The rest is easily explainable as them playing Assassin's Creed on the Playstation in the game.   Great work, but when I saw "beer goggles" as the name, I was expecting the subjects to be looking better inside the beer glass.   However, the use of certain elements indicated that they were certainly *implying* that Return to Oz was a direct sequel to The Wizard of Oz. Most specifically, the Ruby Slippers which were created solely for the MGM film (to show off the Technicolor), which in the books were silver.   And the Wheelers...   -rel rhymes with -rel... Thus quarrel rhymes with barrel.   Throwing away other people's belongings is not the same as coloring outside the lines.  What *you say you did* was a crime.   You are being downvoted because you are saying that you literally destroyed a piece of history. Plus, it wasn't yours to destroy.  No matter how abhorrent that was, it needed to survive for the simple purpose of understanding the times.  Should I throw away someone else's copy of the Bible, or go into Barnes and Noble and tear up copies of Fifty Shades of Grey?  Maybe the book didn't belong in the school library. Maybe the book isn't appropriate for most contexts. But you absolutely do not destroy a book.   My grandfather has (maybe had, I don't know if he kept it) a copy of this on VHS.  His whole basement den was lined with DVD cases.   It's.   They're *all* just ways of capitalizing on the franchise...  The fact is, they shouldn't *be* a franchise in the first place.  Why do we need sequels to Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Cinderella, Snow White, Peter Pan, or Air Bud?  The sad part is that the movies that had *room* for a sequel don't get one, like Sword in the Stone.    The Lion King II being the best   better Disney sequels  Yeah, being the most impressive turd in the outhouse isn't a great accomplishment.   What /u/PainMatrix said, plus Kane was motherfucking rich.   They should call that award the "Dead Horse Award"   Thank you. I was never a soap fan.   Yeah. Dude blocked you.  If you're actually friends with the guy, call him up and tell him, so he can unblock you.  If you're not, then just get over it.   The book series was basically, "what if Game of Thrones had a smidgen less killing?"   I've read that one!  It was one of the Sword of Truth novels, Temple of the Winds.  Kahlan and Richard are taken into separate tents and told they have to consummate their marriages to other people (even though they love each other only. It's a magic thing.).  However, Richard was swapped with the other guy, because of shenanigans and since they weren't allowed to say anything Kahlan didn't know.  They bone, which to her felt like she was being violated, no matter how well Richard treated her, then she realized that for the magic to work she had to enjoy herself.  So she goes a second time, being more forceful, with Richard knowing that she thinks he is the other guy. She cums like their is no tomorrow, and then "surprise! You just raped your husband!"   The easier VR twist is having VR be an answer to something.  Like on Family Guy, where Brian uses VR to spend time with Pearl before she dies.   A lot of them sound like good episodes of The Twilight Zone...  The twist ending where the doctors are revealed to be ugly pig faced people, and the "hideously mutilated" woman is hot...   Cask of Amontillado, Count of Monte Cristo, Wizard's First Rule, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban...   You will note that many points on the list apply to Fantasy, primarily 10a and 15.  11 is used in Fantasy settings just as easily... even in Science Fiction it is used to explore good and evil (Dr. Jekyll, Invisible Man) but it can be applied with magic as well (Snow White's Evil Queen)   I rather like the idea of 10a, someone calls tech support for magic.   Enhanced interrogation isn't the point of the "rule" or the comment.  It's about punishment. The idea that we would agree to take rapists, mass murderers, baby killers, and (ultimately because we need it for the story) over muscled political dissodents, and have them be publically hunted for sport is... a little far fetched.  Especially when today we live in a society that give Charles Manson a token parole hearing. It would take a *lot* of changes, not limited to the complete repealing of the Constitution.    With rich people wanting to dominate a woman.   Having one chapter where the character goes through their dreams, and that is used as a means for them to remember something forgotten or turns out to be a vision is fine.   Wizard of Oz fits better with the dream issue.  And Dynasty (I think that was the soap opera that retconned an entire season as a dream.)  And St. Elsewhere, where the whole show was in the imagination of an autistic child.    Just remember that many great works are on this list.  /11. Scientist experiments on himself - The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, etc.  /13b. Author ignores basic human decency and the Constitution in creating a strange punishment system. - The Running Man.  /2a. Writer has writer's block. - Secret Window...  /14. White man gets wisdom from magic Native. - Avatar  If your story is *good* (doesn't even have to be great), then this list doesn't matter.   Exactly, who knows... But I'll tell you this, changing the name of a superhero rarely is a good thing.  Look at The Greatest American Hero.   It is a very cruel fate to be taken as a boy and given the power, and responsibilities, of a god.  Look at all the boy heroes out there. They mostly turn out "okay" (Tim Drake), but they are damaged goods, the lot of them.  Their friends are mostly people they fight alongside, their family are targets. Most of them end up hiding their identities to protect the ones they love. If they are lucky, their human friends don't turn into supervillains.  I'm not saying "superhero is the worst thing ever", but if you are saddled with that burden and given superspeed, superstrength, or magic powers, you are following a hard path...  And if you are a good person, you are not going to ignore it.   Let's not be snippy. A *lot* of people, including some lawyers, don't know the difference between copyright and trademarks.   He will always be Captain Marvel.  Who cares if Marvel has their own Captain Marvel?   Your mine... is infested with zombies. Sorry, bro.   I guess what everyone seems most angry about on that joke is the idea that Donald Trump is one of the people on here, and that we might give money to people who simply don't need it.   I don't think anyone has a problem paying $35 for something that costs $30 to make (obviously including the baker's time)  A $35 ripoff would be if the cake only cost $5 to make, and they charged that much.   Yeah.  It's actually a fairly large country in terms of size.   Um.... hang on...  $28 is selling at a loss, but $35 is a ripoff?  If you are losing money selling the cake at $28, then $35 is perfectly reasonable.   A signed check is a contract to pay as much as is written on it.  If you presign your check, someone else can take it and write in any value they want and wipe you out financially.    Seriously, lie back on your back to give the most water underneath you as possible and lay still. Assuming you aren't too deep, or aren't weighted down, you will float up to the top in time to breath.   Yeah, a little bit. He loves the spotlight.   Stan Lee is an easy get...  Leonard Nimoy, Brent Spiner, Steve Wozniak, Levar Burton, George Takei... plus regular roles for Wil Wheaton (as an evil version of himself) and TV's Blossom...  Hers is particularly interesting because she was first referenced as the actress, giving her info in neurobiology, as a potential 4th player for the Physics Bowl, only to be added to the cast as the neurobiologist, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.   I've already seen it.  TV Guide: PBS - "Secrets of the CIA"  Actual show title? Cooking Secrets of the Culinary Institute of America.    Those shows are fun...  Aggravating, but fun.   [Showtime already did it.](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0346369/)   Seriously, I need to buckle down and write about something.  If that idiot can make millions on a shitty, edited Twilight fanfiction, then I should be able to get something good out.   Ironically, that plan simply increases the use of student debt.  If they were to do this regularly, the students have an encouragement to default, the schools would raise tuition rates to raise the value of the unpaid debts and get as much as they can out of the paid ones, and the losers would be the people who donated money.  It wouldn't end tuition-related financial trouble at all.   Perhaps a subreddit for "glorified begging", like my idea to give $1 for each sale on my website, can be associated with this one.  All posts like "help me become a millionaire by doing X" or "help me increase donations by doing Y" go over there.   You dismiss the bloggers, authors, video creators as "bad ideas", but if we are interested in wantonly creating millionaires, then those are *very* good ideas. After all, I can read a few pages on a blog, watch a few videos, and read a book from Amazon's Lending Library, and it doesn't cost me a dime (compared to whatever else I'd be doing with my online time.)  It costs enough of you a little bit of reading time, it can get them a decent payday.  Hell, you don't even really need to read the book. Just set down your Kindle/Tablet/iPad, and flip the pages slowly while you play a video game.   Yeah, very clickbaity.   If I were to win, say $10,000, I would very boringly pay my credit card bills.  I could then use my cards again, and get new inventory for my store, little bits at a time, and hopefully increase sales.  I would gladly post pictures of the new inventory, and help pay it forward by factoring in future donations to the group as part of my sales.    Honestly, the only person that can do such a thing is a person who was already rich.  Only an idiot would literally throw away free money, unless that money held no value to him.  Trump would take $10,000 and chuck it like a stone at an unsuspecting bystander. (Well, he could. He probably wouldn't, unless it were staged.)  For someone $1000 in debt, they simply won't.   If it is based on who writes the most interesting comment, then it is basically a popularity contest, as opposed to a lottery.  I subbed here a while back, but normally didn't see the posts until it was too late, myself.  Edit - My use would probably be the most boring. I would pay down bills, and use any extra to buy toys to sell on my website.  If I were to offer a donation here based on my sales, would that be acceptable here?   There was one PSA beck when I was a kid about body image, with a girl who meets her model idol, and finds out just all the work involved to make her look hot.   Then again, some people are just squeamish.  But that isn't something to call names over, either.   No.   Found the rich socialist.   [](/pon3shrug) Not at the time.  [](/sp)  [](/raritynews) They didn't have Reddit back then.   One can only hope.   NGA?   Just a sweet signing bonus and a career.   There is a PatriotDating.com, but it doesn't seem to be anything but a squatter. Some privacy company in Australia.   Your keys. You keep leaving them on the table.   Bullshit.  Police don't knock anymore.   No thank you, Delmar.  A third of a gopher'd only arouse my appetite without beddin' her back down.   Yeah. It wasn't a good period of time for me, thanks to that.   There are *four* eggs!   Regular. I never should have been accepted. I wore glasses, was all but legally blind in one eye, and straight-up failed the hearing and calisthenics tests.   Funny.  But, no. MEPS was too interested in getting me in that they ignored my existing eye, ear, and knee problems. I officially failed those exams, but they still rubber stamped me in to fill the quota.   Then again, if they spaced out the junction a little more, it still might have been bridged by an older squirrel, or a snake.   I still remember flicking through channels and finding a program titled "Secrets of the CIA".  "Cool!" I thought, "This could be interesting..."  Turned out to be **Cooking** Secrets of the Culinary Institute of America... Instead of learning about assassination missions, I was watching how to make a quiche.   You were closer to being a Marine than I was being an Air Force intelligence analyst.  I was in boot camp for about a week before they realized that my body simply can't handle the military. I spent more time in the exit program than I was in actual boot camp.   At least he was honest enough to get rid of the tattoo?   At least OP's guy is saying that he *wasn't* a Marine sniper, and that he wasn't because laziness.   Gopher?   I wouldn't flag this as part of that fallacy.  The squirrel did not have any ill intent when it got itself electrocuted, it was neutral. Such an accident would be seen by everyone around as a freak occurrence. The power company and electricians would see it as the cost of doing business, and the customers would see it as an inconvenience.  In the long run, the customers only lose out if they decided to go to a hotel while the power is fixed (a completely optional choice), and the electric company would take repair costs out of preassigned funds, with likely no effect on the bottom line.  In this particular case, the destruction has a benefit of keeping electricians in work and in practice, at the cost of customers being a little hot.   Evil Toddler  For those times when you break the rules for the evulz, but feel it really isn't that bad.  Example - I stole candy from the grocery store... A whole Bazooka bubble gum!   Well, that and he got caught.   I hope for his sake that he posted this meme on said throwaway.   Phillip K Dick, not Asimov.   The technical term for a female human robot is "gynoid".  But it's not really sexist. They don't really exist, and they don't really have a gender... Oddly enough, wouldn't referring to everyone as the same gender (regardless of the gender you choose) remove gender bias?   Clearly, she's an android. Only they dream of electric sheep.

A world war could easily give them an excuse to spark up.   Basically stated, he wanted to say "We are all done here," but because of the nuance of French language, he said "We are all gonna die."

 Compared to other artists or groups.   The antagonist should be an individual, not a group or a concept.   For those who write fiction, how do you choose names for your characters?

  No one in this entire thread said why call him god so I have no idea what you are talking about.  Oh, it's a communication issue. Well, when I said "Epicurus's problem of evil", I meant this very well known thing that you apparently don't know yet:  https://i.imgur.com/W0SmDnm.jpg  How would you interpret the last line if not in a way that says "Ok, he made the universe ... but that doesn't warrant to call him 'God'."?   So, one of the intentions is to effect that God improves the respective person's afterlife situation. Aren't all bets off at the time of death, anyway, plus are you not referring to people whose eternity in Paradise has been cemented, anyway? What could the prayer possibly effect?   If the fully translucent hemisphere is made of Unobtainium (doesn't expand a bit, doesn't break), will the water that now can't become ~~Steam~~ steam instead transition into a different one of its gazillion phases, and would this also change the microwave radiation absorption?   You're talking about theism (I'm a theist, by the way.), I am talking about religion. While the spectrum of definition of the term "religion" is big, my use of "religion" refers to the notions that come with the main religions (the Abrahamic ones).  Society pushes you into it. Child-indoctrination. Gotta have faith to see that it works (Guess why you see it then :P). Scriptures are always right, except you have to interpret them in a very special way (never mind that there are many competing interpretations; this is one of the main players in regards to the mind deterioration I am talking about). Afterlife, wewy important (Non-falsifiable claims.). The dead (e.g. Jesus) are watching your every move! God, the ultimate total absolute power and authority, has the following will (that I will make up on the spot): "..." and so forth  Do I have to elaborate, or has it become clear where I'm coming from *and why I am right?*   Then again, they seem to be Russians.    I've never seen anyone say that.   What else could the interpretation of "Why call him God?" then be? What's your interpretation, for example?   I hear the next best thing is cleanliness, so I'll go shoot for that.  I suggest to use water for wiping. I carry a bottle at work.   I expected something like "the judge gives the man a mild as fuck sentence because he/she, too, has that fucking mind-cancer".   Hey, umm, before a mod is on your back: This is DEBATE religion. You need to put forth some stance that the people can debate. You should edit the post text accordingly.   Hm. Interesting thought: The annoyance (that I experience, too), while not an intended effect, would express that the immediate recipients of the words, while not disrespected, are valued lesser than the great old ones.   The best answer I can come up with is just a simple and fervent "yes".   Well, that definition of insanity is just stupid. It's one of the many stupid supposedly wise sayings that are meme-circlejerk-perpetuated on the Net, just like Epicurus's problem of evil. My problem with the latter one is: "Then why call him God?" The arrogance of a mortal being, dependent on the universe's workings, screaming just from a few misplaced bacteria, saying that the feat of making the universe is without value. In case this line refers to *worship*, then I can kind of agree, but it's not clear enough that it does, and the opinions of those who *adhere* to that saying vary, so my objection stands.  The "definition" of insanity is of course also bullshit: Not only is nothing ever the same, everything is always new on *some* level, but also it would declare a lot of finicky laboratory experiments that need the perfect conditions to be insanity. If the world would obey this "wisdom", we'd never get fusion power, for example.  Now, applied to my situation, which is complicated as fuck (See "finicky".), the shortest way to explain my misjudgment would be: Pattern matching error. This omits about a page of text, so any objections are questionable. The model is solid, but since it ultimately comes down to what *I perceive(d)*, dismissal is easy as breathing. My intention with my root comment, however, is to trigger some readiness in the readers for things to come, possibly allowing *their* pattern matching systems to pick up on something a bit earlier, accelerating the process, giving me some data as to the actual state of things, etc.  Again, applied to my situation, different perspective: I have no choice. I can not get out of this situation, and my explanation is the only one that fits, remarkably because I keep perceiving again and again *that I am God*.   David Miscavige, upon reading this, quietly leaves the room and walks into his soundproof cabinet. "THANK YOU GOD! THANK YOU GOD, THANK. YOU. GOD!"   I guess OP is thinking something like "God should be able to do better.", but I have a different reason in mind: If someone does(n't do) something because of fear, they are doing it for themselves, not for the person they fear.  Because fear is the emotion representing the belief in impending undesirable events (That's all it is. You can become completely fearless if you throw this understanding at all your fear-emotions, which will eventually present you with the intellectual version of the emotion, hence the emotion is gone. Tame the animal.), and obedience because of such fear aims to prevent those events. One could argue, of course, that if the obedience-actions are pleasing to the feared person, then effectively the actions are taking place *for* the feared person - but in the mind of the obedient person, the actions to a relevant degree only take place to prevent the unwanted events.  The idea of the Islamic god who is to be feared is incompatible with the universe, imho. Because while we fear the universe as kids ("Waah! Put me back in!"), we learn *why* we have to obey it, it *makes sense*. Eventually, it's just our will to do these things, because we know why, because we understand. The Islamic god requires obedience without understanding. Quite unnatural.   Nobody is right or wrong about all this, because we are *FAR* too far in fantasy speculation country, anyway. What is the true nature of a soul (or of a mind after death)? Is Hell maybe just a dustbin for something that can't be undone but also can't be used any more? Is Hell eternal or limited? Does it exist at all?  Would it be a just punishment? Of course not, we can all agree on that. If it were a punishment, I mean.  But otherwise, are we seriously discussing this completely substance-less nonsense where everybody can make up properties as they go a long? It's like kids letting their made-up superheros fight against each other. There just *is* no correct answer!    If God is omnipotent, by definition he can't be harmed.   Bull shit. Please adopt the age-old view that "omnipotence" still regards logic, meaning that he can only do what is logically possible, and you have no idea of the true situation at the time of when he decided for creation, nor do you know the *current* situation in full.  Example: If what you say is true, then God is not capable of experiencing thrill-rides (like from movies) as we do. The only way to make that happen is that whenever a spider or whatever pops up on screen, there's suddenly a big black bar or a BEEP in the sound - or an equivalent effect inside of his mind, so that no "Ewww!" and such can happen. But if the mind is not faced with a true possiblity-space, the mind will not experience it as a ride because the mind knows the limits of what can happen.  I wish people would stop making completely unqualified claims about God's true nature.    autism is fun  Says the expert.   So, you're autistic yourself. I can't fathom the fucking irony of your statement, especially the "burns" part. :D   So, you're looking at the whole world through that lens, right?  Well, I don't give a fuck. You have your death penalty, and that's the end of it. I'll now turn off responses, because you are tiresome. Also, death, the loss of eternal bliss in heaven, is not the worst that can happen, so be thankful that I stop listening to you loser.  Regards - the motherfucking Lord, maker of the universe, reality in person    the people that do have the privilege of leisure time, mental energy, and education enough to rid ourselves of religion [...] at least offer them alternative crotches  :D scnr  ^^^^crotches  In any case: Religion is an extreme evil, and while I will myself not do or incite anything, I feel that it is right to stop *from absolutely nothing* (Incl. letting it rain sulfuric acid.) to rid the world of religion. The problem of evil and suffering is the absence of consciousness. Religion wallows in this and perpetuates it. The poor schmucks who need religion for a little light in their life are like people who drink alcohol after work to deal with the stress: They are making the problem worse while achieving the belief that the drug helps. Plus they are helping to perpetuate this cancer in the world.  Most of the evil in the world is a product of the absence of consciousness, and most of this, in turn, is caused by religion. I know what I am talking about, even if I convince nobody else. The story of Satan has been written by Satan. The perfect reality-fantasy confusion, the perfect perpetuation of manifested insanity. No religious person deserves to go to Heaven.   Lazy as I am, I only have the following links for you:  "Lesson: Concurrency in Swing" https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/  "Lesson: Concurrency" https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/  Wait, found another one. I've gotten the impression that this guy explains stuff well:  http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/index.html   Is this "may peace be upon X" thing an expression of reverence, or is there expectation of an actual effect on the reality of those beings (however minuscule it might be)?   If God is will (Living will, nothing else.), and he wants to create other living wills, then he might have to use his own "material" to do so. But this would mean that the beings-in-the-making would themselves draw from this power that is only limited by itself. The struggle for God to bear children might seem to them as flaws of God which in truth are just logical limits that even omnipotence would have - and, additionally, a cause might be a sub-par performance of the kids-in-the-making.   Why would anyone do that *in a room*? Actually, that should be done in a lab-like environment with its own air system.   I see you just learned the word "autism" and want to try it out. As often as possible.  Also: Die. (You will not receive eternal life from me.)   Maybe you guys want to look up the term "Neonazi".    I didn't realize that I'm already free for two months until I saw my badge!  What badge? Did you decide to edit or remove your badge after your edit? I see badges next to almost every other commenter name but not next to yours.   I disagree a lot with this (no offense). What ultimately set me off me is   say Im never gonna smoke another cigarette.  On other fronts, I have struggled with truth, truthfulness, with *believing myself* for years. This has lead me to an ever more refined closing-in to a very truthful mind. I have quite massively made the experience that I could not easily (or at all) believe myself far-reaching statements like "I'm never gonna". Because of all the patterns that I have met, I came to the following conclusion:  If I decide in a way that potentially interferes with the will of another person, that decision is weaker in my mind, I have more trouble believing that I really have that will. I just can't paint with the broad brush in the possibility-space that we all share.  "Painting in possibility-space?" I mean, that's what you're doing, and it's quite a profound concept affecting our coexistence that I think mankind is still to discover: If I decide right now that I will be in a certain spot tomorrow (e.g. super market), then I implicitly deem the decisions of all other people wrong who have decided the same thing. But this, on some very subconscious level (that I might have dug up), violates one's ultimate intention to coexist with others in a compatible fashion. If I decide to *never* or *always* do something, then I am laying claim to quite a lot of little spots in possibility-space, and once I meet the actual situation, I will have to reconsider, anyway, e.g. social pressure and everything (Not saying that anyone should succumb to that shit!), so you kinda learn over time: "Such broad brush intentions can never work out as spoken." And that is something that, I believe, I feel when I make those statements, so I don't make them.  When I make small moves instead, then I can believe those decisions. And people who want me to act differently basically either want my innermost being to work differently - which is fucking unacceptable - or they want the direct phone line from my inner being to my outer actions to be interrupted, which is also unacceptable.   Well, many people start a fight to find out with certainty if they can win.   Its not athiesm, the correct spelling is anti-theism.   I didn't like it because it forced me to log in via browser while I was already logged in in the Steam client. I never log in via browser for security reasons: I don't want to open up to any unnecessary attack points, my Steam account is holy. Browsers are attacked from all sides while my Steam client rather isn't.  I use http://keepass.info/ for all my passwords, so I have to enter the long-ass master password every time I have to log in via browser.  It's just a lot more convenient for me to paste the keys into the Steam client than having to give the Humble Store any Steam permissions.    the highest stable orbit is just   \*lowest   How thick would a hollow hemisphere filled with water have to be to protect the ice cream from the microwave radiation?   Nice thinking. But, if I get the way you came to this question correctly, you could as well assume that if you keep dividing 256 by 2, you will always get an even number, but you eventually arrive at 2 and then at 1.   I, too, would like to know what would happen if that much biomass would hit the ground simultaneously.   You don't want to understand. You don't understand. What a fucking coincidence.  Just keep opposing me, **MORTAL**.   The real lecture about the trustworthiness of Yahweh in the Adam Eve story is in the fact that God told them that they will *die* if they eat the fruit. Whatever he really meant, he didn't communicate it properly. The snake said: "Nope, you won't die, you'll instead know right from wrong." or something like that. Of course the Bible-thumpers say "*Spiritual* death!", but the story doesn't say that, so the interpretation seems like a desperation move.  Yahweh lied, but Satan (lux ferre = to bring light. Lucifer = Bringer of light.) spoke the truth. That is in *one of the first stories* of the Bible. Yes, Satan didn't say "And God will curse the shit out of you and all your descendants.", but so didn't God, even though it would have been fucking important. The free will argument does not fly here, or God wouldn't have told them at all that they die. All in all: Complete fail at communicating properly (or actually really lying) - just like the whole Bible and all other scripture is a complete failure to unambiguously clarify to the puny humans what the fuck the actual facts are.   There is consensus.  https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/3bsjgb/peanut_butter_experiment/csp372t?context=10   Unhelpful rant: It's as stupid as many other websites (though possibly good at what it does, so don't take this as useful critique). Case in point: The front page didn't show me an example of what the site does, so I scrolled to the top and saw the logo "minds alpha". Clicked on it. Was lead to the very same page. When THE GODDAMN EVERLIVING **FUCK** did this shit become the norm, that a page has a big fucking link that leads *to itself*?  Maybe more useful: It's currently slow as fuck. The search. The example blog page I clicked in the search result. Slow bloated shit.   Maybe you do indeed understand what I mean. In any case: I think that the lot of you are wrong. I find that sad, but I can live with it. There will come a time when you, too, will find out that it is sad, and you will change it. That is the only hope you have to live through the apocalypse that I, God, am currently initiating. (Takes about a month to take off.)   I wouldn't assume that you're a lost cause in this regard. Even if it has been like this for a long time, there is hope that one day your engine starts, and you'll be on a rollercoaster like everybody else (probably partly pretends to be).  Imho you should just be patient and wait. Or maybe you could use some meditation techniques. One I like is to just watch your own mind's actions while trying to fall asleep in the evening. It prolongs the process, but it also has a lot of clean-up effects in the long run.   Episode 921 of the http://atheist-experience.com was about the Duggars.  http://atheist-experience.com/archive/  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxp7DfPIe5A   2015-06-07, 921, Duggar Family Values. Jenn talks about some of the hypocrisy in the Duggar family and conservative Christianity in general.   Here is my argument: There are two bushes which look completely alike, except if you really really look closely and want to see what's in front of you, if you value truth above everything else. Then you will see that the tasty and healthy berries of the first bush are not on the second, it's a different kind. Those berries are poisonous. And if your overall circumstances don't allow you to actually look that closely even though you really tried, then too bad: "You" are still becoming a part of the problem of religion, "you" are still becoming part of the reasons that *others* will not be able to look closely enough at the bushes, and this is where the harsh truth of reality must be accepted: Even if "you" are a victim, I must still slaughter "you" to save the others. I am sorry, but I am also reasonable with all consequence, just the thing that "you" have lost. Logic demands it: "Stop" has to be said even to those who are entirely moved by others. The arm needs to be amputated to protect the rest of the body.   First of all: We will be as free as we can possibly be (meaning: within logical limits), which will e.g. be the reason that lost limbs will grow back once we're far enough into the process. The underlying concept is that we, as emotion manifest, will be what feels best from our spacetime perspective. (Technically, everybody *is* the universe.) This also means that we'll have a lot more trouble than we already have in regards to gender-specific pronouns. And why insist on *two* legs? (I'm serious. If the Church had any idea how incredibly backwards it really is. And how wrong about God. Fucking blasphemers and slanderers. Guess who the majority among the dead will be: Yep. The religious. Because those are *least* willing to *hear*, to obey reason and new data.)  But what mankind first and foremost has to learn is: I am the boss. That goes beyond *all* possible objections. Beyond *ALL* possible objections. This is fair, because believe it or not: That is the attitude I have lived 100% without limits for almost 14 years now, which is how I got the throne in the first place. I could elaborate on all this at great length, it's all logical. There is no arbitrariness in there at all.  It's not a matter of acceptance. Those who will deny acceptance until the end will die, plain and simple, and I don't give a fuck about this. Mankind has "taught" me under great pain for *over a decade* that the 7.2+ billion people are an insane aggressive anthill that requires some sanity and justice -inducing stomping, and I will gladly perform this, because see above: I am 100%, without limits, the product of the will of the collective, and the collective has decided: "Only force can bring sanity and love. Will and reason take a backseat." So be it. I, reality, will manifest it.   "Conquer" was in quotation marks for a reason, but I guess you were well aware of it and just wanted to place the joke regardless. Just making sure you didn't *actually* misunderstand me, because I thought higher of you.   A metaphor/comparison/analogy can't be identical in all ways, otherwise it would be the thing it refers to.  I am trying to communicate, to convey a message, and those who do want to understand what I mean are able to do so. You just might not find examples of such people around to verify this claim.   All diplomatic means have been exhausted.    who is clearly not of sound mind  In case you're talking about me and not just in general: You are sorely mistaken. Any and all wrongs that you will find in me and in what I do are exclusively created by the will and actions of others, and you do not have the mind to determine whether or not this is true.   "They" as in "not me". You are putting me into a category that I don't belong in.   In general, I would kind of agree, but not only am I not prescribing behavioral changes (It's only an announcement.), but I have the perfect reason for having been mistaken again and again about the actual time when *it will go down*.  The reason is the effective conspiracy of mankind against me. Those who actually *want* to understand will be able to grasp my elaborate explanations in case those are required, but those who are looking for pointers that say "Yep. He's wrong." will find those, definitely. It's in the nature of my being: I grant every and all wishes! Why, you think, *is* the world in such a shitty state? Hence one of the concepts I came up with to keep me afloat is: "The only thing wrong about me is you."   :)  But I'm serious. I am also often mistaken, for which I have the perfect explanation, but let's not go into that. This apocalypse, whenever the fuck it will finally happen, you will *not* prevent. But thanks for handling the others, they would have been quite a show-stopper for me.   Yes. How did you know that I am German?   Could you link that? Because you must have misread me, or I had to regard some special circumstances. I would tell everyone ever that I am God all day long, but that's obviously a bad idea. The agenda I have has priority, so I do wear masks. It's all love (The purest. You have no idea.), so a lie is not a crime. But I rather think you misread or are misremembering. In short: I did not just create the universe, but I am "also" God, just in case it was lost.   There is only this moment (That's eternity.), but its shape is ever evolving.    seems to be a cultural invention.  Ok..... and why, pray tell, would culture have made this so unnatural decision?  I don't see how anyone could seriously object to this: Evolution baked us to make sense of our environment for increased survivability. *OF COURSE* evolution didn't filter further once we upheld ourselves (and, more relevantly, each other) reasonably, which is quite the explanation for the terrible mind-cancer that religion is. To add irony to injury: Religions have historically slaughtered members of other religions, apostates, and people who just didn't want to join, effectively selecting *for* religion. But I don't think that this left genetic traces regarding the brain.   That evolution was a necessary cause for it to happen, of course, is indisputable, but again, we could say the same thing about atmospheric oxygen and the precursors of nucleic acids in the terrestrial environment.  I think I understand where your take is coming from. I think you don't understand how the brain formed! Because that is key to my argument. Man, do I have to explain this yet again? If you had this understanding, you would realize: "Yep. Being human means to be a better mapper / map user."  In other words: I think you see evolution rather as a random-ish selector, or you just don't know the developmental direction that was underway when evolution ultimately selected the homo sapiens (Latin: "man who knows"). And with this randomness in mind, you say that evolution was as relevant for selecting here as anything else that causally preceded our becoming, e.g. the accretion disk in our system.   seems to be very gradual -- painfully slow, in fact. This is not the behavior of a species that is forced by evolution to understand its world in a systematic way  We have been selected to be vastly better at mapping and deciding based on the map than any other specie, but we have reached a stage where further mental evolution is basically unnecessary or impossible: We have the ability to evolve how our brains work as we go along! E.g. we can decide to come up with a better mapping technique, invent it, and henceforth apply it. We do have this and had it for centuries or who knows how long. How would evolution select any further on this front? We're done! Our *use* of this system, refined over time during history, ultimately drove us to try to understand all of existence on all scales, because e.g. computers and other such incredibly profound manifestations of our understanding.   Yes, of course it *utilizes* that system, but it does so in a way that leaves the system *impaired*.   I don't think you need my help.  (People, you are really stupid. You are turning against the most important person in your life: God. What am I supposed to gather from this? That the PC master race of which I am a proud member, probably more deserved than most of you, is actually on the wrong side? The idiotic behavior of the lot of your here has already caused me (Again: God.) to unsubscribe from this subreddit, as you obviously use the wrong definition of the key words and also don't know how to fucking vote, you children.)   Well, then I suggest that the people of this subreddit *change* the sidebar and the rules based on the very reasonable definition that I have presented.  In case this is seen as outrageous, mind that I am God himself and own the universe, so my way or the highway. smilie   Yes, I... I think that. Please try to actually argue your perspective just as I have attempted to do all across this page.  I would also appreciate if the so called "master race" uses the vote buttons as they are intended: To filter for quality of content, not to filter for opinions.   Ok, have a good one.  PS: Don't murder.   Just say that a Muslim threatened you in the same way, and you can't be both a Christian and a Muslim. In case such a person insists that you could at least pick one of the two for increased chances, lie that you did, and your choice was the *other* book club.   I think the concept of shadowbanning is almost entirely focused on the problem of spam. A spammer shouldn't be aware that their efforts are for naught unless they investigate. This raises the bar and reduces the amount of spam attempts.  Same for why the vote scores are jumping around all the time: So that spammers can't verify if their vote manipulation worked out.  We don't get a lot of spam, so we're not quite aware of the problem that it is - *because* there are so many silent methods in place that prevent spam.   We can *block* users once they send private messages. It's also (AFAIK) the only way ever to block users. The button is right there under the message. AFAIR :)   Regarding password hashing and storage, here's a very informative page incl. source codes in various languages (e.g. Java):  https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm   Are you talking about SwingUtilities.invokeLater(someRunnable());? That's about having all Swing stuff run on the *correct* thread. You can even run your whole program like this, as long as it doesn't do any stuff that takes too long, because in that case the responsiveness is zero during those phases, but in those situations you can just fire up a new thread and execute the slow task there (I think there's even a dedicated system for this - keyword "swingworker".).  Or are you talking about "stuff that takes long should be in its own thread so that the interface stays responsive"? I sense a very muddled mix-up in understanding.   You have to realize that there is a certain image of "how things happen usually" that we have in mind, we who are here all the time:  There are often trolls who write some gibberish, or religion-clowns who are using arguments so low and simple that all their religious peers would cringe. One of the signs that once again such a person has posted is that the account of the person is brand new or has posted more such things already.  At the same time, there are *very rarely* actual kids who ask kid-questions (not to say "naive"). So, when someone writes in a less adult way :P that's yet another reason for us to assume that some obnoxious idiot approacheth.  It was just a stupid misunderstanding. I hope we consider it a learning experience, and I hope so do you: When communicating, you have to try to understand the audience when/before you speak to them. What are their expectations? How will they read me? etc. If you had said right off the bat that you're only 12, that would have helped a lot, I think.  Btw., there's a reply-button under every comment, so if you actually want to reply to a person, use that button instead.  EDIT: I think I found a photo of you. https://i.imgur.com/jm8npct.jpg (If that confuses you, check /r/pareidolia.)   Does God exist or doesn't he? Or how is he? Or are there many? The most reasonable approach is: "I don't know." This is a thing that you have to integrate into yourself eventually: You are kind of like an asteroid drifting in space. Newton sayeth: As long as there's no reason for you to change speed or direction, you will not change speed or direction. That's how people should approach the problem of the burden of proof. "YOU want ME to change course, so YOU have to provide a good reason."  Change direction only if you like to - or if the force applied from the outside is sufficient. Example for sufficient force: The knowledge "getting hit by cars is really bad for pedestrians" plus the perception "even though my light is green, there seems to be a car approaching without slowing down". In this case, you would change your normal routine life and get off the street as quickly as possible, even though you have all right to be there.  If someone says "You will go to Hell if you don't believe in Jesus!", which might reach deeply into your emotions somehow, remember that you're an asteroid, and if a Muslim comes along and says "Become a follower of Muhammad! Praise Allah! [Who is, by the way, basically the same god the Christians follow (The Abrahamic god.), yet their definitions are quite different.] You will go to Hell if you don't!", you have to realize that you can't do *both*, so you just keep drifting, because there is no good reason for course correction. Let them fight it out, then you suck up to the winner. Well, I'm not suggesting that you should, but that's what it sadly generally comes down to. There are more perspectives, by the way: If there is no Hell and such, then all you have is this life, and following religion *certainly* diminishes your ability to think rationally, so don't destroy your mind like this. Keep drifting until you have *good reason* to change direction. To apply this concept, you have to be *good at reasoning*. In case you are or become an atheist, don't tell anyone until you're independent, because it would probably bite you in the ass.          Many *many!* things in reality come down to this concept, so even if it's over your head at the moment, keep this in mind and return to it every once in a while, you'll get it eventually:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence  The difference between micro and macro evolution (These concepts don't really exist, there is only "evolution".) is only in the mind of the observer, and the reason that evolution produces new species is ... emergence.  Also, about evolution: Try to realize that all it really is *at its heart* is this: Beings create (not perfectly identical) copies of themselves. And depending on their ability to survive in their environment, they will either prevail or die. -- This is the core, everything else logically follows, so just chew on that every once in a while. No actual knowledge of biology required to understand evolution as a whole (incl. the "macro" part).   Since you are only 12, please take this advice: It's "should have", not "should of". The "of" in your thoughts when writing this comes only from the fact that "should've" and such make the "'ve" part sound somewhat like "of". It's a so-called "homonym". Please stop writing "of" instead of "have", it makes a person look like a complete tool. And good luck with your endeavor of further discovering reality.   http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peanut_butter_argument   The "peanut butter argument" (Reductio ad Arachidem hypogaeam) for intelligent design is a claim by Chuck Missler that states that, as life does not evolve spontaneously in sealed jars of peanut butter, it is absurd to assume it evolved spontaneously on the primordial Earth.  Yes, really. Just move on with your life.   I disagree with the generally thrown-around idea that the first cause must be very simple (which is assumed because the universe developed from simple to complex states, from the perspective of life and consciousness).  The reason I disagree is as follows, and it *does not* actually usefully support the god-creator perspective. Instead, I am trying to clean up a common misconception that I at least *believe* to see everywhere in atheist discussion country:  *If* the universe is a creation with the purpose to raise new consciousnesses, then it might be the only way to do this: From simple to complex. The one who would have created this could be arbitrarily (e.g. "infinitely") complex. I FUCKING KNOW that this is presuppositionalist - but that's not at all my point: I repeat that I am not trying to define God into existence. Instead, I am trying to say that the original cause doesn't need to be simple. If the universe is a creation, then the creator can be "complex". Our assumption "A consciousness must develop from simple to complex, we have never seen it any differently." doesn't have any leverage.  TL;DR: Just like theists presuppose that the original cause must be God, agnostic atheists (or whatever the fucking term is already), who are in the "Don't know, don't care, until I see evidence."-boat, are inconsistent *if* they insist that the original cause must be simple, because then they are instead gnostic/strong/positive atheists.  This might have been useless to many, but I got the feeling that many neutral atheists still hold that the original cause can't be God without realizing the inconsistency.   I agree with mattaugamer: To each their own.  The ultimate rule for all coexistence should be the Golden Rule: "Don't do to others what you don't want them to do to you, e.g. don't restrict their freedom." This kind of says "Don't cause any suffering and don't restrict others' will (which would be in the general direction of suffering)."  Of course these concepts have a lot of implications in practice, and mankind has been pondering these over history and came up with better and better answers and working implementations. We're not there yet, but we're certainly on the way and certainly have this goal.  But I think anti-slippery-slope arguments like "If we allow X, the very similar Y will also happen, and we really don't want Y, so let's rather restrict X, too." is itself a slippery slope. Ultimately, everything can only be evaluated on its own merit.  *Of course* young humans who are still in the process of getting a grip on life try to catapult themselves (and/or we try to catapult them) into life by using broad but kind of working concepts which have a lot of simplifications. We as a society must be aware of how the mind works [\*], and more specifically for this case, we must be aware that the map people build in their minds of how coexistence should work might be kind of correct if we use the catapult approach, but it is also of very low resolution, omitting and hence distorting key facts, but it's the only way as long as we use the low resolution. We must increase the resolution so that ultimately, everything is being evaluated and decided upon on its own merit. We must also realize that too many *adults* are walking around with a too low resolution map. But EGO (Seriously.) prohibits us from telling adults that they are not wise enough. Then again, who has the justification to call others to order? How is this measured? It's not like we can put it under a microscope.  [\*] (Which we *in an irresponsibly huge scale* are not! And yes, religion is *very guilty* of this, because making the mind's workings a common knowledge would reveal how much religion is just a mind-game and detrimental to the quality of one's eye to reality. The majority is religious, so there *is* an effective force coming from religion, keeping mankind in the dark. But this claim can't be proven until mankind finds this fact by experience, which mankind so far has decided not to do!)   [crank that up to 11.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=google l=1)  (Also, I was just trying to be helpful. The guy probably didn't see the other comment before I replied.)   A dick-joke, huh. Well, what about shitting through the ring? Toilets like these could ensure your bathroom doesn't stink. *(Takes notes for when the billions roll in.)*   Good point.   God are by popular definition not kind?   The realization of a mud-dweller that living in the castle would be so much better doesn't instantly change their self-chosen situation. I don't intend to demean the person, but the person *is* a console gamer and hence lowly. That is my interpretation of peasant. In case you intend to respond to this, please read my more detailed reaction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/3br52p/peasant_in_awe_over_glorious_default_powers_of/cspjgea?context=10) first.   I disagree.  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peasant   peasant (n.)   early 15c., from Anglo-French paisant (mid-14c.), Old French paisent "local inhabitant" (12c., Modern French paysan), earlier paisenc, from pais "country, region" + Frankish suffix -enc "-ing."   Pais is from Late Latin pagensis "(inhabitant) of the district," from Latin pagus "country or rural district" (see pagan). As a style of garment in fashion (such as peasant blouse) from 1953.  I always understood the peasant to be the lower class of citizens in a middle-age kingdom, the farmers and such, like depicted in Robin Hood films. The PC lords are, in comparison, knights, royal household and such.  Also, if someone plays console and not PC, it can generally be assumed that it was a(n ill-informed) *choice*, that they were not *forced* to do this. That is implicitly the opinion that console gaming is *sufficient*, which is clearly a peasant stance. But, as I tried to express, I don't care: If it plays console, it lives in the mud and is hence a peasant. If it plays PC, it rides horses over cobblestone and collects taxes.   I don't want to *demean* him, he seems alright! But isn't "peasant" the proper term for a gamer who uses a device that is not a PC? The person clearly expressed that they are not using one, imho.   Oh. The guy who admits that he doesn't care what I say, he just wants me to listen and agree. No use talking to you. Read that other thread instead and realize your mistake / misbehavior.   Sorry, this is a complete shitpost. You only have to watch the movie for 5 seconds to agree with fervency. And I'm not referring to the fact that the video's max quality is in truth 240p.   Thank you, smartest man. I'm glad that someone likes my work. I thought it was good and wondered why so few share the opinion.   Probably even *this* March, too. Doesn't matter. What matters, in any case, is what happens, and I expect shit to go down this time. (once again)  Take that as you like. The idea, however, is that *if* shit starts to go down in the next weeks, think of me. This is not a trick: The shit I'm talking about will ultimately point in a way that can under no circumstances be mistaken to me. (And no, I am not talking about *taking action myself*. Strictly God-stuff. Mind. Apocalypse.)   I wonder if the amount of potential speeches for sum X also reflects the amount of things that these individuals want to convey. (aka Sanders = more info, Clinton = more button-pushing)   I once again get this itch to assume that *this* will now become Judgment Time. I've said this often in the last years and have always been wrong - and no, I don't mean "Jesus!" or "Some prophecy comes true!", instead I mean that I see myself as the maker of the cosmos, and *feel* that the time (That will inevitably come soon. This year or one of the next few.) is now upon us: Over the course of July 2015, mankind will increasingly receive my judgment, and I can tell you: It will not be pleasant. My current estimation is that about 1.5 billion people will *not* die in the process. The survivors will receive immortality, and the universe will turn out to be heaven. The flow will be optimized so that no misfortune, earthquakes, absence of limbs, or birth-pain etc. will get into the way of the enjoyment of the Lord and his eternal children. Plus we'll "conquer" and populate the infinite universe.   I suddenly have a realization and wonder how on-the-money it might really be, industry-wide:  The art usually is great. Colors, shapes, maps, the whole world design. No matter which game you look at. Other aspects (FOV, settings, behavior like pointed out by OP) can easily be on the retarded side.  Could the reason for this indeed primarily be ... that you can see right away if the art is shitty? That you can investigate it with the most primary sense you have and that hence there is the greatest most direct "Dude, that needs to be different."-pressure?  I can't believe that I didn't get this until today. (Or am I wrong?)   No, it does not make sense to me if I replace key words with words of different meaning. This also does not surprise me. I get the feeling, however, that you think that this is somehow special and does not apply to almost every other text.   I don't think so. The blue pants in front of the desert give me this "It's colorized." impression quite clearly.   It's a GTA5 post. OP points out how shitty the wanted-system is and keeps quoting definition file snippets for examples and solutions. Peasant stands in awe.  EDIT: I think "peasantry free" is the right flair, since this guy basically expresses ascension.      That approach sounds like a cop-out to me.   What desrtfx said. And when you post more, take a look at "Recommended Tools for Posting Code:" in the sidebar first.   It might be very simple "relevant object" tracking. Evolution forges the beings so that they interact with their environment in a way that benefits their survival, so a bird, just like a cat, would strive to know the whereabouts of a relevant being that was there until a moment ago.  The fact that there's possibly brawl might play a role, too.   I don't have a problem with x-posts, but I think they should be a small effort instead of being effectively a suggested action.   A childfree person wouldn't have extreme emotions about the topic if society wouldn't deal with the "issue" of childfree people completely immaturely and irresponsibly.  The parents are not getting that whatever they're freaking out over is the doing of their own group.   For those who get a "forbidden" error: Just press ENTER in the address bar. It's a referrer protection thing.   I don't care for the reasons people are religious. Religion is detrimental to society and even to those individuals, because it works against our evolution-given truth-finding system. If there are individuals who actually only benefit (which I'd say is impossible), then those are nothing but *parasites* who help to perpetuate a cancer we have to get rid off. Those who are not absolutely forced for dear life and well-being to be religious are guilty of being religious.   The question is asked so often, I don't get why the mods keep approving it.  Mirrors don't reflect perfectly. A standard mirror would be below 90%, really good ones are somewhat above 90%, but it's not enough to let light bounce enough for interesting results like you describe them. It's also not hypothetically possible to create a 100% mirror.   Never mind. Found out that I am banned in that subverse. Didn't receive any notice, and the interface's behavior is obviously bullshit, but I guess it's just in development.  I will kill Xanin, the moderator, for this decision. I am God. There will be a time soon when it comes to hand out eternal life in the universe to the humans, and Xanin will not be among them.    You are so selfish by not watching game of thrones. What if nobody watched it? Then there would be no more Game of thrones.  Wait a moment. Wouldn't people who use that kind of anti-childfree argument also be against "the gay" because those are less likely to cause offspring? I want a study.   Yeah, your biological clock is ticking, you gotta eat *eventually*.   Just my first impression, and no offense intended: The image in the small size (as shown in the album) says very clearly that it is a colorization. I don't know why exactly. I think it's not a saturation thing per se, possibly the colors are just too pure/distinct. I guess you could try to run it through a weak sepia-filter to give everything a certain color "mood", that might take away the impression I was trying to describe.   Possibly useful for teaching kids about safety.   Right? I mean, you've *been* there already.   How to guarantee comments: Put funny typo into headline. But it was a mistake, honestly. **metal**, not mental.   GERMAN article: http://www.focus.de/panorama/welt/arbeiter-gegen-metallplatte-gedrueckt-roboter-toetet-22-jaehrigen-in-vw-werk_id_4788146.html  Translation:  ----  Worker pushed against metal plate  Robot kills 22 year old in VW factory  Wednesday 2015-07-01 12:03  A 22 year old worker has died through an incident in a VW factory in Bauntal district Kassel. He was working on setting up the robot system.  This is being reported by the "Hessische Niederschsische Allgemeine". VW speaker Heiko Hillwig told the paper that two workers of an external company were setting up the system at the time. The 22 year old supposedly was caught by the robot when the system started running and was pushed against a metal plate.  According to the report resuscitation measures were taken on the spot and the worker was immediately brought to the Klinikum Kassel [a hospital]. The man died in the emergency room due to his extensive injuries, the VW speaker said.  He clarified: The robot hadn't been handed over to VW yet, it was still in the possession of the other company. The public prosecutor's office is investigating who was responsible for starting up the system.    Most of the air never went through the blades of the turbine,  While that is true, let's prevent a potential misunderstanding:  Using this indirect blow setup doesn't magically save energy, instead it requires even more energy. The force with which the pump has to move the air is *at least* as high as the force a full size fan would have to apply, additionally all this air-diverting has a cost overhead. It's nice not to be able to accidentally touch moving fan blades, though, and sticking an arm through the ring in the summer heat is probably a special experience.   In the spirit of desrtfx's comment:  https://www.google.com/search?q=java+tower+defense+game+tutorial   The question is too wide open. AI is used for all kinds of purposes in all kinds of ways.  Since your question is wide open - here are 10 free [ebooks](https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2dfdsy/15_free_ebooks_on_machine_learning/cjozl6x) on machine learning for direct bulk download.  What is it that you want to do? Or are you thinking about doing something, and the answers are supposed to help you decide what you want to do?   FTA:   But it is generally accepted that she does not use syntax or grammar, and that her use of language does not exceed that of a young human child.  Let's say they get generations of this going (see title). I think this wouldn't raise in quality by more than 20% (I mean, would max. reach the level of a slightly older young human child). I think evolution would have to be applied (Manual selection.) over thousands of generations to get somewhere remotely competitive to a human 4yo.   Valid point, but in all cases in which I was *able* to remove the videos (by renaming files), the time until main screen was indeed shortened by 1:1 for all I can tell. First example where I experienced this is Dishonored (Steam). Start game, wait about 10 seconds, and there's your main menu screen.  I think OP has a great idea. But I guess that it could be extended by "alter file X for FOV or better rendering" and such, ultimately becoming *the* game tuner tool for the master race. What PCGamingWiki is for knowledge, some day there will be a program for direct effect, and eventually the two will even have a direct data link to fuel the program.   Read my lips: Fuck the EULA. I know that I am not fucking hurting anyone in eternity if I skip the fucking intro videos that tell me how it's meant to be played and such.   Don't know. The Wikipedia plot summary just says (first sentence):   In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility, civilization is on the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction.    Just a suggestion, if you could make an exe and not make me install Java that'd be greeaat :)  The only way I know of to do that would involve blowing up the download size to 70+ MB. No install would be required, just unpacking (launch4j). As a developer, I like Java a lot, and since Minecraft and a few other notable Java games (e.g. Delver) exist, I thought it could kind of be expected that many people have Java. I'm not gonna start turning it into such an overblown EXE download, not only would nobody bite, it would also be yet another stepping stone between me and further development.   would your app name come up at all?  Well, I didn't know what to search for to find a tool like this, which (I guess) lead me to not add any keywords myself. I just now added a few keywords. Also saw that Google indeed finds that page for older keywords, so there is hope.  I made a few other posts, too, back then. I also keep mentioning it when I see a good opportunity (like here), several times a month, I'd guess.  All in all, I have made the experience that people are not very receptive to *anything* that comes from me, however weird that might sound. For example, I made a great replacement for the Steam game library: It automatically reads the Steam files (without altering anything), and then you can rename and tag your games (inside that program only, of course). The tag system even has a second tag system attached so that you can filter the primary tags. I have been using it ever since. It also (kind of) keeps track of your in-game time. You can sort by "date first seen by program" or "date last played" etc.. It has good data safety features (safe saves, and 100 rotating backups of the tiny but work-heavy data file), it even has a log of your activity in case you need to manually backtrack. It also shows screenshots in a *useful* way (as opposed to overstyled Steam), so if you click a game, you see right away what you're dealing with. Can also add custom games or programs, even links to documents. You can directly invoke install or uninstall just like from Steam, etc. I don't have a source uploaded yet, that program was before I started with online repositories.  Well. I made a few posts of this program and mentioned it in a few comments. And what I have been met with was almost no acceptance, and sometimes rejection that was borderline hostile for WTF ever reason. You know how when you go through experiences, you do learn inevitably, I mean, it's a timing and statistics thing, it's how the mind works. The tunnel through which *I* have gone in the last years - if anyone would go through that tunnel, they would *have* to come to the conclusion that they are basically *singled out* for some reason.   Thanks for joining in. - sarcasm   I created an issue about this.  https://github.com/voat/voat/issues/573   Taunt   TIL Kim Jong-Il is a squirrel.   How about "I have a sinking feeling ..."

Still, [my](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/2pgqfz/java_8_apps_with_source_application/) Java 8 renamer (source included) seems to cover a corner-case nobody else yet made a tool for.  FileRenameEditor opens a directory of your choice in a *text editor*, so that you can even type on multiple lines at once, and use block select and copy paste. Unlimited undo. Renamed lines have changed color. Can "save" the edits per line or bulk. As long as you don't confirm, no changes will be made.  It has only like 25 downloads so far, and I think the world is missing out.   Downvoted because it is likely to promote unhealthy behavior, and I feel responsible for my votes.   I think you're better off keeping them in cases, e.g. standard disc Jewel cases. Because no matter how high quality your binder's cushioned pockets are: Whenever you handle the binder, you'll move around all those discs a little, rubbing their surfaces against the Teflon superstar container lining or whatever. They don't rub against anything when you handle a Jewel case. You might have played them all a long time ago, but: $60 per game, bro.   Imagine to be a natural born predator (for evolutionary reasons, so this didn't come out of a vacuum but happened because of the environment), and suddenly your ability to sense or defend against attackers is almost nullified, just like that. I assume that's the kind of feeling the cat has and why it acts like this.   Religion should have an entrance portal with a big sign saying "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."  Too bad the kids it is being taught to can't read yet.   Oh, thanks. Interestingly, it sometimes works (as I *just* found out): In the post  https://voat.co/v/AskVoat/comments/188974  I could successfully comment "PING". But in the post  https://voat.co/v/DebateanAtheist/comments/188770  I was not able to comment *anything* (incl. "PING", but my intent is actually a text with 7 lines. English letters, some standard punctuation characters.) even though I keep trying.  Maybe something in the DB is borked in that post?   LFW creates impulse that affects the flow of reality. If you'd want to know how, I'd have to explain God, as I said. Reality is a complete whole down to the smallest resolution. Whenever "supernatural" influx happens (LFW impulse.), it comes from below the smallest scales, which leaves the universe's sciency whole untainted yet influences its flow. That's one way to coarsely summarize how human will works.   I kind of appreciate your response, because it's the right thing to say to any human who is convinced that he is God while being wrong about it.   The prediction of something useful that can be investigated is an entirely different matter. But even if it had been ignored (which it probably has): Our natural evolution-given strife to map our environment lead us to discover metal. If God has measurable effects on nature, then we will possibly discover him, too. If not, then that would be because the discovery is not useful. If you'd now argue afterlife, you'd be cheating.  In any case, the comparison doesn't hold water.   It has been observed, however, that the people in the neighborhood believe the same thing. That's clearly a manifestation of the truth of the claims.   Thanks. Didn't help, though. Emptied cache, logged out and back in, same effects.

I currently can't submit comments. It hangs with "doing the magic", and nothing happens.   Sorry, this is getting nowhere, and it's not quite your fault and definitely not mine. I can only say this: I am God, the creator of the universe. I am objective, therefore my determination that I am objective and that I am God is correct. = "If I'm right, then I'm right." Except that I *know* that I am right, but I have no way yet to convince you. We do have LFW, and that's a good thing. It also comes with responsibilities, of course. Mankind isn't exactly keen on facing those, which informs the way people think.    "Impulse" seems like an invented term that isn't grounded to anything  https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_%28physics%29  Whatever goes on in our minds has its 1:1 representation in physics, or rather it *is* physics. But if we have LFW, this source of impulse for new/different physical events is not a part of the physical world. I'm not talking about supernatural events etc. - let's shorten this: I am God himself, who created the universe. To explain how LFW in the universe works, I would have to explain how God works. It's not all that complicated, but it involves one or two so-called "Brute Facts". Not only will you as an atheist reject these, you will also not grasp the overall concept. I know this, therefore let's end the discussion here.   The wha? I thought a speeding ticket grants access to the highway in the first place?   Batman Awkward Knight  	138

Why had you been going?   Have you ever heard of Rosetta Stone software?   Where are you?      Second apostrophe in title is misplaced.   ...Alienation and reification are the two ideas most commonly associated with critical theory. The former is usually identified with the psychological effects of exploitation and the division of labor, and the latter with how people are treated instrumentally, as things, through concepts that have been ripped from their historical context. Pioneering studies of alienation and reification had already been undertaken by Western Marxists during the 1920s, but the Frankfurt School provided a unique sense of how these complex categories impacted upon individuals in advanced industrial society.  They investigated the ways in which thinking was being reduced to mechanical notions of what is operative and profitable, ethical reflection was tending to vanish, and aesthetic enjoyment was becoming more standardized. Critical theorists noted with alarm how interpreting modern society was becoming ever more difficult. Alienation and reification were thus analyzed in terms of how they imperiled the exercise of subjectivity, robbed the world of meaning and purpose, and turned the individual into a cog in the machine.  Auschwitz was seen as incarnating the most radical implications of alienation and reification. It was the watershed event that shattered optimistic assumptions about progress even more radically than the Lisbon earthquake did during the eighteenth century. With images of the Nazi concentration camps still fresh, Hiroshima and Nagasaki destroyed, new reports emerging about the Soviet Gulag, and McCarthyism on the rise in the United States, it appeared to the Frankfurt School as if Western civilization had generated not human development but an unparalleled barbarism. They knew that something more was required from radical thought than the usual stale critique of capitalism....  ----------------  Stephen Eric Bronner, 'Critical Theory: A Very Short Introduction' (2011; Oxford University Press), pp.4-5.

Upon receiving your MS I will Fanny Butcher it something like this:  "Leo Adams, a small town boy who made good in Chicago and went to New York to let his hair down has just aroused the interest (to say nothing of the passions) of his contemporaries with one of the boldest American literary efforts since Eddie Guest he could write poetry. His story will live in the anals of literature.  "Working with a modern metre, a Washington Square setting and a limited vocabulary, he carries us back to the daze of Greece when Socrates went blind with passion at the sight of the limbs of a youth and when all a young boy had to do to be successful was to get under a good man and work his way up.  "Though sadly hampered by the English language's notorious lack of synonyms for the capital "I", Mr. Adams reinforces his style with the sincerity of his belief in himself and savors it with a sensuality so austere that one is led to believe that he himself is more staid than stayed with.  "His purple interludes are at once reminiscent of Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris. He is not, of course as Wilde as Oscar but neither is he, on the other hand, as Frank as Harris, though if sufficiently Harrised he might go Wilde.  "If left alone, this young man will go far but we doubt if he will find his way back."   Smoldering...  I know it's bad for you...

The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawkif such a term can be applied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation, whose joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all of self, and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself, and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wearsthe reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in brief, that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness MUST be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, and that the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit, and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world. And lest this last considerationno mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberryshould sound strangely in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause. Sir Mulberry's world was peopled with profligates, and he acted accordingly.

Provision of mental health services for young people varies widely across England, with entry-level care largely funded by local authorities, which are trying to slash spending.   Research has found young people who do not receive help in the early stages of their illness can suffer serious consequences, often needing time in hospital or remaining ill during adulthood.  Young Minds submitted a Freedom of Information request about funding of child and adolescent mental health services for 2014-15 and the previous four financial years.  It had responses from 99 out of the 151 councils it contacted.  More than half had made cuts over the last five years, while nine councils had kept funding at the same level.  The biggest reduction was at Birmingham City Council, from just above 2.3m in 2010-11 to 125,000 in 2014-15, a drop of 94% ____________________________  [BBC News - Mental health services cuts 'affecting children'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-27942416)   http://www.ufwc.co.uk/   I heard the advent of recorded music also had an effect.

Long live the bucket of Lego!   To play devils advocate on the topic, i used to be socially awkward and had anxiety, and facebook gave me a buffer to let me communicate with girls i just met.   My grandma uses the same toaster she got as a wedding gift in the early 70s, because that tank is made of sheet steel and will never die.   I thought it was 10 minutes of sponsor ads.   I would suggest to take one month and put fast food on a credit card at least twice a week. When you get your statement you'll never pull that shit again.   Might be harder to find here, I'll take a look next time I'm around the liquor commission   Still haven't seen KFC Double Down on this thread.   Canadian whiskey is still better. Goes down smooth, not like that battery acid stuff.   Ah American football, where large, greasy men fight for a stuffed leather sack that rarely touches a foot.  The original marketing for the sport wasn't well thought out for the name.   You're opinion on Sennheiser?

I heard a while back that in the 80s Pepsi made it their policy to sell their product commercially at a fixed price, only adjusting for inflation.   Try coke zero and brushing teeth regularly. Helps a lot.   College and university aren't as predatory and useless as the "become a a dental hygienist assistant in as little as 6 months!" Places. Y'know, the college's that advertise at 2am on a weekday.   Wasted my risky click of the day on that....   But i need fake internet points to match my piles of gold. Oh wait...  I'm already there!   I realize now I had Good Guy Dad. Mom pretends she's with the times but still lives with a ruler down her back.  When i started dating, Dad would lend me the car, get Mom out of the house, even burned the empty box of condoms he found in the back seat.  Edit: can't trust Mom, but Dad's a bro in my books.   To add to this, more schools need to enforce (with escorts off campus) poor appearance. The habit needs to be made to pay attention to hygiene and looking professional. So many students don't understand that a school is still a place of work. Dress for it like you would a job. No i do not mean where a suit every day.  I understand the pressure to look attractive and follow fashion trends. But thats all they are. *Trends*. Professionalism is timeless.   How is this an issue? Every kid I went to class with had the pressure of good college, scholarships, etc. We grew up knowing a worthless diploma from a nobody college would be a complete waste.   My middle school principal suspended a guy for a month for taping a fake moustache to himself.  "Disruptive behaviour" is the not so new name for anything that isn't "sit down and shut up."   Unless your child shows clear signs as an academic prodigy and will probably end up at Harvard or MIT, high school doesn't mean a thing as long as you pass.  I'm currently attending one of the best culinary schools in north america, and all they wanted was to know if i passed high school.

Hey r/AskReddit and r/PenmanshipPorn, I'm looking for good sources for quality and reasonably priced pens, inks, etc. for a gift set.

A lot of the western world is on a negative growth trend. Countries like India are on unsustainable growth trends.   I hear this so damn often. I save so many hundreds of dollars a year eating healthy. I highly doubt the cost of healthy food is the issue, as much as lazy bastards who couldn't be bothered to learn basic cooking skills.   An area of my city called Osborne Village. Hipster shops, independent clothing stores, and a great pub during the day/evening, muggings, stabbings and shootings at night.  Not every night, but at least once a month.   As Canadian but also chef, don't care as far as sausages go.   I have a good set of headphones (no, Beats are not good, they're Sennheiser), but my mixer looks like master volume at 30%, everything else at 4%, and other settings like in-game, Youtube, etc, set between 50-80%. I can't figure out how to fix how loud everything defaults to, and I'm not even bad with computers. Any ideas?   But you can save a ton changing oil yourself. All you need is a car jack, big pail, filter, and oil. I'd have my half ton changed under 15 minutes in my driveway.   As a cook i can confirm. 3 inch by half inch scar (we call them chef tattoos) on left forearm. Bumped a sheet pan loading a cooling cart.  	48

Regardless of prestige and difficulty, what are some good schools for fields such as these with good opportunities for a major in CS?

That doesn't strike me as any kind of protection.  By that criterion, we're all protected from any abuse since we can leave and live in another country.  You probably mean something other than that, right?                     I made the original post and took the headline directly from the article. You might try to RTFA.                                       The astute observer will already note the profound irony here - a political group whose ideology elevates the individual over the group (Conservatives) has managed to cultivate more group cohesion than the political group whose ideology blends community well-being with that of the individual.             This is about an affecting experiment in teaching.   To enter the public world, to practice the political life, the poor had first to learn to reflect. That was what she meant by the moral life of downtown.   This is about an affecting experiment in teaching.

I hope you are just trying to make a joke   Overall, no.  Good moments here and there.   I agree to a point.  It is tough though because there are too many people out there that will like the bad guys no matter what and will not boo.  But yes, there needs to be a resurgence in the amount of heel tactics in matches like eye raking/gouging, cheap shots, low blows, etc.   In essence yes, you are giving them a reaction.  But, there is still a fundamental difference between booing and cheering.  Booing shows your disdain for a wrestler while cheering shows your support. For example, if Barrett is facing Neville and he hits him with a Bull Hammer, he should not get a standing ovation.  He should get a rousing chorus of boos because he is the bad guy.   The bigger problem is people cheering for the heels.  You are not supposed to cheer heels, you are supposed to boo them.

                                                                                        I agree, that's one of the most succinct quotes I've heard about the Palestine-Israel quagmire in a long time.             [It was posted there yesterday and did pretty well, it got over 900 upvotes with 86% upvoting.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2x5rl8/make_this_the_year_you_discover_a_new_destination/)         Here's the link to a DailyDot article about Banksy's trip to Palestine. Just seeing the video is a bit vague:  http://www.dailydot.com/politics/banksy-new-gaza-artwork/                                       You know what, I agree with you, and I'm going to take this article down. Thank you for calling it out, cause I was sitting on the fence about submitting it.    Google "gerrymandering ".     I absolutely agree, why would you want to get rid of someone that racially ambiguous, she could pull off several different races, thereby doing a wide range of good impersonations.    "If we're going to look at suspects [for 9/11], we should look to the groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents, and I think we should put the state of Israel on the suspect list because I think this diverts attention from what's happening in the Palestinian territories so that they can go on with their aggression and occupation and apartheid policies," he said in a radio interview shortly after the attacks in 2001, according to the Los Angeles Times.    All of Patrice O'neal's conspiracy videos on YouTube are must see if you subscribe to this sub. They are from some of Patrice's appearances on the Opie and Anthony Show a few years ago.   Patrice does a really good job breaking down the stigma of being a  conspiracy theorist and makes you laugh while he does it.    This is an excellent self.post.    Okay, while I agree with the sentiment of the submission and am not a Zionist apologist whatsoever, I think its wildly irresponsible; not to mention very misleading to make up fake quotes.   I know Elizabeth Warren came out in support of Israel during the Operation Protective Edge last summer, I was very disappointed when that happened, I felt it exposed Elizabeth Warren as just another Zionist.   However, she never said these words, and this meme submission is circlejerky to say the least. Find me a reputable source of her saying this and I'll retract my statement, until then I'm calling bullshit.  You can't just go around making up fake quotes for people you dislike or disagree with on global issues. If that were the case I could just put up a picture of Netanyahu saying how he'd like to wipe out all of the Palestinians and drink the blood of their children.   Do you honestly think that a savvy, liberal politician like Warren is going to give such a ham handed, blunt statement like that ?    They changed the title of the article after putting it up. When I submitted it to /r/politics this was the title.    What the ACTUAL fuck !    Arizona ?   This article is about events taking place in New Mexico.    That's an excellent book. I consider it required reading for anyone who frequents this subreddit.    I posted this in /r/movies and it got downvoted to 0 upvotes less than a minute after I posted it. A slew of what would appear to be stock negative comments followed.   I think /r/movies has been compromised, I don't go there very often but I was disappointed to find out that even a subreddit about movies has been infiltrated by pro-military users.   Here's the link to my submission on /r/movies if anyone wants to peruse the comments section:  http://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2taijh/7_big_lies_american_sniper_is_telling_america/   He couldn't make them any worst.    5 things he allegedly lied about in his book, of which he lost one in court.   He defamed Jesse Ventura in his book and Ventura took him to court and won $1.8 million in a jury settlement, so thats a pretty ironclad, confirmed lie.   Not for nothing, these weren't little white lies that the average person tells. This is a case of this guy writing a book about his life and lying in the book about his life and then selling the packaged lie to the American consumer, so its a little different.    Jesus Christ.    Any more racist generalizations about entire nations of people ?   I bet you have some great opinions about black people, Asians and Latinos as well.    It whitewashes the fact that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, none of the hijackers were Iraqi, 15 of the 19 were Saudi Arabian, the US's second best ally in the region after Israel.   I love it, Saudi's attack us, so lets deploy troops to Iraq, foolproof logic. Clint Eastwood linked Iraq to 9/11 with the way he set up that sequence in the film. Eastwood needs to stop making films, this film was a 2 hour celebration of jingoism and xenophobia.   Did he at any point in the film have any of his characters say:  "Hey, why the fuck are we even here ? Weren't we attacked by Saudis ?"  No, he didn't.    Simple solution:  Don't enlist.   Problem solved.   At the very least don't enlist, go over there and wantonly commit atrocities just to come back and here throw your service in my face, I didn't ask you to enlist, so don't act like you did me a favor.  The worst thing returning veterans say to civilians that question the motives for the war they participated in is:  "I fought so that people like you could have freedom"  Or something childlike to that effect, completely oblivious to the fact that they are just mere pawns on some billionaire banker/industrialist's chessboard. The war in Iraq was NOT about defending our freedom, or about 9/11. It was about taking out a dictator whose policies no longer reflected the US's best interests.   Saddam was going to start pricing his barrels of oil on the international market in Euros and not in dollars or petrodollars, which would've adversely effected the dollars status as the international reserve currency. That more than any other reason is why we went into Iraq. Don't delude yourself into thinking it was about protecting our freedom here at home. I certainly can't remember the last time an Iraqi tried to curtail my freedom, even the notion is ridiculous.    He's made into a tragic hero, a martyr, that's the absolute best possible thing to be. A tragic, misunderstood figure.   They made him into a Christ-like saint who gave it all for his country. The film will without a doubt increase enlistment. [Besides Clint Eastwood is US veteran, do you think he would honestly make a film depicting the army or a marine in a negative light ?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood#Early_life)  Look at Clint's other military film, *Flags of our Fathers*, its unabashed positive depiction of the US military in Japan in World War II, it might as well be a recruitment film.    Really ?!  I think starting a war on what was later proven to be manufactured, phony evidence and bombing a country back to the stone age would make the United States the savages in that situation.   The US left a power vacuum for religious strife to take place, they created a platform for it. Then you have people like Chris Kyle blaming the victims of war for getting sucked up in a power vacuum that he helped create. The idiocy and ignorance looms large in that mans worldview.   Furthermore you have the US army engaging in brutal torture on Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison, setting dogs on them and electrocuting the prisoners genitalia to get perverse pleasure. That's pretty savage if you ask me. Good luck justifying the atrocities committed by the occupying US army in Iraq, you have your work cut out for you.    Yea but its 2015, we shouldn't treat people that are outwardly racist as the heroes of our society.   All this movie does is encourage young Americans to enlist in the military and continue an unending war overseas. It simplistically displays the complex reasons we went to war in Iraq.   For instance, in the film they show the events of 9/11 and in the very next scene 18 months later, Chris Kyle is miraculously in Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. The film attempts to whitewash US history.   Here are some Chris Kyle quotes from his book *American Sniper*:  *Savage, despicable evil. That's what we were fighting in Iraq.*   Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*  *But I wondered, how would I feel about killing someone? Now I know. Its no big deal.*   Chris Kyle, *American Sniper: Memorial Edition*  *Savage, despicable evil. Thats what we were fighting in Iraq. Thats why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy savages. There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there. People ask me all the time, How many people have you killed? My standard response is, Does the answer make me less, or more, of a man? The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government.*   Chris Kyle, *American Sniper*  This is the hero that the American people are lionizing and holding up so high. This movie is pure propaganda and I refuse to be anyone's useful idiot and support this jingoistic, xenophobic film.   He referred to people protecting their homeland from an occupying army as savages, I guess that would make the founding fathers and the soldiers who fought in the American revolution savages too then, right ? Wait no, those people were white so they can't be savages, they were patriotic, red blooded Americans. What hypocritical bullshit, enjoy your Academy Award Bradley Cooper, you like, Ben Affleck, sold your soul for your Oscar with a propaganda film.    Did you see the recent report that said that the US has already spent 3 trillion in the global war on terror ?   Who do you think that 3 trillion is owed to ?   The bulk of it is owed to a slew of defense contractors. Who do you think makes the bombs, tanks, fighter jets, ammo rounds and body bags ? General Electric and their ilk. War is business and business is a booming.   Do you know who General Smedley Butler is ? He is one of the most decorated General/marines in US military history. He wrote a book in 1933 called *War is a Racket*, in which he atones for his past sins in the US military and admits that it was all for the United Fruit Company, Brown Brothers banking house and a few other major corporations. Here is a link to War is a Racket on YouTube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI3lckqaSk0  80 years later its still true that War is a Racket, now more than ever. Listen to what General Butler iterated 80 years ago.    The sad thing is you evidently can milk 9/11 for 14 years. All the while you can also bilk the tax payers out of trillions to hand over to Lockheed Martin, Halliburton, Boeing and Northrop Grumman.   9/11 is a golden goose for defense conglomerates.    Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If youre really in favor of free speech, then youre in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, youre not in favor of free speech.    *Noam Chomsky*   I can't remember the last time a news story was so saturated with hypocrisy.    Max Blumenthal is the author of *Goliath*:*Life   Loathing in Greater Israel*. Anyone interested in the plight of the Palestinian people should seriously consider reading this book. As a Jewish person, Mr. Blumenthal is allowed to really critique the quagmire in the occupied territories without the fear of being labelled an anti-Semite.   We should try to support his work, because he is really putting himself out there on the forefront of this debate with this book which I would consider to be his most important piece of writing. He gets called all types of things by the Zionist crowd, self-hating Jew, etc, etc.   I think writers like him are the most important advocates for a Palestinian state, after all he grew up in a Jewish home and took the birthright trip to Israel so many young Jewish people take. He has an indispensable perspective on the situation in Israel and Palestine.    No, I'm not. I'm saying that when the options are Bush and Clinton that you don't have a real choice to make. You have the illusion of choice. The wealthy megadonors have made your choice for you. Policy will not change with either of these 2 frontrunning candidates taking office.   The only thing you'll see change is wedge issues, if Bush goes in you'll see abortion rights limited. If Hillary gets elected you'll see marriage equality advance. All of the truly substantive issues will remain the same, we won't leave Afghanistan, we won't end the war on drugs, we won't curtail the global war on terror, we won't do anything about the growing economic inequality and the death of the middle class, etc, etc ...   In short, Bush and Hillary are 2 sides of the same coin.    Yea, its a Simpsons Halloween episode reference. A bit dated, but prescient nonetheless.    I think this will be a "don't blame me, I voted for Kodos", election.   So the programming begins. It was really important for them to use the adjective, bizarre, in their title. Clearly letting their readers know that this is their wacky news article for the week.    Rule #4 - No abusive/threatening language   *So brave*   Ad hominem attacks such as "antisemitic conspiratard" are the last refuge of people that have lost the debate and have to resort to labeling people they disagree with, with derisive tags as an alternative.   So I'll go ahead and keep on illuminating people on the issue at hand and you can keep on attempting to assassinate my character and hope that people don't question your motive.    Look at /u/ShadowXWarrior and his account overview. This user moderates /r/IsraelandFriends   Do you honestly think this user is any more impartial than I in this debate.   Furthermore, isn't it a little strange to go and analyze my entire account history to find what you perceive to be offensive material ? What are the motivations of /u/ShadowxWarrior ?   That isn't something that one does just on a whim out of some sort of sense of morality. This user is attempting to smear my character and I'm not standing for it. Why don't you address me directly on the points of this debate rather then attempting to engage in a smear campaign ?   That is, if you think you can debate on the merits of the issue at hand, which is the continued oppression of the people of Palestine on their own land, at the hands of colonial settlers from Israel.    I have a lot of respect for Oliver Stone. A lot of people don't know that Stone's son, [Sean Stone, is a 9/11 Truther.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2387654/Sean-Stone-says-9-11-inside-job-Hezbollah-terrorists.html)  Aside from that Stone's documentary *South of the Border*, is required viewing for anyone interested in the United States involvement in creating coups in nations with democratically elected governments to result in regime change.    I love how TimesofIsrael is considered an impartial source of information regarding Israel. For some reason those articles are never considered opinion/analysis pieces.    I don't see what that has to do with anything, just by asking that question I can tell you are one of those Hindu nationalists, to whom Modi can do no wrong.   I am a Sikh. I don't allow my religion to define my worldview. It would appear that you do. That must be a very boring, programmed existence for you, to have your mind made up for you on all the important issues.   This is you:  "I'm Hindu ! I hate all Muslims ! Go Modi !"  I bet you're a real critical thinker /s.    They also haven't passed a resolution condemning India for warring with Pakistan in the Kashmir region.   If Palestinians who are Muslim, haven't condemned India for the actions taken by India against Pakistan in Kashmir isn't that enough ?   The fact that India is not a Muslim nation and they still haven't drawn any ire from Palestine, a Muslim nation on the Kashmir quagmire, is evidence enough of their appreciation of India.  Furthermore, what can Palestine do for India when they have Israel breathing down their neck, constantly encroaching on their own land and reducing life in Gaza to an open-air prison. If India would stay the course I'm certain the people of Palestine would reciprocate India's many good deeds if only they could.   Israeli's are violating a slew of international agreements and UN mandates when they continue to violate Palestinian's human rights in the future Palestinian state. The parallels between what Palestinians are going through now and what Indians were going through under the British Raj are endless.   Palestine first needs to be in a situation where they can pass some sort of mandate that would be substantive on the Kashmir quagmire. Right now, they are just getting by, surviving on what subsistence Israel allows them. In these troubled times for the Palestinian state, they are using their religion as a pillar to strengthen their resolve. Much like Gandhi and Bhagat Singh did in the face of British oppression.   They shouldn't be punished for being Muslims, like many of the other Indians on this thread would like to do. The Palestinians are the unabashed victims in this situation and India is flip-flopping on their proud humanitarian history and turning their backs on the colonized to appease the powerful the Western countries (US   UK) that would like nothing more than to see Israel take over all of Palestine. That is what Modi's vision for India is, an appeaser of Western imperialism.    No, one Muslim nation, Palestine, is being colonized by Europeans.   How is it that Indians, the poster children for colonized people can't empathize with people being colonized by Europeans. Its as if the British Raj didn't exist, how soon we forget the horrors of European colonialism when its Muslims being colonized.   India was once a great example of a burgeoning power that cared about humanitarianism. Now under Modi, we just do what America and England tell us to do, and turn our back on other people that are being colonized my Europeans. This change in policy is rife with hypocrisy.    Seeing as how you can't continue with this debate without resorting to absurdities (aliens) I'm through with this back and forth. Its called intelligent discourse, its what adults do, you should try it some time.    The religious extremists will support Pakistan, Palestine's government however would support India seeing as how India has close diplomatic ties with India. Furthermore, India was the first non-Arabic country to recognize the PLO. Manmohan Singh also saw to it that India opened up a visa office in Ramallah just last year.   I don't think you know what you are talking about. [Here's the link to the Wikipedia page detailing India-Palestine relations.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Palestine_relations)  India was once a shining beacon for shaming the rampant colonialism taking place in Palestine and the occupied territories. Modi is ruining that great legacy of humanitarianism. He's turning India into a vassal state of the West, rubber stamping their colonialism at the UN. India might as well just turn over its UN vote to England, with Modi in charge. England and America are calling the shots for Modi, he is their puppet.    Good response, I didn't know I was exchanging comments on geopolitics with a 12 year old.    No its Modi kowtowing to the West. He is placating the West at every turn and selling out India's sovereignty. No other country in the world was screwed over as much as India because of Western colonialism and now Modi is rubber stamping the exploitation of the Palestinian people just 67 years after India gained their independence from Western hegemony.   Modi is turning India into a puppet state for the West. India has sovereignty, so they should act like it. Indians would do well to remind themselves that the kind of rationale they're applying to make excuses for Israel is the same kind of reasoning that allowed Britons to ease their conscience about the rape and pillage of India during British colonization.    Well just remember that those white people that you're siding with now referred to Indians seeking independence as extremists just 70 years ago. Its a tad bit hypocritical to refer to people that are being colonized now by European colonists as extremists. I guess with that rationale someone like Bhagat Singh was an extremist as well.    Yes I was born in India and spent my formative years there. So that apology ...    I'm Indian, so good luck with that one.    Oh my god ! They almost don't have complete compliance from Congress. The horror !   Israel and their continued collective oppression of the Palestinian people on their ancestral land seems to be the only thing that Congress can agree on funding. God forbid we let Israel practice apartheid in the occupied territories of Palestine on their own shekel.      "You don't have to go home, but you gotta the heck out of here.

Well we do pride ourselves here on being one of the last places on Reddit where things don't get censored and almost anything is allowed to get posted and gets a fair chance of getting upvoted.   What I can do, as ineffective as it may seem on its face is propose moving no memes up the rule list a few slots, thereby stressing its importance. Right now its the 8th rule of /r/conspiracy but I don't see why it can't be higher up.    We try not to remove anything once it reaches the top of the page, even memes. It leads to cries of censorship. Also content control is a slippery slope.   I don't like seeing memes at the top of the page either, they never provide any new content and usually tend to lend themselves to circlejerking.   The key is to get to memes before they fly up the page and accumulate hundreds of upvotes in a matter of an hour or two.   If I see a good self post, I'll always suggest stickying it to other mods. Our sidebar picture right now links to a great self post by a user about trolls.   If you submit a really good self post that you put a lot of time into and is of good quality, message the mods about it so it doesn't fall by the wayside. We'll always consider stickying a good self post.    Racial slurs will not be tolerated. Continued usage of racial slurs will result in a ban.    I meant how are they going to justify it to the user when they inquire how it falls under the category of politics, as in right vs. left, blue team vs. red team. In other words, its not explicitly political, only vaguely political.    These removals from /r/TIL seem to be getting more and more brazen. Good catch on the removal this submission is about, I wonder how they're going to justify this one ?    [Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98)  This is James Corbett's short 5 minute video called, 9/11: A Conspiracy Theory that briefly exposes all of the inaccuracies of the events that purportedly took place that day.    That all the countries that don't have central banks with Western controlled central bankers running things, happen to be the same exact countries that the United States and NATO seem to have problems with. I'm sure that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that these countries want to control their own natural resources and the currency that values them.   Just look at the countries the United States is currently beefing with, its the ones that aren't in debt to Anglo-American bankers, like Syria, Iran, North Korea. You can take Iraq and Libya off of that increasingly short list of truly sovereign nations.    That the vast majority of the mass media, be it mainstream news, magazines, radio stations, major Hollywood film studios, and television networks are owned predominantly by one group of people. There's no way that happens without some sort of collusion on some level.    Oscar from Fruitvale Station.    The Town    This is profound.    [The Money Masters is a must-see for anyone interested in currency, finance, the Rothschilds, and paper money. It is made by Bill Still, the subject of our most recent AMA here on /r/conspiracy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDtBSiI13fE)  On its face, this 3 and 1/2 hour documentary may seem like a daunting task, but its one of the most rewarding documentaries you will ever see. It answers a slew of elusive questions and portrays the Rothschilds in a realistic manner, sourcing the family's meteoric rise to rule the world of finance.    If they do that they'll also raise the population of India 100%.    Never mind, I saw it, its right on the front page. Thank you !

Answers to leading questions under torture naturally tell us nothing about the beliefs of the accused; but they are good evidence for the beliefs of the accusers.    C.S. Lewis, *The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature*   I don't think they shove them down people's throats like they do here in America. I'm Indian, and the police in India don't have a slew of television shows and number one films made about them. As a matter of fact, the police in India are pretty much reviled, everyone is always going on about how hopelessly corrupt they are.   I think the dozen new cop shows every fall is an explicitly American phenomenon. There's a difference between having novels about a detective, in Sherlock Holmes, and being inundated with procedural cop shows on television.    I wish there was a way for Congress to make accurately reporting how many people they kill a precondition for the police to be able to receive military equipment from the federal government.   That would definitely force police departments to accurately report these figures. Otherwise they would lose the new found tools of oppression and instruments of death that they love to parade around on and with.    I always tell people this. The first step to curtailing the police state is to stop watching shows like Law   Order, 24 and NCIS. We have to lower the prestige of the police state in America.   Literally the biggest hit comedy film this past summer was 22 Jump Street. That's not some mistake. Its not an accident that 'cop shows' are a genre in and of themselves in American television and film. We are programmed to always give the police the benefit of the doubt in any situation.    I can't think of anything that would have a greater likelihood of creating extremists.    No, I never got a chance to. My entire /r/documentaries career lasted about a month. I didn't know The Greatest Story Never Told existed before I was banned. If I wasn't banned from that sub that would be the first thing I'd do there.   Someone should try, I'm certain they'd find a reason to remove it, but its still worth a shot.   I posted this in the comments section of the other submission about /r/documentaries and Monsanto so I'll just copy and paste it here:  I've had bad experiences with the mod team over at /r/documentaries.  For a few weeks I posted great documentaries there that regularly made it to the top of the page. I posted a documentary about Monsanto and it made it to the top of the page and the comments section got wiped out. The shills lost the PR battle in the comments section so the mods took it upon themselves to remove all of the comments.  The straw that broke the camels back was when I posted a documentary about Israel and Zionism and Palestine. It was removed and when I inquired to the mod team I was accused of having an agenda and attempting to use /r/documentaries as my personal soap box. When I countered by sayng that their censorship of my documentary was evidence of the mods of /r/documentaries having an agenda, I was banned. I never did attempt to appeal my ban. Why ? Cause fuck them that's why. /r/Documentaries is discredited in my eyes. You can post as many documentaries there as you want about Isis or Al-Qaeda, but not Israel.

This edition of Red Ice Radio is all about this topic, its called, ["Hate Propaganda" Legislation in Canada.](http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2014/11/RIR-141112.php) It goes into great detail how the Zionist lobby in Canada is limiting on speech on anything with respect to Israel or Zionism.

I'll resubmit with the correct URL later on. Thanks for the heads up, I appreciate it.    For anyone wondering, the submission was removed for being "Off Topic" despite the fact that it deals explicitly with US politics. Certain mods over at /r/politics displayed stunning judgement when they said that this submission somehow had to do with Israeli politics.   I even messaged them selected paragraphs from the article that demonstrated how this article dealt specifically with US politics and the IAC (Israeli American Committee) which is basically another AIPAC, and they still said that the article was "Off Topic".   Pretty poor judgement, something tells me they didn't even read the parts of the article that I messaged them. They had their minds made up, regardless of what was in the article.    Lupe Fiasco is my favorite rapper, his lyrical content and subject matter are unmatched by any other rapper or mainstream artist that are his contemporaries.   His content is so good that it actually makes me feel embarrassed for liking rappers like Jay-Z when I was younger. Couple that with the fact that he has come out for 9/11 truth in a mainstream single and he is simply one of my favorite people, rapper or otherwise, period.    "Some people are the greatest people on Earth with good hearts and will get in the studio and make the most negative music in the world for the sake of success. That's what the music business does to you. That's what capitalism does to you."   - *Lupe Fiasco*     Its called planned obsolescence and its a scourge upon the planet.   How else are the titans of capitalism supposed to fuel their infinite growth paradigm on a finite planet ? Fleece the masses and make the biosphere in the developing and third world pay the price. E-waste is the fastest growing type of waste on Earth and something has to be done about it before it begins polluting the ocean and becomes the new plastic.    I think that's a great idea, and thank you for taking a genuine interest in the state of the sub. Users like you keep this place interesting, don't let the shills get you down.   I know what its like to have yourself invested in your own self-post. You feel like those are your words, thoughts and iterations that are being ridiculed by a seemingly endless cadre of shills, trolls and conspiratards. Try to look at it this way, your iterations are provoking this response from these shills because they don't want the users here to be emboldened enough to submit their own original content to this sub. They don't want this place to be one that is friendly to original thoughts, they want you to be scared of criticism.   In short, they don't want anyone here to get enough confidence in themselves by way of positive feedback from the /r/conspiracy community because then they might have another James Corbett on their hands to worry about.    Okay, the Russ Baker AMA is going to be up for a few more days for visibility, this Sunday evening when that AMA has run its course I will put this submission before the rest of the mod team for stickying. If you log into Reddit on Sunday night or Monday morning and this submission is stickied atop the front page, you'll know who to thank.   I think that self posts about visiting the new page should be stickied every 2-3 months just to remind /r/conspiracy users how important it is that the new submissions page not be manipulated in any way.    Content control is a slippery slope, I see plenty of things that I would like to remove, but that would lead to inevitable cries of censorship. What we like to do is let the users decide what should make it to the top of the page. If you want to do a good write up/self-post encouraging more users to visit the new submissions page then I would definitely present it to the other mods for a sticky nomination. I think you make several valid points here.   If I had my way I would remove the majority of UFO/ancient alien submissions made to the sub, but I can't do that without alienating some of our userbase or being accused of being some sort of malicious government censorship agent, when in reality I just find UFO conspiracies to be childish and amateur. As a matter of fact I would even go as far as saying that some of those UFO video submissions are submitted here by the conspiratard crowd and brigaded to the top of the page to make us seem like a less serious sub, of course I have no way of proving that.   But I digress, write up a good self post encouraging users to visit the new page more often and I'll nominate it to be stickied atop the page for a few days and if its agreed upon your sticky will go up and you'll see the quality of the front page go up drastically. That way front page submissions are better and the mods won't hear cries of censorship either.    [The new Pentagon defense budget for 2015 actually includes an additional $351 million for upgrades to the Israeli Iron Dome defense system, so I don't think this is even something anyone in the administration is even mulling.](http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/12/04/3599827/defense-bill/)   The FreeBeacon is a conservative news outlet, so they'll take any criticism of Israel by the administration and make it out to be much larger than it is. How could the US sanction Israel while giving $3 plus billion in aid ? If the US really wanted to damage Israel they would just cut off some of the exorbitant foreign aid Israel gets, there would be no need to go through the UN to sanction them.    "Rambler felt things got off to an unfortunate, if familiar, start when he learned that the **House and Senate Armed Services Committee had decided to use the lame-duck session of Congress and the National Defense Authorization Act to give 2,400 acres of the Tonto National Forest in Arizona to a subsidiary of the Australian-English mining giant Rio Tinto.**"  The song remains the same, how is this any different then colonial settlers claiming manifest destiny to push Native American tribes off their land in the 19th century ? Except instead of manifest destiny, they have modern day legalese to back up their claim to the land. The end result however is the same, Native Americans being pushed off their land so someone else can profit off of natural resources that rightfully belong to the Natives.    They tend to do a lot of Islamic terrorist fear mongering, that is my only real gripe with them. They recently released a documentary called "Inside ISIS" or something to that effect, that was all about how bad ISIS is and how someone has to do something about it.    I visited that walking dead wikipedia page that another user linked to, and apparently I also downplayed his body count in Woodbury as well. You should just visit that wikia page, they did a better job than I did. The killing of the butchers was a good one, and I'm surprised I missed it, that whole episode was a bloodbath.    True enough. I like choppy choppy BTW, its a nice way of putting a gruesome ending for Gareth.    Norman Reedus is a terrific actor. I don't think any other actor on the show has had their character allowed to flourish as much as Norman Reedus's depiction of Darryl Dixon.   In the first 2 seasons you only got to see angry Darryl or impatient Darryl, of course in season 3 his brother Merle's passing let you see angry/sad Darryl. In this past episode you could see that he was inconsolable. I would like to think that what got him is that an innocent, young life was cut down so suddenly right in front of his eyes.    Chronological order:  1. 2 guys in the Nebraska episode in Season 2  2. Shane in Season 2  3. Tomas at the prison in Season 3  4. A few (approximately 2 I think) of the governors people in Woodbury in Season 3   5. Rick killed that member of the marauders in the house that he, Michonne and "Coral" were staying at, in the bathroom upstairs in Season 4.  6. At the end of Season 4 Rick killed the guy who tried to rape "Coral" and the guy he bit, so that one was a twofer.   7. Rick began Season 5 putting up some numbers, he killed according to my estimations 4 people during the great escape from Terminus, remember he sneaked up behind them with an automatic rifle and took out their legs, leaving them to be killed by nearby walkers.   8. Then Rick killed Gareth in the church because he made him a promise, and what good is a man who can't keep his word ?   9. And of course this past episode started with a bang with Rick taking out that cop who wouldn't listen to him.   So according to my estimations, that makes a grand total of 15 people that Rick has turned into walkers.    This movie is a must see for anyone interested in the history of paper money, the Rothschilds, currency in America   Europe and the effects of these things on political and military history over the last 3 centuries.   This movie has received several nominations for our documentary of the month in the past, but for whatever reason has always come up just short.    More power to these women for fighting back against these animals. When Indian men act like this it should be the responsibility of other Indian men to stand up and crack them in their fucking jaws.   These Indian "men" do a disservice to all other Indian men around the globe when they act like animals and prey upon young women. It doesn't make Indians around the world look good when their countrymen are behaving like ravenous rapists and molesters.   It also screws with tourism in India, which as everyone here knows is a sizable chunk of the economy. You can't blame people from the West for not wanting to go India  on holiday if they are going to be concerned about the safety of the women accompanying them on the trip the whole time.   The other people on the bus also didn't do anything, they just stood by and let it happen. If I was there those dudes would've each gotten a right hand to the jaw.    Well it sounds like Ross just discovered their new advertising slogan to me:  "I gotta go to Ross right now homie !"   SHOW SPOILER:   Best, most underrated villain the show has ever had. Its a shame he was killed off so quickly, although I suppose Rick did make him a promise.    I don't know what that would accomplish.   I take it that you are not going to remove the submission and thereby are encouraging your users to engage in vote manipulation. If that is the case then just say so, and I'll be on my merry way.  BTW your own sidebar ends with "Furthermore thou shalt not brigade."  Way to selectively enforce your own rules.   Its the intention, if you make it an np submission then you are suggesting the users of your subreddit not participate in the submission over on /r/conspiracy.   Simply submitting it to /r/undelete is a clear signal and invitation to your users to go ahead and brigade the thread. If anything, marking it [META] does nothing.    Shouldn't this be a non-participation submission to avoid vote brigading ?   This submission is still on the front page of /r/conspiracy. Flairing it META does nothing to avoid vote brigading. /r/Conspiracy even changed their sidebar picture to one that is about this very submission. Its highly misleading to have it posted here like this as it suggests that the mods of /r/conspiracy (myself included) removed the submission in an act of overt censorship.    They flaired it META as somewhat of an indication that it is not in fact deleted but its still highly misleading that its posted there in the first place, I hate when they do that. Honest mistake.    Its not deleted, what are you talking about ?    (Hikes pants up)   Collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity toward those who are not regarded as members of the herd.    Bertrand Russell, *Unpopular Essays*   This picture makes me furious.   This store owner is an Indian immigrant, he came here with nothing and tried to make something of himself. He doesn't have a dog in this fight, why are these rioters attempting to destroy his livelihood ? These convenience store owners don't even make that much money in the first place. My friends dad owns a convenience store just like this one and he's not exactly raking in the dough, this store owner probably makes most of his money from selling lottery tickets and tobacco products, just like the Swisher Sweets Michael Brown strong arm robbed from this very store.  So first he gets robbed by Michael Brown, then rioters and looters attempt to upend the way that he provides for his family in a vain attempt of misguided and misdirected anger. Their solution for police brutality is to rob someone who came here from a very poor country to earn a living, good job protesters /s.   Source: Indian    Season 2 was by far the worst season. You can make a case for character development, but I thought the writing for said character development was ham-handed at best.   IMHO, season 5 is the best season, even though its only 7 episodes in, the action   acting in just the first 3 episodes made it better than season 2 in its entirety.    "Maybe that's what cops in ~~Atlanta~~ America are like though..."  FTFY    The mistake our politicians so often make with these industry leaders is in thinking they are interested in, or respectful of, the power of government. All they want is to keep stealing. If you can offer them the governments seal of approval on that, theyll take it. But if you cant, well, theyll take that too.    Matt Taibbi, *Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America*   He's the Ex-CIA head of the Bin Laden division. I never alter the titles of my submissions in any way. The person who submitted the original content to YouTube decide for whatever reason to refer to Mr. Scheuer that way. The only thing I changed was making the all-caps "MUST SEE", lowercase, as it would violate rule #6 of the sub.    They have effectively socialized losses through taxpayer funded bank bailouts and kept the gains, which have never been larger, privatized.   Its akin to going to a casino with a rich buddy and having them spot you on your gambling money, and keeping whatever you are able to win from the casino for yourself, only in this paradigm the rich buddy is the American taxpayer.    Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power    Benito Mussolini, *The Doctrine of Fascism*    Okay, I'll delete and repost from YouTube, I found an HD version of the clip.    Seeing this posts shitty title confirmed it for me already :(   I really like this sub, but I hate the casual Comic book spoilers cause I know how much AMC sticks to the comics.    Why don't you flair this "Comic Spoiler" ?   The title of your post makes it pretty implicit that Eugene dies in the comic books, thereby making it very likely that he'll die on the show. Thanks for that. Dick.    Thank you.   Okay so copy the URL of your submission and in between the www.Reddit put in np, example:  www.np.Reddit.com   I hate to do this, but can you delete this submission and repost it with no at the beginning, for non participation, lest the sub get accused of vote brigading.   Its only been up for 8 minutes so I don't think its a big deal. I can practically see the message from the admins about it already. So can you please delete this and resubmit it np.Reddit.com instead ?    Upvote for excellent usage of kerfuffel.    Did you watch the video ?   They ripped off his "Web Redemption" which is what really angered Tosh. He spent a full minute acknowledging the fact that he doesn't own the funny clip tv show format. Its the fact that the hack from ESPN did what amounted to a Web Redemption on ESPN and even used Tosh's phrase word-for-word with the Web Redemption guest:  "Are you ready to give it another shot ?"   To say that the guy from ESPN didn't rip off the Web Redemption would be pretty inaccurate.    "At least when Bush lied, no one died."  [Tell that to the half a million dead Iraqis.](http://www.psmag.com/navigation/politics-and-law/better-stab-estimating-many-died-iraq-war-68419/)    This is what happens when you regularly appoint heads of the FCC that previously worked for telecom giants. You think Tom Wheeler cares more about what President Obama or his former employer Verizon, an affiliation which absolutely got him the job as head of the FCC ?   What Tom Wheeler, formerly of Verizon, is doing with the FCC is the same exact thing that [Michael R. Taylor, former VP of Monsanto is doing with the FDA.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-smith/youre-appointing-who-plea_b_243810.html)  The appointments of a former head of Verizon and a former VP of Monsanto to head the FCC   FDA by the Obama administration is a perfect example of this President allowing the foxes to guard the hen house.   Of course he is.   2 weeks ago Jon Stewart spent the entire first segment of the Daily Show, making fun of the fact that Charlie Crist put a fan under his podium during the debate and that Florida Governor Rick Scott wouldn't debate him while the fan was there. This led to a 10 minute segment about dick jokes featuring the map of Florida.  John Oliver on the other hand will spend 15 minutes on one ACTUAL topic, and thoroughly discuss it, presenting both sides of the debate, as irrational as one side of the debate may be. Jon Stewart's bit is hackneyed and with Stephen Colbert leaving to host the Late Show next year, the path is clear for John Oliver to take over as the best current events/political comedy show on television.    There was also record low voter turnout this year. We haven't had voter turnout this low since World War II. You can't complain about kicking all the bums out and simultaneously sit at home on election day.   The underlying issue is that access to voting in America is not easily accessible. You have to increase the hours of voting, and place more polling stations in higher population density, low-income, urban neighborhoods to truly address the issue. I'll cite a purely anecdotal example, myself, I leave work at 5:30 and then have to take a train   a bus home, leaving me just 45 minutes to vote after I get home. I got it done, but I imagine if I had to wait in line, instead of simply walking into my suburban polling station.    Its cause us Americans are so fat.    There's no one to police the police.    What I'd like to know is why Matt Taibbi *really* left Glen Greenwald's *The Intercept*. Back when I had more faith in Greenwald, I was initially excited to see that Taibbi had joined them as well. Then all of a sudden he dropped out from the fledgling news magazine last week, without writing one article. I wonder what happened behind the scenes between Taibbi   Greenwald ?    Why not just sentence them to death at this point ?    TL;DR ?   The answer is 14, 14 countries, that we've either bombed or occupied since 1980.  The definition of insanity truly is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.    Nah, I wish.   If you're referring to the fact that he used a screenshot of my submission from /r/conspiracy about censorship on /r/worldnews, I did let out a tiny, audible squeal when I saw that. I can't believe that something I submitted to /r/conspiracy made the CorbettReport. If just goes to show you that even James Corbett realizes blatant censorship when he sees it.    Stories like this make my blood boil. The same thing happened [just this past September as well.]( http://www.mintpressnews.com/video-baby-taken-parents-father-admitted-using-marijuana-murdered-foster-care/197034/)  	180
 Takes 3 zephyr hits to kill from full health w/o flak armor... So, you must be counting wrong    No! Everyone is perfectly fine with Nerfing weapons that aren't op, simply because a user, or several, have learned to use the weapon to its full potential.  Nerf the velocity of the rockets, and/or significantly decrease the damage. This weapon was here for the noobs, it should be a way for them to slightly increase their dps since their aim with nose gun will be bad.  - reduce cost to 250 certs  - reduce damage significantly - reduce velocity slightly   Try using a headset, they are louder then gals   I'd call hax, but ur in BLNG. That lib gameplay was beautiful.   Makes sense... Cause humans are animals   Server is up, you will have IP on Sunday when I'm back, and I can talk to you and explain some things.   I'm on vacation this week, but if you are interested, I am looking for some staff for a modern city rp server   I wonder when infantry side will realize that vehicles aren't op, you need to get good before they are effective.   Age? Experience?    What....a...fucking...idiot   Well, ever since that one terrorist event thy happened at those towers; I think a plane hit them or something. I'm sure you will know what I'm talking about, I can't seem to remember the date. Anyways, after the whole plane crash, security has become an upmost priority in the US   Last time I read this story, she disrupted class by shouting bless you.  Unless this information is wrong, this is why she got suspended.   Team viewer should work... Crappy fps though   The problem with g2a lockons is when you dive from flight ceiling after spotting a g2a enemy ESF. You engage in combat with that ESF, however, you have no friendly AA, and a HA locks onto you. Losing 1/3 of your health in mere seconds while in a dogfight is ridiculous. Unless you have great aim, and can quickly take out your target, and are dead.  There are situational exceptions, such as a valley to hide behind on Indar. And whatever else have you, but on continents like esamir, you are screwed. The chances of successfully running away from an ESF are slim.  It would be nice to have a "fix all." As everything has little versatility. In a place where there is an enemy ESF farming your faction, and it is a small fight an no one or one person is countering the ESF, it would be nice for aa lockons to do a bit more damage.      You obviously had some trouble thinking this through on a logical level. I understand if you hate logic, but we have to use it.  If the vehicle is at a stop, the repair rates are the same as getting out and repairing. The vehicle will still lose health, it will just save time getting in and out.  I truly hope your comment was a work of sarcasm, and not sheer stupidity.      If they remove termals, then they should remove any form of g2a, as it will be OP   Trucking was much better 1-2 decades ago. Gas prices have risen a lot, which has a huge impact on profit.   Darwin's theory of survival of the fitted has just been tested once more.  Feel sorry for the sister...   I wish this was my car... No cop would want to search my car; they would be too terrified that I would start preaching.   I don't follow... What has too little information? Wh-- I don't see your argument for this change...   Within last 2 months. I took a break from ESF s, and came back to libs. I noticed the change when vetting my vanguard    The base designs are the problem! Vehicles should be hard to kill, and you should be rewarded when you pull one, because they cost time, and resources.   I used then like a month ago and they were 350   Thermal optics were great for finding enemy vehicles on Hossin. At 350m, I though the range was short, but I deemed it a tradeoff, and accepted it.   At this point however, at 180m, thermal optics are practically useless. Why don't you just fly low and find vehicles that way? Because I don't like AP rounds up my ass, thats why....   Why does the community feel like pushing SOE to nerf things that are in a good state?    Scrin had a valid point. Why should an invisible player be able to do damage to a vehicle? Make Max vehicle render range 300 then, or make infantry render at current vehicle render range...   I don't get why people bitch about stuff killing them... Maybe it is because I have 1000+hrs of Dayz?  If you get killed somewhere, more than once, by an HE tank, don't go there?? Get a vehicle and kill them??  Why is it that you have to shout "nerf" whenever you die?   Call out their position in region chat for other pilots....   As long as they aren't over Ukraine, there isn't any serious danger...   Or... Destroy their nukes ;)   Why are these 'rebels' so dumb. Why would a Ukrainian military transport be flying 6 miles in the air, into Russia? Are the Ukrainians invading Moscow to take Russia now?  Fucking common sense    But there is a risk. When you have an ai weapon, you are going to get wrecked if you get attAcked by any ESF, or a tank.   Uhhhh... Lib OP! PLZ nerf higby!!!! /s   That aim was beautiful!   It's basically certain-death...   I have a better one: 5 reavers with tomcats.....   Clearly this is the result of piracy!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdFmyQkYOxs  There we go haha.

The study found that two long wavelength (infrared) photons with the same wavelength striking the retina about the same time can be perceived as one photon with half that wavelength and therefore in the visible range.  So it would *look* like normal visible light.  The color would depend on the wavelength of the two infrared photons.

Even if funded, I have my doubts that this product will behave as shown in the video in the near future.   Good work sto-ifics42.  Are you an engineer by chance?    Your eyes don't see ultraviolet (UV) light and this frequency is most damaging to your retina since there is much higher energy per photon. Yes the visible light (along with UV) from the sun is substantially dimmed by haze and reducing the time looking at the sun lowers the risk, but damage can be done to your eyes before you know it as the haze subtly clears. You might be safe but do you feel lucky?     You're walking a very fine line of safety with your eyesight.   Estes FTW!  I had many enjoyable launches and (more than I would like to admit) crashes using Estes rockets. The real crowd pleaser during my 7th grade rocket club was my Estes Saturn V rocket with 4 engines.  Unfortunately only two engines ignited, and even more unfortunately the ones that ignited were not diagonally opposed but adjacent engines.  The result was a launch that went from vertical to horizontal then started dipping downward, ending with a parachute ejection into the ground.  I will not forget the applause to this day and that was 44 years ago.     Thank you, I need to check out the SoundLink Mini.   How does it compare in sound quality to the Big Jambox? Or is it more comparable to the original Jambox?   How about a Mac mini upgrade - it's been 2 years.   Here's CNET's take on why the auction was terminated:   http://www.cnet.com/news/alleged-iphone-6-prototype-ebay-auction-ends-with-no-sale/  TL;DR  CNET speculates Apple asked for or demanded the return of the phone and the seller complied.    The "prototype iPhone 6" reached a peak bid of $100,100.  I revisited the site around 5 pm PDT on Oct 6 and the item was no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended. The seller must've pulled the phone off the market.  Sounds pretty suspicious.   Interesting, just went back to the site and the item is no longer available ... two days before the auction was to have ended.  Sounds like the guy pulled it off the market.  Sounds even more suspicious now.    And it took out Touch ID.   Yeah, I think 8.0.1 was the shortest lived iOS update in Apple history.   You must be prescient.   Pretty sure the video was intended to be humorous.    Thanks, makes sense.      After a little reading it appears the most currently favored cosmological model for the universe's expansion is the Lambda-CDM model where Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy dominate the energy-density of our universe (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model). This model appears to support observations that our universe's expansion is accelerating, although I can't determine what the model predicts for the end state of the universe, but it does not support a Big Rip as you indicated.  However, if the acceleration of the universe's expansion is left unchecked, it would appear the Lambda-CDM theory model is inconsistent with the theory proposed by Dr. Padilla and the resulting Big Crunch.  Am I missing something here?   I thought it was an interesting theory, but I'm dubious. The theory Dr. Padilla describes directly contradicts the generally accepted theory that the universe's expansion is accelerating and the end result will be a Big Rip (where even subatomic particles are torn apart due to the expansion of space) rather than a Big Crunch.   Comment by Mr. Rhodes:  "We've shown time and again that if there's a counterterrorism threat, we'll take direct action against that threat if necessary."  He must've meant terrorism threat.   That happened to me as well.  I restarted the process and it worked quickly the second time.   Thank you AlecPeters for injecting facts and some first-hand information into this thread. You and the team are doing a great job securing funding for Axanar. Can't wait for it to be completed.   Live streaming of ISEE-3 lunar flyby in progress now.   Good on ya jacobgold!  What is planned for the lunar flyby tomorrow?   Not clear from this article.  All they say is   Through various partnerships and reverse engineering engagements, Fox-IT and FireEye have ascertained many of the private keys associated with CryptoLocker.    That must be a new rule.  I've submitted my own titles before to /r/technology without any issue.  I'll be careful to use the exact title in the future. Thanks for the heads up.   Thank you for the clarification Ghoda.  I wasn't aware of that detail on Rosetta's orbit.  Are you involved with the Rosetta mission?    This is a result of particle/wave duality.  Quantum theory says that energy carried by a field (or wave) can be broken down no further than its quantum component.  In other words, all fields have a corresponding minimum energy particle and vice versa.  It's like the difference between the electromagnetic field and the photon.  They're the same but exhibit field (wave) behavior or particle behavior depending on how they are observed.   Wish I could give that two up-votes.    They may also want to map and characterize the comet's surface from many different aspect angles before they land.   Favorite line from the article:  ... bar Yahoo and of course Bing, which rather embarrassingly had to volunteer to be included in the whole affair ...  Poor Bing.

Please, if you can, show me a screen cap of this. I'm a tech savvy person. I never saw anything resembling an option to use updated/custom rosters      Nope. I tried like 10 times. The option never comes up like it does in offline mode. The only option is whether I want to start season or start fantasy draft.    Yea, I'm still not sure about Bethancourt at the plate. He's still young so hopefully that contact rate can improve. And BJ certainly can't be worse...right?? And I wouldn't put CJ anywhere near exceptional on the defense meter. Fangraphs has him well into the negative in defensive rating every year of his MLB career   Same kind of thing as that...just keep plugging into different sources.

Yea. there's still not a ton of power down there.   Yea, Keith said he thinks Braves just turned a bottom-5 system into a top 10 system this offseason.    I don't think the FO wanted to run the risk of showing Gattis anymore, especially with no protection in the lineup. If he had a poor first half of the season...goodbye all value. I think it was the right move now. As Brad Pitt/Billy Beane said in Moneyball, "when you get the answer you're looking for, hang up."   Did everyone watch this team last year? Can we all remember for a second how putrid this offense was? With Gattis on it. 2nd fewest runs in baseball and roughly 87345763 strikeouts. Gattis' platoon splits are not good, his defense is terrible, and he was a great story that mashed home runs versus lefties with ease. It was magical 2 years ago when he hit all those game-tying and go ahead homers. Magical. But let's not kid ourselves. This isn't trading Gretzky in his prime. It's trading a home run specialist, whose main position is the same as your top prospect, in a time where you need to juice up the farm system. It's a win for the Braves.    9 fedoras.   There's a million threads on /r/boardgames about sleeves. Just run a search. Places like Michaels, JoAnne fabrics, Hobby Lobby etc all have card sleeves for dirt cheap.   Because if we stop debating them and allow their voices to go unopposed and uneducated, then they begin to win and continue to push a biased, uninformed and harmful agenda. So please, do not stop arguing with anti-vaxxers.   *Shitrish    From this write up, it would seem a great haul. I don't know much about any of these guys. To be fair, Law has never been a big Gattis fine, sighting his K rate, awful defense and platoon splits, so he'd probably see any decent return as a windfall for Braves   at 16 bricks of 12.4 kg each, and a current rate $1,260.80 USD per ounce, that's $8,042,275.20 USD of gold   [This is a list on BGG of games with solo variants](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/49479/soloplay-variants-posted-geek)   It's insider so I copied the text below. [Here's the link](http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/keith-law/post?id=3225 ex_cid=InsiderTwitter_Law_GattisTrade)  In dealing a trio of prospects for Evan Gattis, I really don't understand what the Astros are doing. The prospect depth they have in their system could allow them to acquire a player of a much higher caliber than Gattis, preferably a younger one as well, someone who's going to contribute to the next good Astros team in a few years. Atlanta, meanwhile, has gone from a bottom-five system in baseball to likely a top-10 system, overhauling their major-league roster while adding a broad mix of near- and long-term talent to their farm, in this case trading a player somewhere near the apex of his value for a very strong return.   Gattis is already 28 years old, coming back to pro ball late after several years of off-field problems, and he brings four years of control. In two not-quite-full major-league seasons, he's shown big power, poor defense, horrible on-base skills, and huge platoon splits -- killing lefties but posting a .241/.297/.469 line against right-handers with enormous problems against right-handed breaking stuff. While Houston's a good ballpark for dead-pull right-handed power hitters, he's virtually positionless and doesn't address the Astros' major needs for hitters who get on base or at least make more contact. He's also disappeared in the second half in both of his years in the majors -- whether due to physical wear and tear or inability to make in-season adjustments -- and his body isn't durable. He's probably a bench guy, or a platoon player, but not a full-time solution at any position. The Astros also pick up James Hoyt, a hard-throwing (93-97 mph) right-hander that Atlanta signed from an independent league for $500 after the 2012 season, a good bet to provide some value in middle relief right away.   In exchange for Gattis, Atlanta gets three prospects with question marks, but all of whom are legitimate major-league prospects with real asset value today. Mike Foltynewicz is the big get, and I would have traded Gattis for him alone. Folty is a high-beta prospect with the upside of a potential No. 1 starter if he can develop a more consistent arm slot and find an average third pitch to go along with an 80 fastball and 70 curveball. He drops down on the fastball at times and comes back up to get depth on the curveball, a trick that major-league hitters will exploit. His changeup will show plus, and ditching his slider (which he did early in 2014) may help him spend more time working on the change, but the change isn't good enough now to keep lefties from sitting on his four-seamer. Drafted in the first round in 2010, he's never seen the DL, and has the size and frame to be a durable 200-inning starter. His floor is a Nate Eovaldi type, and he'd be a wipeout reliever, but Atlanta has to develop him as a starter and hope the changeup comes along to the point where he can lead their rotation in 2017.   Third baseman Rio Ruiz has developed nicely as a hitter, showing outstanding patience -- his walk rate put him among the top 10% of minor-league hitters this year, even though he was just 20 in a high-A league. Lancaster is a tremendous place to hit, however, and his power output was a little light given his home environment. He has good natural feel to hit and much of his contact is hard, but his load is getting too deep with his weight too much on his back side, interfering with his timing and reducing his ability to drive the ball out. At third base, he has the hands and arm, but he lacks rhythm in his feet and the ball tends to play him unless he's coming in on it; he has a chance to play at third, although it's at least 50/50 that he moves to first. Unlike a lot of young left-handed hitters, he has no real problem facing lefties. He projects as something similar to what Matt Carpenter has become for the Cardinals -- a high-OBP doubles hitter, a little less glove, a little more pop -- if he can stay at the hot corner.   Andrew Thurman was a command right-hander when the Astros took him out of UC-Irvine in the second round in 2013, then started hitting 95-96 in spring training last year, only to head to the cold weather of the Midwest League and struggle with his control. He'll pitch with a 55 fastball and shows three potentially average or better secondary pitches, but nothing is plus and he has to throw strikes to succeed. I still like him as a potential fourth or fifth starter, but that assumes that he can harness his newfound velocity and stop walking guys. Of the three guys Atlanta got back in this trade, he has the lowest ceiling and the lowest probability, the latter due to his difficulty against low-A hitters last season.   There's a good chance Atlanta walks out of this deal with an above-average starting pitcher and an everyday third baseman, which would be a heck of a return for a flawed player like Gattis. The Astros get four years of control of Gattis, and if they choose to use him behind the plate on occasion, the acquisition might free them up to trade one of their many catchers ... but is this the kind of player the Astros should be trying to acquire right now? They're not contenders this year, probably not in 2016, and by 2017 Gattis will be turning 31 and past peak, which we've probably already seen. I have no objection to the Astros trading from their passel of prospects to add real major-league talent, but they should be aiming higher than an OBP sinkhole who doesn't add value on defense. Foltynewicz is well-regarded throughout the industry, and I think he could have headlined a package for a much better player, now or during the 2014 season.   I did all that. It gives me that option for an offline franchise, but not an online franchise       Go to Roster, then slide over to "retire"    Well, I misread that title at first.

[NOOOOO](http://www.baltimorenewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Luke-Noooooo.jpg)   Can...can I get Five Tribes from you?   try meetup.com. I know my area has several groups coordinated through meetup that gather at various bars or cafes to play board games.    My only tip would be to all play as humans. Keeps everything even throughout the players and lets you get the understanding of the game. and ass /u/Show-Me-Your-Moves said, don't add house rules before you play the game. I've played lots of Eclipse and have never removed missiles and it's not a big deal. Sometimes someone gets missiles early, sometimes they come out real late. Sometimes someone gets a bunch of awesome discovery tiles and you don't. Things balance out during the game and each game unfolds differently.    I think the general sentiment isn't about having to go into a walmart, but supporting their business in general.    Well didn't you just buy it from them?   Boo walmart   Spector Ops looks preeetty sweet. Hearing good things on Spirits of The Rice Paddy as well. And I don't know if they'll allow it, but if you can snag a pre-order discount on the upcoming printing of Dead of Winter, do that too.       [**Acquire**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5/acquire)    Are the Egyptians and Japanese actually much harder than the others?   Only in a board game thread is that ok to ask.    **King of New York** is not a reprint. It's basically a sequel. Or a standalone expansion of King of Tokyo. And it's better than KoT. More strategy, more interaction, more decisions, more destruction, more fun.    The Secret Cabal podcast is my favorite. They release new episodes the 2nd Wednesday of every month, each episode is 2-3 hours so you get a lot of content. They do a great mix of talking about games they played that week, reviewing 1 game at length each episode, going over news and updates in the board game world, and if you're into RPG stuff, they talk about that too. They do contests occasionally too. It's good stuff   I think it's just as cool for people who don't know a lot about the Cold War, because the game organically teaches you so much about it. You're playing the game as you see history unfold.    The box art is pretty bland, but the board is gorgeous, and the cards are very nice as well. The game is just so incredibly balanced and the theme is absolute perfection. It very much is a 'struggle' as every decision you make has a big impact and many of those decisions you make may very well benefit your opponent. It's all about doing your best to minimize what you give your opponent and maximize what you do and score as best as possible. It is a masterpiece.    Ha, that's true. I guess I was just referring to the box size.   Yea, I feel you. What about taking a look at some scores from Cold War movies like Dr. Strangelove, Good Night   Good Luck, Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy, Hunt For Red October or the TV show The Americans.    I wondered to myself "I wonder what I'll find if I google 'cold war music." [This is what I found. Everything is on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_about_the_Cold_War).

Cities   Knights is probably the most popular expansion (i think?).    Overall, in /r/boardgames, you're going to find a lot of Catan hate (and some love). It's such a popular game, a lot of people got their board game start playing it, and playing it to death, before moving on to games with much more strategy and depth.    How old is your son? Ticket To Ride is a great intro game. Other games like Carcassonne or Dominion are easy enough to pick up, but off a ton of depth in strategy and replayability. Splendor is a new hotness that's simple, fun and strategic. Takenoko is a big hit with my gf who hates board games. It's a light, fun, beautiful game, and has a similar hexagonal tile element.

Finally got it to the table last night and I loved it! Played two 2 player games, then a 4 player game. Works wonderfully with both. Quick, super easy to pick up and still some good strategy and decision making to be done. The 'reserve a card' option is a neat twist.    The ios app is phenomenal as well. Especially if you're playing solo, saves you all the time of setting it up just for yourself.    The Agricola solo variant is great.   Wears down the surrounding area to even out surface. Then paint over.    What if it's obvious where it would be. For instance, went to my girlfriend's apartment and the person that lives in the next apartment who I've met twice (and is super friendly) clearly didn't remember me and introduced himself to me. Even after I said "hey Michael." Just didn't want to give him the "yea, we've met before."       Ditto this. I've played 2p with just the bottom section. That was better. Otherwise it's just two people playing by themselves in the same game. Map is way too big for 2 players. My favorite game of all time though.   JoAnne's. Michaels. Hobby Lobby. Amazon. Dollar store.    Uggla gets a lot of hate here (deservedly so, he was awful), but I always liked him and I'll always root for him. He never pouted, he showed up every day, and he always booked it to first on easy ground balls. I hope he catches on somewhere outside of the NL East and does well.    I can only speak for Agricola here...it's tough to get people into Agricola that aren't into heavy euros. Agricola is hard. If people are new to games (or only know settlers, ticket to ride or pandemic), it's a tough leap. There are more complex games, but Agricola just really beats you up, ya gotta make sure people like worker placement euros where you may feel like you didn't do shit for the last 6 turns. That said, I love Agricola. I'll play with you!   my monitor goes up to 255. HP Compaq LA2205wg. I have no idea if any of that means it's good   My work computer won't allow me to download flux.

Any recommendations on the RGB settings on the monitor to help with this?   8 hours?! Yeesh. Even with rule checking etc, sounds like you guys have a lot of analysis paralysis. I own the game, and have never had a game go over 4 hours. My recommendation: agree to a shot clock. Don't sit in the headline phase for 5 minutes agonizing over which event card to play or where to place influence etc. Set a time limit that you'll both agree to stay within to the best of your ability. And that should organically work out anyway as you get more comfortable with the game and what cards will be coming.    I just bought Shadow of Mordor and started the campaign last night, for a couple hours. It seems from the opening cuts that I, and my family, was killed. Now I'm just running around killing Uruk.

Yea, I just don't really want to spend $300 on something I'll use once a month or once every few months.       I'd give it a whirl. My grandparents are devour US History or Art History. My grandmother is a painter and illustrator and adores the french and dutch masters. Most of the books you'll find in their house or biographies of painters, US Presidents, Churchill, WWI, WWII or events revolving around one of those topics. I like to add to that passion and collection each Christmas.    They would not be into that, but I appreciate the thought.    I don't read a ton of non-fiction, but I do read a few a year. Every Christmas I get my grandparents a non-fiction work (lots of presidential biographies, McCollough, Kearns-Goodwin, painter bios) but this year as I walk around Barnes   Noble, all I can seem to find are celebrity memoirs or Bill O'Reilly books.

It goes up to 6 and is loads of fun. I've used it a ton as a fun gateway game to people who aren't into board games at all and it's always a hit.    **Dead of Winter.**   It is an overall cooperative game. You need to complete the main objective together. However, everyone also has a secret objective (none, one or some of which may be a betrayal objective) that each person needs to attempt to complete so they can individually win. It adds a lot of tension, suspicion between players (you never know if anyone has a betrayal objective or how many people may).

There are 5 sets of finely sculpted custom plastic trains, each featuring a different type of train car and unique paint scheme reminiscent of toy trains of yesteryear."   and from BGG:  Contents: * 1 Giant Board map of North American train routes with all new illustrations  * 5 Tin Boxes, each with 48 finely sculpted trains  * 5 Wooden Scoring Markers  * 1 Multilingual Rules Booklet  * 110 Train Cards with all new illustrations  * 30 Classic Destination Tickets  * 35 Destination Tickets from USA 1910  * 4 Destination Tickets from Mystery Train  * 1 Longest Route/Globetrotter Bonus card       Stephen Yuen the ladies panties.   I would not have been surprised if that was real.   	125
 Nor should he resign. People called Bush a monkey all the time and yet I heard few calling for them to resign. Calling people ugly or insulting them is nothing new, get over it and get a thicker skin.             Disagreeing with someone on the interpretation of something doesn't give you the right to assault them. Imagine if you and I disagreed on something, does that give me the right to attack you with physical violence? Of course it doesn't. It is a shame that the left supports violence when it suits their causes and denounce it when it doesn't.      	6
 Not to detract from Unidan's greatness but I'm pretty sure it's a Simpson's quote.   My fraternity house is literally a minute walk away from the stadium for Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a ton of people would drive by it to park on gameday. We would stand out in the road(not blocking traffic obviously) with a beer and a sign saying you honk we drink and basically every car that went by would honk. Whenever cops would roll by all the time and do their little *woop woop* siren and we would finish the can. It was awesome.  I was also only 18 at the beginning of this and looked about 16 so basically the cops didn't give a fuck/   I don't think it's RES, if you open a incognito window and paste the image link in to get it to load again it still happens. Must be something to do with the website   I seriously want to know the answer to this question. Were you using RES as well?   Pulling the old Sir John A. Macdonald, only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments.    One famous story is that during an election debate Macdonald was so drunk he began vomiting violently on stage while his opponent was speaking. Picking himself up Macdonald told the crowd, "see how my opponent's ideas disgust me."  In another version of the story, he responded to his opponent's query of his drunkenness with "It goes to show that I would rather have a drunk Conservative than a sober Liberal.".   You're correct, thank you. I believe everyone should unequivocally be treated with respect unless they do something making them lose it. I am just curious but you're right there really is no way to explain the whole gender spectrum, it just is.   Go the fuck away   I've never understood the term gender fluid. I 100% believe that due to brain chemistry, hormones, etc. some people who were born one sex feel like the other. I'm not saying I don't believe that people are actually gender fluid and feel like different sexes at different times, I just don't understand at all what would cause this.   I want the world to know   Not even just his stuff haha... OP got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car.   Remeber that time you got my car stolen? None of this surprises me at all   I'm pretty sure what he was thinking about, something to do with a copious amount of drugs.   This is the same kid that got my car stolen by leaving my keys in my unlocked car outside a party in a sketchy area. Luckily I found my car at 7AM next morning parked just around the corner from where I had parked it. The keys were sitting **on my hood** in plain view so I guess someone had a fun joyride in it. Somehow he always gets super luckily with the dumb shit he does.   I'm just guessing here but I bet the reasoning is to try to prove they're an "alpha" male not a push-over pussy "beta". Combine that with the severe social ineptitude that these people are bound to have and you get this creepy, disturbing shit.   I ashamed to even be able to answer this but its called "negging" and it is the dumbest thing ever, especially for the type of severely socially inept people that the PUA "technique" appeals to.   Don't forget about /r/AnimalPorn ,  all the badass animals of the world together in a sub!   The worst is /r/HumanPorn , it's like whoever creates those subreddits doesn't even think of what the word porn means to most people anymore.    This is a long shot but was it asherons call?   Ich stimme zu.   No he sensationalized it pretty heavily. I can't see anything constructive about adding 2 base pairs to DNA, when life seems to do fine with just 4. Maybe it will give us more choices with amino acids, etc. but considering we can't even really design our own proteins now due to post-translation modifications and not understanding folding and a whole number of other issues.  This is pretty cool I guess but nothing super ground breaking and I believe it implies that we are close to things like designing our own proteins that nature could never design when in actuality we are pretty far away. It also really doesn't seem like this author understands the whole transcription and translation process and how this applies to building proteins  BTW fuck you ryan   Rob Ford for President 2016. fuck the constitution we need him here in the states   So we should just disregard 90% of the community because of your opinion?   But it does bring a group of similar minded people together. I am subscribed to /r/drugs but I never really post there. I will admit sometimes the posts get me cravings to do those drugs but it has not increased my overall drug use at all and is a very knowledgeable and for the most part level-headed community.   I always thought brilliant writers hold most of the cards compared to publishers, especially if they're as established as Fitzgerald(I'm not sure if he was at the time though I guess). I would think he could put whatever he wants in his book but I guess that's not true.    Oh wow yeah! Ba$h was the shit. I remember i would go to his arena(?go bash) and fuck around with him because you had like unlimited repels and thor's and boosts and all the values for the ships were messed around with. It was a lot of fun   For some reason the only name I can remember from back then is Callidus. NO idea why that stuck with me.   So I guess I got butthole gainz wasted last night haha? Don't really remember writing any of this   I can't remember.. can't even remember what squad I was in but it wasn't like a top tier one, maybe second tier squad.   I played dep all the time and could break some ankles as scout too. This is annoying me that I can't think of what my name was but I'm sure it was really dumb, I was 12.   So it's a 2d game where you control various types of ships using only the key board. Tab is shoot rockets, ctrl is bullets. It's basically like that old school asteroids game where you except multiplayer with 8 different types of ships, objectives(CTF, king of the hill, etc.) and ton of different weapons. The objectives on the maps are super fun, the game has a great community and it's really easy to pick up but hard to master. It's definitely worth the 5 minutes it takes to install it and try it out.      Come play. It literally takes 5 mins to dl and install and I'm getting a nostalgia overload. It would also be nice to have a few more people playing.   Fuck that hell no. Moistening is the most female thing I could possibly think of, you gotta do it bareback and dry as the Sahara    Hey so I did a little research to try to find the map files and I found this.   http://www.subspace.co/topic/26130-sscl-metal-gear-ctf-it-was-back-but-now-its-gone-again//   You could probablu try to email someone from that thread and ask.  This was only about 2 years ago so it's relatively recent    The trick is to start shitting a couple times a day for a couple of days. This should be more than you usually do and you may need supplements to reach your shit quota. This is rip your butthole to shread. Now comes the hard part. For the next 2 weeks you are allowed one shit a week. This allows the tissue to heal. After these 3 weeks you will notice some sick gains in your butthole strength. Feel free to post pictures of your technique and I'll take a look at em ;)   Ah, Evolved rings a bell. That was like one of the most elite squads right   I'm actually on EG right now, but I can't figure it out really   Yeah some of those. I just to love fishies and football and the 1v1 tourneys and elim   I changed it! sorry about that it was the first one that popped up on google and it seemed legit.   I'm not sure but I changed it to a different website that has brrn updated more recently just in case   Probably around 02-04. I cant remember my name for the life of me or what guild or whatever it was called i was in. I used to be really good at dep and scout   Yep I'm currently on trench wars getting absolutely massacred    I don't remember what my username was but I do remember callidus was fucking amazing and I would always dep for her. Miss playing soldier too, and the #2 scout damn good days   Sounds like that might have been Trench Wars. People still play, there's usually 60-100 people on and peak times.  Edit: actualy 158 on right now on that server   That's the only server I played for the two years I really played continuum and I just liked it a lot better than Trench Wars or Extreme Game. Maybe I don't know the nuances of those servers well enough but I long to play some metal gear. Does anyone else feel similar?   I know it's awesome. I should have described it more when i made the post but I was too lazy. What servers did you play on? I played Metal Gear CTF   What server? I played metal gear CTF and its so much different I still haven't quite figured out trench wars and that other big server, extreme games maybe?   I have a script for xanax... after all the opiates I've done, benzo's dont really give me much euphoria, a little, but not a lot.   Is it bad that that movie made me want to swindle and manipulate the shit out of people and fuck them over completely in the process so I could get that kind of life and do that many drugs and fuck so many dimes.   Dude it was all about metal gear. I loved that server. It's not up anymore though =(   Oh.. I guess I'm more of a TagAmateur than a Tag pro. I'm only like 15 degrees   And be sure to inject butter directly into your blood stream every 4 hours to alleviate the debilitating emotional pain   Do you think you're better than me? You're a pussy with your pristine asshole than isn't so covered with scar tissue that you can poop in under 2 hours. I laugh at you before you laugh at me   I would periodically move things around their desk around while they are focused on something else. Maybe move a notebook from a drawer onto the desk. Maybe move a pen they just had in their hand onto the other side of the desk. Things that would be physically impossible to happen. This would be very subtle, maybe once or twice a month at most. Gradually I'd start doing more obvious things, like unplugging their monitor or making a stapler fall off their desk for no reason.   Maybe after 6 months of this, I would start writing messages to them, either using a pen and one of their notbooks that is out of sight, or distracting them enough to write something like **LEAVE THIS PLACE** OR **WAKE UP** on their computer. Maybe I would do this with notes or if they are working on something in word, just type it in the middle of their document. Eventually they would begin to doubt their sanity. As they neared the breaking point, if I sensed they we're going ot loose it soon, I would draw dickbutt in paint and tile it as their background. I would then write "turn around" and have a couple hundred thousands dollars in my hand(which I had stolen using telekinesis) and give it to them to maybe make up for the torture.   Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?    I'm currently toughing my asshole up. I started with singly ply and then I found half ply, next the finest grain sand paper available. I gradually increased the grain fineness over the course of the past two years and now I use steel wool and I feel manly as fuck.   It's like that ass pennies sketch. If i ever am uncomfortable around someone I just think their candy ass can't wipe with steel wool, they don't deserve to be in my presence.    Well I(along with many many other people I assume) am a completely different person on the internet than I am in real life. I would never even think about saying anything like that to anyone I know. It's kind of like how you change how you act, even if only a little, depending on the people you're around   COuld I be your unlikely morbid, depressed and callous robot penguin sidekick.   Or you could just spend a dollar or 2 extra to avoid the butthole pillaging altogether.    For each their own... anonymity breeds weirdness   [Continuum](http://www.subspace.co/). Archaic game the is incredibly addicting and fun  Edit: Wish I had put more effort into this post, I feel like it could be much higher up   I seriously think they should make a tagpro type game with a 3d engine. Maybe something a little like LoL, you would have skills(like jukes or spins or sprint) which would be on a cool down. Maybe even different classes(scout, defender, etc.) too but you would move with WASD.  Edit: Just to clarify how I'm picturing it: It would still be CTF. The only way to die would still be running into each other, or maybe some type of special move. Maybe there would be some projectile type attacks you could aim with the arrow keys, but of coursee they would have cooldowns.  Can anyone elaborate on why this would be a bad idea. I don't care of downvotes I'm just curious     To be honestly I was just trying to type the weirdest possible thing I could ala /u/mroglolblo or /u/_vargas_. Just wanted to try it out, had never done it before  If you want to read some stories kinda like that except a millions times better go through mrog's history  Here's a preview I wouldn't want to have sex with the queen but it could be kind of hot if she watched. She has always seemed like she has a "wry" sense of humor and has always struck me as a woman of intense curiosity. How cool would it be to bring a chick back to your place and she sees the queen sitting in a chair in the corner as you frantically undress each other and she stops and says "oh gosh, it's you!" "It is an honor your majesty!" and she awkwardly curtsies while covering her tits with one hand, "charmed my dear, now start fucking!" At first she is really demure and tries to be as tender and "proper" as possible, missionary only etc. and the queen starts shrieking "none of that, when I said start fucking, I meant start FUCKING!!!" and maintains steely eye contact with her   So OP's picture is literally the first one to come up for chinese english tattoo on google image. [Here's the second](http://i.imgur.com/hRGQoJh.jpg)   Plot Twist: His boss is a transvestite and he caught her right after she had finished jackin it.   I mean what I wrote is just as plausible as the OP's story honestly.   Only thing left to do is post this picture of an intimate situation between two people publicly for literally everyone I even kind of know can see it.   That's when you say oh here let me wipe that off for you and pull out your rock hard dick and ever so tenderly get every drop on the tip of your dick.   The moment is finally here! That skill you've been practicing for months, that you've put your life and soul in, it's moment has arrived. You lie down and prepare. Pushing your dick down as far as it will go you steady yourself. Using the cock pushup acquired dick strength, you let her rip. The the cum is shot in a perfect arc right into your own open mouth. A flawless dick catapult. The man juice in your mouth tastes better than ever before, you literally have an orgasm in your mouth.   Heart of Gold   Don't forget to run it under some warm Code Red first.   Wish the same thing could have been said about his pituitary gland :(. He was such an amazing person   Aw. Guess just exorbitant amounts of coke will have to fill the void.   I don't know if I could handle those Zefs there though(unless they look like Yolandi). Are they like the SA version of chavs?   The name roach is very fitting for them   Does this imply most of his novels underwent similar censorship?   You forgot the type a horrible comment step somewhere before exit out.   Watching that movie makes me want to do so many drugs. Does anyone know if ludes were actually as awesome as they make them out to be?   For snorting coke, I'd say the norm is 20-40 mins between lines depending on how much you have   Can you provide proof for any of this? The majority of other posts in this thread seem to say the exact opposite.   I envy you as well. I've got a 5 hours left till my engineering degree and my recent lack of a social life has kind of left me unmotivated to put my all into school. I am on medication of depression and anxiety but I feel some kind of therapy would help but so far the 2 therapists I've seen haven't really helped.   For some reason I read that as conversation... I'm a pretty quite guy and sometimes have trouble holding conversations with  people I don't know well and was just seeing if maybe that type of therapy would help me but I guess some other type of therapy would be much better    7What about the amazonian(I think) fish thing that swims up your urethra when you pee and lodges itself in there.    Can I ask what you symptoms you were treated for.   It seems to be it's just a bit more specific than his earlier claim and meant to clarify.   Of course inflation has a bit to do with it as well.   Who cares? Your'e a fucking dick   I know right. I speak a little German so I understood maybe like half of it but it was like a really weird mix of german and english   Don't forget about your duderuses either.   Do you mean alprazolam? Altrazaplan isn't anything    Yep, I remember reading in biochem that the best internal combustion engine is only around 30-40% efficient in harnessing the energy produced by breaking C-H bonds, while our bodies are 60-70% efficient.   What? That's crazy I live in Texas and it's only around $3.30-$3.50   I found [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/23dyes/recap_the_failed_moderation_and_gaming_of/cgyf5y4) a little while ago... Take it with a grain of salt obviously    Ah I see, didn't catch that   I've tripped more times than I can count and I was want to say you have a really good idea of what it's like for someone who hasn't done it. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, but only in the right environment. It's really just gives you a whole new perspective on things and is quite interesting.   It's still on? I thought it got canceled cause I've only seen a few episodes.   Thank you that's really interesting and I would never notice anything like that. I also appreciate you being so civil cause I honestly don't understand why this question got so much hate.   I never said she looked better with no make up on.. I meant this style of make up. Maybe I didn't word it quite right but this is just ridiculous. I asked a legitimate question I was curious about Sorry for trying to expand my horizons a bit   Haha I'm suprised anyone understood that at all... so many typos damn swype   I think we're not on the same page. I was talking more about the neuroscience part like /u/mroxiful    Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times makes walking very simple but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.    Same. I'm done wasting my time arguing about it, what a waste of 45 minutes.   Thanks, I didn't know about the earlier models but it makes perfect sense.   I guess /r/science spoils me in this regard   Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors which highly influence the life and death of the insect and in turn the strength of the colony.   It obviously is because insects have 6 legs but what I'm trying to say it's not just basic geometry by any means.   Source: Many classes from my biomedical engineering degree and a little bit of critical thinking   Maybe it is that simple, but I'm sure there are other factors at play. Yes 3 legs on the ground at all times is great but what about for walking over things? What about getting away from predators? Etc. Is it the most efficient for all these factors?    Exactly! Many cases.. not all.   Maybe he did and couldn't find anything so he decided to ask the person who was making the claim. I'm willing to bet that's the case actually.  Any critical thinking, scientifically literate person would do the same thing.   I think you are probably right but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's necessarily true, and if it is true it shouldn't be too hard to do a google or google scholar search to provide a source and remove all doubt   I can and I'm sure he can too, but just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's true by any means.    It makes me sad that some people so blindly believe things that they would condescendingly question why you don't.   Do you have any idea what that robotic pack mule was 4 legged and modeled after mammals, than after something like this. Maybe the who size difference and surface area to volume ratio thing?  	108

 Heard of you guys before, where can I read more information? I want to challenge myself to stop masturbating.   I'm No Superman - Scrubs theme tune   Blackpool *shudders*   Recently my SO's sex drive has rock bottomed, and unfortunately mine has been as high as ever, so I do occasionally do it while she's asleep (I'm a guy) and make sure not to wake her (the long slow build up is quite amazing when you finally reach climax).  Awake-wise, when I want to jerk off with her there it usually takes a lot of persuasion, as she says "it's weird" for her to be there, even though I get off on her watching (or kissing me while I do it). So yeah, most of the time I have to find alone time by myself.   So what does define a planet as opposed to a large comet or similar? I mean, I can think of several things that may contribute, but then I can also think of things that would be contrary to those.  Secondary bonus question- how small can a planet be whilst still being a planet (if size is a defining planet factor)?   Pretty much Brisbane to Townsville.   I know you're unsure of specifics, but if you could find and link me I'd be very appreciative!   Looking for a fossicking tour/experience in Queensland around the coast, with the opportunity to find gold/opals/sapphires/any precious stones or pretty minerals (like amethyst).  Thanks!   Looking for opals/gold/sapphires, any precious gems basically (though pretty minerals like the amethyst rocks are also welcome).   The time I felt loneliest? After I'd broken up with my girlfriend of almost 7 years - I went walking around a local park for pretty much an entire day on my own (just because it was the right thing to do didn't make it hard or painful to do!).  The loneliest thing I've ever done is go drinking alone. It's not the greatest past time.   That's crap! The safari zone was ALL ABOUT the bait/rock ratio and a heap of luck!  They have to bring it back for the next generation! Let's start a petition! They have to listen! *marches out of the door*   I remember watching the annual UK space show with Prof. Brian Cox (Stargazing Live) and seeing the director of this project with one cell of this mirror...I'm so excited to see the resulting images we can pull, let alone the actual scientific discoveries.  Just think all we've managed with Hubble!   Oh? Like how?   What happened to these in the most recent generations? Why weren't they included?  I missed them in Black/White   So the Sydney weather forecast for Sunday is bright blue skies and 34 degrees, so the plan is to head for Manly beach.  Last time I went, I got severely burnt, but want to build up some tan, so my question is, what's the best method?  I've got factor 50 on hand for protection, but ideally want to know how long I should spend in the sun before turning over/applying more sun cream, and how long I can spend in the water before needing to reapply it (it says water resistant)?   Has anyone ever had one appear? I know it doesn't count for extra points, but I'm just curious!   Three questions; what's the evolutionary benefit to laughter?  Why does it sometimes feel like it is uncontrollable?  And finally, why does the uncontrollable laughter feel like it originates from your stomach/diaphragm area?   Damn! lol   Anaconda by Niki Minaj...that video is ridiculous.   Like X and Y have been out since Nov '13, and they're still 59.95AUD over here- how long until they lower in price for the new cartridge?   I'm not sexist based on the forms/colours of the pokemon- I just always want a balanced team of three male and three female.      I am, loving travelling and loving spending quality time with her away from the aforementioned pressures!   I like this post for the sheer ego of it.   Hence the qualifying statement "like if you bought an island already"   Like if you bought an island off the coast of Australia or similar, what process would you have to go through to ceed from the Australian Government?   -coordination -balance -accuracy -attention to detail -problem solving -team work   There's a lot! In a nut shell...  Basically my first real relationship started when we were both 14, and lasted for nearly 7 years. During that time we lost our virginity to each other, and after a few years I grew up and she didn't. I deluded myself for four years or so, cheated a lot and hated myself for it, and finally realised I was unhappy with her when I bumped into an old friend. Broke up with her (which was extremely difficult and painful - just because I didn't love her didn't mean I didn't care), and moved away to go to uni.  Met that same self old friend from above at uni and started going out with her. We moved in together for my second and third years, and towards the end of my second year decided to travel to Australia together when I finished.  This meant living frugally and staying with my mum and step-dad to save money, who are very messy and dysfunctional themselves (he doesn't help around the house at all, my little brother is a shit a lot of the time because of their lack of discipline with him) and took most of their arguments/frustrations out on us (not aggressively, just passively). Due in part to this and having to live frugally we grew apart a little, or at least settled into a rut.  Fast forward to a month before we are due to leave, and I find messages on her phone to another guy arranging a meet up at a hotel room with him. She promised that she'd not talk to him again, and less than a week later I found out she had an was STILL planning it.  I basically plummeted health-wise from the stress and worry, and lost all appetite - couldn't manage more than a tiny meal a day, and begged her repeatedly not to do this to us, and she didn't in the end, and cut all ties.  Fast forward to now, and we're in Australia, away from the stuff that intruded in our life in the first place, and I'm a lot happier but still very paranoid/worried about what will happen when we get back to real life and the stresses involved with getting jobs and somewhere to live etc.   Phew. Told you it was long.   I'd love to talk about my old relationship, my current relationship and the relationship between them.   Told a girl I loved them.   *there (because grammar is important)   I'd argue that, much like the moon missions, interstellar travel would teach us a lot more by just giving it a go then just spending years and billions experimenting and researching.  Build a giant colony ship, gather a few thousand volunteers and a few hundred soldiers to police and guard everyone, and go go gadget long-ass-journey!!   Run your ass off yo!   I wouldn't. It means a lot to me.   I believe that there is SOMETHING more than us, not necessarily an old guy who controls everything and a heaven/hell, but at least some kind of alien being that is more in another dimension/plane of reality than this one (if in this one at all).   I think that the body decays, the spirit however I have no idea about. I can honestly say though that I'm not scared of dying- I'm scared of the pain that could occur the moments leading up to death, but I'm genuinely interested to know where my consciousness will go (if it goes anywhere) afterwards.   *recollection (because spelling IS serious)   Either flea-powerful jumping or gecko-grip, I'd love to run up walls.  Hell, make me spider-man!!   I'd go with both (this is with no research at all by the way). Cancer is a mutation, so it's natural that the longer we exist the more mutations that will happen, and diagnoses have gotten more accurate.   "I'm fine"  And  "I don't mean to insult you but..."   Someone beat me to the Christianity ribbing, so I'll go with the fact that we never went to the moon.   We saw a lot of these in Sydney at New Years- they're so that people can get more background/friends into the picture with them.  	42
 PS I'm from Aus, we bastardise the language the most.   Now you're just being silly, France would quit that battle within minutes.  Colour  Color   Does the same to me with Z. Chrome is confused.   Lol.  You Americanised the English language.   You see how I used an s in Americanised?  REAL English.  Vapour.   Any episode with Dale is a great episode.  One of my favourite Dale quotes about Bill when Dale took all of his money "Bill would've just spent it all on something stupid, like himself"   Oh, you're bald.. And my the attractive type of bald.   Use actual english and not American English and you'll be fine.  Vapour.   I was always told that a 'poor man always pays twice' which is so true.  If you skimp out on a product, you'll be paying for another one very soon.    Thank you!   Which ep was this? I vaguely remember it..   /r/dadjokes would love you over there, you sick freak   Video has been removed, any other links out there?  Edit:  Larry Stogner News Reporter Announces ALS Diagnosis   retires on LIVE TV...: http://youtu.be/mDeQ1IU8QFM   I started on Liqua as well, damn its a horrible juice once you figure out what else is out there.  Buy your juice locally if you want to, I use Steam E-Cigs in Sydney, then go to nicvape.com and buy your nicotine.  Mix it up yourself dude and you'll never go back, you'll enjoy great tasting juices and can make them as strong or weak as you want.  Careful with liqua as there are a lot of fakes out there.   In Aus Dairy Milk is classified as bottom end as well, in my opinion it shits all over the expensive competition.   Dairy Milk that's on the border of melting is the bomb.   This was posted  a year ago, still made me laugh now like I did then.  Don't bother we watching the whole movie, its beyond shit.   That stupid HTC bar is still there taking up real estate pointlessly   Fucking Strobe.. Best track released by far.   Mooooooooom!!   If anything, the guy filming is a total douche.  Get the fuck out and see if the driver is ok, instead of just filming him   Great to see a fellow Aussie tackling the tech world. Keep it up bud   That's a Nexus 5? Great idea though mate, but if any phone needs it, its the Nexus 5.. At least you can get 64gb on the Nexus 6   Depending on where you live and who you are, this could be a good and a bad thing   How come your pillow is so shitty compared to hers?   A lot of these publications still have old writers employed that think it's still 2008.  They have an iPhone and never used anything else   Bingo.. Very well put mate   Don't worry, eventually sex becomes overrated. It becomes a chore.  I now completely understand why Al Bundy used to groan and moan about it.   No probs, some juices do it faster than others   5% of the worlds population pick their nose for sexual gratification.   Holding your pee in and then that awesome feeling of releasing it, is 5% of the feeling of an orgasm   Dude.. Your phone is on silent, it's doing what you've told it to do.. Be silent.  Try using a free trial of Poweramp, I think from memory that paused music.. And it's a shit load better than the base music app   She looks tougher than most male cops I've seen.  She'll fuck you up!   A couple things here mate..  The juice has nicotine in it, as your tank is not airtight, the nicotine is oxidising, this makes it go brown.  The other thing that might happen is that the cotton or wick is so dirty in old coils, it may discolour your juice a little.  My first scenario would be the main cause though    Be careful.. Adrenalin is a hell of a thing, if you're in a heated fight, your opponent might be buzzing with adrenalin, that ball kick will be useless..   Not to say it won't hurt like hell an hour later though.   She squeezed a box in her.. Box?    Well maybe that's what the beheading is about.. No one really eats the head I guess..   Brand identity? Blackberry? Not a anymore..    "Ohh I like the new camera that Sony has released, I'll pick up the block next week"   No need to change the whole phone, just change the camera module.  In a world of so much waste, you'll actually now keep Your phone for 2 years + as you will just change the pieces as you need to.  Removable batteries are back!   The 2 finger pull down reveals the whole settings section of the phone once again.   http://youtu.be/DnJsv46c8rw  Documentary I'm watching about it.  Being Aus, we have heaps of places similar to this but they're easy to avoid..  Anywhere extreme west of Sydney or anywhere with a large aboriginal population is a no-go zone   My Aspire Nautilus always used to gurgle and definitely muted the flavour production. Even with the holes opened full pelt the vapour was low compared to the standard Kanger tanks you get with the starter kit.   Later versions may have fixed these issues, but for me, it sits in a cupboard and gathers dust.  I should be thankful, the Nautilus is what pushed me over the edge to try mechanical mods and start building my own Kayfuns.   100000000000%   Piece of shit, ugly ass looking tank, with no flavour or vapour.    ABCDEFGHIJKRMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ   Could also be the top of a foreskin   There's another Babka?   The fact that you fell for this is brilliant   My Muslim mate married a Catholic Italian girl.. He eats pork, he loves it.  Everyone loves pork.   Dogs aren't stupid.. He knew what you were doing in there.   Can it be changed to 18490 or is it an 18650 tube only?   Clip your nose hairs Al, it looks like a giant squid is trying to reach out and take the kids   Shazam / SoundHound no good?  Hmm hmm hiiiiiiim..   Leave the title as is, we all knew what you meant, but it still gave us a laugh.   From personal experience, start of with an evod kit to see if you even enjoy Vaping / Gaping.  Kanger products for a first timer are great, there are a lot of fakes out there so make sure you buy from someone reputable.  The aspire Nautilus is a heap of shit, ugly, massive, tasteless, tank.   If I hadn't smashed mine out of anger I would've sent it to you for free.   You're the 3 J's - a Jew, a Ginger, and you're from Jersey.   Strike 3 Kyle!    I'm thinking it's something else system based, my nexus 5 started doing this after 5.0.1   If only the babies head wasn't in the way..   According to my chrome dome, no, no it doesn't.   I have an iPad air 2 from work and the nexus 9 that I bought myself..   As much as I hate iOS, the iPad is definitely better in all other aspects.   Even the front facing speakers aren't too crash hot   Err.. They look like mother and daughter.. As long as she's over 18, all power to you.   March 6th is my 1 year anniversary since quitting analogs.   Started when I was 14, am now 30, this is the longest I've ever stopped smoking, and to be honest, there's no chance of heading back.   Samsung has a better one called the SBasket, Apple doesn't invent everything you fanboy. /sarcasm   Can confirm, 30 year old here and already had New Years last night.. 2am we all packed up shop and hit the hay.   Was a good night.   Well, the cover / magic case, is a heap of shit / 10   Folio Cover is what they're usually called? No?    I hate you so much you brilliant man / woman!  Where we're you a week ago!  Thank you so much mate, ordered!   Annnnnnnd its out of stock  :)   So, I just received the folio today from Google, and bought the indigo colour.  Colour is beautiful, not too bright, not too extravagant, just a nice mint / blue mixture, like putting toilet blue in an algae infested pond.  The fit: This is where it fails miserably, it does everything you want an original cover not to do.  1) it doesn't sit on the device properly, it constantly moves and shuffles over the device.  2) the magnets are WEAK. It will constantly fall and pull off as you use it.   3) the folding of the rear tabs will almost certainly pull it off the device.  4) for what you're getting, its expensive.  The good.  1) If you leave it in the TV watching position and don't touch it at all, it works fine.  2) Google ships it in a box that can fit 80 of these cases in there, it won't feel suffocated or uncomfortable in the box during shipping.   Overall Score: 3/10  Edit - Nexus 9 Smart Cover: http://youtu.be/vW_0F6UYOu4  I added a video of it.   I love my Nexus 9, not sure I'd recommend it though.  Its like Google found the perfect way to piss me off this year.  Release a 9 inch HTC tablet : shit build quality, shit screen bleed, shit price, the shittest folio cover and shit screen flickering.  Release a new phone: make it gigantic and unusable with one hand. Make it overly expensive.  Google this year has pissed me off   Good find.  All you need to find now are those blue shipping containers    Ha! When I couldn't find tape, I'd jam rolled up balls of paper on there.   And they're ripping / on-selling steam e-cigs juices and naming of the juices..  That's a shit effort.    Can't help with Juice at this stage, but steam e-cigs in Roseberry is a good B M to shop at, and its about 15 mins out of the city. Relatively close to train stations as well.   I didn't realize pagers still even existed    You in Aus?   This is why we also have /r/nsfwmomoftheyear   According to Google, they release stock every Wednesday   So now I have a video of a tranny dancing in my YouTube history.  Good quality video though!   What scares me is doctors saying that everyone will experience one in their lifetime.      For fucks sake, I don't give a fuck about the rest of your comment, but stop referring to people from Arab countries as wogs.  Europeans don't want to be entangled in the same web as being Arab.  Its an insult worse than being called a wog.   - "how's about Nooo!, you crazy Dutch bastard". Austin Powers Gold member   Or leave it a full speed.. The slow-mo ruins it for me   Really? To the kevels of countries where gun laws are relaxed?  I dont think so.   Fight or Flight..   And this guy had the balls to fight, what a champion, and will be remembered as a champion.  I hope his family and friends find solace in knowing that he saved many lives at the cost of his own.  The other positive is that the cunt holding them hostage was shot dead.. As usually they'd arrest him, then hold him in prison where tax payers will feed him and clothe him, along with some fuckwhit lawyer that would be fighting for his innocence.   Secondly, what's up with the bonehead news reporter from the US claiming this wouldn't have happened if we had more relaxed gun laws?  Let's compare the shooting / murder rates between Aus and the US per capita.   They're saying 'slut' in all the magical different ways.   Stupid Jimmy.   Fraser island in Qld Australia has the same clear water   The N9 contrary to everyone else bitching and moaning about it, is actually a fantastic tablet.  Coming from a N7, the 9 is blisteringly fast and with 5.0 is a perfect match.  The only down side to the 9 is the crappy power and volume buttons that are sunk in too deep, and the screen bleed.   I'm an android fanboy, I have the nexus 9 and an iPad air.. When it comes to build quality, the iPad is far more supreme   This is brilliant.   no no.. Scholar first, to become a Gent.     Well, smart phones didn't have a decent camera till about 2008. My guess is that he/she (redditor) would now be about 12-14   Am I the only one that has actually had a positive experience with my N5 and battery life?  I'm getting at least 10-15% more battery life over the day    Just fixed my auto correct.  Same here, I have no issues with vaping being restricted to smoking areas and cubicles when taking a dump.   Yep, you just can't puff on it in the office at your desk   Why are the greens in general such a negative impact to Australia and its society?  You always seem to team up with the worst government at the time and do nothing but slow the economy down.  How are you going to change this and actually be more productive? Along with breaking the stigma that you're just another bunch of tree hugging hippies?.  We know all about global warming blah blah blah, what are YOU actually going to do about it rather than just telling us what you WOULD do if you ever had power..  Why would you even join the greens knowing well that you'll never stand alone as a party and will always be a tag along?  Sorry for the multiple questions, but you're the one on the stand doing an AMA, and this is my 'anything' I'm asking.   Go and buy a metre of plastic hose for fishtank pumps etc..  Cut it into tiny pieces that cover the tip.  This is how my local vape shop does it   5.. Fucking 5.  I can't get more than that and it frustrates the shit out of me.  Lollipop and the android flappy bird ruined my Nexus 5   I always thought the audience was behind the TV?   Yeah well, I have an Aus made car with an LS1 In it. I need both socket sets to work on it.    Well, I'm having troubles at home    Your response was one of those 'well that escalated quickly' although in reverse.  Nice post though dude / dudette.   I just wanna see it on my wrist for sizing   Inbox sucks.   Its not very often that something actually makes me 'lol' .. Your comment is today's winner   Try turning the notifications off?

 Death by rectal spear, inspired by Vlad.    Do the following: 1. Throw away that thong in a trashcan you'll never be able to rummage through later. 2.  Get rid of those pictures! It'll be tough, but you need to do it for yourself and your wife + your friend. 3. See a therapist or counselor about this. 4. Take a mini vacation with your wife and rediscover sexy time. Kink it up or do something new. Edit: after the baby.   Completed this survey and I have to say, it really made me think. I enjoyed taking it.   Let's consult with Buddha and Allah.   Could be one of two things: That was chiseled by countless hours in dirty chatrooms.  Or we have a great writer amongst us.   Needs a collaboration with Brand New.. Otherwise kick ass.   Nothing says "hood life" like ice cream.   Gum. People were in constant demand for more gum even though technically we weren't supposed to chew it during class.. This made it all the more desirable.   Beautiful :-)   Hello Sarah! When (and why) did you decide to get into this line of work?   How did you tell your family about your business?

 I thank you all for the words of encouragement and insight. Splitting the for test from the MIC helped a lot. Now I am back on track.   Last night I attempted to start Month 2 Day 1. I got through the fit test just fine. However, I found that I could not complete the Max Interval Circuit. I got about halfway through and physically could not do it. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself but that was a real blow to my confidence in terms of this workout.  I really enjoy this workout. I love the potential results I could get.  To anyone else here, how did you stay motivated to keep going when it got tough and when you felt like you couldn't do it anymore?  	2
 He admitted that, Wait!!! he didnt just run away??? WTF, thank your lucky stars you wisened up. Thats some creepy shit    "Hey wtf are you doing"    "Im smelling your garbage for cum!!!"     You fucked up my head, forever.   Blast music, walk around naked and let hang   My fav. Other bands with multiple 10/10 records is pink floyd, sabbath, iron maiden, lynyrd shynyrd, and the beatles.     These are not my top bands either, its hard to put a perfect record. I love the allman bros, dream theater, silvertide, deep purple, Srv, hendrix but these bands didnt have multiple 10/10 records imo, most just one or none. Floyd i think has three so they gotta be right under zeppelin in this catergory.   Coda i dont count, its mostly early seventies stuff anyway, put out after bonhams death it was more a complilation of b sides than new material. I love all their albums except in though the out door. Its ok but dont even sound like zeppelin imo. But 3 and presence are 9/10 for me, the rest 8/10, and in though the out door 6/10.   Im not saying more than half make that amount. Im simply stating that 99% is not an average as you suggested. I was offering jobs that can be readily identified as having tattoos be a non issue. The topic at hand has nothing to do with averages.     You are just bitter cause your sister is a slut machine.   An average does not mean 99% lol     Your insults are childish and your stats do not reflect your statements. Its quite clear you are talking out of your ass look at our corresponding comment votes   10 out of 10 no doubt. I love every album they have done with in though the out door being a like more than love. But those four are better than most albums.     Others id rate 10/10     Dark side of the moon     Tokoyo Tapes     Number of the Beast     Black Sabbath     Master of Reality     Core   Completely wrong. The album was popular because the music was great had nothing to do with Bon scotts death. If the album sucked it wouldnt be a best seller of all time, you kind of made my points for me.     The music was written before scott died. They record the music then do vocals as every album acdc has ever done. Bon died shortly after the music was recorded.    Bon scott and brian johnson have completely different sounding voices.     Ac/dc was on the rise in the late 70s, highway to hell was their most sucessful album up to that point. Back in black was a product of their rising fan base and would have been a sucess regardless of scotts death.   You cant even keep the topic at hand, its 5 figures genuis.     Your stats are made up and quite wrong. Your views are extremely biased and ancient to say the least.     Common pratice to put an edit in when you make one btw   Led zeppelin 2     Untitled     Houses of the holy(best album ever imo)     Physical Grafitti   I agree with everything you said, except that getting a tatto is irresponsible.   How do you know what he was smelling for?   Led Zeppelin   Its simply not the truth, sure there are people who still have a similar 50's mindset like you but they are few and far between, and you are wrong as ive explained.    Dealing with the public is not the same as dealing with clients. A dinner can be had where you wear long sleves. But that has nothing to do with the topic.    Take athletes, musicians, actors. chefs, techs, etc   Focus on your breathing nothing else. In and out, in and out, do this until the background noise in your head stops, eventually it will.     EDIT: Take long deep breaths   Ac/dc fame had nothing to do with bon scotts death. The others ill agree with.    Your reasoning is from 1950. Tattos are much more accepted today and as long as you dont have a rare job of being in the public eye its a non issue.   Crown and seven   /r/shortstories I find it damn interesting and wish more people gave imput.   My friend does, he is an enviromental engineer. Covered in tattoos, both arms and back. A masters' degree will turn your tattoos invisible.   Undercover Brother   See thats the thing she dont leave, bitch we dating you dont live here.   Sam harris, Richard dawkins, and the ghost of Hitch.   Who ever owns the car, regardless of driving.   Superfly   Shes still there long after i nut.   /r/changemyviews. Its simply retarded, the first person who post who doesnt "change your view" can complain to the mods and get your post removed. Has happened a couple of times to me and i didnt get any notice of them removing it. When i messaged about why, the mod who contacted me said he wasnt sure for the removal reason b/c he didnt remove it lol. When this process started again i simply unsubscribed and havent been back. Frustrating to say the least.   How do you justify luck in front of brady?   Most retarded list ive ever seen.   In a way you could say that. But hawking works specifically on trying to find the TOE, even his discoveries on singularites, black holes etc is direct progress into getting to a possible TOE, but if you dont see any connection to each his own.   We understand his discoveries, its his discoveries that have lead to a better understanding of the universe mathmatically, understanding the universe mathmatically is how you get to a TOE.     Was hawking the first to write down a more complicated black hole?   Clarify but it seemed like you took the route of defensively clarfiying your points, just an observation.   Just because you have a theory thats incomplete doesnt mean you cant make progress towards one, kind of nonsensical to think that way. His discoveries have no doubt lead us closer to a possible TOE, we have to understand things he discovered in order to get there.     Ill have to look up the black hole thing, unless you know who was first off hand?     Ill take your word on radiation. He also has come out saying something along the lines of matter disapears in a black hole, which isw hy we cant unify einsteins theories, something controversial along those lines.    You come off as defensive when i put before and after my statement "im not sure", "not 100%", "i thought" , and then treat them as black and white statements.   Black holes were known to exist but i thought he was the first to put it on paper.    I thought there were much contraversey surrounding his radiation theory.     He has made progress in getting to a universal theory, i didnt say one existed.     You come off as being defensive, im really just trying to pick your brain, no harm no foul.   Yea you cant have seperate sections here anymore. But as a smoker i respect that where food is served no smoking should be allowed any where.    Im not sure that is proven. I would think his biggest contribution is figuring out how to express a black hole mathmatically, but not 100%.     He has also made immense progress in the Theory of everything. The theory Einstein greatly desired to find.   Getting worst. Right now its banned anywhere food is served, and inside any public place.   Yep i do the same with my buds, evens out the shitty tobacoo.     The push and pull is not that bad but is time consuming. If i only smoke home rolled i would upgrade.   Yea here you can buy booze anytime and walk freely around with any beverage. Its not like that every where though, most states only sell booze up to a certain time and you cannot walk in public with an open alchol beverage. You have to stay in the bar or facility where drink was purchased.     Yea pretty much anywhere in the states you can have alchol in the car but its illegal to open any such drink in the car regardless of your blood toxicity level. Thats why a daquri shop is insane because the drink is open already. Would seem to a reasonable person these places are breaking the law the moment they had you the drink.     No if you get caught elsewhere in the states walking around with opened alchol its a crime but not driving crime. Only if you have open beverage in car, regardless of blood level. They can also take you to jail for refusing a breathlizer.     I dont know how Dui work in germany and ofcourse its frowned on everywhere but Louisiana is very tough on Dui. Its like a $500 fine, mandatory jail time, $500 in classes, possible suspended license. You are also required to get sr22 insurance for 2 years which basically triples your normal insurance. Your 2nd penalties increased vastly, and your license almost surely suspended. 3rd is considered a felony.   I love Anthony Hamilton, smoothest voice of all time. Im a metal head, and im not ashamed but if my door is open when im playing AH one of my friends is closingt he door.    Snickers ice cream bar. Them things are literally a slice of heaven.   Hell yeah. I dont have a crank but like a push n pull Top machine. I roll my own from time to time limits the amount i smoke of marlboros. And has helped financially to.     I just find my throat gets a little irritated when i smoke too many home rolled and the tabacco just dont tatse the same.   What!!?! cigs in a can and booze at fast food, thats very different than my norm. Pretty cool though     Ill throw a crazy fact your way, i live in Louisiana where drunk driving is a major issue and a monster financial burden if you get one. Open container is also a serious driving crime. But we have alcholic daquiri shops that are drive thru only. In some cases you will be refused service if you are not in a car!! lol   You can look it up. You have to make sure the brand is the same when comparing though. Pointless to compare reg pall malls to 100 marlboro.    Like i said its not much but its there. The amount i spend on cigs, roughly $120 a month, i want the most i can get.   Is that a can in your link?     Crazy little differences in the simple things in life. Reminds me of Pulp fiction when travolta talikng bout Mcd. "Its called a royal with cheese"    There is a difference, it might not be much but its there.   It should be respected or disagreed with in a respectful manner. Its our right to have our own opinion so it should be treated with respect. A decent disscusion is totally plausible on the disagreement at hand but they are civilsed ways to go about that.     There are ways to say you're wrong but be civil about it. Being respectful is the best way to change their mind imo   No the cigarette is longer as well.   Right and you still havent made a case for that. "pretty much" every would be more than half, generally speaking, i just dont see how that case was made. When the link you presented has few in one universe a few in another and the rest not even touched on.     I did my fact checking as well but on the vega brother movie im taking facts from a recorded conversation rather then quotes.   When i say electrified guitar i mean the things that electrify them as well.Yea, guitars were around, but not widely used the way jimi or rock music used them. Jimi and rock acts alike were very brutal on their guitars unlike the common jazz musician or pop artist who barely moved. The design for this was vastly improved on, of course the quality got better with time.     Major differences in their guitars. Jimi could not find a left handed guitar so he had to flip his and chizzle the nut. Srv uses a flip guitar b/c of his dedication to jimi and this design was vastly improved on. He also had a poor tremelo system that helped keep his guitar out of tune. SRV had a much better quality guitar choice and tremelo system.     Amp designs were vastly improved on. Technology has made great improvements in blues. The tube amps design is not much different but the tube itself has vastly improved. So have the speakers they use, which makes a major difference. Also the way the music is recorded makes a world of difference as well, this also much improved by SRV time.      Jimi was not just blues SRV was. Jimis direction was vastly new and different and technology and an early death hindered this. Srv was jimis biggest fan. So yes you short both of their talents by putting one on bass but lets be honest if a choice was made Srv would be happliy pluck the bass so jimi could play.       Couldnt disagree more. When darting though traffic one should be aware of all their surroundings, should not be in a coma at all. It also helps to dart though safely when their is a warning someone is coming to an unfore seen stop, which literally takes the least amount of energy possible to do.   Christmas is like a box chocolate, never know what you're going to get.   Your own link contradicts your case, it clearly says 2 universes not the same   Np, where do you live that sells cigs in different quanties? Curious   Bryce dallas howard, something sneakily sexy about that redhead   Richard Pryor, not a big fan of his movies. But no matter how many times i watch or listen to his stand up im floored and laughing like a mad man.   Amen   Using your blinker while driving   Well im unaware cigs are sold in different quantites. Where im from you can only buy a pack of 20 cigs, there are no other options. You can buy a carton of 10, 20 cig packs etc. My point is not quanity anyway its size so it would cost the same here for 20 or 30 cigs regardless of size.     There are some stores that still sell individual cigs but they are hard to find and usually overpriced   Havent seen that one yet.     I also think the jinx hbo documentary will stand the test of time, that shit was crazy and wildly entertaining   Its not like that in louisiana. Certain brands are the same cost regardless of size. But if your saving money that is quite reasonable   Maybe, but tell me that didnt make you laugh? When i hear sterotypes my mind goes to the venomous MD   Fair enough, will edit.   Thats ridiculous in of itself   Good quality bread, makes all the difference.   She asked for it....   Mountain dew shrinks your dick   Did you also know foxs' chracter is Django von Shaft?  It had been disscussed by QT to do another 2 django movies. The sequel following django and his kin. The third being a remake of Shaft a direct desendant of Django   Wolf of wall street     Django Unchained   Usually if a certain brand is unavailable, a smoker will switch to a cheaper brand.    They cost the same as shorter cigs, its ridiculous not to buy the better deal imo   Most people find longer cigs will cause them to smoke more. I find with the insane prices i buy 100's and put em out half way. Treat it like 2 cigs, 40 a pack. So if the store doesnt have my brand and size ill go to another store, if i dont have the option ill change to a brand that offers that size.     My girlfriend buys marlboro 72s, the short short ones, she believes she smokes less by buying these. Which could be true but the way i look at it buy the 100s and get the most for your money and exercise will power.    The shining   Roger Waters, just a major dick. Music is top knotch though   North Korea    EDIT LOL downvoting cause North korea is too friendly?   The movie The prestige and the machine. I have a very cut and dry explaination that those who listen unbiased can make more sense out of it then the widely held explaination. Most people cannot overcome their bias though   I wouldnt say small, its an obvious difference. Even letting douglas get up differed from tysons attempt to get up and how they were handled.     There has been no proven motive but one could easily think of 100 motives the ref could have had to do such an act.     A great fight but i could never consider this the greatest b/c of the obvious difference in count. Im not a huge fan of tyson either but the tape dont lie, and it is hugely suspicous.   A partial answer to why didnt evolution.... is as the human evolved so did our head size. Early human women struggled to birth these rapidly growing heads. It was either lethal to the women and/or new born. Surely other factors as disease, and other unforeseen factors played a part but so did this   That 10 count for douglas compared to tysons' 10 count was highly suspicous and i loathe that fight because of it   No not at all be critical of anyone you want just be knowledgable on who you ar critical of, and yea im not saying dont post here im just saying its counter productive to post on subjects you dont know about when OP purpose is to get info on that subject, ie not a good move.     I still hold that wikipedia is not a great place to get your only knowledge of a subject   Yea it wasnt lsd, it was something like it cant remember though. He bought barrels of the stuff though, same shit Edgar allen poe was on i believe. But dont hold me to that. Im not sure if he used lsd per say but was into other substances for sure.     Alot of people say approach his works with caution b/c they will change you. I think thats non sense and its just part of his legend. One guy here said one of his works changed him for the better so maybe it is true. It changes you for the good or bad.     There was a great documentary on youtube about him.   Not a good move to post about subjects you know nothing about except a quick wikipedia search. If you dont know a better move to not post on an askreddit thread   I was already on the fence but when i watched Sam harris for the first time i was shocked these arguments could be made intelligently sound. I pretty much had lost faith but was holding on due to social pressure. Harris help confirm my struggles were not crazy. Mostly the debate of harris and Wlc. Most people say Wlc won or was more convincing but i honestly dont see how you come to that conclusion reasonably.    Dawkins and the infamous Hitchens have some strong debates. Watch hitch debate the Catholic Church, where they take votes before and after the debate on the topic. The results are quite powerful   Not a great move to base your knowledge off of wikipedia   So did i, according to actual footage of QT talking, not some quote, this was never a possibility.   At the time the church was much less challenged and those that did so were socially crushed. His bad image has seemingly lasted, and i agree its a bit silly. He wrote some great books, even when possesed, very talented writer. Great works on practical magic that delves into black magic and summons, his life work really.     I cant remember specifics but almost certainly cocaine and lsd trippy kind of substances.     Also, i think comments have been deleted he didnt form the church of satan. Its founding almost certainly used some of his works but he didnt consider himself a satanist at all. And the church was founded after his death. From what i understand in his pursuit of magic, he discovered it was plausible to summon Satan. And if the pain stakingly detail oriented summon was performed properly, Satan would come forth and annoit the with god-like powers. So his pursuit of this consumed him, he wanted the powers as opposed to being a rebel of the Church.   Hendrix played at a time when electrified guitars were brand new. SRV had a big advantage in quality of guitars, amps, and even material to learn from. All of these things played a factor in being cleaner, etc.     SRV is mostly a famous Hendrix fanactic, he had some hit songs, but no where near the influential ground breaking material hendrix released. SRV would have handed hendrix the guitar, of much better quality than he was used too, with a floyd rose,keep it in tune, gladly picked up a bass and sat there to get schooled first hand, and loved every second of it.    EDIT, SRV was a bit faster but imo he played the same licks constantly so of course he mastered them. Hendrix was way ahead in chords and phrasing, also just another level creativity. With that said i love SRV, simply great but in this case SRV wouldnt bite the hand who feed him, imo.   What does that have to do with Crowely founding the church?  In that same website C.O.S., the article "was aleister crowely a satanist", it clearly says he was not and the C.O.S. was founded after his death, same site.   Producing as much as possible was a epic task as we evolved. Early human women struggled in birth because of a rapidly growing human head, with no aid. Still not an easy task today. This to answer on population question.     Yes like "dumfuker" said women are just as "horny", its just socially frowned on for women to be as bold as men on the subject.   Church of satan was founded after his death   Crowely was a satanist of sorts, a rebel if you will and participated in black magic. He endlessly tried to summon the devil. One of his books was claimed by crowely to have been wriiten by a demon he summoned that possesed him, The book of law. He was also assumed to have done sacrifices, crazy orgies, and did massive amounts of drugs requiring his cult to do the same.    He is wrapped up in things people tend to look down on, so they shun him. I find his writing and stories fasinating.    Little known fact, Jimmy page was an avid fan. Led zeppelin even recorded their most famous album in crowelys former mansion. It has been rumored the many tragedies that struck the band after their sessions were from being cursed by Crowelys lingering previously summoned evils there. Including a few serious accidents and two deaths   Yea i think its unlikely given the fact he was wrongfully imprisoned and help find the killer but possible.   This is a great thought.   If anybody gonna play bass would have been srv....   Bonham on drums    Phil leynot on bass/vocals     Allen collins on guitar     Lonesome dave on guitar/vocals        Watch the pulp fiction 15year cast and crew renuion. Hear what Qt actually says about that movie, not relying solely on a quote.   Yea ive seen leo and quentin confirm this.        Another fact like that, Jonah hill really gets knocked out in the Wolf of wall street. After 30 something takes of faking it, Scorcese insisted they do a real take.   Thats some major strecthing with the kill bill movies, where is the connection between dusk? The fact about the bear jew was cool though. It still leaves a few of his movies untouched.      Even by this article, there would be more than one universe, it clearly says two universes. Its quite a strecth to get there btw, but how you get the "same"  universe for all his movies is beyond me.   15th anniversary cast and crew of pulp fiction, video on youtube.    Interviewer "was there gonna be a vega brothers movie?"   Tarantino "They both die in the movie so...."    Cast member " would have been a prequel."     Tarantino shrugs it off continuing on to next question.     There might have been a little talk like hey wouldnt it have been cool to do....., but according to what i gather this was not a serious scenario. It doesnt sound like it was by your comments either. There were rumors but not because QT was actually working on it.    I was setting up the premise samjam   Ive watched everyone of his movies i dont see that at all. His first two movies were very similar because he had exact same crew. Both had extremely small budgets.      EDIT, lol how this gets downvoted?? Some of his movies have similar character names but most are clearly not in the same universe   Not true   Yea i heard this somewhere, i find little known facts like this fascinating.   The interview i just watched pretty much implied Tarantino never had any plans to do this. I would totally have watched that movie though.  	105
    im in awe that such container can be used as a cheaper alternative to renting a place to put up your business let alone be a stand alone bakery. learn more in this article http://www.royalwolf.com.au/blog/knafeh-bakery-takes-on-australia-from-a-shipping-container/. i might consider this an idea when i put up an organic cafe.

 Just asking, not making any assumptions:  Is this kind of shit (and the case in the top comment) only possible in America? I never hear shit like this happen in any other country. Of course mistakes are being made everywhere, and there are dickheads everywhere, but such a large scale fuckup does not seem to happen anywhere else but in America, the land of unlimited possibilities.    So, what was the end of the story?   Who won?   Did anybody insert anything into Haidl's rectum? (I hope so)   I am just wondering which of the movies (plus clone wars and rebels) people actually appreciate / don't appreciate.   I guess just like me all fans are, above all, in love with the idea of star wars, the world and the story of jedi against sith and  the dark and bright side of the force.   Yeah, I would like that.   Thanks!   My mother is crazy and has the radiator on the whole day even when she is at work. I am not like that at all, but I am wondering how I can make some good decisions to spend as little money as necessary and be comfortable throughout the winter.   One question I would like to answer is: Is it better to keep a certain temperature in the house during the day or shall I turn everything off when I am not at home?   Really? I did not know that at this altitude you cant see the curvature. Can you link some pictures showing earth from about that height where you can hardly see curvature?   I thought you wanted to say that you'll get the phone, not that you get the joke   I am glad I got your post before I started insulting you    You're writing that as if you are not permitted to use a windows phone and have to justify yourself.   What happened to you?   I heard that before and it might be true of course.   Personally I believe it's a way to maximise profits. I do not think R Do would be affected. Companies will innovate always to compete    Well, I would also be happy to.know.what it's called   Can somebody make that song from the video on the website into an mp3 file?  pretty pleeeeeze.      I will start by saying I am pro universal healthcare.   You have pointed out the problem of the "old" system. Those who are poor or ill do not get / can't afford it. Universal healthcare makes sure that our society as a whole makes sure everybody is taken care of.  The benefits are that: - Everybody is insured - Even if you are an idiot and don't know what is important you still have health insurance (poor and rich) - People are not bankrupted because they have to have expensive surgery (poor and rich) - Price of treatment in general is much much much lower in countries with universal healthcare   Yes the rich participate with a bigger share but they are rich so that can afford it. They also benefit from it and after paying their share they are still rich (it's not like it's making anybody poor).   What are they fighting over though. Life or death or whether the guy goes to heaven or hell? He looks pretty dead to me   my girlfriend has been diagnosed with cancer and there is only limited treatment. we basically had to accept that it can be controlled to a certain level but not cured.   now she needs counselling but it seems nobody knows where to go. she has had some counselling but was told she is only entitled to 12 sessions in total. she will however need to regularly talk to somebody indefinitely to be able to control and understand her emotions.   does anybody know where we could go?  any advice would be greatly appreciated.    What exactly does this do?   I was sure this was a piss take. I was very surprised    I like yours better   How is someone at home 365 days a week?    And what does that mean from 1-10 (10 being the best)?      Nobody ever admits something is great or awful. It's always not bad or not great.   The streets are full of vomit in London. If I was British I would find that embarrassing    I hope I'm not too late. I'd like to know what other people think.   I deal with many European oil and gas manufacturers. Many of them Italian and British.  For some reason the British have such a low opinion of Italian and other southern European countries and always tell me I should not buy there and that nobody can compete with British manufacturers.   Truth is, British manufacturers are slow, expensive, their customer service is bad, their manufacturing equipment old and their quality questionable at best. All they have left is a bright history and they seem to think that's a good enouh reason to buy from them.  Any chance you will wake up and acknowledge that mainland Europe is miles ahead of you?   I am scared to buy it because I don't want that book connected to my name. Can you just but it on the high street anywhere?    It still isn't expensive in the US. Come to Europe and fill up your tank. That feeling is horrible    I agree with your general view. But if sales are going down for the ipad means people stop buying them. If those people then buy an android applies a different question.    What is the the message?  Soundtrack is amazing BTW   I just love that ze Germans are making a phone that meets the desire of every German to combine private life and work    I am 99.999% sure your problem is not memory. The problem is that you don't listen. Believe me.    Are you saying sudoku players have a tendency to commit suicide?    ... and then I fucked "insert name of person in the story"!   What happened?   What do people mean when they post a picture and call it rare on the Internet?    I have used both platforms. I had an iPhone 4 for 2 years. I came over to android, found that everything I need is available and many paid iOS apps are free on the play store.   Your Eurosport example does not convince me.    Would you mind being more specific?    The "R.I.P my inbox" is not at all obligatory.    Sorry, I am not suitable to answer that question then. Good luck.    Yes, I understand that, but most of them would call themselves Christians I assume.    That is what I believe too. I am not from the US but as far as I can tell, people there appreciate if somebody believes in god and basically is a good Christian. So I assumed that musicians do this to be accepted.    I agree with that, but I think it's fair to assume that most of these believe in the bible and Jesus Christ.    I mean it because many of the promote the fact that they are whores, gangsters, criminals, drinkers and so on. Does not really go hand in hand.     I guess Air Droid then. But you have to be connected to the same wifi.    Strange because I can hear notifications just fine, but I can't hear my ringtone when somebody calls me. I have a z3c   You can access your PC through your phone with Teamviewer. Not sure if this is what you want. It brilliant though.    Sorry, I have not been hating and I have not been cocksucking. I said two things:  - I think Android premium phones are better than iPhones.   - I did not say iPhones are shit or not good. I just said that they are no. 2 on the list.   I personally dislike that fact that people perceive the iPhone to be the best phone you can get because you can get something that is (in my personal opinion better) at least equal for a lot less money.   I never said that iPhones are no good. They are great, but I think Android phones are better which makes iPhones the contender. Everything I am saying. iPhones are perceived to be the best because of high profits and premium image but I personally think that from a quality, performance for money and usability perspective they are inferior.     but crippling them and putting the original victim and others out of work is just fucking stupid.  exactly. Like I said the rule should not be made with the intention of actually applying it. It shall prevent people from braking the law.       If you argue like this nothing will change. The intention of such a rule would not be to find offender and cripple them, but to prevent people from doing it.   If a company then willingly pays less than MW, funk them and good night. This sort of thing does not "happen" it will be somebody's fault   What does that have to do with the quality of the phone?   Take the iPhone head on? The iPhone is the device that has to try and catch up with android devices. What are you talking about?  Edit: sorry, I checked with my mum and she agreed, iPhone is best. My bad    That's what seems to be happening to me... Sometimes it's really fast.    I looks really fake. I mean, it is fake, since it is from a movie, but it also looks fake.    I feel you.    Ducks. Because they are incredibly cute.   I even stopped eating them.    Only lasts a second when your hand goes in your pocket until you realise: Wrong pocket   I am just ever so slightly changing the question:  I went to a wedding. Saw an old friend of mine who I haven't seen in years (we call him James). I left the wedding early, because my girlfriend was unwell.   The next day another friend of mine (Mike) asks me: Is that guy James your friend? I say yes. Mike then tells me that James told him (Mike) how he loved him and missed him and wished that they would spend more time together and nothing is the same anymore, bla bla bla.   Turns out, James though Mike was me. And only because we both shave our heads.  True story   I am on three and it has been incredibly slow lately. I wonder if its them or my phone.    I clicked the diet link and read all of it.   They mention "Old School new body", a workout. Is that any good?   Can I keep tax and insurance from Germany?    Ok, I feel like these are not popular at all, but from my point of view Lenovo tablets are unbeatable.  I had the first gen ([this one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-8-inch-Tablet-Silver-Metal/dp/B00G459J5W)). I love it. It is not very fast and the Lenovo skin is not great, but I installed Nova launcher and then its fine. You get SD card support and the screen is fantastic in my opinion. For browsing and watching movies it is great because it has the stand. Battery life is incredible.   Now they launched the new generation ([here](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lenovo-YOGA-10-1-Tablet-Silver/dp/B00O636JFW/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers ie=UTF8 qid=1416244949 sr=1-1 keywords=yoga+tablet+2)). They both come in 10 inch and 8 inch. And the new generation also comes with Windows 8.1. I really think this is a great product. And the prices are really reasonable.     No matter if it is your teacher, parent, boss or arch enemy. We all hated someone and eventually became like them. What is your story?   I don't know why you are being downvoted. I agree with you. Even if you can disable them, I do not want them on my phone. I knew what I was buying and it's fine, but I really would like if I could just deleted what I don't want to have.   I think it's a fair comment.    OK, wasnt so hard. Deleted the theme.   nope. 30 minutes. and 11 hours overall   Do you thinks that's ever going to happen?  Also Ahsoka's story...   Whom are you buying/making it for? What are you buying/making?   Did you just get the phone or do a factory reset? I had that problem after a factory reset. The account was not linked correctly with the phone. After a new wipe it worked fine   my s3 has the problem that after 11 hours and only 30 min screen on time the battery is dead.   looking at what used it up, it says 35% by cyanogenmod theme.   how do I get that sorted? anybody had that problem?    I commented Grievous and immediately regretted it. She is the best    General Grievous   Watch this. It is very informative and entertaining  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhyYgnhhKFw   Next time, please answer the questions within 1 minute of the OPtime.    I'd like to see his reply to this.

What happened from your point of view? Where is OP right/wrong in your opinion?  Why are you three guys now the mods of that sub?   Thanks for responding.    How did they become America's closest ally? Why are they still America's closest ally?   I find this very interesting, but I would like to know:   Who are these three guys then?  /u/UncleSamuel , /u/fritzly, and /u/Semebay?   What are the values and do you also see the downsides?   The illusion of being able to do what the hell you want.   Why illusion? You know why.   Why do you like / dislike what he does and what he stands for?   I did not realise. Thank you!  Where is this BTW?   I never get this. So for example 'Barack Obama sonic the hedgehog' or what?    Just awesome.    somebody else said they were hitting on his wife.    Typical Eastern European move. They love that shit.    Please ELI5:   When the ambient temperature is low, temporarily decreasing the temperature setting on a building's programmable thermostat (e.g. at night or when it is unoccupied) rather than maintaining a steady temperature can save a significant amount of energy.[304] A common myth is that if the building is allowed to cool, its furnace has to "work harder" to reheat it to a comfortable temperature, counteracting or even exceeding the energy saved while the temperature was allowed to drop. Actually this practice can result in energy savings of five to fifteen percent as the heat lost by a warm structure in a cold environment is proportional to the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the structure.   You know, the 3-4 thousand you get for 500000 plays doesn't sound too bad considering you record the song once and don't do anything after that. Nothing. Money just keeps coming in whilst you are at home eating cocopops.   I would love that   yeah, why post something that says the opposite of what you're trying to prove?   Well, that doesn't count for me.too close to earth. Technically space, but I don't count that   I do not see one that is incorrect. I am not saying they are not, but would you mind pointing one out?      I can't remember the name of the show. Something from the 80s.   A guy thought he won the lottery but turned out he only won 100$. he was super sad about it. However the weird, slightly dumb, guy in the show was super happy. When asked why he said:  Because I do not compare the 100$ to the 1000000$ you thought you won. I compare the 100$ to the 0$ we had before.    It is not uncool to know something.    This is so important. I love when people smile. It's the best and an honest non creepy smile is never inappropriate. Even at a funeral a smile can be consoling.    How to share. I never did and now I don't want to live with my SO...   I made the same experience. People don't even finish reading what you write. They read gun and an adjective and go nuts.   I am honestly just asking: Why do you add "literally"?   Haha, this is good.    My friends brother and I found out we started uni together in the same city. We started going there together in the morning and meet for lunch and stuff. Now we are so close everybody thinks we are gay.   Edit: I feel like I left out the part about how we got close. Well...   Runny nose, no tissue   This is soo awesome. I bet she is super happy with it.   I just pray she is not giving it to the wrong people just filling their own pockets    I only ever played Halo 1, but fuck I love this so much. I can't begin to describe how this makes me feel.   I'm gonna go home, show my GF and be disappointed because she won't care...   I went to a funeral, sat down and the old lady that was walking towards a seat in the middle of the row in front of me tripped and fell. Me and my friend looked at each other and had one of those moments in our minds:  Him: Dude, did you see that?!  Me: Yes, I did. What are we going to do?  Him: Please play it cool. If you as much as smirk, I will burst out laughing.  Me: Gotcha!  Looked to the front of the room for 1 hour not saying anything.     My colleague did a presentation in front of 150 people. He was really nervous but kind of managed not to completely screw it.  He was basically jumping from stone to stone, struggling not lose control (at the same time talking faster and faster) until he said one sentence that made no sense whatsoever.   He stopped abruptly, looked down and sighed. It was really sad but unbelievably funny.   thank you.   Hey, thanks. I thought so. I have not seen it in real life, but on picture the phone loks super thick with the 4400 battery.   What is the oldest android phone that you can think of that still gets custom rom support nowadays and therefore still is a good purchase for people who like playing around? (e.g. S3)  EDIT: And doesn't have terrible battery life.   Which extended battery for the S3 can you recommend?    Can I used Xposed on non rooted phones?   He is not saying Europe should do that. Just that Russia is dependent on Europe more than vice versa. We should not be afraid of the cutting us off. They should be afraid    I would like to add a question.  Why are constructions sites abandoned during normal working hours even though the construction site is disrupting traffic and should be finished ASAP?    I would like to add a question.  Why are constructions sites abandoned during normal working hours even though the construction site is disrupting traffic and should be finished ASAP?    Actually, the case idea is good enough for me. Thanks    Thanks. I'll check    If possible I would like swipe my phone instead of my oyster card. is that possible today/in the future?    I agree with you. I also live in one of those shitty areas. Even though I like it anyway I am really looking forward to the improvements. However I don't think improvements always have to be the same shit. Cleaning up and improving infrastructure is great. Also some nice pubs are great. But I don't need shopping opportunities everywhere and I don't need all the chains everywhere. If I wanna go there I can take the bus to central. I like the independent restaurants and I don't need them to face tough competition. They don't seem to make loads of money anyway but I like their food and the facet that they are locals.   First of all, I love this every Saturday.   I just discovered true dialer. Replaces your dialer app and I think it is perfect. I always struggled with dialer and contacts app, but this brings them together.   Really like it.  Linkme: truedialer  	120

The photo caption I found on wikipedia doesn't give a specific date:  "The BSA Gold Star, (19381963), is a 350 cc and 500 cc 4-stroke production motorcycle that gained its reputation for being one of the fastest machines of the 1950s.

Funny story, my mom is from Louisiana and after my dad left the active army she said she didn't want to live north of the Mason Dixon. I was born in Concord, Mass.

We moved to Maryland and after living in a townhouse and then single family home (and gaining three siblings), we bought a farm... Four miles from the northern border of Maryland.  In my parent's house there is both pork roll and pecan pie. The tea is sweet, but the bacon is crispy.

One would expect that in any diet the existing dietary fats would have to be replaced t omake room for the unsat fats to not simply increase calories.  The only problem is that people are using the studies to argue for less sat fats when that may not be the motive force behind the benefits.  I still need to find and read the studies but wanted to ask.   It has been shown people can live off just butter and potatoes.

Luckily it isn't for ants.      Then you should oust all democrats for making the state do more with less. They lied and told you they were doing great, we only need little tax raises (and huge municipal bonds). The education budgets grew and the transportation fund was used.  But nobody got a raise except the people with nameplates on the desk. Some people, like the county council in Baltimore County, gave themselves a raise.  So I don't know if you are a person who says "well, both parties are shit." Even so, tell me if there is another option:   * Cut what things the state does.  * Cut the cost of how the state does things.  * Increase money available to the state to do things.  Then ask yourself whether the last two are remotely possible.  You'll find yourself in denial, or maybe start wondering if the state could do a little less.

Urban planning is the idea that you need some sort of central authority to guide the development of cities, economic investement, and private development  I don't see why he would not make a broader statement which is more inclusive to the need for specialization in the understanding of planning no matter the existance of a central authority or not. He might just be a little exited or has an unreasonable stance on this. In any case, I think it is an extreme and odd statement that stick out from the rest of what I see as a sensible set of statements and arguments.   Rather than understanding the suburban growth movement and smart growth movement as differing ideas that served different needs at different points in time, he tries to paint them as the same thing, dual aspects of this imaginary ideology he calls "interventionism," as if planners were just sitting around, thinking, "How can we best intervene this year?" The truth is, planners are almost entirely beholden to public opinion. Their job isn't to hand down decisions from on high, but usually just to try to make some compromise out of all the competing needs of a community, according to open, democratic processes.  This is something I want to respond to. Sorry this isn't a full response comment, I should get back to this.   Ok, so I watched to the end of the video, but I still don't know--what are the unintended consequences?  Unintended consequence of Natl Highway system: solidification of car as dominant means of transport, bringing us car-dependant planning and relegating railroads to second-class land use.  Unintended consequence of car-dependant planning: Social stratification, urban decay, an institutionalized poor understanding of efficiant and dense planning. Also, excessive pollution.   And what would the consequences be of not planning cities?  As I said up top, it is hard to believe he doesn't believe in any planning. The idea behind a free market is not to have no regulation whatsoever, but to have decentralized regulation. We discriminate against quality and waste, foresight and foolishness, health and disease, or find privately organized advocates for sensible positions on these. A sensible advocate for planning in a city would be well worth consulting. He is either wrong, or misrepresented his own position. I might read more of his work as I linked below to find out.

If you want to go practice /r/wma with a friend you can do so in public with real swords (but even training or wooden swords would be considered "d.w." imo). One would have to look up the rules for parks to see what restrictions are present.   Best book on this, IMO, is [*Dirt: Erosion of Civilizations.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQACN-XiqHU)   Recently found this blog. The author is raising two kids.

 Gotcha. Thanks :)   Yes, this is true. Although the US Constitution does supersede this and the Supreme Court would rule against it (most likely) as you pointed out, the states do have their rights too, just like how states can have legal medical marijuana although it is still illegal on a federal level.  Why shouldn't I believe that these states have these articles? They are written in text by the governments of the states and that is sufficient evidence for me.

Because we had family from both sides attending we decided to remove some terms that would make things awkward, but we kept the idea the same. A celebration of two individuals joining together, working towards the same goals, enjoying life. It was ordained by a Reverend in the COS.   Coop is a solid guy.

If that kind of symbolism and imagery works for you, then go for it. Keep in mind that what goes on in the ritual chamber is self imposed ignorance, fantasy... the Intellectual Decompression Chamber.  If anyone thinks they are actually talking to or summoning demons then I'd suggest therapy.      Something that might interest you, here's an interview with Ashely S. Palmer of ASP Apparel on the 9sense Satanic podcast. He talks about the Church of Satan Walpurgisnacht celebration at the Dashwood Hellfire Caves Buckinghamshire, Southeast England.  http://www.ashleyspalmer.com/9sense-interview-dec2011/   Read the material, and live your life as you see fit. Some of the most Satanic people I've ever met rarely ever directly talk about Satanism in public (unless asked about it), but they apply the philosophy and aesthetic discretely to their art, writing, careers, etc.     The Church of Satan is an international organization and we have many members in England, including some of our most active. Joining the Church of Satan *is not required* to be a Satanist, but if you wish to support the organization and get to know other Satanists then [you can sign up here](http://churchofsatan.com/join-the-cos.php).  One of my good friends is in England and runs the [ASP Apparel](http://aspapparel.com/) webstore.      I have a couple of friends who work with/for Vice, mainly for their Noisey music segment. I'm also a fan of Molly Crabapple's writing.     Unfortunately they have some people on staff who think the Church of Satan should jump at the chance to be associated with them. They reached out to the COS, we had some questions and laid out our terms, and they decided to go with some nobody who would be willing to give Vice a song and dance.   He was, as my friend [Kenaz Filan](http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/) puts it, a functional atheist, meaning that he did not operate under the notion that there was any conscious God or gods, he lived his life purely materialistically. His idea of magic was materialistic, *if magic exists* it would one day be explained by science and understood to be part of the human experience, not something supernatural.   Essentially, yes. He was open to the possibility that there is a "force" that keeps nature in balance, but this "force" was not something you could communicate with, to pray to or negotiate with. It just is, it doesn't "think", and it surely doesn't give a damn about people.   It's important to be clear that the Church of Satan itself does not advocate any one political party/ideology. It encourages each Satanist to seek the politics, if any, that they most agree with themselves and benefits them best. I've met Church of Satan members from all over the political map. and even though they all agree on the principles of Satanism, and may respectfully disagree on how it is applied to politics.   Personally, I most closely agree with Ernst Junger's idea of the Anarch, an individualist anarchist/egoist.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarch_(sovereign_individual)   Firstly, being an individualist does not mean you're an isolationist. Your self interest comes first and foremost, but you also recognize situations where it would be net beneficial for you, in the short or long term, to cooperate with others.     There are Satanists who consider themselves Libertarians. You can watch artist Coop (Magister in the Church of Satan) talk about his politics on the Libertarian Reason TV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1aC_ltJBs    LaVey was obviously influenced by Ayn Rand. He promoted her work to other members of the Church of Satan, but there were some clear areas where Satanism and Objectivism diverge. See Magister Nemo's essay: [Satanism and Objectivism](http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php).    The Satanist can also recognize the importance of having a stable environment, where you are free to pursue your happiness, and may choose to dedicate your time and resources to improve your own community. Remember, Satanism does not normalize to society. Satanism does not require everyone to be a Satanist. In fact, Satanism says most people *are not* Satanists. I can see how a Satanist can agree with a centrally planned political system, recognizing the need for people to have their interests taken cared of for them (Socialist, Communist), so long as they place themselves in a position of control of this system. Peter Gilmore writes about this situation in The Satanic Scriptures.       Great job!   Nailed it   Satanism is about living your life happily, rituals should be a tool to help achieve that. Rituals are by and large private, solitary practices. The Black Mass, or Le Messe Noir, as it's referred to in The Satanic Rituals, is just an organized blasphemy, a parody of the Christian mass, or any social institution, and are a means for personally throwing off those shackles. They are very, very rarely public events. The last Satanic High Mass was done on 6/6/6, restricted to verified Church of Satan members, and conducted at the Center for Inquiry West's Steve Allen Theatre in Los Angeles.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM      The Satanic Bible is the fundamental text for Satanism. This is like going into /r/islam and asking for thoughts on the Koran...     [Not sure if...](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_ku-medium/18nsju2r17odgjpg.jpg)     Anyway... coincidentally my good friend [Rev. Kevin I. Slaughter](http://www.underworldamusements.net/books/) just posted this [screenshot of the Satanic Bible on Amazon](https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/10150699_10203710027498322_1300974056_n.jpg) and made this comment a few moments ago that's worth repeating here:  "A paperback original, published in 1968, is still a bestseller. There has never been a single advertisement placed by the publisher in all that time, there has not been a single "legitimate" review in any major outlet."   Love is one of the most powerful human emotions, and it should not be wasted. It should be cherished and applied to the people who would love us back. What is the greater good of humanity? I don't believe in an objective human "greater good", other than living in balance with the natural world. This might not match what other people consider "the greater good".    I'll be sure to include your material in one of my upcoming episodes of [Chaos Sedated](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/)   [Satanic booty had me like...](http://cdn.arwrath.com/1/153259.gif)   From the Church of Satan FAQ: http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php     WHAT IS A SATANIC RITUAL?  Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this. The pageantry of ritual is a drama meant for emotional stimulation, not a belief in or worship of any power higher than the projected will of the magician. That is why we call it an intellectual decompression chamber.  The three basic types of Satanic Ritual are outlined in detail in The Satanic Bible, which is essential reading for those wanting to grasp our perspective on this practice. They are for Compassion (for oneself and others), Lust (to release unrequited sexual urges) and Destruction (to cleanse oneself of anger towards someone who has done you an injustice). These serve as models for whatever other purposes one might feel the need to explore via ritual. In The Satanic Rituals Anton LaVey presents other rituals essentially meant for larger group performance based on historical and cultural diabolist imagery.  However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working.  Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist, has spent many years exploring the extended mind and has solid statistical evidence that there indeed does exist a mechanism in nature that could be used for such ends. His many books are fascinating and worth investigating.  We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.  There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information.    Order of the Trapezoid  http://www.churchofsatan.com/cos-order-of-trapezoid.php       The Order of the Trapezoid, as a formal organization, was the organization that became the Church of Satan. LaVey was inspired by historical occult orders, but cultivated members who accomplished things in the real world, not people who spent all their time studying occult mumbo jumbo and couldn't get waiter to fill a glass of water.  " In accordance with LaVeys explorations of demonic geometry, they took to wearing an odd-shaped black and red medallion adorned with a bat-winged demon and formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, which later evolved into the governing body of the Church of Satan. Those who attended LaVeys soirees always comprised an array of professions and pursuits: the Baroness Carin de Plessenwho grew up in the Royal Palace of Denmark, Dr. Cecil Nixonmagician and eccentric extraordinaire, underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger, as well as artists, attorneys, doctors, writers, and law enforcement officers. City Assessor Russell Wolden might share the room with Donald Werby, one of San Franciscos most influential property owners; anthropologist Michael Harner with writer Shana Alexander. A ships purser might be seated next to a deep-sea diver, a dildo manufacturer next to a plastic surgeon. A famous tattoo artist, the grandson of a U.S. president, the owner of one of the worlds largest collections of Faberg artifactsall attended LaVeys get-togethers. The field of fantasy and science fiction personages alone yielded the likes of Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, Fritz Leiber, Jr., to name a few, into LaVeys circle of magical compatriots."   There is no such thing as "Generational Satanism" in regards to the Church of Satan. Any "hardcore members" who would believe in that would be swiftly kicked out.   Blanche Barton is working on an updated edition which would include an updated bibliography. That's a good question to ask her, I'll forward that along.               No problem. What's are some of your favorites?      Representatives put themselves out there not to gain acceptance from the general public, but to defend our rights if we ever see them threatened or to be a beacon for the few others who might share our philosophy. Why bother? I meant what I said in my OP, I did this to have fun and give people the opportunity to interact with a Satanist. All in all I had a good time, talked about music, beer, and Godzilla.     I agree, evil as some kind of "thing" outside of the human mind doesn't exist. Evil to me anything I don't like. I think all circumstances of child abuse is evil. Children naturally love life, they are in tune with their instincts, they are natural magicians with powerful imaginations. Do I need to defend this? Apparently the Catholic Church doesn't deem child abuse to be evil enough to jeopardize their power.     In the context of what he's written later in his life and other books I would think he's being analogous more than anything else.    Seems to be a common occurrence, Selim Lemouchi, former frontman of The Devil's Blood (the band that Watain believed could put their Satanism on the cover of Rolling Stone) recently took his own life. Everyone who I know who's worked with Ndtveidt and various other "theistic" Satanists have noticed heavy use of hard drugs. Richard Mills of Grand Belial's Key was a close and personal friend of mine, and though we disagreed on many things (politics, religion, substance abuse), he was a reliable friend to me. Unfortunately one of my last memories of him was when we were hanging out with Absurd and they asked me where I could get drugs. He knew I didn't do drugs, so I got pissed, told them to fuck off and left. A few days later he would die of a drug overdose on the streets of Harlem.    We believe that the psychological effects of magic is real, and that, for example, by performing a lust ritual, we are able to increase our chances of having our desired partner, because of an increase in confidence and an alleviation of stress and worry. We are open to the possibility that there may be additional effects to the practice of magic that we do not yet understand.   "Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this.

I pretty much enjoy all bands influenced by Neurosis (Pelican, Mastodon, mostly everything on Hydra Head Records). Check out MGR http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYMkejSSrKE    Destructo Swarmbots http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXU4k1Xdbo8    And of course, Jesu http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0PYwPMnUCM   If your six friends bought those certificates in the past... 40 years or so, then yes they were certainly taken for a ride, but not by the Church of Satan. Did LaVey sell certificates at one point or another? I'm not sure, but the only person to claim this (back in the early 70's) was someone who had personal vendetta against LaVey, so I don't take that very seriously. I know I didn't, and none of the Priesthood that I know did, and many of who knew LaVey personally, some since the 80's.  The current administration does not sell priesthood, and will often reject applications and send refunds to people they believe are not fit for the organization (http://imgur.com/r/WTF/E1BPd).    And about LaVey making a "fortune", I guess it depends on what you mean by fortune. He lived a comfortable life off his royalties (which the COS does not hold, all sales of his books go to his ex partner). Here's a blog entry from writer Kenaz Filan, who's working on an extensively researched, unbiased biography of LaVey and his take on LaVey the money grubbing conman:   http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/2013/02/for-chas-clifton-questions-for-devil.html "But amidst all these allegations I've never seen anyone say that Anton LaVey bilked a nice little old lady out of her life savings.  Or that he took tens of thousands from a bored San Francisco socialite to teach her "the Darkest of Dark Arts." Or that he extorted money from his flock. Or that he ever did any of the things you'd expect a con man to do. "  http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/2013/01/satanism-story-of-reluctant-antichrist.html    "Then I saw a throwaway line where LaVey told Lawrence Wright that he hadn't done a Black Mass in over twenty years.  And I realized that here's a guy who could have made a tidy living working the lecture circuit.  Hell, I'm imagining LaVey with robe and hood, holding up a sword and proclaiming  "In this arid wilderness of steel and stone I raise up my voice that you may hear. To the East and to the West I beckon. To the North and to the South I show a sign proclaiming: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!!!"     But he didn't do that.  Instead he watched like Sauron from Barad-Dur as others ran with his ideas (and more often than not got them spectacularly wrong). For a good part of Satanism's story Anton LaVey is conspicuous by his absence. Those aren't the actions of someone who was doing this as a performance, someone who was just looking for a quick buck.  There are many religions founded by conmen pretending to be prophets.  Anton LaVey was a prophet pretending to be a conman. He may have played a little fast and loose with the facts, but he believed everything he said."     For more see: http://kenazfilan.blogspot.com/search/label/satanism   We have some Satanists who are interested in what might be going on and will examine the latest scientific data that could help understand it. Belief in magic beyond psychodrama is not required though, it's up to you and your own experiences to judge that. The rituals, the symbols, the chants and names of the devils are all used to create emotions, stimulate your mind and creativity. Here's some more information, including an interview with Magister Nemo on the role and research on Greater Magic:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcYWmeSkCI     http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php     Find out! Another Church of Satan Reverend just reissued the King in Yellow http://www.underworldamusements.net/books/the-king-in-yellow/   Good questions, sorry I missed it earlier.     I used to be when I was in my teens. I worked for various live venues in NYC and saw many Black and Death Metal bands that I enjoyed. I was into metal before I knew about Satanism as an organized religion. Since I do not have any kind of spirituality, I would say no. I find that heavy metal attracts many young people to Satanism, but many of them get stuck on the basics, the shock value element of it. But I know many mature Satanists today that started out as metal fans; some who still are, others who aren't as much.   Some favorite metal bands:   Sunn O))) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL5Ilyv98c8     Altar of Plagues http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbfieYwl4aQ    ISIS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NT0QL-xrx4 Pig Destroyer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnymA33eoII    Going through some questions I missed here... I would say that don't have faith, but a worldview and philosophy 1. That we believe in a literal Satan (pretty much covered here) 2. That we're all serious, sullen, metal heads. 3. That we're merely hedonists, all we want is immediate pleasure all the time. We say indulgence, not compulsion. When you feel like you *have* to have pleasure, you're no longer making choices but feeding an addiction.   Those anti-christian symbols seem to work well for a number of people, see the popularity of various metal bands (King Diamond) or artists (Coop). Being gaudy about probably won't get you anywhere, have a sense of style and taste and it could work out. Then again, you do away with that all together, use other symbols or archetypes that fit your goals or needs.    I would see Jung and his writing on the importance of archetypes, rituals to mark milestones in life, etc. His books are recommended reading for Satanists.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_interpretation_of_religion     Key terms are *"if you have employed"*, some Satanists are interested in finding out if there's something in the natural world (not spiritual) that could explain magical or psychic phenomenon, and others have no interest in magic other than psychodrama or a form of meditation.   I listen to a lot of ambient and experimental music and worked with several record labels that put out that kind of music. See my Chaos Sedated podcast if you're interested http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/     But I enjoy many other types of music, from rock to electronic pop music. Here are some songs I've been enjoying a lot lately:   Ulver: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srImIubSxe8    ISIS: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWTAkBRe6aI Monster Magnet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-mZqUg7lYU   Crystal Castles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twG4MTnU8xg Cold Cave: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRt-IzBXdNY    Prurient: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNol8eRwfg    Probably blasting this song in my car http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QbAXXXOJF8   I hung out with him on several occasions, did a photo shoot with him in NYC many years ago. We have since parted ways over various differences. He no longer considers himself a Satanist in any way and refers to himself as something like an occult Christian (see the end of his biographical film Iconoclast)   LaVey created the above ground, organized religion of Satanism, so I obviously have a lot of respect for him. Yes, I think that TSB is mandatory reading if anyone wants to understand Satanism.   Waking up and going to bed with my wife.    I'm personally not the biggest fan of heavy metal, but I realize that it attracts many youths to the philosophy. Unfortunately not many get past the shock value and stick to what I consider Phase One Satanist... you know, all black, serious, pentagrams and upside down crosses... But some kids take the ideas and research it it further, find other forms of music and art that have a Satanic element, and develop into more well informed and articulate individuals. Here's a show on Radio Free Satan that focuses on opera and classical music http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/voxsatanae/   Not familiar with what this talk is, but I'm sure it's a lot of crap... the media just likes to paint anything that looks strange or weird as "Satanic".    Not sure which article you're talking about, but LaVey wrote a book called "The Satanic Witch" which was basically a manual for women to use to control men, but also covered the role of sex and gender in general. Here's an article on Satanic Feminism by Blanche Barton, LaVey's last wife and current high ranking COS member http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanic-feminism.php   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDw6k0OllI  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkVwJ_vTjak  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk1ROnOu9iQ   Anyone who believes they are able to communicate and gain favor from external deities, whether it's Jesus, Allah, Vishnu, or Satan is delusional in my eyes.  Many of these theistic devil worshippers advocate animal cruelty and acts of crime.   here is Magister Nemo talking about Greater Magic. There isn't a front, we're pretty open about what may or may not be possible and the fact that some members believe in magic. That's up you to do decide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcYWmeSkCI   You can believe what you want, but I've been through all the ranks of the COS and what you see is what you get. There are a few who believe in the power of magic beyond psychology, but they are interested in *possible* scientific explanations. I know many high ranking COS members who do not practice magic at all or purely for psychodrama. And almost none of them take Crowley seriously beyond being a poet and using some useful material for a dramatic ritual. That's it.   *Satan*   However you want to represent yourself in public is completely up to you, it doesn't make you any more or less a Satanist. I've always enjoyed your responses here, but that's your call.    I was in touch with a few of the mods throughout the AMA, they were very helpful and even supported many of my ideas.   I actually spoke to the mods and it is recommended to not start responding to questions immediately. I waited about 20 minutes before I started to respond, but my responses were *immediately* getting downvoted below the hidden threshold, so no one was seeing it. The mods were trying to fix this because they noticed a big influx of people (some say an organized Christian group) going to the thread and downvoting everything. About 40 to 45 minutes in my answers started pop up. According to some people I responded faster and more frequently than most celebrity AMA's.   "I yam what I yam and tha's all what I yam." If people were going to consider me evil, they should at least be accurate about they think I'm evil for. Maybe I'm evil for being concerned with the planet's environment. Or evil for thinking creationism shouldn't be taught in school. Shock value is important, it wakes people up. Many people can't get past that, but some people get the message and learn to apply what they've discovered about themselves productively in the real world.       "I yam what I yam and tha's all what I yam." My views *are* Satanic. Prior to LaVey the term "satanist" or "satanic" was a derogatory term, a way of denouncing a religious or political enemy, or just a general term for blasphemy, not a formulated, structured philosophy or worldview. Catholics called Protestants "satanic" and vice versa. Every so often there would be a Christian heretic who would switch sides, but they still operate under the Christian paradigm. LaVey's goal was take ownership of the term "Satanist", to make it something that stands on it's own, to apply the idea of the "Satanic" not just in terms of opposing spirituality, but in social and cultural institutions that each individual Satanist decides to reject (if any at all). Is this evil? We may disagree but I believe evil is subjective. I think it's evil that we're destroying our planet's environment. I think it's evil to teach creationism in public school. I think child abuse is evil. I have never, in the real world, been considered evil. Well, that's not true. I once got a person fired for sexual harassment and was considered to be evil for ruining someone's life over a misunderstanding. I can live with that. In fact, I can live with being called evil for all sorts of things. But at least be accurate with what you think I'm evil for.     My end goal is not to help people *in general*, it's to help myself and my loved ones. Sometimes that overlaps with helping others outside of that group. When I advocate for a secular government, sure I'm helping a wide range of religious and nonreligious groups live more comfortably in this country, but that's mainly to protect my own interests. One can expand self-interest outside of immediate rewards. Do you not feel good about helping others? Be honest with yourself, it makes you feel like a better person. That's pride, a sin other religions, not in ours.   I can certainly see a Satanist who uses Kali as a metaphor and symbol in their ritual or art in exactly the way you describe.   Personally? I believe magic is a way of using symbols and a ritual environment as a form of psychological meditation, focusing on goals, and letting go of emotional baggage. Some Satanists believe there is more to this and they are interested in researching how it can be explained with science and rationality, not spirituality.     http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php   Here's more on Satanism, occultism and paganism in general http://churchofsatan.com/faq-occultism-wicca-voodoo.php   Most neopagans I've met believe in some form of spiritual karma, that "bad" things will come back to hurt you. It's always appeared to me as basically Christian morals, minus the mythology, add in Mother Earth. I don't claim to be an expert on neopaganism though, and honestly I'm not very interested in it.    I meant neo-pagans in general that I've encountered, meant to exclude Asatru from that.   I haven't. There's such an overwhelming collection of evidence against the supernatural that I'm very comfortable with my stance.    You're underplaying the amount of self satisfaction one can gain from knowing they've improved the world. That is selfish. Everything else follows. That's right, what's right and wrong, beyond the basic doctrines, is up to the individual. If that makes you uncomfortable, that's fine. I don't think everyone is or should be a Satanist or accept Satanism.   How so? I've never heard of Mark Passio until right now. He was never the High Priest of anything, and to my knowledge not ever been a member of the Church of Satan. How would you respond to a person who claims to have been the CEO of Google though there's an overwhelming level of evidence to the contrary? Would think this is a sane person?    http://churchofsatan.com/history.php     The conspiracy that the Church of Satan is made up of corporate elites has long been debunked. http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/procter.asp   A fulfilling life. Metaphorically our egos live on in the minds of the people we've influenced and inspired.   I get to do a great deal of traveling and met some inspiring entrepreneurs in this line of work. It keeps the technical work interesting knowing that the numbers you're working represent cases of booze shipped and sold around the world. I work in data modeling and predictive analysis, which is a hot topic in the business world right now. Lots of small independent IT shops are coming out with their solutions, some are getting bought out by SAP, IBM, Microsoft, etc. The wine industry is very "traditional" in various ways, but they're catching on and adjusting. Here's an article describing the change: http://www.businessinsider.com/big-data-makes-your-wine-taste-better-2013-8   No. I do not believe in a spirit or the mind existing outside the body.   I don't worship Satan, see my OP. I don't believe in a being called Satan. Satan is a symbol, a representation mans natural instincts. We see our world and society as out of balance, so we take the symbol of the opposer, the enemy, the one who seeks to put things into balance.   I was in a bookstore and came across the Satanic Bible. It looked interesting, so I bought it and read it that same day. I agreed with everything in it, it described me and my opinions as if it was written by and old friend. I was about 15 then and I've considered myself a Satanist ever since.    Crowley has nothing to do with Satanism, he never called himself a Satanist. He started a religion called Thelema and it's more like Buddhism than anything else.    Or this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqcn_TPu4qQ   I have a couple of Therion albums somewhere, I liked them and will give it another shot. I'll definitely check out that podcast.     Oh yeah, and check out Dave Ingram's latest band, Down Among The Dead Men.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7G6j3FcWN8   1. The Church of Satan isn't interested in becoming a mainstream religion but instead promotes the work the members and maintaining the philosophy of Satanism in general. It's possible that at some point in the future Satanism will be a more understood religion, with more public figures coming out as Satanists. For example, there's Jacob Appelbaum as an open, public Satanist, and he's applied the Satanic sense of freedom to his work at Wikileaks.     2. I'd like to see it push secularism, but I rather see individuals Satanists advance their goals in the real world than the organization or philosophy itself.  3.  The only political agenda the Church of Satan has is to push for secularism and taxation on all religious organizations, along with some social and cultural programs (total environments, artificial human companions). See here: http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php    http://churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php       There are Satanists who are Freemasons, the ideas are not mutually exclusive.     I'm not a big beer drinker, I prefer scotch. But I recently visited The Lost Abbey brewery and enjoyed their selection. Their Inferno Ale was delicious and I brought home a few bottles! How about yourself?   No idea, honestly. I think they like to call themselves Luciferians or Theistic Satanists, but it's inconsistent and usually just whatever that person thinks sounds cool.   I spent years going to Coney Island High, The Wetlands, CBGB's and worked with the likes of Deicide, Emperor, Cannibal Corpse, Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Hate Eternal, Morbid Angel... I'm pretty burnt out on that stuff...    Nowadays I prefer drones over blast beats.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whIp7fsfQ1g     I'm in the middle of updating Radio Free Satan right now, you might be interested in these shows:    http://www.radiofreesatan.com/the-metal-grotto-034/    This month on The Metal Grotto, Citizen JNothing brings you the metal sounds of Goatwhore, Nile, King of Asgard, Death Breath, Entombed, Lazarus AD, Cradle Of Filth (covering a Slayer tune), Erupted, Aeon, Gojira, Psycroptic, and finishes off with some Fecal Corpse.     Or this one, hosted by Church of Satan member Dave Ingram, former vocalist for Bolt Thrower   http://www.radiofreesatan.com/metal-breakfast-radio-episode-29-8/    Back with a bang, or is it a whimper? Either way, we return with a new episode for our lovely listeners, fabulous fans, and the rest of you gorgeous gits. First half sees submitted bands through the sniper's scope - with a surprise money shot at the end. Second half is all about David, since we didn't get to celebrate his birthday properly. He chooses these ones, much to Donovan's chagrin. Or poor taste in music. It's definitely not self-depreciating rubbish. On it you can hear: OBLIVION, EKSPOSISI, SEVERITY, CRYPTIC BLOOD, SLAUGHTERDAY, SERPENT EATER, BLOOD LABEL, MORFIN, SPEWTILATOR, CANCEROUS WOMB, DESTRUCTOR, DISCHARGE, THE ACCUSED, VOIVOD, VENOM, BATHORY, POSSESSED, RAZOR, BOLT THROWER and THE VANDALS.    Probably closer to libertarianism. It's a hierarchy. If that scenario provided me with a greater level of satisfaction than pain, or if I personally enjoyed pain, then sure. I don't see that happening for myself.   Here's Peter Gilmore on Godzilla   http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php    "Godzilla anthropomorphizes Nature by giving a consciousness to such vast and terrible powers that dwarf us, showing us how truly insignificant we are, personally and as a species. And that such a threat could possibly focus on us intentionally, rather than being something mindlessly passing dreadfully near, amplifies its might. Godzillas presence emphasizes ephemeral humanity."   I would consider myself most closely aligned with the Libertarian platform.   I never met Zeena but it's pretty obvious that she has an ax to grind against her father. No I don't feel brainwashed.    A Priest/Reverend has the authority to speak for the Church of Satan and represent Satanism. The High Priest and Priestess are aware of this thread, I'm in regular contact with them.   The Church of Satan actually has a SETI@home team http://www.churchofsatan.com/cos-seti-team.php     I'm personally intrigued by the idea of the possibilities of life on other planets and it would help explain our own origins. Our religion seeks to understand the world as it is, within the realm of science, so this is certainly of interest to Satanists.   I don't. It's not work, it's an honorary title.   We do think of the children... we leave them alone for their parents to deal with. We raise our own children without religion and let them decide what they want to believe when they reach maturity. If a child is in danger I imagine a Satanist would not hesitate to contact the authorities.  For specifics see this:  http://churchofsatan.com/faq-young-people-satanism.php   I think they're delusional at best, potentially criminally violent at worst.   Yes, I have it on DVD.   It's god damn rainbow coalition! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlOtvDFjx0   You mean, something like, The Satanic Bible? http://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Bible-Anton-Szandor-Lavey/dp/0380015390   My favorite metal band would have to be ISIS    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWTAkBRe6aI feature=kp     "Satanic" metal isn't really my cup of tea, but I've enjoyed GHOST BC.   Mostly electronic music of all sorts. I do an ambient and experimental music podcast here http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/     Some recent artists I've listened to: Jesu, Grimes, Youth Code, Boris, Vatican Shadow, Ulver, David E. Williams, Zombi, Godflesh, Dalek, Little Dragon, M83, Zola Jesus, Skream, Burial, Massive Attack     But I also love soundtrack music, I just ordered a bunch of records from Death Waltz Records: http://deathwaltzrecordingcompany.com/        Being individualistic does not mean you refuse to work with others. It can mean you only work the those who share your goals. The Church of Satan can provide that network, if you want it. You're not a lesser Satanist if you don't join the organization, and a Satanist can "join" just a form of respect and appreciation and never contact another Satanist.    Here's an article by Peter Gilmore dedicated to Godzilla   http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php   "Godzilla anthropomorphizes Nature by giving a consciousness to such vast and terrible powers that dwarf us, showing us how truly insignificant we are, personally and as a species. And that such a threat could possibly focus on us intentionally, rather than being something mindlessly passing dreadfully near, amplifies its might. Godzillas presence emphasizes ephemeral humanity."   He's got quite the collection of Kaiju toys. Here's his article dedicated to Godzilla http://www.churchofsatan.com/godzilla.php   If this occurs after the lifetime of the Satanist then it doesn't negate the satisfaction he or she received in their initial act.   If that was an issue I'm interested in fighting against I would condemn the political institutions that protect sex trafficking, including the religious institutions involved in Bacha bazi.    http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/  I know a couple of Satanist who work with child protective services and counseling, that's another way of applying the Satanic idea of respecting children.    Here's a book with a collection of stories from Satanic women where all proceeds are donated to The National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center.   http://www.lulu.com/shop/ann-oxyer/lilith-awakened/paperback/product-20405605.html;jsessionid=F4DD97BE10B6525BDD8F68BA75FA80B4   I have no idea what these groups are. I met Leyba when he first came out with Coyote Satan Amerika. We were in touch for a while, but we had a falling out. Do members leave or get kicked out? Sure, but I'm not seeing anything significant in terms of a "schism".    I have no idea what the membership count is, and the Church of Satan does not disclose it. What I do know is that the Central Office is constantly processing memberships, responding to media contacts, and following up with active members.    There is only one High Priest at any given moment, currently it is Peter Gilmore. Where are you getting these ideas from? LaVey stopped doing public performances in the 70's. He never meant for Satanists to do anything "in the name of the Church" other than apply Satanism in their everyday productive lives. The idea that this somehow "changed" when he died is inaccurate.  Here's a video of the 6/6/6 Satanic Mass.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM  Here's a video of a lecture at the Maryland Institute College of Art https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpI_TvJXc84    Here's the successful kickstarter campaign for a Spanish translation of the Satanic Scriptures    https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kevinislaughter/las-escrituras-satanicas-the-satanic-scriptures-in    Listen to Magister Coop talk Satanism, art, and rock and roll on WTFPod   http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_318_-_coop    The Church of Satan does not see a penny from sales of the Satanic Bible. Royalties of the book go to LaVey's children and his former partner, none of whom are involved with the Church of Satan.   What's a good pair of shoes run you these days? If $200 is going to break your bank then don't join. The Church of Satan actually rejects applications and refunds money very regularly. http://imgur.com/E1BPd    It doesn't "bother" me, but it's disappointing. It doesn't change anything either way.   Seems like Kanye West is wearing clothing from Actual Pain, a clothing label that uses Satanic and other occult imagery. http://lineout.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2011/02/25/kanye-in-actual-painactual-pain-in-cross    I was walking around the shops in LA a few weeks ago and noticed an increasing amount of Satanic imagery in high fashion shops. My wife picked up a few pieces she found interesting. I think this part of what makes True Detective such a hit show right now. If this trend means I get better TV to watch, my wife gets sexy clothes, and I can get vinyl reprints of horror movie records then I'm happy.   1. Kooks come in all shapes and colors. Not worth your time trying to sort him out.    2. I've encountered a number of drugged addicted morons in metal bands who think they're in communication with demons. I quickly distance myself from anyone like that.   Had a decent enough time with this, even answered some fun and thoughtful questions.    Good is what I like, evil is what I don't like. You're assuming that "good" comes from a divine source, that is a first principle I do not accept so everything from that point cannot be reconciled.    Here are some more answers    http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/    http://www.reddit.com/user/train_subject9915/   Never been a fan of either! Well before my time, both of them!   1. Most Satanists I know believe in subjective morality. We a few baseline morals (more like guidelines) but beyond that we are left to decide and incorporate any moral system that best suits us.   2. Yes, I'm an atheist. What is Christian morality? It was once moral for Christians to own slaves and kill their children. Obviously this doesn't apply today (for the most part...) but that would mean Christian morality is subjective to the cultural norms of the the time. I'm open to the debate that certain morals are consistent throughout cultures because they establish a basis for civilization and is innate. See the Wason selection task.   3. Most Satanists I know could be described as social liberals and fiscal conservatives, or just plain Libertarians. I know one who considers himself borderline socialist, and others who have no political interest at all. The only political agenda that the Church of Satan works towards is secularization of the state and taxation on all religious institutions.    4. There are no "meetings." Many Satanists are performers, artists, musicians, and writers and the Church of Satan will promote the concerts and events of these people that's what they want. At those events other Satanists who share those interests might show up. But Satanists have a wide range of interests, so it's not some universal gathering.   5. A priest does not have a "function", it's just an honorary title that means the Church of Satan approves of me representing the Satanic philosophy in public *if I choose to do so*.     6. I put up a tree, send greeting cards to friends and family, and exchange gifts. I prefer to refer as Yule. Here's the latest Yule greeting from the Church of Satan http://churchofsatannews.tumblr.com/post/70660015798/superlative-solstice   Yes, that was one of my events! Blood Axis, Changes, and Dream Into Dust. At the time I was part of TESCO USA. You probably saw me there, and that was the same bar I had drinks with Peter Gilmore at. Did you enjoy the performance? If you're interested in more of the same follow me on Twitter, I'll be doing another event in NYC in October. https://twitter.com/InvisibleWar   Odinism can be seen as a noble form of Satanism. I'm close friends with several Satanists who use Norse gods for their symbolism.    If working towards a better tomorrow gives a Satanist personal satisfaction today then this is very much in-line with our selfish philosophy.   http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php "We do not hold, as do the Objectivists that the universe is benevolent. Satanists view the world as neutral, beyond the concepts of benevolent or treacherous, good or evil. Satanism enables the Satanist to codify his life beyond the ethical and metaphysical straightjacket which Objectivism unfortunately offers. This is not written to attack Objectivism but merely to clarify the areas of difference.  Satanism drew from Objectivism as even Rand drew from others. Both are, however, unique. Both are different from the other."   By achieving real world accomplishments.   I have this on VHS!   Much of this has been answered here http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/    http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php   1. No, we do not believe in any supernatural forces. http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php  2. I've never had an issue.   3. We don't meet as an organization, but some Satanists will support the concerts, events, art galley openings of other Satanists who share their interests.   4. My birthday.    http://churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php   No.   I can't say that "love our fellow man". I think people need to earn my love, and doesn't come easy. That doesn't mean I'm not polite or respectful in public. We do not advocate human or animal sacrifice of any kind and will promptly report people to the authorities if we get any sign of that.  	126
 It was a really a last minute decision. I didnt really know what to expect, or where to even go (ended up having to look up directions). The very existence of the event put me into a situation where I would have to make a choice. I could either stay home, depressed. Or, I could go and be depressed there. But if I went, I knew that there was just a tiny chance that I may have a somewhat enjoyable experience. On the way there, I was less concerned with having a good time, and more worried about not having a bad time. I arrived at the school and parked my car. For a moment, I just sat there, watching my hands shake. After a few minutes, I got out of my car and walked inside alone, irrationally hoping I wouldnt leave the same way.  It was relatively quiet when I came into the dim, but beautifully decorated gym- save for the thump of the obnoxious music that nobody was dancing to yet. I had a seat at a table and took my jacket off. I remained that way for another forty minutes or so, watching the gym slowly fill. Someone came by and offered me some juice off of a platter he was carrying around, like some old school waiter youd see in a fancy restaurant. I mumbled, thank you as I took one. I wasnt sure if he heard me. For a while, I just stared at a little electric candle that had been placed on my table. I think its glow was comforting. By now, the gym looked like one would expect it to, lively and loud. I just sat and watched. There were a lot of people I knew- a few I didn't. All of them seemed happy, and for a moment, that made me happy. I knew that I wasn't going to dance. I knew that I wasn't going to leave my seat. I thought to myself, Why are you here? Whats the point? I flicked my empty juice box a few times out of boredom. Thats a good question, I thought. With that, I put my jacket back on and walked out.  As I was almost out of the building, a teacher I knew well said hi to me, and I said the same to him. A couple I knew was just heading into the building. The guy, whom I did know relatively well, said hello to me as well, and I to him. Wait, you aren't leaving already, are you? he said to me as I walked past. Suddenly embarrassed, I just sort of mumbled, I was just, uh... The teacher, who I suppose realized my plight, chimed in with, getting some fresh air? Yeah, sure, I said. And with that, I walked back inside with the couple.  I ended up back in my seat, bored once again. As I sat there, watching little red and green lights fly across the floor like snow in headlights, I came to believe that this whole event was just an immediate example of a cycle that had been occurring throughout my entire life- a cycle of unrealistic hope, followed by crushing reality. Not much happened throughout the night. A girl, whom, I must say was quite beautiful, offered to dance with me, but it was a pursuit in futility, as my anxious mind simply would not allow it. Why couldn't it have been something else, why could she not have offered to have coffee with me or something? Just something a bit less embarrassing, I suppose? But of course, I knew that I would probably screw that up as well somehow, just like everything else. The only reason she probably asked me in the first place was pity anyway.  The night continued fairly uneventfully. The one thing I recall clearly was the one couple that I could see gently swaying together just ahead of me. They seemed entirely absorbed in each others embrace. They didnt seem to hear the music, or the yelling, or the chatter of those around them. When I saw them, I could tell that they truly loved each other. Despite my stupid envy, I could see that what they were experiencing was really, truly, beautiful.  I knew that I would never have that.    It was a really a last minute decision. I didnt really know what to expect, or where to even go (ended up having to look up directions).

When I saw them, I could tell that they truly loved each other. Despite my stupid envy, I could see that what they were experiencing was really, truly, beautiful.   I knew that I would never have that.     I'd recommend that you also contact a principle or superintendent. It might not accomplish much, considering that this is Georgia we're talking about, but it could certainly draw some attention to the issue. You could even try to contact local news stations about it if you'd feel so inclined. Anything that draws attention to the situation will put pressure on the school to resolve it.   I am 18 and I'll graduate high school in May. I've always been an "artsy" sort of person, so I know that my career will be somewhere in that sort of field. Originally, I wanted to become involved with the gaming industry as a 3d modeller or concept artist. To achieve this, my first plan was to go to Full Sail University in Florida, as they apparently have a 'game art program'. Well.. evidentely, for-profit colleges tend to not have a great repuation and Full Sail wasn't regionally accreditted, and my parents shot down the idea anyway, saying that we wouldn't be able to afford it. There were a few other colleges that I was interested in, but my parents didn't like any of them, claiming that they were all too far away or too expensive, or that we wouldn't be able to get a loan for it. Not that my parents would be paying for it entirely or anything- it would be more of a combined effort for both me and my parents. Anyway, my dad has always wanted me to go to a local community college to get a liberal arts degree before possibly transferring to somewhere else, possibly an art school. The only college we ended up visiting was that community college, and in all honesty, it doesn't seem too bad- but I just feel like I'd be sort of biding my time. It's really too late for me to go to any other college, as I've missed any visitation days and whatnot. I'm almost done with high school, and, let's be honest most of high school is general education. I don't know of course, but I feel like getting a liberal arts degree would be like going to high school for another two years. So, I had an idea. What if I just scrapped the idea of college altogether, and opened up my own shop? Like one of those nifty little downtown shops that sell crafts and artsy sort of stuff- like my own gallery, in a way. If I was in a touristy area I bet I could sell some of my paintings to rich tourists and old people. What if I made it into a sort of coffee shop kind of place, where you could get a cuppacino and look at (possibly buy?) the art I'd have hanging on the walls. I could try to get a hold of lawyer to help with legal stuff and I could try to get started with a small business loan. I don't have much money, but I've made a little working as a cashier after school that might help a bit. I also wouldn't have any student debts to pay off. I've done a lot of thinking (and probably romanticising) about it. As long as I could pay my bills and make a living, I think I could be happy. Is this sort of thing reasonable, or am I just being stupid?  	4
 I'd argue it is very hard growing up in Western culture and not know anything about religion.   I would have no problem with religion if people wouldn't believe it.   Of course there is a heat shield,I forgot to mention it.   Good idea, thanks   I am currently designing a lightweight escape pod for two Kerbals, basically seats on a cubic strut with a parachute with fairings (but I don't think they're necessary now). now I have to just solve the stabilization during activating small separating boosters, because it tends to spin instead of keep firing retrograde.   You did good. Some people created a dumbfuck religion out of it and try to make it last as long as possible - blame them for that we do not know yet what happens.   /r/Amitjokes      Keep the tip.   What does a leper say to a prostitute?   *opens the PM image link*  I knew it.                                             I am tasked with translating this but I can't seem to find it anywhere.  Provost Day is an event during which students can take part in some sport activities and so on.      halp  sweaty palms  6 hours straight  it got hard                                             As Cooper is falling in the black hole (or is it already *somewhere else*?) we can see he is falling towards [a spherical structure](http://i.imgur.com/vFciagz.jpg). Given his relative size to [the space of the tesseract](http://i.imgur.com/LD4OvfQ.jpg) and assuming a "chamber" in there is taken as a cubic space with every side being one clearly visible rectangle (or mabe rather the dimensions of Murph's room), I'd assume it could be estimated how many "chambers" there were, but I can't do the math.   "Probably a dozen times since their deaths I've heard my mother or father, in a conversational tone of voice, call my name. Of course they called to me often during my life with them  to do a chore, to remind me of a responsibility, to come to dinner, to engage in conversation, to hear about an event of the day. I still miss them so much that it doesn't seem at all strange that my brain will occasionally retrieve a lucid recollection of their voices."  Just thought it would be nice to point it out, since Google search turns out twisted versions of this quote.      For me it is a horrible/overly complex UI. That is the reason why I do not play many strategies/MMOs, I just want to have fun without having to learn what all buttons do and so on. But if I immediately think the game is worth it, of course I can sacrifice the time learning it.   One of my cats purrs very easily and so I can clearly hear changes in purring, and I noticed about 3 "levels" of purr she gives off depending on the amount of her satisfaction and contentment. The usual purr can then be accompanied by a "deeper" purr or even another sound.            be overtaken by the tree roots and change back into the library?

Almost all of my EPL bases are on planets (and one is in orbit above Kerbin), but I haven't as of yet tried to make a functional base on an asteroid. I am not sure if it can be mined without additional plugins (and screw realism, infinite fuel asteroid deposit ftw). Can it?                  I have built a base on Duna, but I can't get the converter to convert. There is everything - drill, karbonite tanks, pipes and so on - but the damn thing is stubborn as Jeb. I have tried various pipe flows but it doesn't help. Isn't there a mod which makes it work automatically? [ Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/RHH1wkp.jpg)                           I want to buy it, but I am not sure about this.   I saw some bottles of cider in Tesco and thought it would be nice to drink some again, so I bought a few, but it gave me  tummy ache and a little bit of diarrhea and I was lying in bed all day. Is cider supposed to do that? Poor Applejack.                  I remember nothing else about it, but I saw it maybe 15 years ago            Hi, just a quick question, in some games (currently Just Cause 2) VLC's global keybinding doesn't work. I like to listen to my music instead of in-game music and while it is just a matter of alt-tabbing for 2 secs to make it work and then going switching back to the game, it disrupts the experience. Does anyone know a solution?               I mean, it is fun to have your rovers jumping, tubmling and exploding, but if you seriously need to get somewhere far it is a nightmare, as the rover easily slides. Is there a mod which improves that?                        Firstly, some of you may criticize me for this, but I mean no harm - I was browsing FB and look at some dude's profile and there was [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/Zp0JW6k.jpg) of him with his girlfriend. It made me happy for them.  Most people would consider them rather... not pretty, but they don't mind. They found each other, and you can really see their happiness. There is hope for every one of us.                           It has this adventurous feel, almost nostalgic. Why is it so obsure, I heard about this twice (the first time I forgot about it).      I just saw a ultrasound photo on my feed from my other cousin.         The other day I bought a carrot and when I turned a corner to a dark alleyway it hopped out of the bag, pushed me on the ground and brutally beat me up while laughing evily.                        In Pale Blue Dot Carl mentions his colleague who visited New Guinea highlands and found a tribe that was ignorant about technology but not about the Moon landing and the astronauts. I googled, but I can't seem to find what tribe it was. Can you help me?                                       As of now, shockwaves are only a visual effect and I think that's a pity. It wouldn't have to create a chain reaction, just disassemble things in proximity and push them away (or just push away if more distant). I kind of miss this feature. I googled but to no avail.      I built an EPL base on Minmus, but I cannot use it properly because there are two fuel ducts endpoints above the launchpad left over from positioning it and they clip with vessels and fuck shit up. Can't grab them and I doubt I can shatter/smash them with robotic arms. I set up a second launchpad, but I don't want to abandon this one.  [Look](http://i.imgur.com/MEQLMqd.jpg)      Upon "finishing" my 0.90 career mode, I started a new game with a couple of other mods, namely Karbonite, Extraplanetary Launchpads, and SCANSat so I try building fully self-sufficient bases elsewhere and explore the system more easily.  I have finally understood how those work, but I am having problems setting the SCANSat big map to the resources mode. It just still displays altitude map. I have sent a probe with both Magnetometer and SAR detector in a polar orbit of Minmus (I don't know whether SCANSat detector is enough). Do I have to activate the magnetometer? It didn't show the option before activating the detector, but activating the detector keeps my energy drained at 0.01, so I have no way to check, because it won't let me.                       I fail to see any reason why it would not be possible, but I haven't tried it yet. The transfer rates should be high enough for it to function.   There was a scheduled whatnot with the central heating in our building, he was one of the workers that came here. I did not expect that at all, I was in a bad mood and it made me very happy to see him. I love meeting my old friends. :')   http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73983-0-23-Released-ScienceAlert-1-3-Experiment-availability-feedback-%28updated-Apr-7%29  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-0-90-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-0-1  in preparation for 1.0 try karbonite  http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/89401                  http://i.imgur.com/CbrDo9J.jpg  I am just curious, because it must be fucking hilarious.                        Specifically, I think of how much would Sun bulge if it was orbiting the Earth and not the other way around.            Often I have problems with the scale of this game and I think "Wait, real galaxies have fucking lots of stars, but it can't be this much.". I am in disbelief when I fly across any galaxy.   http://i.imgur.com/WdzdfVG.jpg        	186
 ...but should not be mandatory.  Yes it should me mandatory.  Why wouldn't it be mandatory?  It is relevant information for a potential partner.  While some may say it is irrelevant, and if the person otherwise likes them, why tell?  I submit it is relevant because it is not for one person to decide what should or should not be important to the other person.    Yeah, I wish people were more chill about it all but in the end it has to be for them to decide.      That is outstanding voter turnout!  Sure 100% (or near enough) participation would be ideal but compared to most democracies (real ones, not the 100% turnout in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) that turnout seems really good.  It blows the doors off of US voter turnout.     Flash is pretty OP.  He needs to be nerfed.  (Note:  It has been a long time since I read the comics so maybe he got one...at one point Flash seemed pretty much an "I win" button.)    Isn't that true of pretty much every superhero (good or bad) versus Batman?  Batman's gig is being prepared for any (or most) contingencies.  He will outsmart the other guy.  That is not to say Batman is actually smarter (although in many cases he is) but rather he is good at luring his opponents into the situation he wants them in.  Where other superheroes overpower people Batman tricks or outsmarts them.  It's kinda like saying you have a howitzer and I have a pistol.  You would have the bigger gun but that is not necessarily a win button.    This vote had 84% (or better) participation.  I am curious how much participation there is in other, more general (or common/usual) votes from Scotland.  I am really asking.  If there is one thing we see in the US regarding having a shitty government it is horridly low turnout rates in elections.  There is a reason conservatives work relentlessly to disenfranchise certain voting blocks every chance they get (in the US).  If the US had 84% turnout rates for every election our congressional makeup would be dramatically different.  Would the same be true in the UK?  (Again, really asking.)   Relevant: http://i.imgur.com/ky2L05E.jpg    To be fair prior to TDK there was no good reason to suppose that Heath Ledger would make a good Joker.  He had some great roles (notably in Brokeback Mountain) but as the Joker?  I was not seeing it at all.  While I was not posting about it I did not have high hopes either.  Ledger blew me away with his performance.  It was truly outstanding IMO and I was more than pleasantly surprised.    See: [The Agamemnon Contingency](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ2IpJyapG8)  In short Batman has plans in place to defeat every member of the Justice League.    But if a girl falsely claims rape or goes after for bullshit child support like this, there's not much defense for many men.  I may be wrong but I think it is not the woman going for child support but rather the state.  The woman has sought public assistance.  The state, in an effort to lower the costs of such assistance has taken to tracking down the fathers of these children and forcing them to pay.  This case is clearly an injustice but I think the state welfare agency is blind to circumstances.  It wants its money back, it identifies the father and that is the end of it to them.     I've never met a straw feminist.  [Catherine MacKinnon](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Catharine_MacKinnon) and [Andrea Dworkin](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/andrea_dworkin.html) leap to mind.  While you may have not met them they are feminists with a national (or even international) stage, have published numerous well selling books and regularly give speeches to large groups.  EDIT to add:  I provide examples of nationally known famous feminists (not fringe by a long shot) of the type the poster says he/she has never met and I get downvoted?  If he/she wants to say "they hardly represent feminism" then who does by their reckoning?  Certainly there is a continuum and no one person can be said to represent the larger group.  The reality is MacKinnon and Dworkin are/were at the forefront of these issues and certainly sold a helluva lot of books to someone as well as drawing large groups to hear them speak.  They are not "fringe".    I've never, ever met a feminist who wasn't totally pleasant, rational, or who lies about being threatened with rape or anything like that.  I do not think they are lying.  I do wonder though how real these threats are.  Anyone who has played online or engaged in a comments section of countless websites (YouTube in particular) has probably had vile things said to them and been threatened.  It is despicable to be sure but it is also common and usual and done regardless if you are a female or a male.  If these women are seriously worried about these threats then they need to be on the phone to the local police and perhaps the FBI to report these incidents and perhaps get police protection.  They should see to it that the police zealously pursue the people in question.  It really should not be too hard for the police to track these people down.  [Issuing threats is a crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_threatening).       The main benefit usually comes in the form of more content.  Mass Effect 3 had a main character added as part of a pre-order bonus.  While I find the practice reprehensible I had become so invested in MA that I kinda felt obliged.  Sucks but there it is (I feel dirty).     I was of the opinion that pre-ordering was a dumb idea but I admit I caved on occasion (with Mass Effect 3 and Rome II in particular).  There were some others as well and I got burned a few times but Rome II was the last straw for me.  I have not pre-ordered since.  That said I might fall of the wagon and pre-order again sometime in the future (never say never) and I figure if any game will get me to do it Witcher 3 will be the one.  I trust they are in it to please their base and care about their rep.  For the most part I am off pre-ordering though and it was Rome II that cinched it for me.  I can say with reasonable certainty I will never pre-order another Total War game ever again.    Beats headphones are not exactly *bad* headphones but they are very bass heavy and very overpriced for what you are getting.  In the same price range you can find much better options or get something as good for less).  - http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/monster-beats-dr-dre-solo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=uj0S2rgmu-M#t=294 - http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/05/are-beats-by-dr-dre-headphones-worth-the-money/index.htm    Do you mean 60% margins? Because 60% market share would be enormous in the "premium" headphone industry.  Nope...it is almost 60% market share:  The numbers are astonishing. According to a recent piece in the Wall Street Journal, Beats revenues increased fivefold between 2010 and 2012 alone, hitting the $1 billion mark. As of this summer, some 59 percent of high-end headphones sold in the U.S. bear the Beats logo. All this despite the fact that the audiophile press has often viewed Beats as underwhelmingor worseand overpriced. [SOURCE](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/09/beats_by_dre_market_share_how_the_headphones_company_conquered_the_market.html)  What I did not realize till reading that article is that Beats is also affiliated with Monster...the company that sells outrageously overpriced cables hyped to provide all sorts of benefits when in reality they are no better than cables at small fractions of their cost.  Now Beats makes sense as more of the same.  Over priced hype that does not deliver compared to other options in the same price range.  Every time I see someone on the train wearing Beats I want to point and laugh.  EDIT to add: This recent video by Marques Brownlee, [The Truth About Beats by Dre!,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsxQxS0AdBY list=UUBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ) claims Beats has 64% of the market.      As too often happens the choice is not to vote "for" someone but to vote against someone.  You may not like Clinton but would you really rather pull the lever for (say) a Romney/Palin ticket?        [Red Lobster standing by](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2011/01/dogfort.jpg)    I wish I was happy.  Truly happy.  Now you might say, "*POOF* You are in a box but at least you are happy!"  Well, sounds ok to me.  I mean if I am really and truly happy in that box then why not?   Not just because it isn't a priority, but also because there's no way to get the majority of the house and the senate and the states to agree on something this controversial   Maybe or maybe not.  More than a few conservatives have been primaried out of their seats by Tea Party faithful with the backing of serious outside money.  Enough to scare the ones who are left.  Being an incumbent is a huge advantage but one that is seriously minimized with no limit to outside money.  Congresscritters would rather get back to the good old days of safe seats.  As for the states I have seen nothing to suggest the public is anything but pissed at Citizen's United.    You are prosecuted by the state.  It only matters what his wife wants inasmuch as they may not be able to build a case without her.  But if there are witnesses (or in this case video footage) of a crime being committed then they do not need the victim to cooperate and the victim saying they do not want to press charges does not make the crime go away.     Pretty much this and what /u/forresja said.  You could be in an all woman office and show nude breasts and someone might get fussed about it.  Whether that is right or wrong is another discussion.  The NSFW tag is there to let people know something on the other end *might* be considered offensive by some and could be problematic if viewed at work and someone else sees the screen.  I am making no value judgement on it.  Personally I think the link is barely NSFW and far from porn or being titillating.  Others might have a different opinion though hence the warning.    We do not and cannot know, with certainty, that free will exists.  We operate on the assumption it does.  If it didn't we'd have the question the OP poses.  Why throw someone in jail if they have no choice in what they are doing?  It'd be akin to punishing a glass for breaking when it is dropped.  It would be silly.    Adding a deterrent is like pulling the lever that switches the tracks. The trains actions are still deterministic, but that doesn't preclude responding to inputs.   That still is not free will.  If you show me the color green and I walk and show me the color red and I stop I am responding to inputs but I do not have free will.  If the train (in your example) can make a decision of its own accord as to whether the switch ahead gets flipped or not then the train could be said to have free will.  If that is the case though then the OP's question does not make sense.   I'm not completely sold on my own opinion though, so that's why I would like to see other thoughts about this.  In most of the US going topless is [already legal for women](http://gotopless.org/topless-laws).    Here are a bunch of pictures of [women in New York celebrating their right to go topless](http://www.ryot.org/photos-its-legal-to-go-topless-in-nyc-and-these-women-are-celebrating-it/570053) (NSFW).  In Europe there is even less of a stigma for going topless and they are pretty chilled out about it most places.    I am adopted and the way it used to work was when the woman decided on putting her child up for adoption she'd contact an agency and all the medical bills would be taken care of.  The agency of course would get to put the child up for adoption.  Maybe things have changed but seems like a good way to go about it.    Re-directed walking blew my mind.  I used to wonder how people could use the holodeck without bumping into walls.  Now I know.  Clever stuff!    I wasn't wired like that but my parents made it abundantly clear what behavior was a expected of me. Of course I pushed the limits of that and I think it took two trips outside the restaurant (separate occasions ) for a serious chewing out to learn they were very serious.   To this day I hate it when people order coffee after dinner. I'll still sit and wait politely though.    For those not aware (although is there anyone who hasn't seen it over the age of eight?): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQg7QKDButo        It is not that nobody expects him to work after he is out of office.  It is the revolving door that congresscritters get from business.  Do their bidding and whatever happens they'll be sure to get a soft landing.  Exactly what expertise does Cantor being to an investment banking firm?  Before he was in congress he did legal work on real estate and not much of that.  He has been a politician for over 20 years.  So why is he worth $3.5 million with that resume?   Was she or had she ever been a public servant before then?  Did she sell her vote?       The writer loses a lot of credibility by calling the accommodation plan a scheme.  I agree it is not a well done headline.  That said "scheme" does not have to mean underhanded.  It can simply mean "a plan".       Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  At the end we learn they cannot kill Skynet because Skynet is everywhere, in all computers around the planet.  Skynet then proceeds to nuke most of the planet rendering most computers inoperable (blown-up, EMP or even no more power).  In short, Skynet lobotomized itself or worse (it probably killed about 99% of its brain power doing that).    You are correct that there is no way in hell politicians will do this on their own.  The only possible solution is a constitutional convention.     Is there a Field of View selection now?  I played the first Metro for about 30 minutes and gave up because it made me physically ill due to the narrow FoV.  If that ain't fixed I'm never going back.    edit: oh please, comparing immigration laws to racial segregation is preposterous.   Anti-immigration xenophobia is as inherently racist as it gets.  Hiding behind the law does not change that.    Your "source" is anecdotal and as a result tells us nothing.  - While people of color make up about 30 percent of the United States population, they account for 60 percent of those imprisoned. The prison population grew by 700 percent from 1970 to 2005, a rate that is outpacing crime and population rates. The incarceration rates disproportionately impact men of color: 1 in every 15 African American men and 1 in every 36 Hispanic men are incarcerated in comparison to 1 in every 106 white men.   - Students of color face harsher punishments in school than their white peers, leading to a higher number of youth of color incarcerated. Black and Hispanic students represent more than 70 percent of those involved in school-related arrests or referrals to law enforcement. Currently, African Americans make up two-fifths and Hispanics one-fifth of confined youth today.

Chlorine is deadly (it was used in WWI in gas attacks...nasty, nasty stuff).  Sodium is highly reactive.  Add a little water and [sodium ignites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=0QaaUw7B_js#t=245).    Who the hell in their right mind would EVER let their kid near such horrible stuff!?    There is nothing racist or nationalist about supporting the enforcement of your country's laws.  Except when those laws are applied in a distinctly skewed fashion.  Do you really think the laws are applied evenly?    I love seeing couples like this.  There is someone for everyone.  Finding them is the trick.     I agree they are terrible for the environment...but they are still more convenient.  The question no one seems to be asking is are paper bags worse for the environment?  I know the knee jerk reaction is paper is biodegradable and "natural" so therefore are better than a petroleum product (i.e. plastic bags).  Thing is you need to consider the whole process and not just the end result in a landfill.  Paper is terrible on several counts.  You need to chop down trees to make it (bad) and paper production is far, far more energy intensive than making a plastic bag.  Further, in many cases, paper production uses large quantities of chemicals that are bad for the environment.  When you put it all together the plastic bag is by far the "greener" product save for its bad habit of not degrading in a landfill.  Some will say use a cloth bag and bring it to the store.  That is fine for many people but for others (including me) that is problematic.  I shop on my way home from work.  I commute via mass transit and stop at the store on my way home.  I am not likely to be carrying shopping bags with me everywhere I go so I can use them at the end of the day nor do I want to walk all the way home, get my bags then backtrack to go shopping and backtrack again to home.  EDIT to add:  Not sure why the downvotes.  I can only assume it is a kneejerk reaction that plastic=bad.  Well, you are right, plastic is an environmental problem.  No doubt.  But then so too is paper.    - Causes pollution: Paper production emits air pollution, specifically 70 percent more pollution than the production of plastic bags [source: Thompson]. According to certain studies, manufacturing paper emits 80 percent more greenhouse gases [source: Lilienfield]. And, consider that making paper uses trees that, instead, could be absorbing carbon dioxide. The paper bag making process also results in 50 times more water pollutants than making plastic bags [source: Thompson]. - Consumes energy: Even though petroleum goes into making plastic, it turns out that making a paper bag consumes four times as much energy as making a plastic bag, meaning making paper consumes a good deal of fuel [source: reusablebags.com]. - Consumes water: The production of paper bags uses three times the amount of water it takes to make plastic bags [source: Lilienfield]. - Inefficient recycling: The process of recycling paper can be inefficient -- often consuming more fuel than it would take to make a new bag [source: Milstein]. In addition, it takes about 91 percent more energy to recycle a pound of paper than a pound of plastic [source: reusablebags.com]. - Produces waste: According to some measures, paper bags generate 80 percent more solid waste [source: Lilienfield]. - Biodegrading difficulties: Surprisingly, the EPA has stated that in landfills, paper doesn't degrade all that much faster than plastics [source: Lilienfield].**** [SOURCE](http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/paper-plastic1.htm)   When I got married my (soon to be) wife got me a computer from [Falcon Northwest](http://www.falcon-nw.com/).  These guys preceded Alienware by a good margin and did boutique PC builds right.  Their stuff is great.  Can you build a comparable PC cheaper?  You bet!  You always can.  That said the build quality and *especially* the support from Falcon were superb.    I have since taken to building my own PCs and that is really the only way to go for high end rigs BUT if you can't be arsed to do that and/or you want the support and warranty (and have money to burn) then I am not sure you can do much better than Falcon Northwest.  They've been quietly doing their thing for over 20 years.    Sounds like my Ex  "El_Gringo" suggests you are a male.  For this to work you'd need to be gay.  That's fine, just trying to be clear about this.   I wonder if there is an issue that the monster needs to kill the Medic (or whatever you call the healer on the team) first.  As the video shows it seems there is no other worthwhile play for the monster than to go after the medic when the whole group confronts you.     I live in Chicago which has some fantastic steak houses.  At all of these everything is ala carte.  Put another way if you only order a steak you get a plate with a steak on it and nothing else.  All sides are extra.  - Smith and Wollensky (a chain in several US cities) [Filet Mignon: $42 10 oz](http://www.smithandwollensky.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/SWCH_DinnerMenu_Spring2014.pdf) (PDF)  - Gibson's: [Filet Mignon: $39.75 10oz](http://www.gibsonssteakhouse.com/dinner-menu-pages-332.php)  - Gene   Georgetti's: [Filet Mignon: $37.75 small](http://geneandgeorgetti.com/dinner-menu/)  And so it goes...$21 gets you that shitty grayish/brown hockey puck of a steak.  The steaks listed above are stupidly expensive but they are (usually) a meal you literally will never forget.  A really good cut of steak cooked to perfection is pretty special.  Again, none of the above include anything but the steak on a plate.  You will be lucky to leave for less than $100/person with drinks +tip from these places.  Shitty thing is I went to a really good butcher in Chicago (Paulina Market) and they sell an aged NY Strip for [over $39/pound](https://www.paulinameatmarket.com/?p=shop cid=beef).  While they provide great cuts of meat it is fucking ridiculous...I could go to any of the above and pay barely more to have it cooked for me and have others do the dishes.  Their filet mignon are near $38/pound.     I'm new to this sub-Reddit.  Why is this being downvoted?  (seriously)  I think this is hilarious!  A good movie?  Nope.  Not by a light year but is this only for pop movies?  If so is there a sub-Reddit better suited for this?        I'm with you and the problem is restaurants like to put it in damn near every thing they possibly can.  Ok, a bit of hyperbole but seriously, it is pervasive cuz it is healthy or some shit.  As noted there is a portion of the population genetically disposed to not liking it (and I am one of them) so it is not even a matter of learning to like it.  It is fine that some dishes use it as no one expects every dish to be to their liking and some people genuinely like the stuff.  But it need not be on nearly as many dishes as it is.  Is it really necessary in every bowl of salsa in every Mexican restaurant ever?  It is really necessary on practically every dish at Wow Bao? (I always ask them to hold the cilantro yet almost invariable they drop it on the dish anyway.)  I do not know if everyone is like this but I feel like the princess in the Princess and the Pea story when it comes to cilantro.  I swear I can taste one speck of that shit if it is anywhere in the dish.   Liberals should start protests like this outside gun shops or their churches.    Turnabout being fair play and all that.    They have to take every call seriously.  Just how that stuff works.       Alaska is the northernmost, westernmost and easternmost state in the US.     Decades?  Do you understand that this area of the world has been fought over since around 1,000 BCE (and perhaps earlier than that)?  The Kingdom of Israel was formed around 930 BCE.  This shit has been going on for 3,000+ years.  Both sides, every side, can (and do) point at the other and claim a near endless litany of injustices done to them.  EDIT to add: Also, imagine you took over a portion of your neighbor's back yard.  Your neighbor declares it his mission in life to kill you and your family and take everything from you.  He's so pissed that even giving him his bit of land back will not assuage him.  He wants nothing less than to annihilate you and your family.  Now, you took a piece of that guy's land so you can understand he is pissed.  Would you then be ok that he was looking for any opportunity to kill you and your family because you deserve it or something?    I do not think Hamas will be content if Israel stops illegal settlements: .  .                   THE COVENANT OF THE HAMAS - MAIN POINTS                   =======================================    The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement was issued on  August  18, 1988. The Islamic Resistance Movement, also known as  the  HAMAS,  is an extremist fundamentalist Islamic organization operating in  the territories under Israeli control. Its Covenant  is  a  comprehensive manifesto comprised of 36 separate articles, all of which promote the basic HAMAS goal of destroying the  State  of  Israel  through  Jihad (Islamic  Holy  War).  The  following  are  excerpts  of  the   HAMAS Covenant:    Goals of the HAMAS:  ------------------  'The Islamic  Resistance  Movement  is  a  distinguished  Palestinian  movement, whose allegiance is to Allah, and  whose  way  of  life  is  Islam. It strives to raise the banner of Allah  over  every  inch  of  Palestine.' (Article 6)    On the Destruction of Israel:  -----------------------------  'Israel will exist and  will  continue  to  exist  until  Islam  will  obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.' (Preamble)    The Exclusive Moslem Nature of the Area:  ----------------------------------------  'The  land  of  Palestine  is  an  Islamic  Waqf  [Holy   Possession]  consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgment Day. No  one  can renounce it or any part, or  abandon  it  or  any  part  of  it.'  (Article 11)    'Palestine is  an  Islamic  land...  Since  this  is  the  case,  the  Liberation of Palestine  is  an  individual  duty  for  every  Moslem  wherever he may be.' (Article 13) [SOURCE](http://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/880818a.htm)    Mirror (for now at least): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UljNDz7jiOg     Seems very similar to Railroad Tycoon (2 or 3 or Sid Meier's Railroads).  This seems better on the town detail but thinner on the economic simulation which was pretty great in Railroad Tycoon.  Seeing this got me to fire up Sid Meier's Railroads again.  Good stuff.    Yeah but there is taking artistic license and then just completely fabricating so much that there isn't really anything remotely accurate in the movie compared to history.    SOE getting DDoS'd would probably elicit not much more than a yawn and a tepid response from the FBI.  Claiming a bomb is on a plane will get these guys the full attention of the FBI as well as an alphabet soup of other agencies in the mix and they WILL pursue this zealously.     I was in high school in the early 80's so programmable calculators were a rare thing and not forbidden.  As it happened I had one so I programmed my calculator to solve for "X" wherever it was in a calculation for my upcoming Physics exam.  Worked like a charm although the funny thing was that going through the process of programming the calculator I taught myself the material.  When taking the test it turned out I was faster just doing the problems normally without running my program (which was a little kludgy).  First time I ever finished an exam before anyone else.  Waaay before anyone else cuz I knew it so well.  Got a 98% IIRC.  tl;dr - Tried to cheat on a test and accidentally taught myself the material by setting up the cheat.    So much of the police force seems to be filled with men looking for power and acting like thugs.  It should come as no surprise that certain professions attract a certain "type".  These types are not a hard and fast rule as of course there is variance.  But if you graphed it you'd probably come out with a bell curve with a certain type as prevalent at the top of the bell curve.  There are of course many good and conscientious police officers.  Unfortunately the profession attracts all too many of the type depicted in the OP.  The problem for the good cops is police culture means they have to stay silent about the bad ones.  As a result their profession and how we (the public) feel about them as a group is colored by sociopaths like the guy in the OP.  I do not know whether to feel sympathy for the good cops having to live with that or hostility that they abide by the "code" that lets people like this prey on the public because they won't say anything.    It depends how the company presents itself.  If at the outset your company says it is interested in reducing carbon emissions then fine.  Anyone who invests in your company knows that and cannot bring a successful lawsuit.  Such things, while they happen, are rare.  People invest in companies who will increase shareholder value.  That is kinda the point.  Hewlett Packard recently settled a lawsuit with shareholders for $57 million because they changed course:  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) agreed to pay $57 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit accusing former Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker of making misleading statements about operations before he was ousted. [SOURCE](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/hp-reaches-57-million-settlement-in-shareholder-lawsuit.html)  I am **NOT** saying I like the status quo but people here need to realize that "nice" companies are a pipe dream.  If you ever become CEO of a company your **LEGAL** responsibility is to the SHAREHOLDERS.  Period.  Full stop.  It is not to the environment.  It is not to poor people.  It does not matter how much you wish it were different.    Interesting I am getting downvoted.  A fiduciary duty just isn't a notion some people have.  It is a legal responsibility and has legal ramifications for the people who have a fiduciary duty.  A fiduciary duty is an obligation to act in the best interest of another party. For instance, a corporation's board member has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, a trustee has a fiduciary duty to the trust's beneficiaries, and an attorney has a fiduciary duty to a client.  .  A fiduciary obligation exists whenever the relationship with the client involves a special trust, confidence, and reliance on the fiduciary to exercise his discretion or expertise in acting for the client. The fiduciary must knowingly accept that trust and confidence to exercise his expertise and discretion to act on the client's behalf.  .  When one person does agree to act for another in a fiduciary relationship, the law forbids the fiduciary from acting in any manner adverse or contrary to the interests of the client, or from acting for his own benefit in relation to the subject matter. The client is entitled to the best efforts of the fiduciary on his behalf and the fiduciary must exercise all of the skill, care and diligence at his disposal when acting on behalf of the client. A person acting in a fiduciary capacity is held to a high standard of honesty and full disclosure in regard to the client and must not obtain a personal benefit at the expense of the client. [SOURCE](http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/breach-of-fiduciary-duty/)  Companies that violate that duty can and frequently are hit with shareholder lawsuits.  Such lawsuits are not uncommon.     I was on my phone posting so it was hard to tell but the NASA app seemed it might have the radio along with other stuff.  Some review complaints suggested videos thumbs in the sidebar kept changing which was distracting. Not to mention using more bandwidth.   I figured the radio-only app was a better fit here. Lighter weight download, less other extraneous stuff.  To each their own though. Whatever suits you.    Yes they would. At least publicly held companies would. The executives have a *fiduciary responsibility* to maximize shareholders' returns.   They keep that in mind so they can sleep at night with a clear conscience.    I agree mandatory minimums have become a bad thing but in theory they were supposed to address real and serious disparities in sentencing.   Things like white guy gets community service and black guy gets five years.    Yeah but they NEVER call themselves that. It'll be things like "American Crossroads" or the "Heritage Foundation" and so on.  Look up "astroturf lobby groups".    I have not seen it mentioned yet.

They need to add this to Euro Truck Simulator.    I can do everything I need to do for my job from home.  All I need is a computer, internet access and a phone.  I can sit in on meetings via Skype or conference call.  Many jobs are like mine in that the work can be done places other than the office.  I know of few employers who will be cool with you taking three months/year at home because you can do everything you need to do while on vacation.     It's obvious that you are making conclusions based on zero information.   Pot meet kettle.  Having policy meetings with many of the most powerful world leaders is your definition of vacation?  snip I guess Bush must have been great buddies with Putin and Angela Merkel for them to accompany him on his vacation multiple times.  Merkel went to his ranch once.  Bush entertained [17 dignitaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_Chapel_Ranch#Visits_from_foreign_dignitaries) at his ranch while in office.  Two of them visited twice.  If we assume each one stayed for two days that is 38 days out of 879.    EDIT to add: I do not consider working trips to Camp David as "vacation".       The second is child molestation. The victims often take years to come to terms.  Certainly there are cases where it can take a child well into adulthood to deal with childhood trauma.  That said a lot of "repressed memories" are induced and implanted by therapists:  In the early 1990s, the focus of Loftus work shifted to investigating whether it was possible to implant false memories for entire events that had never taken place. The impetus for this new line of research was a case for which Loftus had been asked to provide expert testimony in 1990.[9][10][12][14] The unique point in this case was that George Franklin stood accused of murder, but the only evidence against him was provided by his daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, who claimed that she had initially repressed the memory of him raping and murdering her childhood friend, Susan Nason, 20 years earlier, and had only recently recovered it while undergoing therapy.[9][10][14] Loftus gave evidence about the malleability of memory, but had to concede that she did not know of any research about the particular kind of memory Franklin-Lipsker was claiming to have; Franklin was convicted (though in 1996 he was released upon appeal).[9][10][14]  .  At that time, many others were also making accusations, both in and out of court, based on recovered memories of trauma.[14] Loftus began work to find out whether some of these recovered memories might in fact be false memories, created by the suggestive techniques used by some therapists at the time and encouraged in some self-help books.[9][10][14] Ethically, she could not try to convince research subjects that they had been sexually abused by a relative as a child, so Loftus had to come up with a paradigm that involved childhood trauma without causing harm to subjects. The lost in the mall technique was the result. The method involves attempting to implant a false memory of being lost in a shopping mall as a child and testing whether discussing a false event could produce a "memory" despite never happening. In her initial study, Loftus found that 25% of subjects came to develop a "memory" for the event which had never actually taken place.[10][14] Extensions and variations of the lost in the mall technique found that an average of one third of experimental subjects could become convinced that they experienced things in childhood that had never really occurredeven highly traumatic, and impossible events.[14] Loftus work was used to oppose recovered memory evidence provided in court[10] and resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials as well as a greater requirement for corroborating evidence. In addition, some states no longer allowed prosecution based on recovered memory testimony and insurance companies were more reluctant to insure therapists against malpractice suits relating to recovered memories.[7][9][10] [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Loftus#The_memory_wars)  (FWIW this researcher is held in high regard among her peers: "Loftus has been recognized throughout the world for her work, receiving numerous awards and honorary degrees. In 2002, Loftus was ranked 58th in the Review of General Psychologys list of the 100 most influential psychological researchers of the 20th century, and was the highest ranked woman on the list.")    I expect to get downvoted and called a racist or Republitard for bringing factual information into this.  Except there is barely any factual information to be found in your post.  "Bush spent a lot of money to have the Crawford ranch set up for many operations" is about as close to a fact that you get but it is vague, unsubstantiated and says nothing about how much work Bush did on his ranch.  Certainly the president (whoever it may be) at the very least gets the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) and depending on circumstances they may well have to work the whole day while on vacation.    It remains that Bush spent 30% of his time in office away from the White House and Washington (not including business trips...just "vacation" time).    It is Journalism 101 to ask for name pronunciation if there is the slightest doubt.  Asking pronunciation is showing respect rather than guessing and mangling the name which would be a lack of respect (else something [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=nxxSIX3fmmo#t=20) could happen).    I think I played 2033 for 30 minutes a year or two ago and gave up and uninstalled it because the FOV was way too narrow and made me nauseated to play.  If they do not fix that I am not going back.    It was recently struck down in Illinois:  In People v. Melongo, Docket No. 114852 (Ill. Mar. 20, 2014), the Supreme Court of Illinois held that Illinois' two-party eavesdropping statute, 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/14-1, -2 (scroll down), was unconstitutional on its face. The statute made it a crime to use an "eavesdropping device" to overhear or record a phone call or conversation without the consent of all parties to the conversation, regardless of whether the parties had an expectation of privacy. The Court held that the recording provisions of the statute, as written, adversely affected the First Amendment rights of people making recordings in a substantial number of circumstances where there were no legitimate privacy interests.  The Court further held that a provision of the statute prohibiting the disclosure of recordings likewise ran afoul of the First Amendment.      This does not mean, however, that recording of communications is now universally permitted in Illinois:  - Recordings may still be subject to the "one-party" consent rule of the Federal wiretap act. - Communications reaching other states may be subject to the wiretapping laws of the remote state. - Secret recordings may still support an Illinois common-law claim for intrusion into the privacy of another. See, e.g., Narducci v. Village of Bellwood, 444 F. Supp. 2d 924, 938 (N.D. Ill. 2006). - Another Illinois statute, not necessarily affected by the decision in the Melongo case, makes it illegal to "videotape, photograph, or film" people without their consent in "a restroom, tanning bed, or tanning salon, locker room, changing room or hotel bedroom." 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/26-4(a) (scroll down).  Consult The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press's Can We Tape?: Illinois for more information on Illinois wiretapping lawyer.

The problem with the new curriculum, in his view, is that theres nothing in there about our military and all those victories.  Someone should remind Mercer that most of the great generals of the Civil War worked for the South and a lot of victories went to the South.  Maybe he figures the Civil War was great because no matter what Americans won.    Yes.  The difference in the law would be your intent which can impact your sentence.  If your intent was to shoot the police officer and you missed but the bullet ricocheted and hit it will make no difference in your court case.     Really?  Near as I can tell she had been trying to put a lid on it because the story line is not trending in her favor.  I could be wrong though.  I really am only [watching from the sidelines.](http://i.imgur.com/rj59FUv.gif)     Same here. I posted some innocuous thing like, "Kinda wondering what's going on here too," and it was deleted.   Till the TB post I was 100% clueless about the whole thing. Because of the mass deletions I investigated further.  Note to Ms. Quinn, the Streisand Effect is a real thing.     So, if you were a person who could be tapped to run a $50 million company would you accept an $80K salary?  Of course you wouldn't because you could easily get jobs paying 2x, 3x, 4x that or more.  Charities need to pay their executives somewhat commensurate with the going rate.  Same as if they want to hire a nurse they cannot expect to pay that person minimum wage because they are a charity.  This is normal and the good charities are up-front about where the money goes.  Generally if less than 33% goes to running the place (salaries, rent, electricity, water, etc) then things aren't so bad.  ALL organizations have costs.  None of any size can do the work for free (hell...cost of postage can be substantial).  That said it is wise to look into organizations before you donate to them to see how the money is spent.  Some are downright robbing people.  If you look at enough you will start to see the differences.  SOURCE: I have two family members who have worked for charities in executive roles (real and well recognized charities) and they also worked to improve the ethical standards of charities.  I have also worked for a charity myself (as an employee...several as a volunteer).    Did you *really* imagine it?  From Bill Bryson's book, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](http://www.amazon.com/A-Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X) (for geographic reference he is talking about an impact that happened in [Manson, Iowa](http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IA_66936.gif) some 74 million years ago and left the biggest crater in the US (you couldn't tell if you went there...nothing to see crater-wise anymore without using special equipment to see underground):  An asteroid or comet traveling at cosmic velocities would enter the earth's atmosphere at such a speed that the air beneath it couldn't get out of the way and would be compressed, as in a bicycle pump. As anyone who has used such a pump knows, compressed air grows swiftly hot, and temperature below it would rise to some 60,000 Kelvins or ten times the surface temperature of the Sun. In this instant of its arrival in our atmosphere, everything in the meteor's path - people, houses, factories, cars - would crinkle and vanish like cellophane in a flame.  One second after entering the atmosphere, the meteorite would slam into the earth's surface, where the people of Manson (an impact site of such a collision millions of years ago) had a moment before been going about their business. The meteorite itself would vaporize instantly, but the blast would blow out a thousand cubic kilometers of rock, earth, and superheated gases. Every living thing within 150 miles that hadn't been killed by the heat of entry would now be killed by the blast. Radiating outward at almost the speed of light would be the initial shock wave, sweeping everything before it.  For those outside the zone of immediate devastation, the first inkling of catastrophe would be a flash of blinding light - the brightest ever seen by human eyes - followed an instant to a minute or two later by an apocalyptic sight of unimaginable grandeur: a rolling wall of darkness reaching high into the heavens, filling an entire field of view and traveling at thousands of miles an hour. Its approach would be eerily silent since it would be moving far beyond the speed of sound. Anyone In a tall building in Omaha or Des Moines, say, who chanced to look into the right direction would see a bewildering veil of turmoil followed by instantaneous oblivion.  Within minutes, over an area stretching from Denver to Detroit and encompassing what had been Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, the Twin Cities - the whole of the Midwest, in short - nearly every standing thing would be flattened or on fire, and nearly every living thing would be dead. People up to a thousand miles away would be knocked off their feet and sliced or clobbered by a blizzard of flying projectiles. Beyond a thousand miles the devastation from the blast would gradually diminish.  But that's just the initial shockwave. No one can do more than guess what the associated damage would be, other than that it would be brisk and global. The impact would almost certainly set off a chain of devastating earthquakes. Volcanoes across the world would begin to rumble and spew. Tsunamis would rise up and head devastatingly for distant shores. Within an hour, a cloud of blackness would cover the planet, and burning rock and other debris would be pelting down everywhere, setting much of the planet ablaze. It has been estimated that 1.5 billion people would be dead by the end of first day. The massive disturbances to the ionosphere would knock out communications systems everywhere, so survivors would have no idea what was happening elsewhere or where to turn. It would hardly matter. As one commentator has put it, fleeing would mean "selecting a slow death over a quicker one. The death toll would be very little affected by any plausible relocation effort, since earths ability to support life would be universally diminished."  The amount of soot and floating ash from the impact and following fires would blot out the sun, certainly for months, possibly for years, disrupting growing cycles. In 2001, researchers at the California Institute of Technology analyzed helium isotopes from sediments left from the later KT impact and concluded that it affected earths climate for about 10,000 years. This was actually used as evidence to support the notion that the extinction of dinosaurs was swift and emphatic - and so it was in geological terms. We can only guess how well, or whether, humanity would cope with such an event.  And in all likelihood, this would come without warning, out of a clear sky.  EDIT:  Added geographic info for context.  EDIT2: It is worth noting that there were no extinctions associated with this impact.  As devastating as it was it was still not sufficient to completely end any species' time on the planet.  Now consider what the one that put a sharp and definitive end to the dinosaurs must have been like!    I don't care about art, why would I? I'm not purchasing art again that's something for the rich....and science, wow you came up with cures I cannot afford, and technology which has eliminated millions of jobs to enrich the tiny sneering technical elite  "Art" is a broad term.  Do you read books?  Watch TV?  Go to movies?  Listen to music?  Have you ever appreciated a beautiful photo or painting?  All art and I bet you are a consumer of some if not all of that.  Prosperity means people have time to make that stuff instead of hunting food.  Prosperity means you have time to enjoy some of that stuff.  Your life expectancy is longer than it was in the past due to science.  Hell, even something as simple as salt is iodized and water has fluoride in it both of which improve your overall health (not to mention civil water and sewer systems).  As for technology eliminating jobs it certainly does but that is not always bad.  I remember as a kid that elevators used to have elevator operators.  People who manually controlled the elevators with a lever.  Would you suggest we were better off with manual elevators rather than the automatic ones we have today because some people lost their job running an elevator?   Compare yourself to someone from, say, the year 1500.  You are light years better off then they were.   It is not about whether others should earn as much.  It is about people striking who earn $150k+ because they feel they don't earn enough.  In the US in the mid 90's professional baseball players went on strike.  They had a hard time mustering sympathy when their average salary was $1.2 million/year.   I wonder how much competition those tugboats are subject to?    "Anecdotal bad apples"?  It is more than anecdote.  Wonder why there is no accountability for police after they do something egregious?  Ever see how hard it is to get rid of a bad teacher (including criminal teachers) in New York or Chicago?  Ever try to start your own business as a garbage collector?  Ever try to plug in a computer at a trade show without paying $120/hour for a union guy to do it?  The list is long.    I read The Jungle.  I know of the labor disputes of the early 20th century and the horrid excesses of corporations (literally killing women and children in some cases).  I appreciate the need for workers to collectively bargain.  On the flip side the unions have become monsters in their own right and it is no surprise that people push back against them and they are losing power.  In the end we are the losers and the corporations are winning.    Kinda wondering that myself.    As for us that like unions: no.  Unions are partly their own worst enemies.  In principle they are great.  In practice they have become big business in their own right that are more interested in their own existence than their workers and (sometimes) are dominated by organized crime.  Workers coordinating and uniting to protect their rights is *great*!  But they can create an intolerable mess too.  There has to be a good middle-ground (I am thinking the Germans have a good model for labor relations with management).    Prosperity is good in general (within reason).  Prosperity allows for all sorts of luxuries which can include everything from an iPod to going to an opera (read arts).  The world used to be dominated by growing food.  It is what most people did.  When technology allowed for better returns people became more prosperous and allowed them to try and do new things like science and art.  You may not care that *I* am prosperous but you should be glad for overall prosperity.    AUS $150K is about US $140K.  Cost of living in the US is about 1/3 less than in Australia (on average of course). [SOURCE](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Australia country2=United+States)  So an equivalent wage in the US would be around $100K.  That is a fantastic wage in anyone's book.  Most people live on well less than half that.  Hell, $50k is not a bad wage either.  Not rich but not bad.  In 2012 the US average wage was about [$44,000](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html).  In Australia it is about AUS [$75,500](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6302.0).  However you slice it, by any measure, these tugboat crews are doing quite well.  Hard pressed to feel bad about them.   I see the sarcasm and it is not lost on me.  More seriously I will add the issue with giving tax breaks and other incentives to create jobs really do not work.  Imagine you can sell 1,000 iPods/month and it takes you five employees to manufacture those 1,000 iPods.  Will a tax break get you to hire more people?  No.  Why would you?  You will hire as many people as you need to get the job done. Period.  If the government lets you keep more money you will not hire more people just cuz...you will pocket that money.  Further, wages stagnate because there are 100 people waiting to take one of those five jobs.  You want more money? Fuck you...Joe Schmo over there tells me he will work for half your salary.                That's why they were crying.    Oh, so that one time 50 years ago?   [The Ludlow Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre) jumps to mind.       This is not remotely true. The National Guard has a history of shooting civilians. See Kent State for starters.    You're probably right that these bats were fine and posed no danger.  Thing is you can never be 100% certain with wild bats and you only get to be wrong once.  Rabies is some majorly bad juju.    That said bats are cool and good to have around and kinda neat.  Just best to not mess with them in general.  Glad you relocated them!    Why is this even news?  Countries spy on each other!  News at 11!  Seriously, every country does its level best to spy on other countries be they friend or foe.  No one wants to be caught flat-footed.  There is nothing new about this.  Yes we can get all butt-hurt and righteous when the Israelis or Russians are caught spying on us but none of our governments really get all that bent out of shape about it because they all know that is part of the game.    It doesn't matter if they are far from the same.  In the US Congress they are both right of center, caucus together and vote together as a bloc.  They can argue amongst themselves all they want about the finer points of conservatism and if they ever completely run off liberals our two party system will break along libertarian and non-libertarian lines.  But that is all academic right now and there is no practical reason for a liberal voter to distinguish between the two.    I am not sure which sacking of which city it was by the Mongols but reportedly in one city 60,000 women committed suicide rather than to be raped/captured/killed by the Mongols.  Our modern mind simply cannot encompass such a thing.  Imagine filling a modern football stadium with women and then they all commit suicide.  Boggles the mind.  The really amazing part?  That wasn't even the worst of what the Mongols did.  It was par for the course.    IIRC the Mongols were pretty serious about *not* spilling royal blood.  This did not mean they would not kill royalty.  They most certainly did.  They just found creative ways to do it.    Oh man...there are lots of these.  [This is the worst picture](http://www.newjerseytelephones.com/images/Wiring%20Mess.jpg) of one I have ever seen.  The worst I have ever personally seen was something like [this picture](http://www.vibrant.com/images/cables/artistic-mess-cormacphelan.jpg).  Weird thing though it was easier to change out a cable in the messy room (within reason...not like the first pic) than it is in the nicely bundled and zip-tied neat room.  I have traced cables through both kinds (messy and bundled) and the bundles were a pain in the ass.  You have to unbundle them then find your cable in the bundle then trace it then replace it and make it all neat again.     It honestly looked like the same trick to me over and over again.  I understand I have no clue what I'm looking at but it remains that I doubt this can be really appreciated by anyone outside of the community of skaters.    Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville   (From ["How I Met Your Mother"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5RQNBFKK30))     I am interested to know if this changes your opinion.  For the sake of argument let's assume Brown did commit the robbery and let's also assume the officer who shot him had no clue about that robbery.  Are you still unconcerned that the officer shot him and killed him?    I am not sure this link will have the info when you go there but this is listed as "Breaking News" on a banner on CNN's website (as of me posting this):  Chief says initial contact between Michael Brown and officer who shot him was unrelated to alleged convenience store robbery. [SOURCE](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/15/us/missouri-teen-shooting/index.html)  So, even IF Brown did commit a robbery prior to being shot the cop that shot him apparently did not know that.  EDIT:  Here is a screen cap of the linked page in case it the banner gets removed: http://i.imgur.com/vkX8Hv1.jpg    You can sue for being detained for no cause.  Consider a country where any cop could throw anyone in jail for 24 hours then merely shrug and let you go for any reason or no reason whatsoever.  Police most certainly need probable cause to detain you.    Peering is not last mile stuff which would be the "local" portion of Comcast to your house.    There is nothing inherently stopping breaking up of monopolies at the local level.  They merely tell Comcast that it HAS TO allow others to use their wiring and Comcast would charge a fee for that.  It's been done before and works fine.    When you "delete" a file it goes to your computer's trashcan.  In this case the file is not really deleted.  It's location in the file system merely changes it from the original directory to the trashcan directory.  When you clear your trashcan the file system marks the space the file is located at on the hard drive (or SSD or whatever) as available.  At this point the file is NOT deleted and can be recovered with certain utilities.  Over time other data may be written in that spot and the old file will be unrecoverable.  For this reason there are some utilities that, when you delete a file, write random data into the file's location on the drive eight times.  This thoroughly scrubs the file and makes it truly deleted (apparently, if you have the right tech, it is possible to see what data was in a location even after some other file has overwritten it by the magnetic traces it leaves on the surrounding area...or something...point is writing random data eight times in the same spot ruins even that method and truly makes the data unrecoverable).     This is an asshole cop shooting a guy. Im not setting up a new system here. Im not reforming the courts and laws. I just dont care if these kind of scumbags get shot.        Don't start going down that rabbit hole and reading too deep into my comments.  Seems pretty clear you are fine with police dispensing summary judgment on anyone who robs a store and ok with them imposing the death penalty for that crime as a just and proper punishment.  Judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one.  When suggesting such things you need to consider how you'd feel if this was done to someone you care for.  Imagine your brother or sister (or best friend) robs a store and a cop rolls up and guns them down.  You'd be ok with that?    The courts broke up Ma Bell and there was no publicly owned anything about it.  Note that where Ma Bell has a monopoly is still in the local markets but not long distance.  It is actually cheaper to call long distance now than it is to call locally.  How do I know?  I work in Chicago and have setup fax systems for companies that do a lot of faxing (mortgage companies are a prime example) and it is cheaper to route the fax via ISP to offices in another state and call back to Chicago than it is to have the suburban location phone downtown Chicago directly).    While that may be prudent it should be noted that it is explicitly illegal for police to search your cell phone without a warrant (Supreme Court unanimous decision in [Riley v. California](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/riley-v-california/)).  Further, it is explicitly illegal in ALL circumstances to delete video (tampering with evidence).  [Felony charges](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech-criminal-law-reform/hidden-third-cameraman-proves-crucial-nebraska-photographer) have been brought for such things.  Of course you would have to *prove* all this in a court so uploading via Dropbox is still a good idea but it IS at least illegal for the police to mess with your phone without a warrant.    It is a little gray but not as much as you seem to suggest.   https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/know-your-rights-photographers    Sue for false arrest. The damages from not getting the job could be substantial.   Uphill battle I admit but if the officer is never held accountable perhaps the taxpayers will hold their bosses accountable at the ballot box after a few million dollar lawsuits.     Can any redditer's here find on line how much money, political donations he gets from Comcast/Time Warner?  By far his biggest contributor is the insurance industry ($116,200).  After that is lawyers and lobbyists but there is no telling what the lobbyists were lobbying for.  If it was ALL for cable it would be $55,118.  Of course this is not current.  No telling what has been promised in the past few weeks.  You can see the data here: http://www.followthemoney.org/database/StateGlance/candidate.phtml?c=153538    In a weird way you kinda did.

I created a research report on nuclear energy for my high school enviro. biology class in 1992, which included mention of these types of reactors. There are still none in mainstream energy production today.  You realize they built an operational one back in the 1960's?  The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was an experimental molten-salt nuclear reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) researching this technology through the 1960s; constructed by 1964, it went critical in 1965 and was operated until 1969. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment)  There are also some working today or in the works:  - [Thorium fuel is now being tested in the Halden research reactor in Norway. It was loaded in the last week of April, defining the start of a physical test program that will simulate how it operates in a power reactor.](http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF_Thorium_test_begins_2106131.html)  -  [Chinese going for broke on thorium nuclear power, and good luck to them](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ambroseevans-pritchard/100026863/china-going-for-broke-on-thorium-nuclear-power-and-good-luck-to-them/)    He wrote 66 of 83 citations so most people who were cited were cited by this one guy.   That said the article suggests he was citing homeless people so I doubt they will contest these (or pay the fine).    I tried for years (literally) to get my GF and (eventually) wife to try sushi.  She'd have none of it.  Then, one day, a close friend of hers from college who she had not seen in a long time was coming through our city but was only in for a night.  She REALLY wanted to see this person!  Her friend told her that she was going to a particular sushi place.  If my GF wanted to see her then that is where she'd have to go.  My GF grumbled but I assured her there would be other items she could eat on offer other than sushi so she figured it was fine to go.  Once there she kinda felt that, in order to be cool, she had to choke down some sushi.  She did and it was a revelation to her.  She freaking LOVED it (kidjanot).  Somehow, after that, she was someone who ALWAYS liked it.  Nevermind the years I had to sneak eating sushi because she would not even abide the sight of it.  All's well that ends well I suppose...  **grumble grumble**    I thought everyone in Chicago knew this song.  I then asked some co-workers (we are all in Chicago) about it and was surprised that none had heard of it.  I was surprised.  Spread the good word! :)    I've lived in Chicago most of my life and have lived on the north side now for 15 years.  This never gets old.  One of the best drives into a major city anywhere in the world (I think THE best).  Have to add the obligatory [Lake Shore Drive song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOrdtmG2IMM)       Name one time a restraining order has saved someone's life.  That's impossible to answer.  A lot of restraining orders have been issued where no one has been killed.  There is no way to know if any of those prevented something worse.  That said I understand if someone is intent on murder a restraining order is small potatoes and not going to be the thing that deters them.    *Brian is writing a slogan on a wall, oblivious to the Roman patrol approaching from behind.

 Through the scriptures. They resonated with me in a way that was only explainable as Divine. Their truth grappled with my heart and left my walls of excuse broken.   Because he has enabled me to. Salvation was all his work, I had no part in it. He awakened my heart and drew me to himself. I could never have been "convinced", it was all his doing.     Yes, absolutely brilliant.  Blood Meridian is my favorite.   *All the pretty horses* by Cormac Mccarthy   Get involved in a community organization. Seriously, you would be surprised how many friends you make by volunteering.    Kind of. Except I could be a hippie with a beard and nobody would care.  Plus, highschoolers might be actually smarter than Army privates.   1. More time with my family. I am ready to plant roots in the north Alabama hills, buy a little land, get some chickens and sheep, get involved in my community,never move away again.  2. I just got tired of the Army running every aspect of my life. I understand it, I don't hate it, I just am ready to move past it.  3. No.   4. Yes, I have a railroad job lined up and I am going to use my G.I. Bill to go back to school at UAB, get my teacher certification, and teach some high school kids.   Anything by Sondre Lerche.   Obviously this is a subjective question.  I don't believe the point of religion is "getting back to God" or "helping your fellow man", though those are two admirable things.  I believe the point of religion is to properly serve our Creator according to His holy Law. It is not about a unification of consciousness or altruism, it is about complete obedience to our Sovereign King.      I meant to say state action in the marketplace. My mistake.  Because I believe I should be allowed to work for however much or little I want. If I choose to accept conditions below minimum wage, that is my business. I have in the past worked for low wages, and would again. I don't like the state telling me what I must work for. I also don't like the state pretending to be my nanny. I believe as an individual I have the right to agree to any contract I want. It is not the state's business what I choose to work for.   If a union wants to argue with an employer about wages, that is their business. I don't care what they do. Everyone in that union has the right to free association, and if they can strike or whatever to get the employer to agfee to their contract that is all fine. I don't believe it is ever the state's job to intervene though. The state should enforce contracts, not make contract demands. It is the individual's (or group of individuals') responsibility and right to make any contract they are willing to agree to.  Since I believe life begins af conception, I believe abortion is an act of aggression against a human life, which I would never support under any circumstance. Violence should only be used in defense and never aggression.  I am a libertarian laissez faire capitalist. I believe the markets should be free from state control. I did not come here to egg on a political discussion though, that was not the intent of my OP.   Well I am not a union member, and won't ever be.  My question was not about a personal curcumstance though.  In some states it is nearly impossible to work in the blue-collar career you are skilled in without joining a union.  I have nothing against the idea of unions, I think everyone should be allowed to associate with whomever he or she chooses. I just do not know of any unions that operate from my perspective, and I would not want to join an organization that runs counter to my ethos.   Well thanks for your explanation, I appreciate your perspective.   For example, if a union decided to strike for employers to provide birth control coverage to employees, including abortion, I would be against the morality of those benefits.  Since I am also against minimum wage laws, I would not strike to raise minimum wage.   Since I believe state action is immoral, I would not strike to enact state change.   Hmmm, we didn't. We shot slick for familiarization, but not qual.   You win.  Pushing now.  Climb to glory.   We are hot shit.   Do pushups.   Weird..    You did not do it in basic and AIT?   How are you in the Army and now is your first time shooting in an IOTV?   I can understand your reasoning. I am not in a union job, but I am in a job that requires me to be in an organization where we actively lay our lives down for the guy to our left and right. I understand being a part of an organization that is equatable to family, the reason for the OP is just me trying to get my head around one thing ( I am honestly not trying to say this like a jerk)  My brothers woukd never ask me to stop working under threat of eviction from the organization, even though our benefits and workplace can be crappy as well. I just cannot understand being forced to participate in that because an organization has a monopoly on that trade.   I agree with what you are saying. Unions are important, and I am all for people joining unions. The area about this issue I am curious about is what does one do if they are in a state where they have to join a union to work a specific job? They cannot leave the union unless they want to lose their job, move, or face legal action, yet they disagree with the strike issues?      *Lone Survivor* and *American Sniper* are the only two I have read. They were ok. I have been to Afghanistan, and approaching them with firsthand experience gave me a bit more appreciation than I might have before.  I would not place it on a top ten military books list.   My personal favorite is *We Were Soldiers Once, and Young* by Hal Moore.   What if I disagree with the union about the morality of the benefits rhey represent?   But in a non-right to work state, would I have to quit my job?   What happens if my union is on strike, and I disagree and refuse to strike, and instead go to work? I am especially curious how this works in a job where union membership is mandatory?   What happens if my union is on strike, and I disagree and refuse to strike, and instead go to work? I am especially curious how this works in a job where union membership is mandatory?   Probably just a publisher misprint.   "Bubba".  My little sister could not properly say "brother". It stuck.   There are several reasons  1. Because Jesus Christ is fully God, and we are forbidden from making images of God.  2. Because it is impossible for finite men to draw one Person with two natures ... the picture will be heretical.  3. Because Jesus Christ has ascended with a glorified body. We have no way of picturing the Risen Christ.  4. Any picture of Jesus we make will be a fashioning of his appearance by us, not as God revealed, for we don't know what Jesus looked like.  5. You need to contemplate God to draw Him, and we can't contemplate without owing worship. So, we either fail to revere God or we worship Him by image.  6. Because God is spirit, and this cannot be captured by a picture.   There is no wiggle room. In relation to your first quote, we consider the standards *goodband necessarily deduced from scripture.*.  Your second quote proves my point. It says that the circumstances regarding the worship and order of God's church *according to the general rules of the Word, which are always to be observed*  Read section XXI. That is where the RPW is explicitly stated thusly  T*he acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by Himself, and so limited by His own revealed will, that He may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representation, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.*    I did not mean we don't need any recruits.   I meant it in the sense thst we are not lacking in possible recruits. There are a thousand others who will join anyways, without tattoos, and the Army is still cutting.  My point; this is a garrison Army. We aren't fighting OEF and OIF anymore. They have no interest in loosening up the rules.   I would not say more... or less.. I like spending time with people based on many attributes, whether they are gay or straight has no relevence on how relaxed I would be.  I know gay people who are obnoxious as hell.  I know straight people who are obnoxious as hell.  I know gay people who are mature andi enjoy being around.  I know straight people who are mature and I enjoy being around.   It doesn't matter if it is religious patriotic etc. If your tattoo below your elbow is larger than your hand, you are out.  Do you think the military really needa recruits? They are cutting our numbers all the time. We don't need recruits badly. So no, they are not going to be lax on tattoos. If anything, they are only going to get stricter.   Sometimes we have stained glass as an aesthetic thing, but they never have images of Christ. Usually they are landscapes or some other artistic design.   We sing only Psalms in worship, our ministers usually wear black Geneva gowns   Because I believe there is no biblical precedent for seeking God through images. Also I believe the Law still demands us to refrain from any images in our worship.     Morality is determined by obedience to God. My fsith defines morality by God's law.  It is very human to define morality by how we relate to other humans. God demands us to judge our morality by our relationship with him.   Both.  I believe it is a mockery and is disrespectful to Christ. The example of portraying Christ as a white man is one example. It is also blatant disrespect to assume that sinful man can even come close to depicting a perfect God.  It is also morally wrong in the sense that God, in Holy Scripture, directly forbids it. Therefore it is a direct act of mutiny against His holy law.    Both. It saddens me to see Him disrespected in a way that he specifically forbid us to do. It also saddens me to see folks overlook the seriousness of this action, and saddens me for their wellbeing.  I don't think this is a "heaven or hell" issue. One can be a Christian and still break the second commandment, but that does not mean it carries no rebuke.   Yes, we do take a sola scriptura view of scripture.   I understand the theological justification behind iconography, but we reject it.  No, I do not think you are going to hell. I imagine we disagree on a good many things though.   It upsets me at all times, I believe it to be very wrong.  If you are asking if it angers me in a way similar to the Charlie Hebdo incident angered some extremists... absolutely not. I would never take aggresive violent action because of such a thing.  I do believe it is morally wrong, and folks who participate in it will have to answer to God for it. If it happened within my denomination I would bring the issue before our leadership and expect disciplinary action.   Some of us do.  I am a Reformed Presbyterian. It is **strictly** forbidden in our denomination. We do not allow images of any person of the Godhead in any scenario, ever.   Not in our homes, not in our church, not on our facebook page, never    Exactly.  Having a contract forced upon you without the option to determine your own contract rules is slavery.   It also violates the concept of free association.  Free individuals choose their contracts, servants have their contracts forced upon them   Our church name is a decriptor that refers to our form of government.  We do not believe the Westminster Standards are extrabiblical. They introduce no new doctrine. Every point of the Standards is from scripture. They are simply a concise and homogenous guide to explain Scripture.  We are so strict on them to prevent division. If you want to have your own varied views on scripturex go ahead, but to be a Presbyterian you have to agree with our standards totally. If a church or elder in our presbytery wants to stop being Calvinists, or refute paedobaptism, or teach something different than the standards, we have grounds for discipline. It is easy and simple.     Yes. We are strictly bound by the Book of Church Order with regards to those things. The BCO operates with the Regulative Principle as it's foundation. We do not operate congregationally, we have a plurality of elders because we believe that is the example of scripture, there is no other option. There is only one way we do things. We have a presbytery with authority to exercise oversight over local churches because we see that in scripture.     It is a revolving line of funding from Congress given to veterans as repayment for their service. I am not getting benefits just because I am a human and "deserve" it. I am getting those benefits because I am contractually entitled to those benefits.  If I agree to exchange my service for "X" product, and itbis included in a contract, after my service is completed I am entitled to that product. That is the premises of free trade.   I defend freedom. I do not defend anyone being "owed" anything just because they are human.    That applies specifically to worship. The Sabbath is the Lord's day and we believe in only worshipping him his way on the Lord's day.  We do believe there are many areas left to Christian liberty in private life (alcohol, smoking, etc)   By we, I mean all EP Reformed Presbyterians. I can speak for all Exlusive Psalmody Presbyterians because we have very strict confessions which we subscribe to. We do not allow deviation from the Westminster Standards.   All of us believe exactly the same on everything in the confession. We do not believe in individual interpretation.   Some confessional presbyterians deviate very slightly from exclusive psalmody and allow hymns as well. Nonetheless, even they would be *very* strict about what is allowed in worship.  We do not use instruments in worship. There is some debate about the use of instruments within the RP camp, but my particular group does not.       Yes.  We believe the state has no say in marriage.  Your religion is free to define marriage however they like, but they cannot force those beliefs on others.  So we believe the Catholic church has the right to not define same sex marriages as valid in their religion, but they cannot stop unitarians from marrying the same sex.      We believe that verse us referring to various *kinds* of Psalms (i.e. Psalms, Psalms of adoration, and Spiritual Psalms.)  The fundamental issue that guides our view of worship is the Regulative Principle of Worship. We believe if Scripture does not command something in worship, it is forbidden.   Libertaran here.  I would not say Pres. Obama is a socialist, he is a progressive democrat.   We disagree on the role of the state. We believe the markets should be free, and nobody should be forced to pay for other's welfare. We believe welfare should be accomplished through voluntary association (i.e. charity, relgious organizations, and non-profits.) We believe the state should not force contracts on people. It is up to each individual to negotiate and decide what contract he is willing to work for (or join a union voluntarily to band together to bargain collectively).   There are some things I do agree with progressives on. For example, open borders, drug legalization, marriage equality etc.  Libertarians and Republicans are *nowhere* near alike.    I never once said homosexuality was worse than other sins.  I did say that living in blatant sin (in any area) is not a mark of a true Christian.   I earned my college and my paycheck because they were both part of the wages in the contract I agreed to. It was not given to me. I gave services in exchange for thst G.I. bill, as it was stated in my contract. In my contract it specifically said I would give my services in exchange for both a monetary wage and other benefits, including a G.I. Bill,   It was not a gift, it was income for my services.  You paid for my college because I worked a job to defend you. Your tax money did not give me anything that I did not earn.   There is no such thing as a free lunch. The money will come from taxpayer pockets.   As a veteran, I worked hard to *earn* my college benefits. I put blood, sweat, and tears into my job so that I could go to college on the government's dime. Now we just wanna give that to every kid on the street... It devalues what I worked so hard for.   If you want to go to college, you have to earn it. Through the military, through academic application, through employment programs, through any way you can. I am not of the breed of folks who believes you deserve free college just because you can eat, sleep, and piss.     I am not a Republican so I can not attest to every motive of theirs.  I disagree with them on a good many things, including immigration, drugs, gay marriage, etc.      That has nothing to do with it.   The point is that I, and many others like me, just want to be left alone. We do not want anyone making our decisions for us (good or bad). I own myself. I work for what I choose.  I would argue that viewing the government as a benevolent organization that only wishes you good is a very uninformed and foolish way to view the world.   It has nothing to do with the government being out to get me. It is the fact that they will not allow me to make my own decisions. They won't let me decide what is best for me. The state is not my mommy. I can choose for myself.    I believe in bettering the world we live in through voluntary action and free choice, not through the government trying to do it through force.  What kind of world would it be if the government told me what I was allowed to work for? Am I not an individual? Why should they force me to accept their conditions? I want nothing to do with them, yet they are going to force me to work for 7 paid sick days, thus removing yet one more thing that might distiguish me from other job applicants.  I say leave me the hell alone. What benefits I choose to work for is none of their damn business. If someone else wants 7 paid sick days, 15 dollars an hour, etc, they can go find that job. If I am willing to work for less, with no sick days, why shouldn't I be allowed to?   The point is we do not believe it is the state's job to demand what an employer and employee agree to in a contract.   We like the government out of our business. I don't want them making my employer give me days ofd, I don't want them telling me what benefits I have to work for. It is my business and my business alone what contract I choose to accept.  Perhaps agreeing to work for less sick days makes me more marketable to employers? I am willing to work for zero paid sick days if it makes me more competetive in the job market.   They are against the government forcing businesses to give folks sick 7 days of leave.  As a Libertarian, I am against this too.     He is speaking to the combined houses of Senate and Congress.  He is basically giving them an assessment of the current "state" of the "union" (United States).  Traditionally it was a way for the President to report to the legislative branch ow the nation was doing.    More Psalms.  We only use Psalms in corporate worship. So in a corporate worship context, all other types of music are irrelevent to me.  Other types of Christian music are nice for the car though.  Take notes from Red Mountain Music and the Gatsbys.   Neither.  It leans communistic still, but the markets are not totslly stste controlled. There is some competition and freedom allowed.  They are a mixed system, just like pretty much every other nation's economic system in one way or another.   [Here is a link for you](http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/passports/information/where-to-apply.html)   If you are celibate, then yes.  If you are engaging in sexual relations with the same sex... Maybe. Let me explain.   Christians can sin. If you are a Christian, and are attracted to the same sex, and slip and have sexual relations, you do not lose your salvaion or anything.   If you are living a life of outright noncelibate same sex relations, that is not an indicator of discipleship. True disciples do not live in blatant sin for extended periods of time.  I take the traditional and orthodox stance that same sex relations are a sexual sin, just like adultery, lust, sex outside of marriage etc. A Christian can slip and be involved in any of those sins. A Christian cannot live a life of blatant disobedience in any of those areas for an extended period of time.   I have seen the term thrown around a bit, but I have no clue what it means. Can someone break it down for me? Also, is there any divide between traditional libertarian thought and paleolibertarian thought?   Ah. I would venture to say they fit into the latter category.   Probably not, as long as you don't challege their prosperity gospel.   I would like to see myself owning several acres of property, operating a little farm. I would love to be surrounded by children and grandchildren. I cannot wait to see how much more I love my wife the older I get. I am gonna be a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking old veteran. (I know this because I am a cardigan wearing, pipe-smoking, scotch drinking *young* veteran). I would like to be well travelled. I would like to continue my travels as an old man, with my wife.    Where do you see yourself as an old man? Just curious if any of y'all ever think about this?   Depends.   In a few pentecostal type churches they have bishops in the traditional diocesian sense.  Oftentimes they see the word bishop as interchangable with elder or pastor. Many times they are ordained by their denomination.  Others are ordained by no one. Oftentimes these are the ones who open up their own "worldwide ministries" operating as entrepreneurs peddling Christendom to whoever they can.   Neither, I am a Libertarian.   Because I believe in social *and* economic liberty.   You are right about that! Those days are over too. I just picked up my 5. Now I am the private of thr NCO corps.   Absolutely. I took full advantage of my private status.   Now those days are gone and when I get in trouble, i can no longer say "I'm a private" as an explanation.   In 1 Cor. 7 verse 12 and on Paul says that a husband/wife who is married to a non-believer should not seperate from them.   The fundamental principle would apply in your scenario as well.   For example Russian Orthodox, Antiochian Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Greek Orthdox etc. From what I understand they are merely cultural divisions, but what actually makes these variants unique from each other? Also, in the US do Russian, Greek, and Oriental Orthdox churches all follow under the OCA?   Best news sources I would recommend.  Reuters.  BBC.  NPR     The seventh day was not a day spent creating anything. The world was complete by the end of the sixth day. The seventh was the day of rest, the initiation of the Sabbath pattern.   This.   I like it. I will soon be transitioning from my current career into another.  I love stability. I love knowing where I am going, and seeing myself move from a kid with no skills to a grown man moving in a bright direction.   I will refer you to my confession.   [Article IV of the WCF](http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IV.html) I believe in a literal six day creation.   Good. Not LHBC Milk Stout Nitro, but enjoyable nonetheless.   Our view is the same view Calvin adhered to about Sola Scriptura. It has historical precedent.   Again, we are not participating in any worship. We are enjoying a cultural holiday with neutered cultural symbols. Culture determines what symbols relate to false gods. Nobody in our culture associates anything on these holidays with pagan gods (except fringe groups)    Reformed Presbyterian here.  We don't believe you can come to God any way exceot through the word revealed in Scriptures. The Scriptures are the only revealed word of God. The Scriptures are the complete word of God. There is no other revelation at all. Since we are staunch adherents to the RPW, we allow nothing j  worship that is not commanded in Scripture. No outside traditions. No images, no human written songs (I am Exclusive Psalmody), no church calender etc.   That is what we mean by Sola Scriptura. It is not that the Scruptures are the highest revelation of God among many, we beleieve the Scriptures are the **only** revelation of God at all. (In an immanent sense).   Obviously the LOTR.   I liked the Elven appearances in *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell* by Susanna Clarke   The Name of the Wind series by Patrick Rothfuss  The Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson.  The Boneshaker Series by Cherie Priest.  The Leviathan series by Scott Westerfeld   If I use thst logic I should not use regular names for days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday etc), or teach my children the names of planets (Mars, Jupiter), or hve them read any litersture besides Scripture..  Paul was very schooled in the Pagan Greek poets, and Greek philosophy and rhetoric. He was familiar with the Olympic sports (hardly a Christian institution). There is value to culture and cultural identity. We do not allow that cultural heritage to influence our worship.   See Paul's argument for food offered to idols in 1 Cor 8. I would place cultural celebrations in this category.    Reformed Presbyterian here.  We acknowledge the paganistic core of these holidays, and therefore do not acknowledge them as Christian. If you go to our churches on Easter Sunday or the Sunday after Christmas, it will be no different than any other Sunday.  Usually we celebrate them as fun cultural holidays, but we place *zero* religious significance in them.  I cannot speak for the rest of Christendom.   **Edit;** Also, we don't use holy water, symbols, images, or any other such thing in worship.    [The Road to Middle-Earth; how J.R.R. Tolkien created a new mythology](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/564204.The_Road_to_Middle_Earth?from_search=true) by Tom Shippey   He assesses the influences and themes of Tolkien's mythology, noting especially the philiological themes of the works.   Because cars were a status symbol.   Today just about everyone has cars. If I took a picture to prove I had a car, you would not care. I think you already assume I have a car.    I am a Reformed Presbyterian looking to better understand EO history and thought? Can someonr recommend some good introductory (but not dumbed down) books to the EO world?   I listened to that article on NPR, and I think it is one of the best standalone stories supporting prison libraries. That is actually wht got me searching for information on prison libraries (which led me to the NYT article).   I am sorry, it was my misunderstanding.   My wife and I are set on homeschooling our children. Can y'all recommend some books about homeschooling? I am looking for anything about why you should homeschool, how to start homeschooling, any of your favorite books dealing with the subject.  I would also appreciate some memoirs of folks who did homeschooling/were homeschooled.   Yes, the PCA holds to the Canons of Dordt. (TULIP).  They are staunchly Calvinists.   Depends on which Presbyterian Church.   The PCUSA is pretty liberal. There are a few conservatives left.   The PCA and OPC are the largest confessional denominations. They are strict calvinists.   Cool, I was there too  March 2011- March 2012  November 2013- July 2014   Yeah, not a sports guy either. I have better things to do with my time.   Which conflict?   I am gonna have a glass after dinner. It was recommended by my (very knowledgable) local beer guy. I am a *huge* fan of stouts. So far Left-Handed Milk Stout Nitro is my very favorite beer.   What do y'all think of Bell's? Where does it fit on the stout spectrum?   Yup. I think there is a big difference between healthy assertiveness/confidence and alpha-male overcompensation.   For myself, I would say yes.   I work a manual job (the military), keep my hair short, dress very old school, enjoy mostly masculine type hobbies (wood working, hunting, fishing etc). I tend to be *very* conservative in my behavior (not exactly in my politics though).  I also like cooking, and do my share of the cleaning, but I don't see those as feminine exlusive activities.   Basically, would you say your definition of masculinity/male roles is traditional or not? Do you fit into the traditional parameters of masculinity or not?  I am *not* asking whether you think all men should be restricted to traditional gender roles, I am just curious in what ways you personally fit into traditional masculinity, and what ways you do not.   I dunno. I have never been that kind of guy. I don't put my hands on other dudes, don't hug other dudes, and don't pretend flirt with other dudes.   They tear you down as a human being. The point is to root out all individuality. You no longer own yourself. You are not unique. You do not do what you want. Your life belongs to your brothers.   Then they build you back up. They give you a new identity as a team member, a uniformed person who has voluntarily surrendered all selfexpression in order to live a lifestyle of absolute conformity.   I am definitely not opposed to reading it. I enjoy reading many things outside my perspective.   So you support the release of the Guantanamo Bay inmates but oppose free exchange of ideas for them? Interesting. How do you reconcile those two things?   I also support the closing of Gitmo, but I was just curious if in the meantime, y'all found the library important?   Not just my congregation. This issue is fundamental to Reformes Presbyterians throughout history. Calvin, Knox, the Westminster Divines, the Covenanters, all saw this as a first tier issue.   My entire historical line is one if Penal Substitutionary Atonement advocates.    Mead is closer to wine than beer.   My church would disagree. This is an issue we see as fundamental to Christian fellowship. A first tier issue.   Yes, it is changing. I was just explaining why such a divide has existed in the past.   A lot of it is culture. In American culture, beer has been associated with masculinity, especially blue collar masculinity. In the past it was frowned upon for women to drink beer.      I don't think they are heretics. That is a strong word. It refers to the denial of some fundamental doctrine of the Christian faith (i.e. the Trinity, Divinity of Christ, Substitutionary atonement etc)  I don't approve of many of their songs being used in worship, since I am a staunch advocate of the RPW.   For example, why is Pluto a typical dog, while Goofy is an anthropomorphic dog?      The war is no longer active, for one. It is officially over. OEF is over.  Of course you might have to do hard things. That's life. There is no free lunch. Vets sometimes understand that better.  The payoff is better than any other option though. No debt, a good resume, attractive employment qualities..    Not to mention you will actually be headed to college with an extensive resume and real world skills. Your chances of employment after college will be way above your peers.   Join the Army. That is what I did. Post 9/11 GI bill benefits are phenomenal. They will literally pay for all your college.  Or you could get an ROTC scholarship, and they will pay for all of your college and you will join as an officer.   Get another cut. I cut my high and tight every two weeks to keep it looking fresh    Mostly they just do paperwork.   92Y, Unit Supply Specialist.  You spend most of your time outdoors. Oftentimes they get called away on special missions to help others. Sometimes they have to prepare short speeches to give in the local "soldiers only" forums, and they win special medals for properly explaining themselves.  They are always on the front lines, truly the tip of the spear. Everyone in the military calls them "the SEALs of the Army". Not everyone can make it, but if you think you are up for it, go for it!      In the denominatin I grew up in, SS was always the packaged lifeway spiel. I got nothing out of it. I was always way more advanced, and comparing biblical principles to pop culture always annoyed the crap out of me.  Since I have made my journey to Reformed Presbyterianism I have loved SS. We always have very beneficial discussions at my church, our teachers write their own material, I love it. Now I teach our young adult SS class, and it has been wonderful.  I think it depends what circles you run in. Super grounded/confessional churches tend to take their theology way serious, this carries over into small group. This is what I look for in SS.. My experience with more broad evangelical circles has been very different. I am not a fan of the super chill social club SS ideal.   I recently read [this article in the Times](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/books/review/prison-library-at-guantanamo.html?_r=0) (which I know is a little old) and I was struck by a few thoughts, that I thought I would extend to y'all.  1. What do you think about the censorship going on at the Gitmo library? Librarians and library supporters tend to be very anti-censorship, but I am curious if circumstances determine our vehemence? Should we strictly regulate what a society of extremist affiliates are allowed to read?  2. How important is it to have a library in a place like Gitmo?  I would love to hear any other thought's y'all have   I would go for Old Rasputin.   First, I would make a distinction between "will" and "pleasure". I believe it is the will of God to ordain all things (including the judgement of the wicked) for his glory. This does not mean he takes pleasure in their demise.  In regards to Ezekiel 33:11, I believe this is God using human language to describe divine thought. The point ot this text is the individual responsibility of every man for his sin. The point of this text is not an explanation of the redemptive plan of God, but rather a plea for repentance aimed at an ungodly nation.     I am too, but it is pretty much the default explanation from every PC advocate I have ever spoken to.   Your disconnect is that you see baptism explicitly tied to profession of faith, and we do not. I do not believe any of those references explicitly refer to baptism being predicated by belief. Baptism is tied to the death, burial, and ressurection of Christ in the sense that it identifies the baptized one as a member of the covenant which Christ's sacrifice paid for.  The issue is, fundamentally, we do not interpret a single scirpture about baptism as referring to it being predicated by faith. 1 Cor 11:28-29 are quite obviously referring to believers.   I love stouts. They are truly the beer-lover's beer. I love oatmeal stouts, imperial stouts, pretty much anythubg but Guinness   [Ideomotor Effect](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_effect)   Left Handing Brewing' Milk Stout Nitro.  Stout's are my favorite styles of beer. The Nitrogen bottling makes the beer smooth and velvety. It is full bodied ans bitter in the best possible way.  Also, I am a man. And stouts are manly.    I was just using the example of the passover in passing.  The main reason is the aforementioned, 1 Cor. 11:28-29 make it clear that the recipient of the Supper must be able to **examine themselves** and **discern the broken body of the Lord**.   Those who support PC often claim this verse is referring to being able to discern the supper belonging to the body (i.e. the Church) as opposed to being able to discern/understand that the supper *is* the body of Christ.     First, it was not his time. He had a plan, and it was one of gradual revelation.  Second, Christ often veils his words in the gospels. He reveals himself to those he chooses, but veils himself to others. He fully intends for the pharisees and jewish leaders to think he is lying, so he can be crucified. He *wants* to be convicted and sent to die.   I believe it works the same way today. God reveals his gospel to those he chooses, and hardens the reprobate's heart.   Because infants are not capable of examining themselves so as not to partake of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner (1 Cor. 11). That is the simple answer.   Baptism is a continuation of circumcision. Obviously infants in the OT were circumcised.   The Eucharist is a continuation of the Passover supper. Do you think infants partook of the paschal lamb? They were present, of course, just as our infant children are present at the Eucharist, but I doubt they partook.  We believe baptism is a sacrament which does not require anything of the recipient. The Eucharist requires the ability to cognitively examine oneself, as per 1 Cor 11.   In regards to my comment about the regenerate man having free will, I agree with your assessment. I was using "free will" in the same way the OP likely meant (i.e. freedom to choose right from wrong) not in the sense that our will is totally free. The idea of free will is so subjective that it is hard to get across the point.    You don't choose God.  As a Calvinist I affirm the doctrine of predestination. Gid chose his elect before the beginning of the world, died specifically for his elect, and he regenerates his elect. Once a man is regenerate, his will becomes unbound, but unregenerate man has a will that only acts according to his nature.  As a monergist I do not believe man has any part in salvation.   We don't have free will. Our wills are utterly bound and distorted by sin. We are totally corrupted from birth.   	135
