                                                                                     I WOULD GIVE YOU GOLD BUT I SPENT ALL MY MONEY IN THE ESHOP.   THIS IS REASSURING THANK YOU.         I HAVE JUST STARTED PLAYING FIRE EMBLEM AWAKENING AND I AM TOO SCARED TO PLAY ON PERMADEATH AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT.   I see! But doesn't the time of year also factor into that angle? IE higher in the summer (I think)? How did they discern that difference?                                                                                                I'll just put this yeast in with this water and flour and - OH. It just seems like a strange thing for early humans to do and discover all around the world.                                                                                                                                      	110
 It could just be me. I have this weird thing with mannequins (that is a Forever 21 mannequin), I can't be near them without feeling uneasy. I don't like em at all!      Ooooooh! I didn't see that! I thought it was a woman having her head smashed in. But still, why is this on my drink? Haha      I have no idea.... My friend was trying it out, and she's not much of a gamer so there was some button mashing involved. We just see Batman what looked like kicking and flailing.      I kind of appreciated it. I like to watch movies with as little of information as possible so I don't expect what's going to happen. The list of actors and the director tied to the film is more than enough to consider watching this film.   Its so...beautiful!      This pub at the Shoppes in Chino Hills had a display that they would be showing it. I'm not sure if they're going to be charging for admission for it though.   Yea, didn't think there was something for it   Must be her son. Won't be able to look at her the same way again. Now that's a confused boner.  	12
 It's a sad day in America when anyone is still gullible enough to fall for either Ron or Rand Paul's stunts.   Yet another Libertarian man-child trying to act tough.   Maybe Rand can get a spot doing this on his Dad Ron's "THE END IS NEAR!!1!" infomercial scams after his presidential campaign collapses.   Phony political parties, such as "the Tea Party."   James Dobson's colon.   Then again, look how many fall for Alex Jones' bullshit.   Exactly. See the Cliven Bundy Militia/Jade Helm paranoids.   The GOP is already 4 or 5 separate parties, and the fissures continue to widen.   They're pretty much doing it to themselves.   And when a speaker at David Duke rallies (Rep. Steve Scalise, R-LA) is Republican Majority Whip.   And then he had his son drunkenly crash into it.   And what with that Jade Helm thing going on too, you know, it's better to be safe because those terrorists are some wily ones, you know?      Uh-oh. Reddit's White Supremacist/Neo-Confederate Downvote Militia isn't going to like this story one bit.   "far-right forced birth" is yet more accurate.  The forced birthers couldn't give a damn about the child after they've forced it into the world (or the pre-existing mother, it must be noted.)  Then, in their eyes, the mother and child they claim to so venerate become "welfare scum."          *So Brave*      IOKIYAR   William F. Buckley is spinning in his grave.   Especially bold considering GWB's own military record.    The neo-cons have not gone away.  And they can still play right-wing social conservatives like fiddles.     One million copies dropped from a sufficient height would definitely be enough to bust up a chiffarobe.   A few hand grenades for each of the security guards would help too. Then they can take out the evildoers should they hide behind statues and columns.   And that's just the way the Kochs and their ilk like it.   Establishment Republicans and their funders always make sure that they and their children don't do any of the fighting, bleeding, or dying in the wars they start.  That's where poor Republicans come in. The Establishment Republicans are happy to send the poor Republicans into the meat grinder if it means personal profit can be extracted.  I don't know how or why poor conservative voters keep falling for the lies the rich conservative plutocrats sell them. To rich Republicans, poor Republicans are little more than dung on their polo boots.  It's really just the same as the Civil War: wealth-extorting Plantation Owners and the Confederate Generals they funded sending poor white sharecroppers to die to for "the Cause."   I wonder what he thinks about his Dad's infomercials?  Maybe someone can locate him and ask.      Establishment Republicans and their sympathizers always make sure that they and their children don't do any of the fighting, bleeding, or dying in the wars they start.  That's where poor Republicans come in. The Establishment Republicans are happy to send the poor Republicans into the meat grinder if it means personal profit can be extracted.  I don't know how or why poor conservative voters keep falling for the lies the rich conservative plutocrats sell them. To rich Republicans, poor Republicans are little more than dung on their polo boots.  It's really just the same as the Civil War: wealth-extorting Plantation Owners and the Confederate Generals they funded sending poor white sharecroppers to die to for "the Cause."     can Salon just be banned?  Why does the American Right always insist on censoring or banning anything with which they disagree?  Reddit is, by deliberate design, meant to be a haven for ***USER***-submitted, ***USER***-curated content.  Reddit was never meant to be "a place where reactionary right-wingers won't have to risk getting their poor widdle fee-fees hurt." Previous management of this very subreddit found out that censorship, user bans, and false appellations such as "Not US Politics," "Off Topic," and "Rehosted Content" only backfire. Most of those Mods are gone now.   If you long for the comfort of a "Free Republic"-style echo chamber on reddit, try /r/conservative for one, where any mention of the Republicans' multi-decade ["Southern Strategy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) will get you flat-out banned.    I love how the GOP just keeps painting itself further and further into the corner.   As always, it is important to note that *The New American* is the house publication of the John Birch Society.  The John Birch Society believed that both Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy were "active, willing agents of the International Communist Conspiracy."  They also believed that fluoridated water was a Communist plot designed to stupefy the American population and prepare us for the inevitable Communist invasion to destroy America and all she stands for.  It's not at all difficult to see the parallels between the John Birch Society and other more recent movements on today's reactionary right.  See the "Jade Helm" paranoia, for one, in which Chinese soldiers are supposed to emerge from newly-dug tunnels beneath shuttered Wal-Marts to take over the United States.    Republicans are quickly losing the wedge issues they've exploited for decades.   He's down in his Dad's bunker, shotgun across lap, waiting for the invasion of the Washington Machine.    Nonetheless, if we can get those delegates together for Rand, he'll win the Republican nomination at a brokered convention. And so:  MONEYBOMB!  END THE MEDIA SILENCE!   Or you're a paranoid.  It's more likely than you think.   If they had inherited hundreds of millions in the 1970s? Yes, just about anyone *could* have "amass[ed] a fortune" of $10 billion, given that quantity of capital and *four decades* to grow it.  The Kochs' John-Bircher founding Dad left them hundreds of millions in the 1960s. Same story, but they've had *five decades.*   Is this "bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran"-McCain we're talking about?   Why would you anyone want to eliminate their own ability to vote for candidates they like, and who are good at their jobs?  Term limits = lazy democracy. If you want someone out, vote them out.  If you want to be a spiteful cuss, please don't take your sadism out on your fellow American voters by trying to limit their choices at the ballot box.   But even when "responsible gun owners" *do* do something stupid with their guns, they are often still lionized by the pro-gun crowd.  Witness the cult of shitposters that sprung up around George Zimmerman and celebrated him for "takin' out that thug."    It's the Gunbertarian Downvote Militia. They're extremely active on reddit.  It's like reading Yahoo News comments with a healthy dollop of Free Republic/Breitbart users thrown in.  They've managed to convince themselves that the "Muslim Kenyan Usurper" is coming to get their guns.   [He's lookin' like a fool with his pants on the ground.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMwhl4IrPNc)   Bingo. Same with abortion.   And a very small bumpersticker:  *This Winnebago sponsored by Koch Industries*   I understand you feel quite persecuted as an American Christian.  [May your mind be put at ease.] (https://video.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xft1/v/t42.1790-2/11333832_10152989957262297_366353660_n.mp4?efg=eyJybHIiOjMwNiwicmxhIjoxMTgyfQ%3D%3D rl=306 vabr=170 oh=601e51217b0f8b31a143256848089200 oe=55AAF61B)   And 100% of forced-birth wingnut warriors are outraged that 99% of women don't regret their abortions.    I'm sick of seeing democrats demonize Christianity   The democrats haven't demonized Christianity. What an odd charge.       The truth is that a lot of people respect Trump for being a "straight talker"  That's also what people said about Ross Perot. Glad we dodged that bullet.    See Stephen King's *The Dead Zone.*   Trump fans tend to be simpletons, so it fits.   Do you actually believe that crap, or are you just repeating what they've trained you to think on Fox News/AM radio?   Donald Trump is the living caricature of everything the Republican Party has stood for since the 1980s.  So are his fans: "He's a billionaire, so he must be doin' sumptin' right."   But... but... Ron Paul, Peter Schiff, and Glenn Beck all told me to buy gold! None of them would ever lie to me!   "The New American" is the house magazine of the John Birch Society.   What an attention whore    Prosser is the justice who was witnessed strangling one of his fellow justices because *she disagreed with him.*  I can't believe this was swept under the rug. No doubt some of the high-powered right-wing donors who have taken over Wisconsin greased some palms to make that incident go away, just as they did with this one.  The "War on Women" waged by Republicans and the American Right continues, no matter how many times they dismiss or scoff at the idea.    At least one Red State Governor out there is no longer willing to watch his own state's citizens suffer and die because Republicans want to spite the President.  What are the odds of other Red State Governors following his admirable lead?     What I mean, more specifically, is the subdivision within the Republican coalition which Establishment Republicans lead.  At best, the Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans humors (a better word might be "tolerates") the single-issue 'morals' voters -- but *only* because they bring the votes. Once any of those "moral planks" starts costing them votes, they dump it.  The Wall Street/Country Club Wing of the Republicans couldn't care less about the social issues, but they are happy to exploit rage over them to win the votes of a population that, were it not for these id-tapping rage issues, would have no objective reason for to voting Republican.  For example: the Republicans have lost on marriage equality. They can't continue to rant about "the homosexual agenda" and be taken seriously. They know this.  That leaves only a few single-issue wedges they can still reliably exploit for votes, one of which is abortion.  On abortion: the Republican Party has no intentions whatsoever of banning abortion, despite all of their rhetoric over the decades. Anyone who votes for Republicans on that issue should abandon all hope. The Republicans had the Presidency, a solid majority on the Supreme Court, and full control of Congress for the majority of the Bush/Cheney Era (2001-2009.) Yet they did nothing on abortion. (They did, however, try to kill off Social Security in their 2nd term.)  To sum up, the Republicans will continue to play single-issue anti-abortion voters until their tactics alienate more voters than they attract, just as they did with by exploiting the fear and rage of their anti-LGBT wing for the past 15-20 years.    It's worked quite well for abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin.     If they really believe a fetus is a life  ...then they'd support a generous post-birth social support network to care for the consequences of their ideology, rather than seek the elimination of such public assistance.     As a self-anointed "speaker for the unborn," *what makes you so sure they'd want you to speak for them?  Do you have any special skills that qualify you to act as a ventriloquist for "the unborn"?   What if "the unborn" found you horribly annoying and wanted you to STFU?        Translation: the Kochs greased some palms to get the investigation killed.   It's one of the few right-wing rage/wedge issues that still has any effect.  Mark my words: the Republicans will gleefully shove the "pro life" voters under the bus the *instant*  they realize that this wedge issue they've exploited for 40 years is costing them votes.  If anyone out there is still foolish enough to believe that the Republicans are about "honoring a Culture of Life," don't say you weren't warned when the Party dumps you and all of "God's Littlest Angels" like a used condom.   If Trump can't make it as a Republican, here's hoping he runs as an independent/third party candidate.  ;)   I guess it's because Texas politicians love the Constitution so much.    /s   Seriously, this should have taken all of a couple hours.  I doubt Josh could last a couple of seconds.    It'll be redone as a drama for Netflix: *19 Kids and Mounting*   I maintain that they aren't "pro life" so much as "forced birth."   They aren't "pro life," they're "forced birth."   Maybe he just needs to work longer hours, like his son Jeb! recommended.   Tell me why I love you like I do.   Were all other magazines wrong when they published cover stories on  Bin Laden, or Timothy McVeigh, or the Unabomber, or Dylann Roof?  I don't get the selective anger at Rolling Stone. It's always seemed like a self-created talking point for the permanent "THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!" media outlets to exploit.   Huh huh. You said "cum."   It sounds like a roller derby team.   Why do so many descendants of the poor white sharecroppers (who were sent to die by rich white Plantation Owners in their Cotton War) still celebrate the Confederacy?   I'm convinced it's because these poor whites have never really stopped to think about what and whom their ancestors were actually fighting for.  The Plantation Owners (and their latter-day apologists) invented all of these "Southern Pride! Honor! Heritage! War of Northern Aggression!" distractions to keep the Southerners of the time and their modern descendants from realizing the truth: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of the poor white sharecroppers as worth EVEN LESS than their African slaves.***  Let's restate that to make sure it's even more clear: ***the Plantation Owners viewed the lives of their of African slaves as inherently MORE VALUABLE than of the landless white peasants they sent to die.***   *The Confederate Battle Flag is nothing more a sign of their own exploitation  that of poor, landless, Southern whites beneath the very same Plantation Owners and Slavers that the slaves were forced to suffer under.*  So why do so many of the descendants of these poor, landless, sharecropping whites sent to die in the Confederate-initiated Civil War *still* celebrate the symbols of the Confederacy as if it were something of which to be proud? Why continue honor those "Rebel Heroes" who sent their very own families to die for profit?  Yet they'll still run around claiming "Pride! Honor! Heritage!," even thought it was those same bogus "Pride! Honor! Heritage!" lies that sent their own ancestors to the grave in defense of the slaves (and most importantly,  the profits the slaves generated for Southern Aristocrats.) There's nothing remotely "honorable" about that.    Oh really? The Confederates "returned" Fort Sumter to the United States?  Or did they invade it, occupy it, and then use the very cannons and munitions they also stole from the United States to fire upon United States ships?  Stormfront or Free Republic devotees might fall for such Confederate revisionism, so don't be surprised if you find no takers when you try to market such Confederate apologia here.   Most of the South freaked out and abandoned the United States months before Lincoln was even sworn in as President.  It wasn't Lincoln's fault that Plantation Owners were raging paranoids.   Nor was it the fault of all the poor white Southern sharecroppers sent by the Plantation Owners  to die to protect the slaves in the fields. Do you know what that means? It means that all of the Confederate Ownership Class placed a greater value on the lives of their black African slaves than of lives native white Southerners.  It's always confused me why so many poor Southern whites still proudly wave the Confederate flag  the very symbol of the Plantation Owners that sent all their great-great-grandpappys to die  in order to protect the slaves and the profits they brought to said Owners.  The rich whites of the South kept all the money; the poor whites did all the fighting and dying for their White Masters.  It's not as if they had a choice. "Go fight in my Cotton War or get shot for desertion."  That's why the rich, Plantation-owning whites had to invent all this "Southern Liberty! Heritage! Honor!" horseshit: to distract the poor whites from realizing they were being used as fucking cannon fodder. Some, as we've seen, even fall for that old load of crap *today,* 150 years after the fact.  Yep, those Confederates and Plantation Owners sure were heroes! Why do so many poor Southern whites continue to celebrate the "Heritage" of the Southern Elites who sent their own families to die?   Did the Confederates make any effort to compensate the United States for all of the Federal property they stole?  Who violated the "Non-Aggression Principle" here?  This is the question Confederate apologists *always* refuse to answer (at least honestly.)    If they feel like their identity is being purposefully eradicated, even moderate Southerns like myself would shake hands with the KKK and agree to a temporary pact of mutual benefit against the Outsiders.  And if their "feelings" are the result of paranoia?   even moderate Southerns like myself would shake hands with the KKK and agree to a temporary pact of mutual benefit against the Outsiders.  Imagine the Pay-Per-View audience! I'd bet Americans would pay a lot to watch potential McVeighs and Bundys and Roofs get what they seem to so desperately seek.     Nazi flags too. There's a strong Aryan Nations/White Supremacist/Sovereign Citizen Militia presence in Idaho.  I don't understand the reflexive support for distant and failed causes, but many are clearly receptive to it.       I hope all those Patriots!^TM and Liberty-Lovers!^TM busy keepin' us safe from TYRANNY!^TM don't leave their potato salad sitting out in the sun for too long.   And simultaneously protecting us from tigers too!   "Liberty University" (founded by Jerry Falwell) and "Regent University" (rebranded from the original "Oral Roberts University") are nothing but diploma mills for right-wing Evangelical Christians.  It's amazing the number of Bush/Cheney Administration hires who had "degrees" from these phony diploma mills.   What your people call corn, my people call maize.   It's hard to say precisely what a Trade Union is, but when they come for them, no one who is not a Trade Unionist will speak up for them.   --Peggy Noonan   *Jeb!* says you just need to work longer hours.   More Republicans voting Libertarian would be *very* good for America.  I encourage this practice strongly. ;)   I think I may have heard that phrase... isn't it "Southern Plan" or something similar? "Strategies for the South," maybe?  I know that to utter the dread phrase (whatever it is, precisely) earns one an instant ban from certain "conservative" subreddits.  It must be a *very* dangerous idea for them to fear even its mere mention.     Damn those lib'ruls and their free-spendin' Big Gub'mint ways!  THOSE ARE OUR TAXES! *OUR TAXES!*     Or, very simple: they'd just starve out and die. Natural selection at work.  Libertarian Alert!   This is an excellent point. The Southern slave states were *always* trying to game the system, even from the very beginning. There was never any consistency to their arguments beyond the naked financial interests of Planation Owners.  "Well, no, they can't *vote,* of course, but we have to take care of them at our expense. Shouldn't they count as least as *partial* people for our the representation of our fair state? We know what's best for them anyway, so of course we'll vote in their interests!"  See also the American Right's continuing efforts to suppress and complicate participation in elections for those voters they denote as undesirable.   An uncomfortable truth for Confederate apologists, and their modern-day descendants and defenders:  ***The Plantation Owners cared far less about the lives of the poor white sharecroppers than they did their African slaves.*** That's why they sent the poor whites to die on the battlefield. That's got to be a bitter pill to swallow, and the entire "Southern Identity" movement is centered on a collective refusal to acknowledge that simple truth.  "PRIDE!" and "HONOR!" and "HERITAGE!" had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Initiating and waging a war against the United States was an economic decision to make the South's fat and happy Plantation Owners fatter and happier, and they used the bodies and blood and limbs of the South's poor whites to do it.  The Confederate Leadership/Plantation Owners sent hundreds of thousands of poor white sharecroppers into a meat grinder because their sole goal was to keep their cotton profits rolling in, and that required safe, healthy slaves to harvest it. And poor, landless whites had no choice but to go war to defend the slaves who generated the cotton profits which kept the Plantation Owners and Confederate funders going.  So why do so many of the descendants of these poor white victims continue to lionize the engineers of their own families' death and destruction? In a way, weren't these poor white sharecroppers used by the rich white Plantation Owners/Profiteers used as pawns and slaves themselves?  There is one difference: the newly-Americanized slaves never worshipped their Confederate oppressors as heroes and role models. Poor whites who still defend the "Lost Cause" and believe the lie of "the War of Northern Aggression" have spent 150 years venerating the very Plantation Owners who sent their great-great-grandpappies to die to preserve and expand their personal profit.  These aren't ideas that Confederate apologists like to entertain, as if they think about it too hard they are forced to realize that they, like the slaves, were ***utterly used,*** and, very ***unlike*** the descendants of slaves, still continue to the lick the boots of those who sent their ancestors to die (even now, 150 years later.)  If so many poor American whites weren't fixated on maintaining this toxic "At least I'm bettr'n *you*" attitude toward poor Americans of other races, all could realize that, if united, have far more interests in common than they would ever expect.  American conservative leadership can *never* allow this realization to take place, or their uneasy coalition of the past 40+ years collapses from beneath them.  And the power of the "Southern Strategy" (employed so successfully by the American Right ever since Richard Nixon) is fading.         Nearly four decades on, many of the most foolish of all voters (the "Reagan Democrats") are finally realizing they got played for suckers.  Some are still falling for the schtick.    The Religious Right couldn't give less of a damn for either mother or child post-birth.  Always remember: they are not "pro-life"  they are *forced birth.*      It's getting harder and harder for the GOP to hide what it is, and for whom their dog-whistles are designed.   Limbaugh's colon.   Hey, he was the one who decided that 2016 was going to be his year and had gastro surgery a couple years back as prep.  Screaming Republican jackasses do well on Fox and AM radio, but that's about it. He's going for the post-"I ran for President" contracts.   Yes, as in when she insisted on buying a failing PC-clone company (Compaq) and duplicated HP's existing PC-clone business.  Thanks to Fiorina, the once-great HP is now an inkjet refill company.   Carly Fiorina: "I'm utterly irrelevant. Pay attention to me!!!"   Oops.   Panorama setting required.   OP used to sell bags of oranges on off-ramps.  One day a Mexican laborer showed up and started selling better-quality oranges for less.  Big Orange laid off OP the very next day.   The Free Market: it bit OP in the ass.   I really don't understand how/why the Pauls were ever taken seriously by anyone.  It's been one long grift since the first newsletter, and yet they only defend the Paul family all the more.  Is there a classification in the DSM-V that deals with this sort of thing?   See?   The thing about PaulBots? They always insist upon having the last word.     No, it's about ***Paul*** saying it. Otherwise it would have never been posted by his apologists in an attempt to say "See? He's not racist, and neither is his Dad!"  Didn't work for Ron, won't work for Rand.  Everyone knows about the Pauls and their history. Those who do and continue to defend either of them know exactly what they're speaking for and who they're speaking to.   As I said, this isn't the 19th century anymore. The Paul and their fellow Confederates can't get away with this shit anymore.  But it's certainly clear it won't stop their zealots from trying.     This thread isn't about the Drug War. It's about Paul-pologists trying to hide the Paul Family Legacy.  Didn't work in 1988, didn't work in 2008, didn't work in 2012, not going to work in 2016.  Sorry. The 19th century is over.    Otherwise, I just don't care.  Obviously.     Then they should be happy to publicly stand by their supporters in the Aryan Nations, Sovereign Citizen, and Militia movements, shouldn't they?   Why are the Pauls so afraid to publicly acknowledge their base? (See Rand's surreptitious meeting with Cliven Bundy about "Nevada state sovereignty.")  Calling attention to relevant facts is not a logical fallacy, no matter how much one would like to pretend it is.  Arguing it is of little use if one is a "true believer" in the Pauls and their phony "R*EVOL*UTION." Those who still support the Pauls after the extremist right-wing, paranoid conspiracy crap the Paul Family has squeezed out for decades tells us a lot about their alignments, their sanity, and likely both.    Calling out candidates like Ron and Rand Paul, who have decades-long ties to White Supremacists and Confederate apologists, is not a "logical fallacy."  Anyone who doesn't know the history of the Paul family and its sympathizers is certainly not well-versed enough in recent American politics to engage in an intelligent discussion.  And even worse are those who *do* know the Paul Family's history, and continue to support them.     I bet the 'facial strategy' worked far better for the Republicans in the convention center's Men's rooms.  *[tap tap tap]*   Why criticize me? The Paul Family has poisoned their own name far beyond anyone's ability to defame it.  [Lest we forget.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)  And as everyone with even the most basic knowledge of current American politics knows, there is a ***LOT*** more where this came from.   I remember how the Republicans got him to singlehandedly fund the "Recall Gray Davis" petitions to the tune of $1.7 million. He was foolish enough to think that the California GOP would actually let him run for Governor of California.  Here's a video of him realizing he'd been utterly used to pay for the recall drive, then dumped by the California GOP in favor of Schwartzenegger:  [Rep Darrell Issa sobs after Scharwenegger bigfoots him out of 2003 gov recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VW0v7wwfkQ)  But hey, they threw Issa a seat in Congress as a consolation prize. ***"BENGHAZZZZZIII!!!1!!!one!1!"***   Kochonomics!   No doubt this will be as successful as Donald Trump's outreach efforts.      As did Michele Bachmann.   In Scott Walker's case case, "God" clearly refers to "the Koch Brothers."   God must have a great sense of humor.   Stop trying to make "Paul" happen.  It's not going to happen.   In short: today's Republican Party is attempting to repeal the 20th and 21st centuries and return us to the 19th.   The main question: is his "gofundme" Wingnut-Welfare page live yet?   The Elephant in the room, as it were.   as they have secretly sown, now they must publicly reap.  what a bitter crop to harvest.   Good God. They're tea-bagging *themselves* now.   For conservatives to get over their fascination with repealing the 20th and 21st centuries in favor of a return to the 19th.   The GOP is a wrecking ball for the future of the GOP.   Jesus built my hotrod.   Oh, look! The Mods are employing the "Off-Topic" lie again.  I guess a Bundy Militia cheerleader must have got his little fee-fees hurt and complained.   Wisconsinites: Walker's Republicans and the Koch Brothers are trying their best to turn Wisconsin into an extension of the Deep South.  Don't let them get away with it. Our nation needs you.   It's surprising that that shitty right-wing fantasy novel hasn't received more attention, given all of the havoc that it's inspired.  That book is where a lot of their "the gub'mint is a-gonna come git mah gunzzz!!1!" and "the coming race war" and "let's nuke the Jews!!1!" fantasies came from.  "The Order" in Denver used it to justify bank robberies and murdering liberal talk show hosts. Timothy McVeigh used it as a model while planning his domestic terrorist attack on Oklahoma City. The Bundy Militia are also big fans.  In case anyone doesn't know what were talking about, *The Turner Diaries* is a novel by a White Supremacist (under a pseudonym, of course) that right-wing domestic terrorists have viewed as an instruction manual for nearly 4 decades now.  Here's the wikipedia entry on it, which is a good start but doesn't nearly capture the poor writing and bizarre conspiracy theories which have come to define the modern American Right:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turner_Diaries     Pat Buchanan is the man who convinced Ron Paul to act as a "top economic advisor" to the Buchanan campaign in 1992 instead of running for the Republican nomination (as Paul had originally planned) on the heels of Paul's failed 1988 Libertarian presidential bid.  Ron Paul discusses this in his ridiculous, racist newsletters. Birds of a feather, I suppose.   ... and their "Uh, I have a bad back" disability payments.  (Funny addendum: Pat Buchanan got out of Vietnam with "a bad knee." This, however, didn't stop him from taking up jogging in 1992 when he sought the Republican presidential nomination 25 years after the fact.)   Until right-wing domestic terrorists start setting up roadside IEDs.     Is it TeaBaggery?    Yep, this was also the exact target demographic for the KKK in the 20th century.  And Fox/AM radio's target demographic for today.      this very small minority of southern crazies is literally making the entire south look bad  The same could be said of all the poor, white, landless soldiers that the Plantation Owners deliberately sent to die in order to protect their cotton wealth.  Instead, the descendants of those sent to die by Cotton Profiteers still fall for this "Pride and Heritage" bullshit invented by the Plantation Class to justify sending their great-great grandfathers to die to preserve the "Lost Cause."  Here's something for members of White Wing of today's right-wing to think about: *the lives of poor whites meant even less to the Plantation Owners than did the lives of their African slaves.*  And yet, these poor, angry White Supremacists *still,* even after 150 years, wave the banner of their own forefathers' death and oppression at the hands of the Southern Slavers as if it something of which to be proud.    Only in Texas could a couple hundred rednecks think their AR15's could stand a chance against the United States military.  These Keyboard Kommandos were raised on *Red Dawn/Rambo/Chuck Norris* violence porn and fantasize of themselves as invincible ass-kickin' heroes fur 'Murica.    I hope the Timothy McVeigh/Cliven Bundy/*Turner Diaries* Fan Clubs aren't going to act out again.   This is what happens to people who drink the Tea.  Don't drink the Tea.   And Sarah Palin is their Queen.   They aren't "pro life"; they're "forced birth."  Just look at how much regard they have for "the Sanctity of Life" after birth. Then, both mother and child are dismissed as "welfare scum" and cast away.  Based on their attitudes, I often wonder if these "Christians" are following who they think they are.   Crunchy Frog.    it's when major retailers and such start getting scared and politically correct and end up pulling related products from their shelves and banning their sale of such products on their websites even by private sellers. It's basically back-door censorship disguised as political correctness.  Another way to look at it: the Free Market has spoken!     The corrupt Mods themselves specifically used that language.   And this is what led to grossly unscrupulous Mods banning users with a de facto shadowban, all the while lying "Mods have no power to ban users. Only Admins can do that."  Then they banned anyone they felt like.   The "de facto shadowban" problem on Reddit is greater than has been widely acknowledged.  A couple of years back, some remnants of the Ron Paul/Cliven Bundy/"LIBERTY!!1!"^TM crowd engineered a takeover at certain news and politics subreddits, then started flat-out banning users, content, and publications that they disagreed with.  Hopefully such Mod Frauds will be swiftly dealt with in the future.   Sons-of-Birchers.   Phillips or Flathead?  	151

 I finished the first chapter of Infinite Jest (Year Of Glad) and I didnt't understand anything.It's not about language,it's about the plot.I simply didn't understand what is going on.   Well,I read 49 in my native language.It's the only Pynchon novel that translated into Turkish.I've hardly found GR and it's English.So,I can't read V at this moment.   wow,this looks amazing but i'll miss malvo.   Why do you consider GR as a difficult book? Because of the language or because of the plot?   I've read Crying Of Lot 49 and I loved it.It was an amazing book.  	5
 Definitely. The accents, the snow, the mannerisms, the setting is as much a part of the show as the characters.    "Where do you think we are?"   I thought she conveyed them both very well in Breaking Bad, but different strokes.   It's quite clearly not.      Snarky? Matt isn't snarky. Well, maybe in the Waid run.  I love Daredevil because he's had some of the best character work in modern comics. Over a decade he slowly had a massive mental breakdown due to the death of a loved one and the outing of his secret identity. The Bendis/Brubaker era was like one really well written TV series with a main character arc comparable to Breaking Bad. All he wants is to protect the citizens of his city, but it all comes at a massive cost to his mental well-being. Frank Miller and Kevin Smith also touched upon this and I think that's part of what makes their books so great.  Looking elsewhere, there are a lot of fun stories. I've heard the Waid interpretation as a swashbuckler.   I'd love to see Miles' costume. I love that costume a lot.  Edit: Seriously guys? You're downvoting me because I like a costume. I'm not asking for black Spider-Man or trying to say I'd prefer to see Miles. I'm just saying I'd like to see [this extremely badass costume](http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portland-press-herald_3535489-674x1024.jpg) in a film. It's a great costume and it'd certainly help differentiate from other live-action incarnations. I thought this sub was better than downvote to disagree.   And what's that?   I haven't played in a few months, but I was wondering what happened to all of their mods. I was wanting to play with MFFS again.   I dunno. I love that run so very much, but if you're not very into comics - paticularly older comics - the dated style is kinda hard to read. Therefore I recommend the more modern runs first and foremost.   Really? I thought she was perfect. She's the perfect mixture of snark and I can't be arsed to do anything that I think embodies JJ.   You hate comic Daredevil? For shame.   Shame because both of their series were really good, then they just got shoe-horned into everything.   He said with the Warren Ellis flair.   Pretty much what I came it to recommend. It's worth noting that Thanos only appears in the beginning and the end of DnA's run.   I'm trying to do a school project on box-office sales, and I thought the Chinese release date would be a major factor in how much money the movie makes.   I'm not an anime fan, but when I'm sick I'll turn on Naruto as I loved it when I was younger.      I really enjoyed CATFA for the Spielbergian vibe. I didn't watch it until after Iron Man 3, but when I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was like a cheesy 80s movie with a nice message, good dialogue and characters, entertaining actors and an interesting story. Red Skull wasn't great and the action is hardly memorable, but overall, it's very enjoyable.   How has there been no mention of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Inception? If you look toward eastern animation, Akira and Ghost in the Shell are both very pretty movies.   I wouldn't object to him leading a Firefly revival.   Does it make it any less of a good idea or any less of a good hour of television?   It was a good idea putting 90% of Game of Throne's main characters in one place for the start of the series before splitting them all up.   Community - Tell Dan Harmon to make the show about the characters rather than himself. I enjoyed the first couple seasons a lot, but near the end the character's personalities were flip-flopping all over the place and Harmon was explicitly writing episodes to make fun of things he didn't like (even if most of his viewers do). I miss the days Abed was cute, now he's just an excuse for Harmon to say something meta. Honestly, I don't think it's even funny anymore.   Why is he running? Is musical chairs really that big in ABQ?   Just ask Tommy Wiseau   Is it the same as the dick joke?      He wrote it himself. Kermode's main case for enjoying it more was because it was based on a book it gave Tarantino a stronger structure to follow.   My mixtape.   I dunno. Foster is pretty great in that movie.   I can't blame him for that. At least, if he's written well in future movies, we have a good actor in the role.   Clever Bryan Singer and Co. I didn't even notice that.   Just now noticing what an unfortunate acronym A Clash of Kings has.   And - for the most part - failing. Thankfully a charismatic and entertaining actor like Cavill was cast.   Throne of Blood all the way.   It wasn't voice only and I meant recognition in general.   But from Peter's perspective pretty awesome.   I've been dieing to see Tarantino return to the blaxploitation genre.   Does The Dark Knight count by this measure? It's a Mark Millar comic and it's pretty rare for him to dip his toe in other genres and when he does, it tends to be pretty poor. I'm shocked they made a decent movie out of the steaming pile of crap that was Kingsman.   I love Saga, but it's not a comic book movie.   I wasn't a fan of Drive - it was well made, but the tone and style didn't sit right for me - but the kiss in the lift was magical.   Sandman was perfect in that movie.   Best cameo, because - dammit! - Nathan Fillion doesn't get enough recognition.   Frankly, I couldn't stand this show at first, but complicated plotting, great character work and funny dialogue really made the show grow on me so I personally think Marvel's Agents of Shield is much more deserving than a 7.5. I don't think anything about an 8.3, but still, the show improved vastly, but I feel it took way too long to do it. The direction is still kinda bland and as a result, so is the action, but it's still a pretty entertaining show.   That wasn't what I was asking, but I love those series. I finished YtLM a month ago and am still conflicted over the excellent ending. I've got volume 4 of Preacher lying next to my bed and I'm waiting for the last two volumes in the post. These books are both more deserving or movies than characters like Cyborg or Ant-Man (saying that as a DC and Marvel fanboy) yet they've spent so long in development hell. Thank God Preacher is getting a show and the fact it's replacing Mad Men's slot in the AMC line-up gives me high expectations.   I, for one, really like A History of Violence and V for Vendetta.      I'm 98% sure Alan Moore put a curse on the movie to prevent it from becoming a classic. Either that or it wasn't *that* great.    I think that was a result of HBO's deal with the BBC though. I could be wrong.   Didn't he have a heart attack?   I'm a big comic fan, so when I was first getting into the medium I was recommended Sandman and Fables and I loved them. I quite like the other Gaiman books I've read so I'll check out Anansi Boys.   I'm looking for good adaptions of myths. I was very much into myths in general when I was a kid and would love to read some more mature content on them. I used to like Egyptian, Arthurian, Greek, Celtic and Norse myths in particular.   Isn't R-Rated Home Alone just Die Hard?   Upvote for "adorably homophobic".      It was a joke. Peyton did a great job on Ant-Man, especially in the face of adversity. I wouldn't deny him that.   I used to really dig that movie when I was younger, now it's a bit meh, but I love the style to it.   Doom, Kang, Annihilus and Galactus are all being screwed by Fox. I'd love to see them and the Silver Surfer brought into the MCU. If they wanted to do the Reed Richards as a villain arc from Ultimate Marvel, I'd be pretty pleased. Unfortunately, Miles Teller is perfect for that Reed.   Nah, Bring it On mate.   I don't understand the downvotes, I liked most of these, but I wouldn't call any of them the best of the year, but none of them are so atrocious they deserve downvotes.   It's fine to watch by itself, but if you want to watch some of the earlier ones, I only recommend 5 and 6. The others are a bit meh, but 5 has some really great action.   I'm shocked to see this so low down. ~~Of course he does! He's great.~~ Actually, not a comic book movie.   I really like Arrow, but I hate him being a Batman clone in the show. In the comics, Green Arrow is a border-line hippy in his views. The (exaggerated) Frank Miller version describes him as a communist. Watching him torture people and use excessive violence to get revenge and deliver his own form of justice reminds me much more of Charles Bronson in Death Proof than Robin Hood (which is where most of his basic characterisation comes from).   The visuals in DoFP make up for how stationary the rest of the film is.   Fargo   No Country for Old Men  Stand by Me   Super 8  Goodfellas   Casino   The Wolf of Wall Street   Slow West   It has 90+% on Rotton Tomatoes.   Ehh, wasn't my cup of tea. Certainly not bad, unlike Psycho II or Child's Play.   I mean, he did Fright Night, Child's Play and Psycho II. That's hardly a stellar filmography. I'm not even going to mention how unconvincing it'll be having a 72 year-old playing a high schooler.         Transmetropolitan.   Looking for some slow, romantic and generally pretty and good-looking movies with a focus on landscapes.   Garden of Words also has a calm, understated feel to it. It's plot is similar to Lost in Translation, except gender flipped. The animation is on par with 5 Centimetres Per Second, but the story and characters aren't and it ends abruptly. It's still very good, but not as good as 5C/S.   Even if it was Pam Grier?   True Romance, Lost in Translation, 5 Centimetres Per Second, The Garden of Words.   It insists on itself.   And the action really isn't great. I really don't like the film's visual style.   Premise doesn't captivate me, but Joss returning to comics is pretty exciting.   Is it too much to ask for a likable Robin?   None of that was a problem with the direction.   Ferris Bueller's Day Off   Intergalactic private investigator.   I couldn't ever settle down either. I'm a leaf on the wind.   I wanna see him in the Bendis-era tank top.   Actually, they do. It's Formatted like this   Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish   and   Adam McKay and Paul Rudd   I'm loving Aaron's run so far and I give him credit, not a single word written has been out of character.   I hate finding out he had a wife before A New Hope. You'd think it'd be mentioned a few times in the original trilogy.   I prefer the second one, just because it succeeds as a sprawling gangster epic as well as an excellent action film.   Completely fresh start with a focus on telling great stories. We see everyone starting out again at the cost of some great supporting characters. Certain books will have interlinked storylines, but no company wide crossovers. Books will be aware of each other, but won't need to conform to match the main books or whatever. We slowly build to the Justice League for like a year or two in each characters respective books, then the first crossover is the formation of the Justice League. A similarly variety of books to DC's current line up. Only two books per character maximum. Origins are rebooted. Creative control is left in the hands of writers and artists and they propel storylines.   Please don't. They're both abysmal and contribute little to the characters outside of the book itself.  The only books starring Batman that are good are Batman and Robin, Batman and Detective Comics from #30 onwards. The rest are crap.   Doug Liman   You'd still think the director would think about these motivations.   Simple, but a pretty great story.   I love artsy bullshit, but its getting in the way of the narrative right now and it's annoying me.   He said he'd have been in Arrow if they asked him.   I liked it.    I ended up 1600 miles   That's diameter of dwarf planet Pluto, formerly the smallest planet category of our solar system.   The thing about street fights is, the street always wins.   You'd respect a guy for abandoning all of his religious beliefs?   Luke Cage, Daredevil and Iron Fist teaming up.   Because we already pay for it and and it is a government-owned company.   Soule on Daredevil and Aaron on Doctor Strange? This'll be great.   I wouldn't recommend that. As I said, I'm not a fan of half of those movies, but love the other half.   How has this not gotten more attention. This is ridiculous.      Except from pretty much all of them. Just look at Captain America's across the movies.   Honestly, the first four suck really bad. They're horrendous, but most gearheads I know love them for the exact reason you listed. Come the fifth one, they pretty much became heist/superhero movies. There's only about fifteen minutes of racing between the last three films. And they actually got some pretty interesting female characters which is more than I can say for most blockbusters. They're a bit like a racially and sexually diverse Mission Impossible, they just do ridiculous stunts and banter with each other and that's what makes it so entertaining. Watching the Rock and Vin Diesel have one-liner offs or Ludachris and Tyreese Gibson arguing is just so damn funny and the cast has great chemistry. The setpiece at the end of five is such a blast to watch I feel I have to mention that. If you must watch one, watch Fast 5. It introduces the Rock, has some of he best action (well, maybe 7 can rival it) and it has a pretty great villain.   I'll never forget the shock on my face when he leaves Brolin's wife's house and checks his boots for blood.   [I love this look](http://www.therpf.com/attachments/f78/marvel-now-punisher-costume-gerads-version-10-22-white-ammo-pouches-added-imageuploadedbytapatalk1405125912-617483-jpg-348172d1405125913)   Nova, the Runaways or Young Avengers. You could probably squeeze Kamala Khan into the YA.   Anthology series almost never work out wow. Although, the cast is excellent. Nick Offerman could get me to watch anything.   Do they take overseas subscriptions?      Read the article.   Hopefully now that Aaron is on board , this'll change.   Selma director. MCU Exchange broke that they were in talks.   Buy it. I've got the first one and it's excellent. I've actually performed a monologue from it a couple times. It is truly an excellent piece of writing in keeping with the tone and language of the movies and Shakespeare's tragedies.     	120

That's what I said. Black people aren't bad swimmers because they're black. Rather, black people are usually bad swimmers. Probably for a number of reasons.   No, that's stereotyping. And many stereotypes are there for a reason. The one about black people not being good swimmers is more true than it is false.   Bermuda   Just edited my comment because that's how it came off.   Racism is the one thing in the world that makes me actually rage. This is not racism. I live on an island with a majority black population. While black people love the water just as much as us whiteys do, if not more, they really are terrible swimmers. I've seen black kids jump 40 feet off cliffs, do a perfect backflip jackknife, then pop up and doggy paddle their ass back to the dock asap. That said, it's not a rule, rather a trend. The armchair Freakonomics writer in me wants to say it might just come down to whose parents pay for swim classes, or where you grow up. I'm a super strong swimmer because I grew up on a beach with a vicious rip-tide and a father who'd chuck me into it then tell me to swim back to him, not because I'm white.   well if we're going with the neck injury, surely there's more of a chance of that pushing someone and whipping their neck back, rather than just smacking them on the head   Thanks mom   ... hwat?

I know this opinion is super unpopular on reddit, but I just don't see it. He's a perfectly adequate actor to me, but really nothing special. And in A Young Doctor's Notebook I think he's trash, helped  by very good writing and Jon Hamm. So many actors that could do so, so much more with that role than Radcliff ever could.   Pretty sure there are enough people doing that already. You can't just enslave an entire people then give them their freedom and expect the entire population to swing into step with the rest of society. White people have had an entire system of support that's been improved for thousands of generations.  Imagine sending two kids out into the wild to fend for themselves. Which one is going to do better: the kid that's been raised by a family of avid campers, or the kid that's never ventured beyond the city limits?   Yeah, I've TRIED to explain this in one of my articles, but really, I have no idea. Short story is that it's a combination of factors. The wing-sail exploits the Bernoulli principle, the same thing that makes planes fly. The foils then practically eliminate drag by pushing the boats out of the water. These two combinations mean the boats can get going way faster than anyone, even the designers of the boats themselves, predicted.   For safety reasons, no. Luckily the course they'll be racing in Bermuda has a pretty steady breeze, rarely getting above 20-25 knots.   The AC World Series comes down here in October, when flights and hotels rooms will be cheaper. Come check it out!   The point is that they can sail much faster in wind speeds that would have been too low to race in with a J-Class. I get to see the AC45's from my porch. The water is flat calm but they're fucking flying, crew boats behind them going full pelt just to keep up.   3x the wind speed fast. Boggles the mind    Not only that, they are capable of reaching three times the wind speed in much shallower waters, allowing stadium seating for spectators. Historically only those with access to private boats were able to watch the races. The wing sail the boats are using is also a huge improvement as it allows them to not be at the mercy of the wind as much as they were in the past. This meant there were huge delays in the action, which is terrible for TV.  For the next finals though they've shrunk the size down to 48 feet. The AC48 while smaller is a lot more affordable to build (SF only had three boats competing because of the price).   I'm actually the America's Cup correspondent for my paper when it comes to my home of Bermuda in 2017. Can't. Fucking. Wait.   I feel safe here   It's ok.

Shine on each other?   Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Erathe kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .  History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of history it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the timeand which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.  My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nightsor very early morningswhen I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .  There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .  And that, I think, was the handlethat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didnt need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fightingon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .  So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water markthat place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.  EDIT: I went through an HST phase like everyone else, but I went a bit further. I devoured everything he wrote. Even copied his short stories out by hand. Without a doubt Fear and Loathing is his best work, but I'd really recommend people pick up The Great Shark Hunt, which is a collection of his short stories. That said, out of his entire bibliography, this quote still sticks with me the most.   apparently people don't like South Park references    Not my neighbor. My best friend's neighbor. And I guess they are. The two families are very close.   Lucy is her name. She's also called Lulu. Or just Lu. Or Lucifer.  e: Lu. Cy. She was Lulu, plain Lulu, in the morning, standing two foot one in one sock. She was Lu in slacks. She was Lucifer at school. She was Lucindra on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lucy.   My best friend's dog does this every morning to his neighbors. She's the sweetest chocolate lab you've ever met, Lucy. She pops over to the neighbors house at the exact time the mom goes for a run. Trots along with her for a little while, turns back, hits the pool, then goes home to be fed and have a nap.  The whole being a human thing is way overrated. I'd trade places with dear old Lulu any day.    Step ~~3~~ 4: bro down.  e: [seriously thought Reddit would get this reference.](http://media.bizj.us/view/img/3873531/cartman-south-park-twitter-ubjjpg-large*1200xx946-532-0-16.png)    Your posts recently have been not bad for someone who can't spell their name ^^^^I'm ^^^^sorry ^^^^I ^^^^can't ^^^^resist ^^^^it's ^^^^a ^^^^problem. ^^^^I ^^^^know   Well there goes my Friday night plans ^^^I ^^^need ^^^to ^^^get ^^^a ^^^life   That;s exactly the type of solution I was thinking of. Use your head.    It is ALWAYS ok to laugh and upload to reddit. SCHAAAAAADENFRUEDE is like when a college kid find out what he put his dick in.   In my 27 years I've learned dealing with assholes is a part of life. There's a family that's moved onto a sailboat just off my dock (I live on an island) and I initially said they could use it to move their shit back and forth as they made it into a place they were able to live in.  They've since torn the ass out of my favour, use it all the time, and disrupt the guests I have living in the vacation cottage I rent out when they're down on my dock relaxing/kayaking/gawking at the turtles. I posted private property signs, put a chain across the path leading to my dock, but they kept using it. Instead of going out to their boat and smashing it, I called the respective authorities, reported them for illegal mooring and trespassing without filing charges. The police spoke to them and they haven't used it since.   Then you get the list of registered license plates from the property manager, call the authorities, show them the unregistered license plate parked illegally, and have it towed. Not sure if property managers do that everywhere, but they do where I'm from.  Or you come up with a creative, infruriatingly annoying (but legal) solution yourself. Box them in. Cover the car in bird food. Have a stakeout and wait for the repeat offender to show up and don't let him park there. Cover their car in sticky notes. The reason they are parking there in the first place is because it's clearly more convenient. Make it inconvenient.   My problem is that the punishment doesn't match the crime. This is an inconvenience. Smashing someone's window as a response is outright destructive, not to mention foolish because in the end it will most likely cause you way more grief than it's worth. I'd rather not risk the ball-ache that would come with being charged with destruction of property. I was a court reporter for three years and I can assure you that risking a legal battle over something like this is just not. worth. your. time.    Not what I said at all. Just think you should deal with assholes reasonably and within the bounds of the law. Glad you fuck law for a living. So euphoric.    Think I'll just have to use last year's stats and find a total average. I'm not even good at math, just really want to know the answer.   I dunno, because that's what grown ups do?   Cheers. I'm bored and curious, so trying to figure out how much energy the racers in the Tour produce over the course of the event and how that compares to the energy consumption of a town or city. Ie: riders produce an average combined total of X watts over the course of the TdF, enough to power x for x amount of time.      Yeah we don't have that where I'm from. Mostly just clamping, which is retarded since the whole idea is to move a car from where it's not supposed to be, not keep it there.  E: the fuck are people downvoting me for?   Depends on where you live. Could call and have it clamped, but that won't solve the issue. Could file a report with the police and have the towed....   Exactly what I thought of. My country is mostly black. I got serious dirty looks during American History class in middle school.   Yeah I'm not getting how this is funny. There's perfectly legal recourse for getting people to stop parking where they shouldn't be. Seems to me the residents are the bigger cunts in this scenario, unless it's just some random window smashing bandit.   I have two dents in one shin, another dent in the other. First two came from running full sprint in the dark into a shin-height wall.   The other one I got while sailing. I was in a two man boat with a weighted keel and we hit a rock, sending my crew overboard. As I tried to wheel the boat around to get him, I hit another rock and my leg slipped out from under me and wailed the traveller bar.  Excruciating.   Funny that this is a popular idea with a website like Reddit but not with online news. Sorry /r/KotakuInAction, while it would be nice to have ethics, the advertisers funding the content you enjoy have far more of a say than you.   huh... had no idea Pesci was gay. TIL   /r/CasualJiggles    Don't jump to conclusions just yet.   -- Abraham Lincoln    thank you for my new background     I didn't say "not to be pedantic." I apologised in advance for being pedantic.    This guy's a way better actor. Let's be real.   different events.   Sorry to be pedantic, but you can't read the IPCC. He'd need to read the IPCC's AR5 (Fifth Annual Report).   Exactly what I was thinking. You can bet your ass if I had an island like that I'd be chucking spears at anyone that came near.   Thanks! Have to admit, I really thought this was a clever question. The rule that no thought is original holds true once again.   Fucking hell. Ever since Inception every fucking trailer has that WHOMMMMMMP noise. I can't stand it.   Reminds me of when everyone thought Serena Williams could beat a male tennis player ranked 110th. She was demolished.    Ah. Thanks.   I dunno, I think people underestimate the power difference. I'd be willing to bet she'd have a tough time taking him down alone.   I drive a motorcycle and I get caught in the rain from time to time, so I've always wondered this.  Driving fast means I arrive at my destination faster, reducing my overall exposure, but surely the faster I move forward the more rain I come in contact with. But driving slowly has the exact same problem. I reduce my overall contact with the raindrops, but increase my exposure time.  For the purpose of the question, I've made things simpler, and perhaps more applicable to the everyday person.   Not seen What If, but Horns and Notebook were exactly what I was thinking. There are a lot of actors that would've killed those roles. Radcliffe merely fills them. He's a well trained actor, don't get me wrong, but he's only where he is today because he looked the part for Harry Potter when he was a boy. A Young Doctor's Notebook is extremely well written, and I think deserved more than Radcliffe alongside Hamm.  I'd just like to add downvoting someone because they don't like an actor you do is why this site is going down the drain soon. I think I'm contributing to the discussion by adding an alternative viewpoint, one that's been informed by experience in film and screenwriting.    Humblebrag much?   Minus the acting ability. Lovely chap. Really. But his latest work has showed him to be pretty one dimensional, despite his efforts to find unique roles. Lucky for him, people will take one dimension Daniel Radcliffe.  EDIT: the downvote button is not for disagreement.   Yes.   Last I checked Luda was a supporting actor in a multiple oscar-winning film...   OP clarified saying the dog could only pee in small, bloody drips.   Fuckass deleted it. Alas we can only remember   Exactly what I was thinking. Reads more like the top post on /r/soccer yesterday.   You need to get better at maths, champ.   Maybe when you get a little older you'll realize the world isn't as cut and dry as you'd like to think it is.   You just said "it's hard not to imagine" and followed that up by declaring yourself "completely right."  Must be weird believing your imagination to be completely right, huh?   Pao: "Hey guys, could you get these shit slinging monkeys off my back? Just tell them what's what."  Alexis, eating popcorn: "No, they wouldn't believe us anyways. You're tough, Ellen. Keep it up."   At least it wasn't comic sans.  Serious tip though. Pao was pre-packaged for redditors to dislike considering her history. The fact she has an easily punnable name didn't help either. Also, she isn't a founder of the site. The decisions made while she was in charge gave the distinct appearance that this was a CEO who didn't know what they were doing and was enforcing their own agenda on the company.  At the end of the day I'm blown away nobody stepped up to the plate to let Reddit know what was really going on, that Pao was not to blame. This could have been avoided entirely if someone had the stones to say: "This is what we all think should happen going forward, and that's been the case since before Ms Pao was hired."

    It's set up so it takes 1,000 years to mine. There was a pre-mine that was supposed to be set aside in a vault in Antarctica. More was to be used to purchase an office building. They had a bus tour scheduled in NY to scout out locations for their office tower. And users would be able to purchase oceanfront real estate near other like-minded Marinecoin faithful. Not sure whether this oceanfront RE was supposed to be in NY or Antarctica. The thing is, it wasn't a joke. When you talked to the people, they were dead serious...like a cult or something. It may still exist, I haven't heard lately.    It must be nice to be "on" on a day when you have a doubleheader. He's having a great year.    Marinecoin.      Exactly. The sacrificial liberal challenger. It used to be a mainstay of Democratic primaries to have someone left-of-mainstream who could get young people, unions, and traditional constituencies fired up and ready to pound the pavement for the mainstream candidate when they eventually make peace. Nice to see Sanders catching some attention.     Doubt it.    Once in awhile, Max Keiser gets it right! Kudos to him for researching this enough to understand its enormous potential.       From the thumbnail pic, I honestly thought that was a bolt of lightning. Gorgeous.   Exactly.    You guys deserve much, much better.   Right on. I never knew how good my hometown announcers were until I started listening to MLB.com's TV and radio feeds. The White Sox team is one of the worst I've heard, just ghastly. How fans put up with those clowns is beyond me.    Second breakfast, please.    Drafting a popular running mate from Florida or Ohio? A Republican candidate could put Scott Walker on the ticket, since he comes with the Koch Brothers wagonload of cash. Bush's opponents (both his GOP rivals and Hillary Clinton) should mention his quote that Americans need to work longer hours. If they handle it well, there should be no way Bush wins the presidency after saying something like that.    Nothing wrong with being dickish. I thought maybe you were one of those posters who hadn't seen a mountain before, so I was attempting to do my part for education. Glad you know your business.     At a certain altitude, plants and trees do not grow any higher. When you're in high mountain ranges, this is referred to as the treeline, the point at which the rocky or snowy parts of the mountain emerge above the greenery below.   Great picture. I like how the composition looks tight, even though you got a lot of scenery in there.   Glad it's worked there. I'd be worried if some of the more profit-minded companies got into providing essential services. But if they can be content with a predictable, fixed return, then it can work. There certainly are some very greedy and poorly run utilities in various parts of this country.     The teenagers who put on baseball hats and go trick-or-treating with black plastic garbage bags in their hands are, in my opinion, to old to go trick-or-treating.    He's brilliant at understanding some things, but not at others. It's a common fallacy to think that someone's aptitude in one area of life extends to others. Bitcoin is more than economics and it's clearly beyond is expertise.   If you truly have the compassion, then you put up with some government waste. Work to make it better, but don't lose the compassion. When you register Republican, just realize that your new team cares little about helping others unless they are mega-corps.    Private control of the water supply could lead to decisions driven by profit. Ya think?    I'm a huge fan of baseball and all the inane trivia. But this fact provides utterly useless information. Upvoted, nonetheless.   The offseason wasn't that rough. It was mighty entertaining. It's the on-season that's been tougher to watch.    PeerTracks is onto this and more.   Which place do you identify with the most? If it's the state where you go to school, try running a Google search for voter registration in that state. Make sure you register to vote well in advance of the election you wish to vote in (say, at least two months beforehand to be safe). Some states allow provisional voting for last-minute registrations, but don't count on it. If it's your original home state you want to vote in, then even if you aren't physically there for the election, you should be able to vote early or vote by mail. Again, check their requirements.    Is there an /r/ skyporn or cloudporn?   The country club Republicans say you're not making them rich enough.   Bter has been really good about honoring the BitShares snapshots. I'm not sure if the team has talked to them yet about the 2.0 conversion, but it's likely you should be fine. Always best to keep your funds in a wallet.   EDIT: Bter is having issues with a few coins right now. Not sure if withdrawals are working.    As far as I know, the cores/samples from this tree date it at 4841 years old. Quite old, but not nearly 10,000. http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/the-worlds-10-oldest-living-trees/methuselah    It sounds great and I'm all for equality, but the market (not the government) sets the pay for pro athletes. With few exceptions, womens' sports do not command the kind of TV ratings or sponsorship dollars that allow some male athletes to be grossly overpaid. And even when they seem overpaid, that money comes from somewhere: the public will pay a certain price for entertainment.    True, but Japan had near-zero growth for a couple of decades. It didn't drop off the face of the earth.   Yes, and it's nice that he spoke out about it.   CCEDK, Banx Capital, Peak Venture Group, and now the Nuclear Bunker Data Center, all joining the BitShares network. It's been a busy month!   Pack light, bud.   It is good. And I have a funny feeling your posting won't get censored by the mods! :)   If Jeb's opponents flog that quote to death, it could be worse than Romney's 47% or Papa Bush's 'read my lips'. Bernie has the right idea.   Sacrifices must be made for the sake of the rich, who line their pockets when everybody works more.       Awesome news. I hope they can confirm transactions fast enough so people aren't sitting around waiting. Really, P2Ps should work together like this.     Done.      In some countries, that's exactly how this is pronounced.      	45
                                                                               It seems that Syriza just does have the courage to give Europe the finger and leave the EU for good.  It would rather capitulate to bankers than charts its own path and gain its own control over its economic future by leaving the EU for good.  Yes, the consequences would have been grave in the short and medium term but in the long run, it would have been better than being a slave to the EU for good                                                                                                      Survivor.                        Spying on your friends should be referred as "economic intelligence'. And everybody does it.    The easy solution is to pass a law stating that Congress people cannot lobby until seven years after leaving Congress.                           Have  not people learned the concept of leave no trace?      Submitting links on Reddit.   San Diego. Because it has perfect weather and is America's city.   Personal finance.   People who abuse dogs.   Right-wing bozos who ignorant of science.   Smiling.   It really depends on how the Eurozone deals with Greece after the election. They could do a massive debt writeoff and keep Greece in the EU in exchange for a package of economic liberalization, investment, and massive tax overhaul.  Or they could let it go and play Russian Roulette with the economy. Either way, the Greek debt is going to have written down to pennies on the dollar to prevent economic chaos in Europe.          I would go into a sober living home and use the money to train at a local community college for a skill or trade. I would choose to HVAC because HVAC is always in demand especially with climate change. I would use $2000 to buy a truck and use the truck to work for local contractors while I go to school at night and learn a trade.   It would not evolve.  We would be caught in permanent state of hunter/gathers because there was no stability to set up civilized government.   Because it became a battleground as a proxy war between Soviet Union and United States.  It is a way for the US to engage the Soviet Union without sending troops directly into harms way.  The US could not tolerate having a Soviet proxy state in central asia and so we were willing to support the Islamist rebels without thinking about future consequences. Which was the problem with most Cold war policy anyways.   Not well. I am not hunting, fishing, and trades types of guys.            Because it means freedom of self-determination.                         Walmart has been calling me a bunch of times recently as well.                                          Just in case, my friends are not doing anything. I would be interested to see which city has the best firework display.   It is the same thugs that had a secret place for "enhanced interrogations" of suspects.  aka: Rahm's Goon Squad  http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site             What a bunch of crap.  Why does these religious hucksters accept that the fact that the USA is a secular nation and not a Christian nation? They should accept that they are living under the same conditions that Jesus was living under when he was in the Roman Empire.  There was rampant homosexuality in Rome and probably more than there was today.  Did Jesus target the rampant homosexuality that existed in Roman culture? No, he was more concerned about people following the way of the cross and redeeming themselves in Christ.      If you want to leave cheap, you can live in a sober living arrangement. However, you have to a person that alcohol and drug-free to do that. You do not need to be an alcoholic to live in those places, you just need to drug and alcohol free. Those places usually have the cheapest room rentals in the county.  The downside of those places are (i) Abusive managers (my one loves to yell at people) (ii) Curfews (which really do not matter at Action Alliance or Ready to Recover houses as long you tell the manager that you are out for the night) (iii) Places that require meeting cards. (iv) Annoying roommates  Try to find a place does not require a meeting card because if you are drug and alcohol free, you are abiding by the house rules and you really do not need meetings unless you are in recovery.  And make sure that you find a house manager (aka: landlord) that tries not to snoop in your personal life. I still hang out with my Burning Man friends all of the time and no one tells me what to do.  But I have over two years clean and really active in recovery and my UU church in Costa Mesa.                                                             The question is how to eliminate the big insurance companies and just to get down to the simple act of doctor and patient relationships.   The damage done to that country is jaw-dropping.                                       The Broncos.  I do not like the Raiders either, but I have universally rooted against the Broncos my entire life.                                                                            Tell that ton of recovered drug addicts that go to AA meetings and then get lured into doing cheap telemarketing jobs.                  I think he is a picking the wrong candidate.

 So a friend of mine built his house just on the edge of town and for over a year now local ISP (Eastlink and Bell) refuse to hook him up with high speed internet. The issue arises from the fact that currently the house across the street (less than 100 ft away) has access to high speed. However, the ISP says they would have to run additional cables to allow my friend to be connected. The kicker...they want him to pay for their infrastructure. I've got a home being build next door to my friend, even closer to the house with high speed access and doubt I'll be able to have access to it. We've both been told, "You will be able to have access to our Rural connection, good luck." Now, considering their current high speed connnectiong is 50 down/ 5 up and their rural is 1.5 down / 0.5 up.... there is literally no way in hell I can handel that bad of a bandwidth. And to top it all off the ISP is going to put a 15 GB data cap on their Rural connectiom starting in the fall.  Tl;dr - Fuck ISP's in rural Nova Scotia, they don't give a shit about their customers or the service they provide, and only care about their bottom line. It ain't  only comcast that screws people!   Watching u/sips_ play this on stream sends my dick into the dark depths of the universe.      Maritimes also has bagged milk. Nova Scotian, can confirm.   Wellington beefed her.

 Probably. This is 2 levels above 'Hot'. It's pretty crazy. My lips burned for a while, started sweating and it gave me random hiccups. Pretty sure it's Cayenne and Ghost Pepper.   Last week at Hattie B's here in Nashville their hottest called 'Shut The Cluck Up' http://imgur.com/yzcjRVW      At least go medium...         They get almost everything from Reddit, snark it up and cash in on ads. But lately they're gleefully talking up Reddit's demise. Reddit has its problems, but I don't think it's really going the way of Digg IMO.   Has Leto ever played anything but a doomed character in any movie? I dig that about him. https://youtu.be/aj1D9RYK2QU   So that's it huh? It's just gonna be Judgement Day now?   I think they will maintain or gain value if you hold on to them. Especially if they don't produce a lot of them. Hellcats are the new MOPAR Halo cars like the old Hemi Cuda, Roadrunner, Super Bee, GTX, Super Bird, Daytona etc. Look at what those cars are pulling in at the auctions now.   That's the biggest one of the year.   Is this one of Tom Haverford's ideas or Charlie from Always Sunny? Tom Haverford's Ridiculous Business Ideas Supercut: https://youtu.be/6r17Ez9V3AQ      I usually go with something salty and something sweet on a road trip and stick to something that won't melt and get weird if you leave it in the car (chocolate).   My go to candy is Sour Patch Kids or Starburst because I love sour/tart stuff. Then for salty, Jack Links sweet and hot beef jerky, or those bacon cheddar TGI Friday's chips. Pretzels or nuts are a good choice too. I'll usually just drink water but a cherry coke slurpee is nice on a hot day.  Like some of you said , if it is breakfast time, I'll get a sausage mcmuffin or mcgriddle (no egg), coffee and hashbrowns. Takes me back to childhood.

 Hell if you're into swords check out Iaido. Not really solid self defence unless your local dojo also teaches aikido but its a lot of fun. Plus, well, swords.   I'd certainly check out Aikido. It does have a very strong 'pacifist' structure. BUT you should look into particular schools philosophies. Some schools focus more on spiritual development and some are very martial. I practice Iaido at an aikido school and from what I understand our aikido is a balance of the two with a bias towards the martial side. Different schools will yield a slightly different art. In the end you need to talk with several instructors at several schools and decide what it is you resonate with.      Double Dare 2000   Cometely agree. Its actually how I found numenera. I remember playing torment over and over again in the early '00s and even as recently as '12. Out of curiosity I decided to look it IP and see if there were any sequels planned. Bam -numenera   Anyone else expecting Kevin Costner to come and steal someone's dirt?   Thanks for this post.   Grew up in rural New Hampshire . There isn't much going on around town so there is lot of dumb shit you can do to get yourself in trouble.    I can't really agree with you on the orientalism/racism thing. Samurai are essentially on par with cowboys here in the US. Its just a romanticised class much like knights in Europe 500 years ago.  All three had incredible virtues associated with their class but in reality they were human and thus prone to error at best and committed horrible atrocities at worst. Hell between 1845 and 1855 somewhere around 80,000 native Americans disappeared from the pacific region, especially California but we all still grew up loving John Wayne much like others grew up loving Kurosawa films.   You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.   Whoa thea bub! Watch what you be sayin about my Moxie! But for real I think I am the only person in Portland who actually enjoys the stuff.    There often times are. It was optional in my highschool but we had a class called "Street Law" that was essentially about legal proceedings, how the law works, ways to keep yourself out of trouble, etc.   Can confirm - Am Mainer. Most of our news is centered on local moose jousting tournaments and maple tap thefts.  Edit: and I guess there is our batshit governor too...   This is pretty close to correct. Most concussions actually occur through falling and are unrelated to helmets. Essentially your brain moves inside of your cerebrum and slams into the inner walls. Its like slamming on the breaks in your car. Any fast motion with a sudden stop yield potential for a concussion. Bad juju for the developing brain   Flossing... Go ahead, tell your dentist that you do. They know we only do it when we have a cleaning.   Science does not prove anything outside of mathematics. Source: am scientist.  To be honest I support legalization in Maine even though i do not use. I have to say, however, that your post claims "facts" and cites no sources. An "American study" isn't a source. Also presenting a barrage of statistics isn't going to propel your argument. You need to describe your statistics and tell us why they matter without the standard political/infomercial sensationalism.   You are trying to change something in a political fashion. Your best shot is to change the way its done. By presenting us with "facts" that "scientists proved" you are immediately losing anyone with experience in the sciences or expertise in logical/analytical fields. All that does is tell us that your agenda is just as groundless as you claim your opposition is. By citing actual sources that you've investigated and explaining the **context** of your statistics as well as ditching the sensational rhetoric you'll actually make a much stronger argument that won't only sound, but will be more legitimate.  Again, I don't disagree with you and I am not trying to be a dick, I just feel that if you want to see this change than you need to play a different song than the rest of the media and political sphere else you get lost in the noise.     We have a minimum time requirement (ex 300 hrs tracked class attendance plus your own practice time) for each kyu or dan before you can test for the next level. Tests are held once or twice a year at seminars and are graded by our federations technical director. If you don't pass, oh well. That just means you put some more work in and retest. Improve, learn, and  do better next time. I'd hate to pass on a curve or because the rest of the group did. Maybe instructors have good reasons for it and maybe it works for some people. I understand your frustration but measure your own successes against your own shortcomings and try not to pay attention to the color of your belt as long as it is sweaty.   I know that feel...   Thanks.   A lot of Stephen Kings stuff is righteously fucked up when you start getting to the short stories. Check out Rage if you can find it. Its written under his pseudonym.   Edit: its up on YouTube   [Kel has orange soda too](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view6/2429821/kel-loves-orange-soda-o.gif). It's a joke from an American sketch comedy kids show in the mid 90's called All That.   Nah, jenny said they just met for some kisses   Hands down the best audio book I've listened to. Enjoy!   Its alright. We don't have a Good Burger either. But we do have orange soda...   I agree with all three points entirely. He certainly does have great form. I've just always been taught to keep back straight with weight centered. It's always really cool to see all of the differences between different practices and schools. I wouldn't say one is more valid than the other; just different.  Speaking of which - That tsuka is huge! I have seen some schools lean towards longer tsukas. We have a Toshindo dojo in my city that does a lot of sword practice and they all have extremely long tsuka from what I can tell (Toshindo and their sword practice is a different discussion entirely). Almost seems like it'd be obstructive, but Mr. Threadgill makes it work; impressive.        How have I been pandered? Though I think he should be removed from office (Which is actually being discussed in Maine) for the stunts he pulls, I have to admit that he is very straight forward with his political intentions and is no B.S about his views. He said he'd veto every thing that came across his desk regarding the state budget and did exactly that. He even admitted that it was just to waste everyone's time like "they wasted his". He's a joke of a politician and an embarrassment to the state but at least he doesn't try to snow anyone about what he plans to do. I did say that in any other situation, not regarding his political intentions and motivations, he should just not speak. Next time please read the comment you reply to before contributing so wonderfully.  Edit: removed unnecessary comment; no need for me to be a dick   I expect Scott Stapp to play a seven foot Russian. Or at least have a cameo as a drunk log in a training montage.   Love the Bier Cellar. I went in for advice and left with them hand picking 50 beers for my dads 50th birthday. All based on his favorite beers and foods with some new things to try. They were awesome and completely non-pretentious.  Also how is the thirsty pigs food? I've been in portland for four years and still haven't stopped in. Every time I try to go I end up across the street at Novare.  	29
 Greg was the guy that drove them around and had sex with Jay in the hospital. I believe the guy from the beginning is named Hugh.    Hey guys, finally got to watch the film "It Follows", and it left me with a couple of questions.   First, there were three scenes in the movie which had me very confused. All three of them had to do with various characters passing "it" on.   1) after the main character and Greg have sex, they show Greg talking to a group of girls and flirting with one of them  2) the main character sees the men on the boat and strips and swims out to them  3) Paul is in the city after having sex with the main character and sees the prostitutes  So my question is whether or not these scenes had anything to do with them passing "it" on. In the first two cases, the monster still ends up coming after them, however after the third the monster isn't seen again. So is there any evidence that they did pass "it"  on in these scenes? Or am I just reading in to it too much?   Same thing here. I can drink as much as I want, or as little, and when I wake up I feel sober and fine. Usually great because I sleep like a rock when I drink.    The first time I drank was also the first time I smoked, so it was an interesting night. I was just passed out of  the couch laughing my ass of while my friend was passed out behind a potted tree with pizza in his hand. Good times, but I'm also drunk now so    I don't know how much experience you have with dph, so if you need any tips or whatever just pm me   In my experience, tolerance builds up way fast with dph. I went through a good week of daily tripping a few months back and by the end I would take 800 and get little to no affects. So while you probably could just up it, I'd say wait a week or so and then take a dosage equal to or a bit higher than your last attempt.    Definitely going to give this a try. Does the volume matter? And should I just be meditating while listening?    I love the way you describe the visuals as looking like bubbles. I can never properly describe what they look like to other people, but I feel like your description is pretty accurate. I usually just say that it looks like a transparent jelly is shaking all over the wall, but nobody ever gets what I mean.    Heh well I meant more of a website dedicated to it. Whenever I look on YouTube I just find shitty videos that people take of someone tripping too hard in a store or some shit.       Yeah I had a feeling I'd be stuck upping the dose. The time I took 1500 was definitely 4th plat and was intense, but it was amazing. Haven't ever tried smoking with it though, so I'll give that a try as well. Thanks!    Hey guys, just looking for some tips on hitting the fourth plat. I have tons of experience with dxm, just about every single trip being in the third plat. My typical dose is around 700-900mg, which is perfect when I'm looking for a good third plateau to listen to music. However, I'm wanting to go up a step with my trip to keep things fresh. So any advice on ways to potentiate the trip? Or am I just going to have to ramp up my dose? I'm fine with the latter, as I've taken as much as 1.5g at a time, but I'd rather find a different way. Thanks!   Nothing wrong with polistirex! The trip will be a bit different as far as intensity and length, but that's about it   My experiences were different every time. Varied from absolutely nothing, to tiredness, to a weird trip where I could hear my thoughts as though someone else were speaking them, and finally to an amazing euphoric experience.    I feel ya. Started off with 600 and have only gone higher. Below that just feels like I'm losing every desirable affect and gaining nothing.    If you took gel caps then it was straight dxm, they're reliable as anything else. Maybe more so because there isn't anything else in it. But your dosage doesn't sound too high at all. I'd say try it again if you're up to it. May have just had an anomalous bad time, or maybe you just don't like it.   2 capsules, 550mg each   Apparently Jerry Garcia was also addicted to heroine, according to the newish documentary on Netflix about Bob Weir. I believe he said that it pretty much made Garcia not give a shit about his health, which led to massive weight gain and his eventual death.   Edit: woops, didn't see you had him on there   TL;DR chased through carnival by murderous smurfs   When I was in like fourth grade my friend had an old bridge going across a creek in his woods, but all the planks were gone so it was just the beams. Being the spry intelligent little kids we were, we would hop from beam to beam often. Well one time I attempted this with wet feet, and slid upon landing. My feet went out from under me and I smacked my chin right off of the steel beam. Ended up getting many stitches that night.    I actually found a site that had pre-built terrariums for sale not too long ago. They had one that was $50 for the container, humidifier, and some other piece of equipment. I'll send ya a link in a minute when I find it!   Edit: well it appears that it was only on sale when I checked last, and now costs around 150. However they do have fruiting chambers for $50 that look to hold a single cake. Just browse www.mushbox.co/mushroom_kits.html for something that suits your needs!    Similar experience happened to me recently in Ocean City. By the time I got back i literally couldn't take more than  a step or two without my legs giving out because of how hard I was kicking off while trying to swim back. Terrifying experience.    I actually ended up buying ginger capsules for this exact reason. It did help with the nausea of lsa, but not the cramping.    Hey, experienced dxm user here! I can't really help with the dosage, as it's very reliant on your size. What I can say though, is that you should try using cough gels, rather than syrup. There's no disgusting taste, and it's very easy to get exactly the dosage you want. Just about every pharmacy type store sells them, and usually have their own brand. Typically comes in a small white bottle, inside of plastic, with "robogels" written on it.  Also, good luck! Dxm is a powerful disassociative, but in all of my experiences it has been fun as hell.    Thank you! That was actually my first guess  	25
    It's called Seaglass Beach. You can find it on Google maps.   It's a button from a U.S. Marine service uniform. :)   I live in Japan and can confirm this. It was the first thing I noticed when I moved here and changed to a Japanese phone.   I thought it was funny. :)   The casing is very corroded. I posted a few pics of the bottom earlier... Here you go...   http://i.imgur.com/iq1IZT7.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/tAe52fS.png   It's beautiful here! Snorkeling and diving paradise! The beaches are pristine. I love it!   They were just sitting on top, mixed in with coral and shells.   It's worn.   http://i.imgur.com/iq1IZT7.jpg    Absolutely! I didn't even know about this!   http://i.imgur.com/iq1IZT7.jpg   Here is a pic. The only letter I can make out is a C....   http://i.imgur.com/iq1IZT7.jpg     It was our first time. We loved it! Very secluded and beautiful!   No. It's no different than finding bullets from the civil war in a field or Indian arrowheads. If it was found in a national park or a preserve, then it would be different. There are protected sites on the island where the main battles took place, just like any other country would have. You can't remove items from those areas.   I had to look! The back of the button is really corroded. I can't make anything out. :(   Where did you find the rifles?? Did you use detectors? We are starting to venture to the less known areas and finding some really awesome stuff. This is our first WWII find tho.   I went to Seaglass Beach.   Haha! One is an engagement ring and the other is the wedding ring.    Okinawa was a major turning point in the war. When the US took Okinawa, it was the first giant step toward Japan's surrender. The history here is incredible. There are many memorials throughout the island.    They are a rare find now, especially on the more popular beaches. Most are now found with a metal detector. I went to a beach off the beaten path looking for seaglass and found these. It was pretty exciting.   The item on the left is a bullet casing; the right is a US Marine uniform button.  Edit: Wording.      It's just north of Nago.   This is at least 2km from a paved road.   	25

This advice originates in long years of military training for hand-to-hand combat.      1. There is no such thing as a "fair fight". That being said, avoid fighting all-together, but if that option is off the table, go for the opponents' soft spots and joints. This includes the eyes, throat, stomach, groin, knees, elbows, shoulders and feet. It only takes two pounds of pressure to snap a knee or elbow.      2. Keep moving your feet, don't lock your knees, and watch your opponent's midsection because it will indicate where the next attack is coming. Stay on your feet but keep in mind that the goal is to neutralize your opponent and make them no longer a threat. The eyes and throat are prime targets because both areas are important to the average person. If your opponent is worried about losing an eye or the ability to breathe, he/she is more likely to disengage.

I highly doubt the govt has sold or surrendered its stake in the stadium so most likely the payments go to it or a subcontract that is all-but govt    so this $6 mil number is obviously not just the fee but the start-up cost, so to speak--is what I'm getting at...which you already know...so cheers!   over at Midfield Press, there's a kind of clearinghouse for the podcasts for each team. a great way to find them all in one spot. Reckless Challenge is a good site, does a great job trying to cover as much as it can   I've convinced I remember the NASL franchise fee is fairly low like $1 million but the primary owner has to be worth $10-20 million. but I could (probably am) wrong on that   I would assume lease. Because the money would go to the PR government and it needs more than a few dollars      I'm a house spouse                           A good mid-90s joke is its own reward            so much for getting to watch Wednesday games      I still think your team is gonna make the playoffs   well, I know my picks were all wrong this weekend so that bodes well for Indy                      yeah, it became league owned this year.      sure thing. completely see that now, guess I was just getting ahead of myself a bit. thx!   always a danger   both of those guys have really carved a good niche out for themselves   that's just as neat. who do you hear speaking your characters when you write/read?

Does it help or hinder you?   Also, who would be your cast for other fantasy books like Sword of Shannara or Dragon Wing or The Name of the Wind or Blood Song?               no   the doublespeak of deadlines   The the United States' domestic cup tournament, open to all teams regardless of status            I hear ya.

Indy is a good club, a lot of energy and room to grow.     But I gotta encourage you to back Minnesota United, good stuff that.    Check out the Northern Pitch, Reckless Challenge, and Midfield Press sites to get up to speed.  Welcome!         I don't know if I'd go so far as to say Ring is Carrick-esque but I like where your heads at in looking at him. Wasn't impressed with is vision or his ball winning ability--I see better technique in Pena and better awareness though I would give the workrate to Ring hands down.     And as far as the research goes, I watched the highlights and as many fullgame replay videos as I could find (think I just missed finding one full match). So though I crammed them all into one day of viewing and reviewing and reviewing, I will defer to supporters like yourself that see the guys play every week.    Thanks for talking! Hope to keep getting better over at MidfieldPress      there's always room to discuss. I think Mares   Pena are vastly superior choices over Ring. Would Indy be better with Kleberson in the line-up rather than out? Absolutely. The point I was trying to get at, Indy have stood strong without him      you consider this a virtue?           	139
 It came out here a good few months ago and it's terrific, I'd love to see a British stop motion animated film do well in America.    I know I was just playing along with nomefish.   But The Muppets Show is in the same universe as the latest two films.   And only a week after they said we wouldn't see it. For anyone who doesn't know the actual show is about the Muppets working on a talk show hosted my Miss Piggy.      Probably my favourite Hollywood Handbook episode and one of my firsts. The Bababooey bit is so funny to me.   I'd say the fish in Finding Nemo were more similar to real fish than that main dinosaur.   Definitely. I actually watched the G.I Joe episode of Community recently and I could only hear Diane and not Annie.   That was actually Daniel Radcliffe?? I thought it was Paul F. Tompkins again, since it sounded like  his Andrew Garfield.      Honestly this status could very much just mean Tig is officially leaving, the show might still continue without her.   Haha I meant non-main character.   Yeah, last night I was actually watching the G.I Joe episode of community and I heard Diane whenever Alison spoke instead of Annie.    I was hoping we'd get a full episode about the Back To The Future 9/11 conspiracy video.  Also does anyway have a link to the original Harmontown Hollow Earth episode?   In the credits it says "This film was shot on location in New York City, which is almost like another character."   You really remind me of someone but I can't put my finger on it.    I know it's been a while but music rights work completely differently for UK television, anything that isn't scripted sort of has the same rules as radio. They own the rights to play it, not to sell it. As long as you don't sell DVD's with the music you can put any music the channel owns, and all of the big channels have deals with the music studios.   I can't believe people seem blind to this fact. For some people under the age of 30 Star Wars is some old films they haven't seen or those 3 films that came out that everyone hated. I have quite a few friends who only went to see the prequels when they came out during the hype and are turned off Star Wars completely.    Yeah, I really need Simon for the christmas livestream.    I'd like an actual Christmas Special though, with actual character development.   I never realised she did Vincent! You can hear her all over though yeah, most notably the older girl of Horsin' Around.   Might as well.   me too. :/   Pm please?   There is one!   If you haven't watched Bojack Horseman, he's in the new season.    Especially because it looks like they did a HD conversion of the movie.   Did he link to my facebook page? I guess he just reversed image search?      What? But this is way too spooky for him.   I'm probably going to have this for about a year. I had my last one for a year.   Not really, basically just take a screenshot of your facebook page and put it in the layer above the picture. Then I exported the image that fit in the profile box and then I exported the image that fit in the cover box. The templates are just sort of the ones on  Facebook.   Oh shit. Well fuck mobile.   Yes!   It's not actually literally set a few neighbourhoods over from Phineas and Ferb. If you read the source for that it says "And what's really cool is that -- in my mind, anyway -- Mikey Murphy just lives a couple of neighborhoods over from Phineas and Ferb." It's not like a true spin off or anything.      My laptop doesn't play it better. Simple as that.   All of the people I used to play with have migrated to different games or the One. So if you still play this please add GT:  "CianHatesPeople."   Yeah, I can't really imagine Kermit sticking his hands up in the air and screaming awwwaaahahhaha in this new style and tone.   You can have both.   Enjoy the karma s4082211.  Also feeling a little down since this is the first UTU2TM since Harris left us.   Wow I'm surprised they didn't show Elizabeth Banks in the trailer. Maybe they're doing the same joke in the actual premier.      Or 18. Source: Born in 97 and am 18.   I'm hoping for it to come out this week. Only two more days then!!   I'm pretty sure you're thinking about this way more than Paul but the other british characters from him are.. the pie minister, I think.   /r/showerorange could be one.   I think the problem with this is that to offer a sale on an item it has to have been that price in the past month.   Good one.  EDIT: I thought Spontenation had begun at the end there since I had it queued up. I was confused as to why Paul was reading an ad for his show on his show.   Billy and Mandy and Codename Kids Next Door were on the same level of this.   When I seen the thumbnail I assumed puppeteers would be under the table but they're fully visible! I love this so much. If you're willing to have writers on comic con panels the puppeteers should be there too.   This is a very rare occurrence and I'm surprised it happened. It's probably the only thing I disagree with Jim Henson on, he was on the side of always keeping the puppeteers a secret.  EDIT: Also wow that whole Promo we seen is completely thrown out the window. I will say the plot to this show sounds more Muppets Tonight that The Muppets Show.   This is a TV movie. They've done a bunch of these.   It feels like a biopic about the inventor of time travel at times.   You should get her to do this if she hasn't seen Star Wars.  	53
 Additionally, is there an easy template for Soviet style Socialist emblems? I know those aren't true heraldry, but where else am I going to ask that? Thanks in advance!

It's been removed.   Yeah, I'm removing it.   I assure you, as a mod, that we can say fuck here.      They've got Cave Johnson running a razor company now.   Well, it's getting downvoted. You probably won't see it on the front page.   Oh! Oh! Is it because you only bring near beer? I bet that's it.   And also, John Hurt.   I suppose I meant *technically* plausible, not *philosophically* plausible. Who knows if mankind will ever build a transporter? Not I. However, everyone sleeps... Well... [Nearly everybody.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_familial_insomnia)   I find it to be a more plausible version of the Transporter Problem, if you're at all familiar with that.   Isn't this what the ancient Egyptians believed about sleep? Or was that the Australian Aboriginals?   Oversector 3 reading positive noncontact, uh... Recommend three subsumations. Cauterize and clamp. Huhuhuh.   Agreed. Not NSFW, but the flashing lights could be cause for caution around epileptics. Thus, the added flair.

Happy plinking for GLORIOUS RODINU.   Where are you at on guns? As guns are the guarantor of proletarian liberty, any restrictions on firearms will lose you my vote.   Made for export.    Or they just went around harvesting flowers for people or something. Maybe they were laborers?   So much so, that's it's got a flimsy LED shovel and is preparing to make glow in the dark dirt once the barrel gives way.      That is disappointing. I like to give people the benefit of a doubt, but you can't fight for the oppressed if you're nursing your own bigotry and prejudices.   Do we know who runs their Facebook page? Perhaps his opinion isn't shared by the rest of his organization.  Incidentally, while Huey P Newton was pro LGB, his statement didn't mention trans folk. Do we have any sort of citation on his opinion on trans issues?   I would be surprised if Scientology didn't somehow have capital to leverage against anybody who owns billboards in Clearwater. Seems like they're the sorts who would defend their home turf.   The handy dandy notebook is the GULAG system  The clues are kulaks, accused capitalists, and Finns  and the solved mystery at the end is the electrification of the Soviet Union and the destruction of Nazi Germany. Karma plz.   Billboard advertising is dreadful, no matter the subject matter. This is mildly preferable.   They sling the best sugar on carpenter ant turf.   Gun owners are already subject to rather harsh background checks. The supposed solution to this, requiring checks for private sales, risks straying into some rather overbearing territory. The best response, I feel, is to make private sellers culpable for crimes committed by those who they make straw purchases for.   But really, the Confederate flag and guns aren't problems, here. The issue is and always will be this nation's horrible approach to mental health care.   I think it's something that would like to echo the style, as a complement to it but not necessarily an example of it, you know? It's the sort of thing one might call Neo Deco or something.      Well, until the findings of NASA's sciences lead us reeling into the seclusion of a new dark age.       That would be nice. Why it isn't already a de jure independent state is beyond me. Seems like everyone would be better off if it were.   I always make sure I'm kind to call center workers. From experience, I can say that they've got it the worst.   Unless they're telemarketers. Because fuck telemarketers.   Maybe I should. I imagine the quantity would have to be large enough that the plasma grenades would generate their own gravitational field. The XKCD guy would have a field day drawing that. The math should prove pretty interesting, too.   A lot of conservatives see the country as slipping away from them. By pandering to the very fringe, Trump is keeping this group quite happy and has their rapt attention. I can't imagine that anybody close to center would still be having much to do with the GOP. Thus, they would not be participating in Republican polls.   And somehow he's regarded as a financial genius. Absolute proof that life's not fair.   Trump's businesses cripple themselves. No cartel help needed.   It goes necrotic due to horrible dick parasites and just sort of falls off one day.  EDIT: Horrible Dick Parasites would be a great name for a band.   I'd imagine so. But supposing that practicality and logistics weren't obstacles...   Asking for a friend of a friend.  Bonus round: how many fragmentation grenades for the same task?  Lightning round: how many Scorpion tank shells?   It'd be one hell of a coincidence if it wasn't.   Of course, everyone knows that. But that doesn't help much when trying to develop an overall feel for the story and the events within it.    I always thought that to be Prothean in nature, but that was at the time and I guess now that I think about it, it doesn't fit their MO. Neither does it fit the MO of Reapers however, who only go after spacefaring civilizations.   I'm accepting this as headcanon until something comes along to disprove it.   It's a great hobby and I believe that everybody has the right to defend themselves. Whenever I see a chance to spread what little knowledge of guns I have, I take it.    I mean, hypothetically speaking, if somebody had the capital to make these things, what would the legal side of it be? I assume the IPs are all Russian state property, and I have no idea how the US government or the ATF would deal with that when approving the firearms for sale on the general market. That said, how does one even claim to have gotten the designs. You can't tell them you threw the thing together from illicitly imported parts. Maybe claim you downloaded the specs online? Or maybe you're working on original plans reverse engineered from photos and previous AK designs?   They were $80 earlier in the decade. I mean, now they're up around $250, which is substantially more than I thought they were, but that's still cheaper than US prices. [Here's one for $220](http://www.grouseriver.com/Soviet-SKS-Semi-Auto-7-62x39-Rifle) and [another for $200 on a seller I've heard mentioned highly.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85526)  More products to make an American like me jealous?  [How about a Chinese M14? Half its US price.](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/product.jsp?productid=85814)  [Chinese Army handguns? Got 'em!](http://www.marstar.ca/dynamic/category.jsp?catid=85812)  [Genuine USSR Tokarevs for $200!

Point is, if you want guns in Canada, there are options. Oh, and if you're after AKs, I hear unrestricted CZ-58s are due back in production.   I had a Marui FAMAS and some AEGs by Echo(?) for a while. Also, gun ownership in Canada isn't *too* bad. I mean, y'all get dirt cheap SVTs and SKSs, so it's not all awful. I mean, the RCMP keeps some really awful gun laws in effect from what I hear, but there are a number of things up there to be envious of. You can still get stuff from Norinco, for example. We can't. I am keenly envious of that one. Still, if you ever find yourself in the states and want to shoot an AK, tons of folks over on /r/ak47 and /r/firearms have them and I'm sure would let you shoot. I myself own one, but I'm quite a ways away from the Canadian border.   Cugir doesn't run the tightest arsenal in the world. I mean, they're not African hellhole bad, but they're not world class either. I still love my WASR, though.   Not really. I bought my WASR in 2010 and it had much the same stock set on it.      Chinese AKs are actually pretty highly regarded. I'd rate them in the same tier as Soviet AKs, personally. At least the AKs from the Polytech and Norinco factories.  Anyway, judging from [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/bcU8AkL.jpg), it looks like their full sized AKs at least use compatible furniture and the bottom handguard retainer even looks to be close to spec. If I were still into airsoft, I'd likely pick one of these up. I don't think they were around when I played. If they were, I hadn't heard of them.    From that first screen shot, it looks like actual 74U wood might fit it. If you're keen on trying the real thing, they look like [this](https://www.k-var.com/shop/KR-404BT.html). I can't seem to find them for under $50, though, so you might want to have a look at your handguards for comparison.   SEGA might actually be the best place for them. They've been pretty good about letting external devs they own make decent games without fuckery from the central offices. Maybe have them snap up some key Kojima Productions personnel and a couple of IPs and see what they can do with it.  Just don't put them to work on Sonic. That franchise is where fun goes to die.   Is that real wood on there? Did you use an actual 74 foregrip? I ask because I have some AK furniture lying around after replacing the wood on my WASR and a friend of mine hates the polymer on his AEG.   Yeah, most people sort of stopped using it. I guess it's for the best, but there are certainly worse flags that have been rehabilitated.    Gotta go... fat?   I'll have to do that. I'm on something of a funk kick at the moment (Parliament and Stevie Wonder, mostly) but once that's over, it could be time for some metal.   That's the practice. I've read up on capitalism and I've read up on Communism. The best I can figure is that the market is pure chaos and neither theory on running an economic system can lead to much good for the common man.    I had completely missed that point, somehow. Thanks for pointing it out!   You're like the eighth person to say this. We clearly need to label it. Putting labels on the smokes clearly did wonders to stop people smoking. If we do something similar to high sugar foods, it might help with our runaway obesity problem. There's literally no reason not to.   I should listen to more metal, then. I know *of* Pantera, but I don't necessarily *know* Pantera.   Ideally, yes. However, corporate croney capitalism serves to drive prices in a direction that benefits share holders and executives, not necessarily the consumer or the masses. Couple this with the excess wealth of corporate America going to buy elected officials and you have a dysfunctional brand of capitalism that rivals Soviet "Communism" for its sheer harm to the average man.   With our obesity rate what it is? Absolutely.    The Nordics have their problems, but by and large a mixed market seems to be the best way of doing things.   Plausible. After all, *everybody* knows that Charon is a [Mass Relay.](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Charon_Relay)   I think a lot of it is down to insurance driving up the cost. It's one of those cases where everyone knows they can get more and more with the system set up the way it is, so they keep charging more and more. It's all relatively fine if you've got an insurance plan that covers prescriptions, but if you need something over the counter or you're uninsured, you're up shit creek without a paddle.   Why not just show the sugar? Hardly anybody is willing to do that and it could - and should - be so plainly shown on the label. I think the public has shown that they'd like things stated as plainly as possible.   Your body actually does need sugar, to an extent. We just get waaaaaaaaaay too much of it since it's added to damn near everything.   I disagree here. For full disclosure, my girlfriend works and has worked in pharmaceutical development and while a LOT of it is down to skeezy business practices and lobbying, developing medicine is a risky and expensive process. I, for one, would much rather have it be a nationalized process and remove it from the shady morality inherent to anything that's done under profit motives, but as long as medicine is a capitalist enterprise it's going to be at least a little expensive.   FDA's been fucked for years. You know the reason why the percentage of your daily recommended sugar intake provided by a serving of food isn't shown on the Nutrition Facts? Corporate goddamn kickbacks. The FDA and their corporate masters are literally killing our country.   Looks like if Skynyrd did prog rock. I want one.   Woah, is this Hail Corporate or /r/frugal_jerk?   An employee or owner could have made the video with his kid. I'd imagine an ad agency could have done it more subtly. The logo is much too well framed to be anything but an ad.  Besides, they could be aiming to be a local landmark or something. I dunno.   Cincinnati isn't exactly a small market, and this was posted on two other subs. Anyway, my gut says nobody would give a shit about framing the logo in their shot that well unless they wanted to promote the brand. The kid was in the bottom of the shot for half the gif. Feels like an ad to me, hoss.   I'd buy one of these in a heartbeat. The fudd in me hopes a wooden option would be made available.   I'm really liking the STI Detonics gun, as well. It seems reliable, it's got a steel frame (which I think is better for a variety of reasons) and the look of the things just screams "this is an American handgun." I would love to see it make the cut, but we all know that the M9 will once again remain just out of sheer stubbornness.   A museum and people's homes. I wouldn't bring mine out in public or wear it or anything (I also think wearing the American flag on anything but a patch is tacky, mind you) but people should still be able to display it as they sit fit if they're private citizens. I mean, they should also be expected to either be avoided or have lengthy conversations about the thing, but if you only have it at a place where close friends will see it then it shouldn't be an issue.   This should be interesting to see.   That's my feeling. I, too, am a white male from the South; albeit not especially conservative. To me the flag represents the army that many of my ancestors served and a lot of positive aspects of Southern culture - the Dukes of Hazzard and Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example. That said, it was used by an army that propped up a racist regime and therefore has no place in any setting funded by tax dollars or wherein the functions of government might occur. I can completely understand how it makes black people uncomfortable. What the South needs is a new flag.   Hope you don't mind, but I crossposted this at /r/nocontext.          How in the blue hell has nobody mentioned The Alan Parsons Project's I Robot?    That sounds amazing.    In many areas, there are group homes and care centers; often times with a level of state support depending on your country and jurisdiction. In a lot of cases, however, the kid and the parent are shit out of luck.   As a disabled person, no. Even without mental retardation - which is, alone, an enormous burden on parents - medical costs and care considerations for physically disabled children are particularly burdensome. Not everyone is up to such a task.    Looks like ticks.   EDIT: Oh, wait. Those are flies. Maybe some of the smaller ones are ticks? In any case, i was wrong.   sitting_bike.ani not found, loading default pose on model: bikecop.ord   To be fair, with proper containment and disposal regimes in place, uranium has a lot of potential for clean energy production.

[Polish dictators?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Jaruzelski)   There's something mildly profane about advertising in public places. It always makes me feel like I've got no choice but to be pitched to if I see that tripe while I'm going down the sidewalk or the freeway. When they invent a way to block this shit with augmented reality glasses or something, I'll be so happy.   Not too hard, not too soft.   If KotOR and KotOR II don't somehow get reintegrated, I'm going to be a bitter old man some day.   Yeah, this might just be clickbait. That said, it's a pretty good reimagining of the Facility theme.   It won't. Having worked retail, I can tell you that the reason you get bugged so much in stores is down to the fact that it's a loss prevention tactic. The theory goes that by directing your employees to talk to customers, many of the ones that would shoplift would be too spooked and will be much less likely to steal inventory.   Well sure, but the 5.45 has a little hollow chamber in it that causes some gnarly wound cavitation. It also tends to go to pieces.   Is it true that Russia somehow isn't a party to the convention on post impact wounding munitions? I've heard this regarding the wound ballistics of the 5.45mm and several bits of Spetsnaz kit.    The Clone Wars ruined a lot of things. I'm pretty bummed that it's still canon, to be honest.  It'll always be Korriban to me, dammit.    I would assume some sort of recycler. We have the technology now. I assume by Mass Effect times, it would be small enough to pack into N7/galactic spaceman combat armor and most militaries worth a damn would have developed training protocols for getting people past the ick factor.   If it's getting upvoted, the subscribers of /r/russia obviously want to see it. If I was in the mods' position, I wouldn't remove it.   HOLY SHIT YES! Thank you so much! You're my hero right now, for real.   Russian army  I'm actually somewhat well versed in the Donbass conflict as I've done some research and discussion with people over there. Everybody I've talked to on the DPR and LPR side seems to be a local who really, genuinely dislikes the Ukraine and is quite displeased with the Maidan, so to call it a Russian invasion is incredibly disingenuous.   But that's another discussion entirely.  As for the crimes of the Soviets, none of this is news to me. But that's how all hegemonies act. If the Soviets were an empire, they'd have been far worse. What do you think happens in any country where the US sets up a dictator? Look at how we ran South Vietnam and Argentina. Still, nobody calls the United States an empire, at least nobody of any sort of geopolitical credibility. The only states I can think of in the 21st or 20th centuries who might truly be called Empires in the truest sense of the word are Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and the nascent ISIS state.   I do hope you don't mind me asking, but just for context, what country do you live in? I know that some countries: Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania - got it worse than others under the Soviets.    They built hospitals, infrastructure, schools, and housing. They increased standards of education and industry in most of the places they went while also fighting backwards social trends and inequality. A lot of places in the former Soviet sphere are still using Soviet infrastructure because the capitalist governments that came in afterwards are too corrupt to spend any money on fixing and replacing it.  The Soviets weren't universally evil in every single regard. There were many, many problems with the Soviet system, but to forget the good that they did is to forget a huge part of the past, and we do the past a tremendous disservice in trying to turn it into a good vs evil melodrama.   Rather, what we should do is take the good that they did and the good that America does, learn from the mistakes of both systems, and try to use these lessons in forging ahead to a better tomorrow.   Speaking not just as an aspiring musician, but as a man in a wheelchair, this looks fantastic. One of my biggest problems with formal wear is that it gets all bunched up as I roll around. I could foresee this being a far lesser issue with this sort of shirt. Anyone know when something like this might be available publicly?  EDIT; Oh wait, found the link. Damn that's pricey.   I would compare it more to Saudi Arabia or Israel. Not every country the United States props up is a good guy, just as not ever Soviet sponsered country was horrible. That said, what they did in Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and North Korea was truly despicable and has done a lot of damage to the lives and livelihood of the people living there, not to mention people's perception of Communism.   If the Kims get what happened to Mussolini, that'd be just swell.   I wouldn't call the Soviet Union an empire. Hegemon is more fitting. It's a somewhat similar system to the United States, where we prop up brutal dictators to suit our needs, too. Basically, all superpowers are bad.   Not to mention that they're starving. It's hard to rebel when you can't even get out of bed due to your body consuming itself to survive. It's a real shame. I've got something of an armchair interest in the state and I'd say North Koreans are quite possibly some of the nicest people around. They deserve better. They deserve much better.   Maybe the first was included with The Little Cars 6: Tokyo Drift?   Glorious rifle serving fascism instead of fighting it? How curious!   I'm pretty sure it would fall under soul. It was in commercials a few months or maybe years ago. It's been stuck in my head for ages, and although asking Reddit to identify a song based on a half remembered snippet with no lyrics relayed entirely in whistles, it's probably the best shot I've got.      But there's *so much space.* We'd need a sphere capable of seeing it all. In space.   According to UNIT special archives released to WikiLeaks, the entity known as "The Doctor" has been seen several times in connection to Cyberdyne research projects and Skynet in particular. If the conjecture that Skynet is supposed to be of great importance to the course of human history holds true and the conspiracy theories regarding time traveling battle robots holds any water, it would make sense that the Doctor would have an interest in this.   Moreover, the Dyson family in particular have been rumored to owe the survival of their son Danny to the Doctor after the shootout that claimed the life of Miles Dyson. It's not unlikely that Danny would design the avatar of his father's life's work to resemble the man who saved his own life.   Of course, all of this is just conjecture.   Shame, too. Zune was vastly superior to ipod.   Got any skills to bring to the table? We might need transcribers or people to run a subreddit to keep followers updated on our progress.    Got any foley experience?   Bases, not production plants. While bases are mostly located in the West as a legacy of Soviet Cold War strategic planning, what manufacturing for the military wasn't taking place in Kharkov or Russia was often sited in the Donbass. The Ukraine hasn't really invested much in relocating anything since funds for doing so were usually siphoned off by corrupt officials up to and including the present day.   ISIS has got scads of mint condition Abrams and T-72s/80s from Syrian and Iraqi government stores. The issue is that ISIS tanks face much greater rates of attrition than DNR and LNR tanks. The Ukraine has much less in the way of air to ground capability than the groups fighting ISIS, so the rebels in Donbass aren't having as many of their tanks destroyed.   It is. I think the Ukraine had some of their military-industrial capacity located there, too. Their tanks and weapons mostly come from Kharkov (nowhere near there and still in government hands), but I'm pretty sure weapons were made in the Donbass.   That's perfectly fine. I'm on the US East Coast and I've got team members on the West Coast of the US as well, so a bit of havoc is already quite expected. Shoot me a PM with whatever times (GMT or EST, it doesn't matter,) work best for you and your contact info and I'll start working to set up the first meeting.   Oh wow, that would actually be AMAZING. If you can do anything of that sort, I couldn't imagine doing this without your help. My PM is inbound.   I like it a lot! Consider yourself in. There are one or two things I think might be dialed back or reeled in, but you really captured the sort of arrogant, almost naive detachment that I want out of O'Hurley and the haughtily matriarchal air I wanted from the Red Queen. Would you be willing to attend a Google Hangout based collaborative session with the rest of the writing team ~once a week?   It's one thing to have a personal belief. It's quite another to be against somebody else having equal rights. Being against gay marriage is principally as bad as being against interracial marriage or something of that nature. People aren't upset at Adam Baldwin just for disagreeing with them.    You generally have to turn that on for each video. I have a monetized channel, for example, but tend to turn off monetization for videos that are in other people's IPs.   That might work even better. I'll chat with the other writers and see what our preference for method and time is. Once that's hashed out, we'll all get together and discuss this thing.   Duly noted! Thanks!   A little is better than none. I'll make a note of your name for when we've got a list together for a casting call.   That sounds awesome. We really need an audio guy for this. Shoot me a PM and we'll hammer out some details.   Voiceover work will be a while in coming, but if you're interested I'll be happy to keep your name in mind when we've got a script hammered out.   Certainly. I'll PM you and a few of the other writers in here shortly. Would you be willing to go over the specific world details in a google hangout with the other writers I'm collecting? Ideally, there will be three or four of us.    Certainly. I'll PM you and a few of the other writers in here shortly.

Well, the intention has always been for the project to be noncommercial. As this is someone else's IP, I'd rather not try to capitalize on it and get 2K's lawyers upset. Rather, this is a strictly volunteer based fan project that will serve only to show our love for BioShock and maybe showcase our skills.    Sending now    That's awful.

Thanks! I have a feeling I'll need it.   [Cue announcement music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogDy2Yk1W9A)  I'm an aspiring voice actor and have often honed my somewhat meager talents by producing audio projects. As a huge BioShock fan, a tale set in the BioShock universe seemed a natural for me and I began to embark on it with my utmost attention.   At a certain point, I decided that this could be so much more than a half-assed amusement. Drawing upon /u/Zombietimm's post in a writing prompt [I submitted on this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/34y1do/writing_prompt_the_year_is_2015_the_place_is/?utm_source=feedburner utm_medium=email utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reddit%2FeCVh+%28Bioshock%29), I've devised a short list of characters and a rough timeline for what Rapture might be like in the year 2015. I have a story forming in my head, but I feel that this will need more than my talents to become a reality. And so I turn to you, /r/BioShock.  Basically, I need a writer to help me with characterization. It's always been a weakness of mine, as dialogue and character volition tend to lack in my writing. I'm more about world building and technical details. I also need someone to help me find foley and record from multiple people's computers. Finally, in the longshot event that this actually produces a script, I will eventually need voice actors. The characters I have so far, just to whet your appetites for events to come, are as follows:   Captain Benjamin O'Hurley: an ageing career officer of the United States Navy. He's slightly too old to have been chasing Soviet subs for most of his career and never captained a mission during the Cold War. He is thus inexperienced with large scale threats, despite his many years of service. Prefers observation and   Lieutenant Commander Miles Jenkins: The Texas' Executive Officer. A recent appointment to Captain O'Hurley's crew, this recent graduate of the Newport Officer's School was quickly promoted through to his current rank by unknown means. He directly commands the Texas' SEAL detachment and closely guards his Pentagon orders.  Orville Dodgson: A twisted, elderly man, first encountered in the ruins of Rapture. This barely coherent old man, twisted both in mind and body by severe deformities, raves endlessly about the works of Lewis Carroll. How he has survived so long in so inhospitable a place is uncertain. What is known, however, is that he will prove indispensable in deciphering the mysteries of this place.   The Red Queen: the principal antagonist, the Red Queen seems to be the only force holding Rapture's remaining inhabitants together. She maintains the lumbering behemoths who fight a Sisyphean battle against the encroaching oceans with her mad court of semi-coherent, wizard-like scientists and supplies the twisted Splicers with the ADAM their bodies crave. Rumor has it that this so-called True Utopian had ventured to the surface and returned to save her people.   Additionally, I will need various sailors, soldiers, splicers, and survivors; with multiple voice actors playing multiple roles.  Coordination will take place over Skype or Google Hangouts, with consensus ruling on the decision.  As this is a noncommercial fan project, I won't be able to pay anyone and can understand if people can't give 100% of their time to this, but I'd really like to see it happen and I just know that if anybody can do it, BioShock fans can.   **Wow! This has gotten a lot of attention!** I am honored to have received so much interest from everyone. Thank you all so much! With any luck, we'll return in a month or two to show off our masterpiece. Bunny masks will be mandatory for the unveiling.   **Update 2** I am thankful beyond words to all of the people volunteering to make this project a reality. I'm finding that I really need people with knowledge of US Navy equipment and SOP, as well as people who are familiar with *Something in the Sea* to consult on various world and character details. If this is you, please consult with us!    illogical  You green blooded hobgoblins and your logic. Let go of logic. There is only the Force.   I always take Legends to mean it's canon until proven otherwise. It's fiction. There's no wrong way to approach it as long as you enjoy it.   That's sad. Couch co-op is best co-op.      Rank mobility in the UNSC always struck me as a bit slow.   There's a kitchen shop in the Exton mall that sells brewing kits. As for takeaway craft beer, there's always Boxcar brewpub on East Market. I rather like them.   Unless we suppose one of two things. Either easter eggs aren't canon, or the PoA crew thought it'd be a lark to roll a cryotube down to the flight bay for a photo op.

 I am still torn as well. Thanks for the input though!    As promised here is the link.  http://imgur.com/a/Ktmop  Honesty is best, please, what do these say to you?

Your input was invaluable, so I am hoping that here, in round 2, you can all assist me again. Link is in comments so as to not be considered advertising. The book title is common enough that you would have to dig if you wanted to find it at this point.    I would love to be included in this.

I don't fit in your criteria, however I am always looking for artists to help express what I can create with words.   I can't offer you much help, but perhaps there is someone out there that can.   Good luck!    Hang out in r/writingprompts for a while and try your hand a few. That might help.   On the other side though, careful what you start. As an author, I have too many ideas. It's now a serious lack of time that gets in my way...  And Reddit...that too.       Count me in, real name and all!    The Event by Jamie Heppner.   It's an apocalyptic sci fi fantasy that never gets a dull moment without something happening.   And, it was written by a Gamer (odds are like your husband) that just got tired of playing the games.    I started writing an independant story in the 7D world, but it never really hit home with anyone so I dropped it. Perhaps if there were more interest I would start again.   you missed some 0's I think.    I am at 38...so maybe what, .06c earned?   All of my stuff is on Amazon :)    *Edit* Link for the interested, might as well since Reddit is so up in arms over pretty much everything these days. Here is my stick to add to the fire.   **edit 2** Robot won't let me link so, use your mind! ! !   http://www. """Big book seller online, might start with an A""" .com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps field-keywords=jamie+heppner   Me!  But my definition of near and yours may be completely different...   Sorry, but I am confused? You are saying don't do anything with it? Meaning,  you like it and don't think it should change?   (I like Buffy, but Angel was really the only good spinoff IMHO)    Gotcha...Carefull, may be a best seller out there entitled MOON! one day.   I know this needs work, I just need to find what I am really going for, that hasn't already been done 1000 times.     You are right with it being tied in and yes, it is broken, even more than in that image. Perhaps I could tone down the people, and bring a more shattered moon as a complete background image?    That actually made me LOL, MOOON!  Maybe that's why I should have tied into it more, or even just change the title to MOON!   However, this story has been around since before Twilight, and the moon is tied in, hence the show. Is it vital on the cover? Nope.  I am more interested in what you are trying to say with Show, don't tell. When as a cover, it's all show? That's where I am running into problems, how can I use a cover to say the words I want said. With no words. Perhaps I should turn the world on it's heels and put my synopsis on the front and back, with only a faded image in the background...   27b/6 is awesome!   I came here for honesty. I would rather have it.   I am thinking of tossing the background almost completely. The moon, does have significance...   Thank you. I have my doubts and they are being realized. I have showed others, but since they know me I am getting nothing but "Awesome! Great! Perfect!"  I know better and Reddit loves to be brutally honest with people. That's why I am here.    Thanks! That's a great help!    Thank you. There is a "too digital" quality that I am not a fan of.    You would be surprised what counts as advertising here on reddit. I will post it here in the comments hoping it doesn't get me blocked.   "Can evil be defeated, or does it merely transform?   Donovan is evil.   He knows it.   He doesn't care.  When an unprecedented solar flare ruins the earth, it changes all humanity, turns back the clock to days long gone, and gives Donovan the power to do almost anything he wants.  That is, as long as he can get rid of his sister.  After all, she has the same power he does.     Hey, I said no holds barred and I meant it.   If I tell people about it, the author, or anything other than a picture. I am advertising. If I could have removed the title. I would have done that too.   Thanks for the input regardless.    As mentioned, here is the imgur link.  http://i.imgur.com/WptonAs.jpg?1      Here is the link for pictures. http://imgur.com/a/Zrpy6    I have a large part of the work already done, but I am looking for a way to place the glass inserts without large bulky tabs underneath.   I think that ideally I should have cut a small bevel around that the glass could have fit in, but my tools are limited (almost everything so far is done by hand) and I am so close to getting finished that I am doing my best not to rush. I will place a few photos in the comments to show the general outlay.   TL:DR Glass needs to go in, how can I hold it without making it look like crap?      Look at the date of the original post. Not this persons post.  This is posted on the bottom.  "Note: The San Jose Police Department confirmed the break-in occurred on October 29, 2014, and provided me with a case number. Roohparvar has also provided the following image of his busted-in office door."     Anyone else notice the original article is already a year old?    Maybe take a look at [Mirror Thief](http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672) It's on the smaller side, but still getting 5 Stars.      Nice pun.  Yes, I am thinking it was a bad start, but the feeling is there, why should I give them a second chance when the first left a "rotten egg" taste in my mouth.   That is the kind of experience I would have liked to have. Sadly, I don't see it happening. I tried customer service but just got the same answer over and over. I don't think it's worth a second try.   It would have been if they had actually shipped the product. They are just charging me (potentially) and not shipping anything.   If the product had actually left, I would understand delays out of their hands. However, they just said they might be billing me, but aren't shipping anything.   I live a little out of the way, so normal shipping is two weeks. They promised to have it in 2 days, 3-4 would have been expected, so now I am sitting for anywhere from 8-10 days at the best. Odds are, I will have another bill pop up long before I get this card and I will have to start saving all over again now.    That's the problem, now I sit on my chair and wait. Or I take a chance and only create more problems in the long run. All because NewEgg can't figure out what they are doing.   I am no stranger to online shopping. This however is a first, if my address contained a "C" but I typed it as a "c" they would cancel my order.   I checked, it was the exact same address as I have been using for 3 years. That's just their excuse for a cancellation.    Odd, my money may be disappearing, but no cool stuff will be appearing.     I just ordered my GTX970 (finally saved enough money for it) and within 24h they cancelled my order. Claimed there was a problem with my shipping address. (Used it for 3 years, paypal and ebay confirmed) and that I may be charged the full amount from my bank regardless. But I shouldn't worry, the money will be refunded in up to 5 business days. So they say.   SO! Now I can't even buy another card since I have to wait a full 5 days to make sure the bank doesn't withdraw the funds for a card I am not going to get and put me in an overdrawn state.  I just beat my head against my firewall for 30 minutes with their customer support, but they just kept copy/pasting the same cookie cutter responses. I have had more intelligent conversations with a bot...  I am not too happy with NewEgg right now. To say the least.  So am I alone? Or has anyone else been treated like this from these guys.    Cept in this instance...  http://www.amazon.ca/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672   You have 4 posts over the last 4 months and every one of them are you asking for help. The kindness of Reditors can be amazing, however perhaps you should be looking somewhere more local first.  Not saying you aren't legit, but?   So...I was just thinking...   I see you grabbed it. Thanks! Will let you know if I get more than a penny.   Nope. I can even show the bank deposit for it. Amazon loves to rape its authors.    Thanks! I don't see a lot of traffic so it would be a nice test of how much Amazon actually pays. I am not %100 sure, but I think the last one I was paid .01.   You got it!   http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Thief-Jamie-Heppner-ebook/dp/B00FFRD672/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8  There are other under the same name if you feel so inclined.    Caves, deep and usually under water.    Unless you are an administrator, you can't. If the message is blank it's an unfinished program, or a glitch.    It's the server sending you a message. For instance on one server I play in it tells you when you are within 1k of the boarder.     I ran...and ran, and ran. Still alive!   Have to keep looking, bigger towns are the best bet!   Was just on it    Follow a road, keep going, find a town.   Zombies spawn everywhere. Not just the city.  Dogs are still in game and just as strong.   Yes, you have greater numbers but read that first line again.   Logged in at night, in the desert, no town and was instant killed 3 times in a row.    Perhaps your humor is to deep for us. But, don't see it here.   I had a hand full of nails today after working on some home reno's and I was thinking...damn I need a nail gun. My wife just looks at me and shakes her head now.

Do you have any samples of work you have done before?    Stand alone with great twists try The Event by Jamie Heppner. There is a sequel in the works but it doesn't need it to finish the story.         Actual speed. Even compaired it to a newbie char last night. My 180 char is way faster.   What is your current health at? That might be the difference, I am around 170 I think...I just took it for a level base but it may be more than that.    It's part of character development, and I actually like it. I understand that you can't have everything right off the bat.   Things that are worked for are more valuable to me.   However, I also understand that other people just like the down and dirty, so if I were that person I would just turn on debug mode, hit g and run till your heart is content.    Source would be me, at lvl 23, running very very well. :)    You do know that as you gain levels you get faster right?   If you haven't found a buyer yet, let me know.    I don't care how many other people are. I stand alone!   Just wait until she becomes a proffesional redhead...!   Does, for the love of god, type DOES!   Have you looked at fiver? With art/writing skills you might be able to make the money in a couple days, or sooner.    Just and idea, but you can grab a zip drive for around 10 bucks and use it as a HD, not a ton of room, but it's better than nothing?    Not much to go on, but here is the first description of Dario Fisher from Mirror Thief.   "For the longest time I simply just stared at the reflection in the mirror. The lines were still there. The brown eyes still had the light inside of them, I could see the signs of healing, although it looked like hell, it must have been worse before. My hair had been cut, poorly, it wasn't a style I would have chosen myself, yet I guess it was better than what it could have been if left to grow out. My face showed only the slightest bit of a scruff growing in. I didn't normally let my beard grow out, but I could see the advantage of not having a close shave at this point of a healing process. I noted with some regret that my goatee had been trimmed off. Ah well, it would grow back if I let it."  He has just awoken inside a hospital after a motorcycle accident. White male about 18 years old. I would like to see what image this little bit brings to your mind...   I am sure that it's a glitch at this level. They are just a box after all, one would think that you should be able to open it, locked or not. Perhaps in 11 it will be one of the "many" bug fixes!    Not working for Audible, Budding...sure, we can call it that. Shame, but enjoy your months of questions anyway! :)    Sounds like an awesome guy, I'm sure that he is. You are very fortunate to remember at least that much, all I remember of mine was him being angry and telling us kids to be quiet.      InvalidCust actually...   There is a company that makes aftermarket heater setups for older vehicles that never came with any heat. It wasn't a factory fit, but it did supply heat from the coolant lines much like todays vehicles. I believe they used to be a couple hundred dollars. I don't have the places name handy, but I know a guy that will be at work tomorrow who does. Since you mentioned you are in Canada as well I can get the toll free number to his work for you, see if he can dig up a name from his old memory.   PM me if you are interested in that road.    1:Do you read e-books? (if you ever find time after answering all these questions.)  2:Would you like one for free?  3: If you like it, would you publicly tell everyone how awesome it was?    I was hoping for some input on the logistics/plausability. I will wait and see.       Okay. Prove it. Prove you don't cheat. What server were you on, and who was the admin? I will personally ask them.    Oh well  then since no one lies on the internet, you should just message the mod and explain it was all an accident.   I am a mod and I spend 2+ hours a night cleaning up after people that "weren't cheating".    Sure. DON'T FUCKING CHEAT!  And your steam ID gets banned. Not your game.   If you want to dupe, go play offline. Some people actually want to play without cheaters messing things up for them.     If it makes you feel better, I'm sitting here thinking...damn missed opportunity.   Had you hoped for a secret message and we're vastly disappointed to not find one?   Many places already have stopped doing DLST. If I had a vote, I would abolish it as well. Stupid thing, who thinks you can cut a foot off the top of a blanket, sew it on the bottom, and have a longer blanket?    WTF! Screw looking at the paper, run for the hills and get the hell away from that toilet!    No, just messing around for now. Not many readers around for this game yet.   Maybe TFP are looking for a writer though?   That would be cool!   Thanks :) I plan on it. I am enjoying the different writing for now.    Define "wonkey"?   Not really sure what you mean here. There are worlds, they are generated...what else did you need?    The Event by Jamie Heppner  Dark post apocalyptic good vs evil where good is questionable...    Please remember, this is just raw writing I am doing in my spare time. Errors will and do exist, and feel free to point them out, but I am spending no extra time editing this stuff. It's just for fun!       Rainmeter.   And I now see you are OP, so do you know the wattage of what you purchased?    Very true. But a 1500w space heater needs at least a 1500w inverter (I won't get into spike wattage detail, but a 2000w inverter would be even better.) so the odds of OP buying that large an inverter is slim on a limited budget.     Sadly an inverter won't power a heater very well, if at all. You are better off to run the car and use it's heaters that way. Even better to stock up on blankets and be sure to put some under you when you sleep as well.   Hope you don't get too cold.   True. But they don't usually talk like  ....   Yes, you need to set up a blocking system. Or your server will be over run in no time.    Omw! I'm just north of you!   I am always open to input. Feel free to message me here, or find me on FB. My name is no secret here on Reddit.   If it makes you feel any better, I say down and just typed. There is no editing process involved in this at all.  Other than spell check, which has failed me before.  Thanks, I think I will see what the rest of the night brings me.   A hug.   I have an idea on how to incorporate some of those skills in a learning curve. Thanks for reading.    Rest of night and day 2 coming soon!   I already do. But having your work enjoyed by others makes it even more enjoyable to me.   Thanks :) I think I will more than likely write more.    hehe, we will see...I am having fun writing it so far. If there is support, I might continue.    Perhaps.   What did it feel like when you held her hand? Looked into her eyes as the lights in the cafe shifted shadows across her face? When she stepped away from that first night as  you watched her sit down into a cab and close the door?   She isn't real on google.  	116
             /r/fuckablefaces      Did you even check the article to see if it was any kind of challenge?  Nope, I haven't done that for any of the articles I've posted here recently.                  I should have but didn't since I'm not sure if it is real or not. I showed this to somebody once who was skeptical about the picture.   Looks like this pic was taken at Delta Essen, a German nightclub.   Onision?

Even though I don't like overpopulation and think that to an extent tragedies, famines, and diseases are a good thing for decreasing the population, I still feel that 5.33 billion people have enough of a right to live that they shouldn't be killed intentionally. It's a weird idea to think about for me since I place freedom over lives and by killing them on purpose with no other reason than to kill them, I would be taking their freedom by taking their lives with no other reason.  Edit: But now I'm thinking about how this would effect supply and demand. Since most of the population will be gone, the homes, cars, and valuables that used that once belonged to them will end up being cheaper than before. There's potential looting to be done too.   http://www.inclinterior.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bathroom-bathroom-stall-design-with-brown-wooden-swing-door-panel-and-chrome-metl-door-handle-combined-with-white-ceramic-water-closet-amusing-wooden-bathroom-stalls-interior-design-728x546.jpg   Black S-Class      Deep dream is getting fucking old on this sub.

I used to be and still sort of am one of those people you puzzle about. I really don't care about 30,000 deaths a year since that is still a small enough number that it couldn't put us at risk for extinction and I see it as sort of a good thing. I see it as sort of a good thing because that is 30,000 less people around to pollute, use resources, and reproduce to contribute to overpopulation. It also takes some strain off of Medicare and Social Security because most of those who die in the accidents die before 65. Basically, I see cars and motorcycles as "population control/natural selection machines", but that isn't a good enough reason to be against a new technology. I still do not really care about deaths from things like cars for these reasons and value freedom over lives and safety, but my view on autonomous cars is now neutral. If you want an autonomous car when they are available because you feel that is the better choice, so be it, but that doesn't mean I think we should ban manual cars from the roads. Maybe make licensing requirements and penalties for drunk or reckless driving stricter and make autonomous rental cars or cabs more readily available to those who don't have them but are in a situation where they shouldn't be driving though.

Misleading title.               /r/spacedicks (NSFL)   I have always thought that this is one of those crazy ideas that may actually work, a sports team of cross-dressed males who play against actual female teams unbeknownst to them. I imagine that the male team would probably win an overwhelming amount of times due to their typically larger muscles, larger bodies, taller stature, higher aggression, and increased competitiveness due to testosterone. All this would probably mean they would pummel the real females. Also, how long could this kind of ruse last? I imagine that on an amateur level it would last far longer than on a professional level due to gender testing and media attention. However, even on an amateur level they might need to be careful which males they choose to play as females, as a team made up mostly of 6'3, 200lb "girls" with Adam's Apples would probably attract negative attention. I know that the Eastern Europeans used to do these shenanigans to some extent in the Olympics, but mostly not with team sports.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Mr._Ripley_%28film%29 (Spoilers)         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Kasso                  According to the comments, the last known info about this guy is that he was sentenced to 27 months in prison in 2006 and forced to pay $400,000 restitution.  Edit: He was charged with tax fraud.         It's like the new "Not your father's Oldsmobile".

From Wikipedia: The GLK-Class is not sold in RHD markets, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, due to a driveshaft used to operate the front wheels on 4WD versions of the GLK. It is positioned such that it encroaches slightly on the right-hand-side footwell. In August 2014, however, it was announced the GLK-Class will be sold in the United Kingdom from Q4 2015.   It should be noted that Q4 2015 marks the end of production for the GLK, so this info hasn't been updated.         Quality post.   Thats punny.      That was a risky click.   /r/conspiratard         Edit: You should x-post this to /r/punchablefaces  That's how I found this. Somebody posted a screenshot of this guy and there was a link to this video in the comments.   Probably, but I was also wondering if part of why the older ones don't look flashy is because they aren't new anymore. It also seems like the first Mercedes-Benz made to be intentionally flashy was the SEC coupe in the 80's and the pre-facelift W212 was somewhat of a return to their older style of designing cars.   It seems like the ones from 20-30 years ago were more plain, restrained, and utilitarian looking compared to the ones built more recently.         The new Elliot Offen.   Edit: or co-worker.

 In the least surprising news of the day, I've found that the biased SJW-type presenter also works for the BBC.         Unsurprisingly, the rather biased feminist interviewer also has a job at the BBC.      If he'd have just shouted racist at her it would have been much more entertaining (and appropriate).   Even from a British perspective it's usage in this instance is completely inappropriate and quite offensive given the circumstances (surely the correct term is "civil rights campaigner" or "gender equality activist". That said, the rest of the article isn't too bad.      A somewhat disappointing headline, but the comments section is simply magical.  From what I've read of this case it seems extremely complicated and it seems this guy has been failed by the state throughout his entire life.                           Lets not link to total fabrications please. it doesn't even allow comments so how is there any value at all in such a link?                        There are no less than three "Boys are Stupid, throw rocks at them" products on the B N website. Most responsible companies withdrew these products either in 2004 or in the follow-up campaign last year.   Here's the best summary of the case for those who want to know the detail. There's a lot of myths out there so it's well worth a read of the truth: http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail   here's the best summary of the case for those who want to know more: http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail   The story is out there if you read the right articles.

No. Siddique's religion is an integral part of his work/fame. He's a leading Muslim, not simply a regular/occasional Muslim.   Apologies, I just basically took the title from the video to avoid suggestions of editorialising.      Funny how in all of these scandals the opinions are left-wing or anti Conservative/UKIP.     You know how often they mentioned him being a Christian?  Fucking never.  That's probably becasue he was Jewish: http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.638528     **edit**, awww he's deleted the post. Real shame, a true classic.    To be fair, this statement could be used for any actual terrorist group to justify their actions. Isis "only adopted their tactics" because...  Not really, it say they only use the tactics becasue of the failure to uphold the law. The likes of ISIS hate the most fundamental features of our system of law and even democracy itself.

This reminds me of their 2011 presentation which lymped in Fathers4Justice with the 9/11 attacks, the IRA and Animal Liberation Front.  https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/second-thoughts-on-extreme-tactic/418439.article?sectioncode=26 storycode=418439 c=1  The Fathers4jjustice smear was not only more severe, but also less accurate given they just wear silly costumes. The worst they do is occasionally throw various pancake ingredients at Labour politicians.      2000 people clearly disagree with you.   Best parts starts at 9 minutes in: https://youtu.be/8eHLnb6kYnc?t=9m9s   By far the best part starts at 9 minutes in: https://youtu.be/8eHLnb6kYnc?t=9m9s   Also served as a Minister according to the Sun, so that excludes about 70% of those on your list.         that's 545 under 24 year olds vs 104 women of any age (and it's less than 104 these days.) The actual number of male suicides is over 4,500.         Nice to see the Universities disgraceful behaviour starting to have consequences.   A reminder of Burchill's previous thoughts on male suicide: http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/16/weekend7.weekend6  "Well, if the men who manage football think that 545 under-24 male suicides a year is a more frightening statistic than two women killed each week - and hundreds of thousands injured every year - by the men they live with, then they must be even stupider than they look; though it's hard to imagine, I know. But I can't help feeling they're on very dodgy ground, taking on the young male suicide thing. For a start, it's a phony panic, catering to that lowest of modern male desires - to be a victim"  "That young men succeed in suicide more often than girls isn't really the point. Indeed, the more callous among us would say that it was quite nice for young men finally to find something that they're better at than girls."            Meanwhile far worse happens to millions of babies and it's 100% deliberate every single time. If they're rally unlucky they'll live in NYC and some sicko with herpes will suck the blood from the wound afterwards (and the government will be ok with it too!)               The fact that it's legal to carry out similar mutilations on boys show the law to be inconsistent and therefore flawed.  Of course the way to fix this is to protect boys from mutilation too,  but anyone supporting mutilation can take the opposite position an argue they're being discriminated against and they should be able to cut girls just as other cut boys.   That study is at odds with most other research (and it even says as much in the link).    There aren't any 'benefits' to FGM. There are to circumcision.   Actually, pretty much every supposed "benefit" of MGM also applies to FGM.     There's no apparent evolutionary sense to wanking  Not true at all. It cuts the risk of prostate cancer and also helps maintain sexual function.      The topic of the story is the mutilation of children's genitals without their consent. If we made it illegal to mutilate all kids , regardless of gender, you'd instantly take away one of the best arguments supporting FGM.  People opposing MGM are the biggest opponents of FGM - they go further than feminist opponents of the practice and want to protect all victims of mutilation instead of just a small percentage.    We need more mental health initiatives.  That's true and mental health may have been one factor here, but I object to this statement on its own - it's now standard response to these cases and pretending that mental health care is the main issue is used to gloss over the abuse men face in our society.  This guy was denied access to his kids, and in most cases these denials of contact are quite clearly wrong. He killed himself in prison, where he had already been subject to violence and it's highly doubtful that he should have even been there in the first place.  If we allow men to be mistreated again and again, and then imprison them for highlighting such abuses (where the abuse continues) then inevitably some will reach breaking point, regardless of whatever mental health care is available.  We need to fix the root causes of these problems, sometimes that's mental health, but mostly it's the shocking way men are abused and mistreated by society.         Sorry to hear about your loss, this is a reminder of why we're all here.   His imprisonment was as result of his protests, not for any actual crimes: http://newfathers4justice.co.uk/2015/06/06/suffragent-free-haydn-burton/  Of particular note, is that his arrest was at the hands of Hampshire Police, who have also engaged in some extremely distributing practices against the founder of the original Fahters4Justice, a case which also involved alleged misconduct by a Conservative MP. Matt O'Connor of F4J is currently been dragged through the courts by the police and has also been subject to physical attack by Conservatives at his own home!  So in summary, in one county we have a corrupt police force going out of their way to target all fathers rights campaigners who dare to engage with Conservative politicians, and there are very close ties between Conservative politicians in this country and the police force.  Essentially it seems that the the country in question is not a safe place for anyone concerned with equality for fathers.         Could we do something nice for this guy, maybe raise some money for him?                 They have to be as unbiased as possible when reporting the news and they enforce this heavily. With any news they have to be as unbiased as possible.  They're supposed to be unbiased, but they're terrible when it comes to gender issues. It's now basically a feminist organisation.   U.S. soccer thinks she does as do over 10k people who favourited their tweet   And to think just last week US Soccer proposed putting Solo on the new $1 bill! https://twitter.com/ussoccer_wnt/status/617868478607921152   And just last week US Soccer proposed putting Solo on the new $1 $10 bill! (with their proposal being retweeted 6K times!)   Just last week US Soccer proposed putting Solo on the new $1 bill! https://twitter.com/ussoccer_wnt/status/617868478607921152   Just last week US Soccer proposed putting Solo on the new $1 bill! https://twitter.com/ussoccer_wnt/status/617868478607921152                                    No idea, sorry.   There isn't one.   The guy who made this video made countless other equally good one on other gender related issues, with hours and hours of original content interviewing figures such as Erin Pizzey. His original channels have disappeared, but some of the best vids are mirrored on other channels. Search for "manwomanmyth" for more similar content.   The follow channel has mirrored quite a few of the videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71JvwMCwlbATlyWBonidug  Here's a good one to get you started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjwe6ECiXi4               Exactly, and this case is elevated well above those in significance becasue Solo is representing her country rather than just dong her day job by playing for a random team/business    It was looked into and there was no hard proof Solo was the instigator just a bunch of he said she said  The case was dismissed on procedural grounds, therefore the allegations haven't actually been "looked into" yet in court. There's also rather more proof in this case than a great many other cases that end up in court.    Does that mean the celebration of the US victory is something to be questioned? I don't think so.  If she'd maybe have stayed away from the celebrations then it wouldn't be so bad. Perhaps if the other athletes had come out against domestic violence then it would be a little more tolerable. But if even 10% of the allegations about Solo are true then she shouldn't have been on the team and therefore any victory is going to be tainted by that.    There was bunch of he said she said going on and dismissed like a normal case.  No, it was dismissed on procedural grounds. This dismissal gets appealed on Monday so there's still a very real chance of her facing justice    Because one person on the team is a dickhead, you can't celebrate winning a world cup?   No, you suspend said person from the team before the tournament and have a squad completely free of violent assholes who are all fit to represent their country.     The outcome of the Women's World Cup has nothing to do with the handling of Hope Solo's case.  Of course it does, Sole played every minute for the winning team!   I only just found this article and this is my only account here.  It's a highly topical story - prosecutors are expected to appeal the dismissal of the case on Monday.                                             I'd normally condemn you for linking to such a hateful site, but it does at least seem to be allowing comments, so that makes it excusable in my book.    people who couldn't beat 13-14 year old boys  One of the team members is allegedly very good at beating boys...      The charges were only dropped on proceedural grounds, this is being appealed in a few days time.   Does the 6% figure include all the additional still births and miscarriages etc? The article also only spoke about defects diagnosed in infancy, health issues can emerge later in childhood or even as young adults and perhaps they're being glossed over too?               'Debunking feminist myths'? Ugh.  Did you actually watch the video?, I know it's long but at least view the first 5 minutes. Whatever you opinion of his other politics it's clear he's an MP who taken the time to research an issue in depth, ask questions, study the data and find the truth. I doubt you'll see a better performance from any politician from any party, and its' a real shame there weren't more there to hear what he said and learn from his work.   Davies has done some fantastic work highlighting sexism in the prison and justice system and debunking feminist myths. This speech is well worth watching:  http://human-stupidity.com/stupid-dogma/mens-rights-feminism/conservative-backbencher-philip-davies-thoroughly-debunks-feminist-politicians-politically-correct-nonsense      And only two women in the top 100 (with one of those set to lose her top 100 place in August)   He's saying most of the crap ones who lose drop out. If you're good at what you do then you obviously wouldn't drop out for the reason he suggests and therefore his point doesn't apply to you.      Philip Davies has been working to highlight inequalities in the prison system for years now, he's gone from basically knowing nothing about the issue and believing all the feminist lies to being the most knowledgeable person in Parliament on the topic. It's really worth watching some of his speeches on this issue, please consider following him on twitter and tweeting in support of his work.      Probably the most comprehensive article on this topic, useful for dispelling some myths about the case that seem to be flying around.   Probably the most comprehensive article on this topic, useful for dispelling some myths about the case that seem to be flying around.          Looks at your post history  While we're on the topic of post histories, care to explain yours?       I hadn't heard of the idea of men being on the ends of the spectrum and women in the middle. It's a compelling idea but probably not 100% accurate.   it's absolutely accurate and absolutely the perfect argument to explain the lack of female geniuses and chess grand masters, becasue the differences are by far  the most significant at the genius level extreme of the spectrum.  There's also evidence to suggest that the male curve is shifted very marginally to the right of the female one. This difference is extremely small, but it magnifies the differences at the extreme right of the curve.   I'm not necessarily defending his body language during all the discussion. However, if an opponent makes a point that ridiculous/extreme then laughter can be an appropriate response at that immediate moment. If she'd have been able to debate properly and left out the most idiotic "arguments" then there wouldn't have been anything to laugh at.   That victim blaming point really was worthy of a laugh though, by then I was laughing too. Nothing wrong in laughing when something is that ridiculous.   At club level yes, but this world cup has received plenty of hype.    she defending her sister from her nephew  Solo went to the nephew/sister's house drunk (in her car). She insulted him about his weight, was asked to leave but then followed them into the house. She then attacked the nephew and he restrained her. After he was persuaded to release her she attacked thim again repeatedly punching him in the face smashing his head into the concrete. Solo's half sister then tried to protect her son, at which point she was then also repeatedly punched in the face by Solo. The nephew grabbed the BB gun t try to get Solo out of the house, and Solo later lied to the police that it had been a real gun.  Both the victims had visible injuries and Solo swore at the police and even threatened them when arrested.   Where were the people who claim to care about domestic violence though? How many domestic violence charities condemned her? How many feminists and other activists did so and started contacting sponsors etc?  I've seen one politician condemn what she did and one player (and she was retiring anyway).   ..said the mod of /againstmensrights!          the charges were dismissed.  They were dismissed **on procedural grounds**, not becasue of any evidence pointing to her lack of guilt. This dismissal of the charges is now being appealed by prosecutors, so there's a good chance she'll end up on trial.                     The BBC does exactly the same thing in the UK, their Comic Relief campaign donates to the "Paws for Kids" charity helping the pets of women and children who are victims of domestic violence. Meanwhile men barely get a penny from anyone.  This issue was identified as early as 2007: http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-relief   Actually it's the rarity of them getting caught and the prosecuted which makes it news.   They're clearly discriminating by gender, that's my point.                     The Greens really are now the most sexist political party in the UK.  They only want men to go to prison, men appear to be completely sidelined in the party (despite them claiming to have equality when it comes to the leadership and deputy leader position). Can you name a current Green Party figure who isn't female? When did you last see a male from the party sent to be their representative on TV or speaking at one of their press conferences?  Looking at Bennett's background we see she worked for the extremist feminist organisation the Fawcett Society and therefore it's no surprise she comes out with sexist rubbish such as this. No wonder so few males vote for the party.   "Mansplaining" is a sexist term invented by feminists so they can avoid debate with men and instead play the victim any time they get something completely wrong.  More recently they've introduced other similar sexist terms such as "manspreading" for when a person supposedly takes up too much space on public transport.  it's quite incredible to see feminists such as Bennett supporting such sexism as feminists pretend to be in favour of gender neutral terminology at all times, yet here they are inventing more and more unnecessarily gendered language (and quite unpleasant and sexist language at that).                              Yes.         The admin who runs AMA losts her job shortly after this, so there may well be a major men's rights angle to the current Reddit meltdown.      They'd promote gender equality for everyone rather than just special privileges for women (which is was feminism has become).            Yes but those facing such charges would expect to be suspended. If she's actually guilty of attacking a child then she gets banned from the team for good, not simply suspended.         Any policies to reduce the gender education gap (something that's actually a genuine issue)             There is no blatant sexist double standard. Male athletes beat the shit outta females all the time, and get slapped on the wrist  In some of the cases where males have been suspended it was actually the female who attacked first. We see the same double standard in the music industry - Chris Brown gets vilified for abusing his partner, yet Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston, Cheryl Cole all get a pass and in most cases boast about their abuse and sometimes even make money out of it.   Who's to say I'm fully in favour of suspension? I'm sharing an interesting video, there's an argument for innocent until proven guilty, though a precedent has been set with many other male athletes, so in the US at least she need suspending. There would be an alternative or reinstating others accused of domestic violence. My main concern is the blatantly sexist double standard rather than taking a stance on which of the two options would be correct.   Yes an argument in early June which exposed the true facts of the case and thus made an extremely compelling case for her suspension, nothing has changed since then has it? Obviously it's a little late now, but the fact is that every game Solo plays just compounds matters and arguably brings shame on the team, making it difficult for fans to get behind them.   Good argument there, really convincing.      It's ongoing news. Every match she plays and ever game the USA win makes the story bigger and bigger and makes the problem worse.   The fact that the USA have progressed to the final means we'll see this abuser representing her country on the biggest possible stage in her sport. The plus side to that is there should be even more attention in her case when it comes to court.  	208
 [The TV on their Wii U demo isn't straight..](http://i.imgur.com/cRH0axm.png)   Saving to my keyboard porn folder...right after I crop dat shit    Scythians were straight ballers   damn whats the source for that? Very accurate   This is like the starter house I make on Sims when I have fuck all for money    /r/im14andthisisdeep    Yeah i'm by no means informed but aren't the shit working conditions in these places also influenced by their own government policies and not solely the companies in question? Why pick on just Apple when it's a nation-wide issue with almost all companies?    I use Apple because they make a good product but holy shit those overhyped losers at the London iPhone 6 opening make me wanna shoot myself out of a goddamn cannon into space    I feel like almost every big budget medieval movie is either set in England, France, or some fantasy realm (where everyone inexplicably has an english accent). Maybe this is just due to exposure because i'm from an english speaking country but I don't know of any movies set in medieval Germany, Austria, Poland, etc yet i'm quite interested in the Holy Roman Empire and this place/period (1000-1600 C.E.) in general. Do you guys have any suggestions? I don't care about language, just production quality (good costumes and sets)   Nice, have fun keeping them clean though haha, I have yet to find a good way to clean the foam part of my boosts    Avatar   Techno is gonna take North America by storm once all the kids grow up and tire of poppy EDM. It's already happened in Europe, South America and Australia...    Funny story actually. I randomly clicked Berserk:Golden Age I on Netflix in midst the peak of my Dark Souls obsession and naturally got into it because of the similarities. I was with my gf and she made fun of me and said I could only see the similarities because of how obsessed I was with Dark Souls at the time (she had to persuade me to put the game down just to come over that night.) Now of course I know there are some concrete influences and she can suck it.     ...what's the name of the church?    That's fair. I guess i'm coming from a somewhat young and naive perspective, being only 22 myself.    O S solo when you take out Smough first. Never thought that fight was very hard at first because I always got super Smough instead of Ornstein. Super Ornstein is next level bitch    You can also just hide behind a big rock/cliff and make short work of him with a great bow    Yeah even with the homeward bone exploit, which makes dying a little bit less inevitable on BoC, the fight is never something I look forward to, just the last annoying step before I get to fight Gwyn and restart the game lol    ugh I skate, game and make music. DOESN'T MAKE YOU RIGHT HONEYCOMBS.    lmao how are people taking this seriously?    lmao the trap beat    If you misspell Squirtle on Google it can take you to some shit... trust me     Please wait while I take my extra strength dose of vitamin DUH    What's the mixer/soundcard with the DON'T logo?    the fact that I was looking at a picture of a photograph threw me off soo much at first    Yea for real, demanding to be treated like an equal by a Senior partner lmao     I feel like that's a sort of a plot point. He's the human amongst a bunch of ambulance chasers.    Once you get to like NG+6 and every bonfire is max kindled you'll just end up having a lot. Even more if you don't die often.    In the first Dark Souls it's so easy to speedrun/dodge past enemy placements it basically renders them pointless if you know what you're doing. Except those damn clams in Crystal Cave. Fuck those guys.   This is exactly how I do it every time. Basically play shot for shot like a fuckin real man would.    I've never parried Gwyn ever. I'm all about dat dodge yo. And fully upgraded giants helps lol     This I believe. I don't believe an 8 year old girl made it through the entire game blind on just her intuition...    /r/thathappened  jk but seriously pretty hard to believe unless she's following a guide like a cookbook. Also you forgot to tell us the timeline. If this was over the course of like a month it's believable but you make it sound like she zipped right through it with no problems whatsoever.   yup, that f/m ratio is for a reason    Those bitches were getting DP'd every night    Magic Mikearp   I just asked my dad if the soup we were having was home made. He answers yes, but from a package. I say that's not home made. "It was made in my home, it's home made. -_- Thanks dad    That shoe game though..    Probably not even in the ground yet and there's like 54654 pieces of fan art depicting his headstone already...    yeah but even after entering Drangleic Castle, you still have a ways to go before Nashandra. Twin Dragonriders, LGK, Shrine of Amana, Velstadt, Giant lord, Throne W D... that's at least another 400k souls  Edit: ah nvm, forgot you could just agape ring all those bosses/areas    idk probably not lol. How do you even get to Nashandra with only 1m SM? It takes more than that just for the lord souls + the giant lord soul no?    Yeah I'm really glad to be going back to soul level. It will actually make builds relevant again in the late game :D    Yeah I definitely learned my lesson. Mofucka will never know how much damage his little jump caused hahah    maan that sucks haha, no one to blame but yourself either    The Blue or "Aged" Smelter Demon is actually magic damage. Spell quartz +3, blue burr and Magic Havels greatshield are what you want if you gonna tank that fight. Smelter is a lot easier if you just have high agility and dodge though.   Difficulty wise, Iron Passage. Cool Ranch sword is almost worth it.. I would do the lightning deer dash before that place again though.   Lore/story wise, the Grave of Saints. Even just the name had so much potential, but an entire area dedicated to rats? What even?   Design wise, I agree Aldias Keep had such potential but just fell so flat.    semi-speedrunning, had just finished breezing through Heide's and the FoFG without levelling, pwned the Pursuer via the parry-ballista method, then stupidly got stuck in the gate room with the 5~10 royal soldiers in Lost Bastille and double death lost everything. Wasn't a gross amount of souls, but it was a big hit since it was like over 50k souls right at the start of the game. Basically said fuck it and started over.    So I decided to cap this character just before 2m soul memory to perpetually help with Velstadt because he's my favourite boss. I'm at around 1,980,000 SM with just enough souls to buy the agape ring (first mistake) and for some reason I stupidly decided to leave Staids bonfire unlit this playthrough (second mistake) so i'm making my way over from the one in Sinners Rise. I get invaded by some guy, and not wanting to go over 2M, I plan to let him win. Only as soon as I gesture, he just runs straight off the cliff. Like he knew.   Anyway, [this](http://i.imgur.com/CQ8AY5t.jpg) is what I was left with after the smoke cleared. _  TLDR: Ill-timed suicidal invader messed up my whole playthrough plan just by diving off a ledge.   the ghosts are probably the worst obstacle for challenge runs, but the mutant skeleton hounds in the tomb of giants are the king of casual playthrough enemies   love it seems like the kinda guy you could just hit the blunt wit and talk about life    [8]   Agreed, I really wish the Ruin Sentinels warpicks were a usable weapon!    yup yup!    This is my favourite thing to do! Depending on my mood I might let the host clear out the area and then duel, but if he's a chugger or I just feel particularly devious, i'll just lure them into a gankgle of enemies and sit back laughing. My favourite is the room in undead crypt with all the leydia pyros    salt alert    throwing knife? I've fallen victim to like 3 throwing knife coup de grce's today alone   Yeah i'm not sure what the logic was behind giving you all these crazy, unique looking boss weapons in Dark Souls 2 but then giving them such shit damage or impractical move sets that you're better off going through the game with a basic rapier..    It will be one of the main selling points of Dark Souls III: Age of Shit along with an all new online levelling system complete with killstreaks and callsigns! Also a mt dew twitter campaign. I can already see the Faram knight on the slurpee cups.    or a whole new crafting section for consumables. hexing urn + dung pie = ?  jk, I think [6]    Agreed! I think those would work great thematically with faith builds    Does that actually allude to an in game mechanic of the sword or is it just a cool description?  Edit: just looked it up, gets more powerful depending on your NG+ level for anyone wondering     Is Lothian an actual character with lore? Very nice btw, Can't wait for an update on the finished piece    On that note, I would love even more easter egg/joke weapons. You're in midst the heated clash of zwei on geisteel when suddenly -bong- parried by a goddamn frying pan     This isn't Dark Souls 3 speculation, just wishful thinking. Apologies if this sort of question has been asked before.  Personally i've noticed one thing missing from any previous Souls games are flails. I love me some swordplay but every once in a while I just wanna go swinging around a big spiky ball like a cartoon knight. I get that it's probably physics related, hard to make a realistic flail animation but it would be awesome to have one day.  Another weapon i'd love to see is essentially a blunt spike the size of a dagger. I don't know the technical name of it, the documentary I saw it in just called it a bollock dagger because of the hilt shape, which I know can also have a cutting edge, but anyway... yeah, it'd be a great alternative to the parry dagger since they're specifically designed for punching through plate armour in hand to hand combat. I imagine it could also have a parrying option, but just scale really well against certain enemy/armour types.  I'd like to see an Ulfberht (I know this is essentially just a broadsword, but it would have a cool ass description or something)  And finally.. I'd like to see some hookswords. I know they're a little impractical but then we could finally cosplay Kabal   I'm all about dem spears. Feel like a goddamn spartan. I'll use whichever one, don't care if it's perceived as a "cheap" weapon because of the range. Aged Smelter Sword (Cool Ranch Danksword) is also fun coz you feel like a boss.    I laughed, but RIP for srs.    Did it my first play through. Thought it might be reverse psychology.  Nope.    Lud and Zallen are fairly easy, but the run to the fog gate is almost not worth it    This happened to me with Sinh and I was pisssssed    YOU FINISH THE FIGHT    Vaati = ISIS?    I knew it was coming but when I finally saw the face I burst out laughing anyway.    "The proportions are off" Oh really, tell me more about the unrealistic proportions of the giant sea monster and the flaming tiger-dog..   	73
 Skit wasnt funny. It was just irritating to watch him fumble around like that.   That was difficult to watch   What do you guys do? And r u hiring ;)?      Oh thats hilarious   A random number is basically a calculated number.  The computer has a specific formula (algorithm) that it uses to generate a number. This formula requires a seed to make the number different each time. In general, current time is used to make a unique random number.   For example :  Say the formula is : RanNumber = seed + 2;  If seed was 5, then the answer would be 7.  But to make it random, we can use the current time in milliseconds from what computer interprers the start of time in milliseconds (roughly around 1970s).  So ranNumber = 1029828227373792(made this # up) + 2;    I guess thats why people even suggest against online mbas. Hmm.   Based on what you have learned from getting an MBA. What are some books/courses/resources that you can provide for someone that want's to learn the materials and concepts being taught in earning an MBA without actually going to school for it.  I come from a Software Engineering background and for the most part you can learn everything from a book or a video online. Granted MBA has a huge social component to it but the concepts at the core curriculum are I'm sure easily obtainable from a book.  So what are those core concepts that can be learned without having to actually attend an MBA school.   Damn 40% seems high. Are you sure you're not causing the anxiety yourself by over paying. If you want to feel less anxious then get yourself on a plan that will help you pay the student loans thats at a comfortable rate. It might take longer but at least you will be at peace. That's how debt it. You can either pay it off sooner or later, sooner the better but will affect your peace. Later, will give you some peace now but you might struggle later. Which one would you rather have? If the answer is neither then your best bet is to hop on a plane and live your life in the Amazon rainforest :)   Care to elaborate on this? Like how does this work?   Lol me neither but hey emergencies   Realized that myself today and went out and got a kit and shaven in the work bathroom today. I told myself to get a kit for a while but got the cajones to actually do it today.   Which hoops   Dang. Nyc would be so much fun too.   Why in the world would you downvote a serious question?   I'm a philly driver but I noticed that as I was passing by nyc that I can activate both Uber and Lyft when I'm there. So can I pick up pax even though I dont have a TLC? And if I do get caught what are the charges?   Come out to philly. Ull get one.   Well if they would put me on a tier plan than i rather go to a company that's considerably cheaper. Heck I'd go to Cricket and save a boat load then stick with att.   if they did that then i would leave right away.   yea   they sent me an email saying it was for lyft drivers who sent them two pay statements   cool i sent them the text info yest. i hope i get it soon.   When did it show up? Because i finished my 20 rides yesterday and dont see anything yet.   I got it too. U mean im not getting my $500 :(   @brownhairidc @inkios @Friendly_jackal join http://hashtagdrive.com/  its a chat app where bunch of uber lyft drivers converge.  id really like to see more philly ppl on there.   I've been driving for a week in Philly. Don't worry about it.  Just drive around. If you do airport pickups then tell them to sit in the front.  and if they do impound your car then just call lyft and get reimbursed for your car.   Oh thats so true. Worst part if when you're in the middle of fixing something and have to make four or five stops because ur too dumb to measure twice or sit down and fig out what you exactly need.   Java. you can jump ship to any language from there.   Came here to say that the islam ideology is to increase number of members by and increased size in family.

Triffin (train+ tiffin) Meals on wheels (i feel like this might be copyrighted) Loco-Food or loco-khana    Seriously, its our generation that will answer whatever future outcome results of this. So why arent we holding marches and raising awareness, etc.   Even if someone throw rocks at the train it still wouldnt cause such a damage to a train that we see with the amtrak train.  Speed is the main issue. And if the black box rules out speed then i think speculation can take place.   Any Salvation Army center. Maybe even the Kroc?  Not sure why you're getting down-voted.   So the moral of the story is that even a homeless man cant evade student loans.   I hear ya. Im not perfect but I gotta say that this sub is def. not what the general consensus of Christians would agree with.  They should change their name to r/LiberalChristians  That said, i do appreciate their diff views every now and then.   My friends brother went through a similar experience.  Raised in a muslim household.  Met a christian gf. Really searched out the truth. Even went to college to learn about world religions. And then finally became a christian. Currently serves as a missionary leader for a church.   I love a church where the sermon is so good that everything else doesnt even matter.  By everything else I mean, what kind of worship style is being used, denomination, liturgy or not, etc.   I dont think I'd be able to. I mean a place of eternal torment or a place of peace.  But then again I dont have kids yet.   What do you guys make of this?      I think I will be voting for Doug Oliver. Seems like the guy for me! Someone that cares about schools!

    Awesome! My dad picked up 2 cameras for me last time he went to Hong Kong so I can use them racing. I have a track day on Wednesday so I'll be sure to post some videos    I'm almost positive it didn't, but I don't play 5 anymore so I can't say for sure. The straight cuts were one of the best things ever in that game, it truly made it sound like you were driving a race car. Especially the BMWs   I agree, I remember back in Forza 4 and 3 when you upgraded the transmission it would actually change the sound like it had straight cut gears    I'll pm you later. I'm going to look at one from an s2 tonight    Just blew my ring and pinion. It costs more to replace that than a used transaxle   Yup!   Just going to swap it out, I already pulled it out today. But now comes the fun part of trying to find one that is in my area for sale.   It definitely has crossed my mind. But it's really not worth it with my car. You're better off starting with either a turbo or S2 for upgraded suspension, brakes, trans, etc   Yeah, it's name was clutch. Probably shouldn't have dumped it so soon    I checked Larts. I have a track day coming up on the 22, so the problem I have is I live in the north east so I'm afraid it is going to come in at the last minute. I did find one from an S2 locally that I may be picking up tonight    I was in a Porsche parade, and I was cresting a hill and it just went. The ring and pinion went and it sent shrapnel through the whole thing.          I think it may have been a 280   This is my affordable dream. I'd do anything to have a 4AGE with ITBs screaming right behind my head    I see you driving around all the time! I live in wilbraham   Is this the one I see around Ludlow all the time?   It completely caught me off guard. I was at a driver's meet, and the way you get to the paddock to the track is over the bridge. I looked over to the bridge and I saw the front end and I nearly shat myself and everybody else at the meeting. It was truly amazing       I had a set of primewells on my 944 when I bought it. It was pretty fun autocrossing with them   11/10   I never thought of that, I'm definitely going to have to try it. I have a few autocross mods for Race 07 and they just don't feel right. They seemed herky jerky and the cones make you jump I'd you hit them    I really should get back out to Devens. Going to the LAZ lot in Hartford is just so much more convenient for me but it's no where near as fun    Does Amy's Baking Shop count?   I'm not sure how many people use copart for buying cars, but they do have a section for cars that have been declared a biohazard. This most likely fits the bill    Looks awesome! Can't wait to try it!   I NEED that Turbo Cup   I'm not exactly sure, mines an 86 and it came with late offset wheels for some reason, but there was already rear spacers so it looked like an actual late offset car. I would definitely do spacers though, fills up the wheel arches much more    Looks awesome! By any chance do you know what year those wheels came off of? They look like they came off a late offset car and that's why they're sucked in so much. But really good job, it's hard to believe it came this far!   Howdy neighbor! This was taken in East Longmeadow right?   Awesome looking car, but the front licence plate mounting is questionable       I start college this year, I'm trying to get all the track time in I can before I go    Thanks, my dad is an Oldsmobile guy, so he wasn't too keen on letting a Porsche stay in his brand new garage       Without a doubt he's going fast, but that GoPros FOV makes it look like he is going at warp speed    I'm pretty sure they are. The only difference is that some of the Porsche ones don't have that little plastic trim on the inside, and they have Porsche written on them    I have actually thought about doing coilovers, I've been kind of going back and forth. I definitely like the idea of being able to adjust coil overs instead of having to change out torsions bars. I got the cage because I bought it used at super cheap price, so it was a mine as well for once I actually start doing road course stuff.    Alright, rebuilt calipers, Hawk HP Race pads, stoptech slotted rottors, turbo S sway bars with adjustable drop links, fiberglass header panel, I took off the US crash bumpers just because they looked hideous, ac and heat delete, autocross alignment that has maxed out front caster, 1/32 toe front, 1/16 toe rear, -2.5 camber front, -2.0 camber rear, Bilstein HD rear shocks (I have Weltmiester 250 LB front springs coming in as well as a larger torsion bar) I stripped back all interior wires that didn't have to do with necessary equipment, Hankook Ventus RS3s V2, circular throttle cam, Momo steering wheel, full stripped interior, Autopower bolt in roll cage, Momo Daytona FIA containment seat, Schroth Profi 6 point FIA camlock harness, custom billet one piece shifter, radio delete, and lowered rear end. I know I may be missing a few things here and there but that's what I have off the top of my head.  	40
 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; is it really hump day in Cleveland again?. I am going to do it SOBER!   I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you.  Today is what counts.     [This is the link to the post in the FAQ on What do Drinking Dreams Mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)  I wrote it after I exchanged emails with two of the country's leading dream researchers.     Welcome to your new millennium!   So usually, I save this link for the day that someone begins the journey, but I'm going to share [the link to the Baby Steps with you, tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2ree7a/hey_cc_im_newly_sober_what_do_i_do_next_the_baby/) because you asked for advice.  The Baby Steps post is the advice that I got when I started my sober journey and I've shared it thousands of times with newcomers to r/stopdrinking, and now with you too.  Good luck.   We all do this; when certain sober promises kick-in you will feel yourself pause and go: Oh, yeah, it's only Tuesday, that's not on my plate for today.     ; )      Congratulations on your anniversary; an invite to join us on /r/dinos will follow in your inbox.      That's what I did--lot's of them and sober activities.  But another thing that was helpful to me is the [Daily Check-in on r/stopdrinking.](http://is.gd/afsucks)      Early sobriety can be an emotional roller coaster.  In early sobriety I was dealing with lots of heavy weather including coming to grips with being criminally prosecuted over unfiled and unpaid taxes and losing my professional license and career.  I was psychologically miserable, but I got counseling, dove back into AA and I got through it all, one day at a time.  Today, my sobriety is my most valuable asset.   Good work, /u/jdee1 -- we carry the message we don't carry the alcoholic.    Nice!    I went to AA meetings and I didn't drink.  Trust me, I had a very tough first year after returning from relapse.  But it was worth it and it got better.   In the early days of sobriety all I had to stay focused on was not drinking and going to bed sober.  That in and of itself suffices for a real victory.  Baby yourself through these rocky first two weeks, and I promise it will all be worth it.  Already, you know if you don't pick up the next drink you NEVER have to go through the first four days again.               I doubt it.  He hugged O.   It's breathtaking.

Welcome /u/TheEyeDontLie -- you sound like a [Country Song.](https://youtu.be/-Qu8RPvhP-U)  Bear in mind, that we can wallow in the sadness and tragedy of the past until we don't anymore because we choose not to; or, we finally drink ourselves to death.

[I changed the historical record by doing the things I describe at the Baby Steps link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.   [Nature Boy](https://youtu.be/Iq0XJCJ1Srw)   CC says, this is a really great post and a fine illustration of what AA's call "emotional sobriety."     For a relapser, your username shows up in my browser with beau coup upvotes which means you know how to do this whole deal and at some point had some good insights.  Like me, I guess when I came back from relapse in 2009--I had to go back to the very beginning and not miss any of the basics.    Congratulations, /u/Giasone_3 on your 1-Year anniversary!  I see where Slip has already invited you to join us on r/dinos--you are a role model, my friend.   Remarkable for the Court's analysis of the "snitch's" cooperation.

That's a real ACTION step.     Good for you.  45 days or so I'll add you to r/dinos.                 Welcome /u/newagain62015--I like to share the [Baby Steps with as many an SD newcomer as I see](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) hoping that the things that helped me stop drinking and get sober helps others.  Good luck to you.   I face the things I'm afraid of by remembering one important fact: all I have to do TODAY--for today to be successful--is to go to bed SOBER.  I do this by practicing the things I describe at this [link which goes to a post called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I hope something there will give you some ideas for your next steps on your journey.  Good luck and welcome.               Understandable.  Don't fool around with a serious medical situation.   All of this makes sense, but you need to ask the questions of a licensed medical professional not well-intentioned and supportive strangers on the internet.  Please go see a doctor.   Don't forget Kasich, who called a Highway Patrol trooper a jerk in public remarks for pulling him over for speeding.       Good for you.  I know a lot of people in the service industry who stay sober.  Guess how I know them?  AA meetings.         That's a big step forward. Now build on the gain and you might be on your way.   As a side note: I'm reading Tim Weiner's (famous for the CIA history, Legacy of Ashes) new book on Nixon.  Admiral John McCain turns out to be one of the real villains of the Viet Nam War.      No enemy get's free rent in my head.         McCain BECAME a war hero in my eyes when he refused early release in favor of fellow captives.                  Sitting IN my emotions has proved to be pretty much a waste of time.  What I needed to do was move my feet.  While AA meetings might not be the answer for everyone, for me AA proved to be a place where action and progress was supported and reinforced.           I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; another beautiful Monday in Cleveland.   Super smart insight.    took out the recycling and felt no shame because the empty bottles/cans weren't mine.  I remember being new in AA years ago and listening to fellow AAs talk about their "Supply Problem" with getting and hiding bottles.  I thought, sheesh, I have a disposal problem.  I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one ; )   Notice that in recovery we make a distinction between Joy and Happiness.  We are promised Freedom, Joy and Happiness as a byproduct of working a recovery program, for a reason.        Great, great...keep updating us.   Next /u/1literCC I will be adding my friend to the /r/dinos sub.   Great work!   I  don't drink no matter what happens good or bad.     I like it.  For me it's easiest when I make my daily commitment the moment I wake up.   This is a longtime African-American neighborhood, close to University Circle but really not part of that neighborhood.   Good work.  It gets better.   Good work, my friend, keep doing what you are doing.      One of the things that you will see me say on /r/stopdrinking (in fact I say it so often that it is occasionally used as a tagline in the daily check-in) my decision not to drink TODAY, only--is not dependent upon what others do or don't do.  I make the decision not to drink TODAY, and I doggedly persist in that commitment to myself.  I am not at fault for "getting" my "disease" of alcoholism, but I am responsible for the treatment.   Some profound ideas, there, /u/Choices63 -- thank you for sharing the wisdom.            Yes, this is an epiphany!  I VALUE sobriety.   Welcome /u/tannis21 to /r/stopdrinking; my [standard advice is at this link to a post known as the Baby Steps,](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) its actually the advice someone else gave me when I started and things I've picked up along the way.  Let me be clear--nothing in my relationships, no drama, nothing was more important than staying SOBER today.  In time, all things worked out.   Welcome /u/bugger_off to r/stopdrinking.  Since you've been lurking you've probably come across [this link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) but it's not such a bad place to start stopping.  Good luck to you.   Welcome back, /u/yowzees.     This is ACTION and remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) holds that we act our way into better thinking, we don't think our way into better acting.   The great insight that I had about cravings is that it is an emotion just like anger, joy, jealousy, sadness.  In our case a craving is a powerful desire for alcohol and like all emotions it is fleeting.  Generally speaking time heals everything--including cravings.  One other thing, I was able to move along the healing considerably when I recognized that I am ex-drinker and therefore I no longer process that emotion.   That's just great!  I know for me, I got to 400 days from 200 days by focusing each day on the 24 ahead.   The problem with booze as a medication for what ailed me, I could never get the dosage right.   Congratulations, /u/the0riginalp0ster -- so why no outside support?     That very idea struck me this morning as I was reading about this.      Yeah, I'm grieving just for this reason, LOL.            No one on /r/stopdrinking is interested in converting drinkers into non-drinkers.  Nor am I concerned with convincing anyone that they should QUIT drinking which to my way of thinking implies permanency.  What I am suggesting is a path to stopping drinking, TODAY and today, only.  Sometimes sustained time sober changes our entire outlook on our relationship with alcohol.  That's how it worked for me.   Hey, /u/sugarfreehowl -- YOU ARE NOT A MISTAKE.  How do you know this?  We just told you so.    When a person judges another person.  There is the pointing finger, and then there are the three fingers curled back pointing at the person pointing.  In other words, we judge those who we see as most like ourselves.  There is a saying in AA that is right-on:  You spot, you got it.  Oh, one other thing, I strive mightily in recovery to never give free rent in my head to those I resent, and I try to not resent.   OK, /u/benqb1 -- I'm not drinking in solidarity with you, also check out the [Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) for some other effective "next steps" and see if any of that resonates for you.  Best of luck to you.   Welcome /u/Discarnated--why not check-in again totally SOBER?  In the interim [try the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  A lot of us on /r/stopdrinking started there.  Good luck.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Sunday SOBER all day on the north coast.   No, expressly not.  The Big Book speaks highly of the value of physicians and mental health professionals and encourages us to avail ourselves of those resources.   He saves that whole gutter-wallow for his attacks on the President of the United States.      Change often comes when you go all-in.     I have gone cold turkey in my life from daily drinking to zero--twice.  Both times, I was depressed, I suffered severe withdrawal including audio hallucinations, and panic attacks.  I slept fitfully for a few days and then I was fine.  Each of us is different, physically, mentally and I would highly suggest talking honestly to a licensed medical provider.   Good.  My sobriety is my most valuable possession.  It is not something that I will give up for any reason.  It is the key to any hope I have to live a free, happy and joyous life.   I hope you submit this to the Saturday Share link.     That's great news!  Keep doing what you're doing and before you know it I will be adding you to r/DINOs.   [Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) are the way I found the "next steps" to getting sober and staying sober.   Pretty cool, this.   1. I am grateful for hot summery weather in Cleveland;  2. I am grateful that my spousal unit did the grocery shopping without me and all I had to do was unload the car; and,  3. I am totally grateful for my friends on /r/stopdrinking and in AA.   Well-done, my friend, Mouse.   Congratulations, /u/aanon_18901--glad you found us.  I just added you to r/dinos, so check your inbox.   When the student is ready, the teacher appears.  It sounds to me like you are ready.  Congratulations.   Those things that loom a week, a few weeks away--are not in my movie TODAY.  Today, I am not going to drink and I'm going to live this day to the fullest.   Brilliant!                   This was [my Roots music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5agslFnwBQ)  :D   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping hot Saturday in Cleveland, sober all day.  Thank you /u/MessedUpMakeup for another super week of service on the Daily Check-in.  YaY, /u/teddypeep for stepping up.   I remember when you were just a penguin pup.  Congratulations, my friend.      Alcohol is a chemical depressant.  What worked for me even when I came back from 7 years in the Hell of Relapse was the [Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)   Beautiful and touching post.  I was the king of false pride and pretend courage.  I guess what I'm saying was that the precursor to honesty for me wasn't so much courage as a whole lot of exhaustion and a tiny bit of willingness to admit that everything I felt, everything I thought might, possibly, could be...wrong.  With that openness to the possibility that I was living a lie--everything changed.  Great track.  Here's one [Live Forever](https://youtu.be/aeJ4kp1AwY4)   I'm impressed!     I strongly suspect that my alcoholism was related to, caused, or significantmy aggravated my psychological disorders.  When I stopped drinking and got SOBER in addition to AA meetings I went to see my shrink.  That was great too.  AA encourages this explicitly in the Big Book.  But the most important thing for me is that self knowledge alone did not get me or keep me SOBER.  My participation in a recovery fellowship made all the difference.            In the FAQ (on the sidebar) there is this [link which attempts to set some of this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/36cgmh/faq_timelines/)  Can I add as someone who has some time in sobriety including a prior 15 year continuous stretch of sobriety, that I would take all of this as very generic and only slightly relevant to your potential experience.  While we can all generally talk about withdrawal, breakthroughs, insights, recovery--because of who we are individually and genetically each of us may have different experiences.  Factor in the quality of individual effort at recovery and you have a whole other factor to consider.   Good luck to you--as a general rule: what effort you put in, is what you get out.  Remember the [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) say we act our way into better thinking.   Why is this off topic?

It's a super common experience based on my own experience and reading the posts on /r/stopdrinking for several years now.  Here's my [post on the meaning of drinking dreams after I exchanged emails with leading dream researchers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)                  Welcome /u/happytobesober to /r/stopdrinking.  Since you're new I'll share the [link to the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and stay stopped.  It also serves as sort of "what do I do next" post.  Good luck and I look forward to seeing your posts and comments.   Newf's rule (and drool.)   I think the distinction may have more to do with the traditional approaches to recovery--the 12 Step, AA model of recovery was based on a "singleness of purpose" which is to recover from alcoholism, BECAUSE prior recovery models: the WCTU, the Oxford Group, the Washingtonians all failed with multiple goals, issues, and ambitions.  AA officially declared we will deal with alcoholism and alcoholics ONLY.  This has changed considerably over the years but in my nearly 30 years in AA I've seen actual hostility to drug addicts and arguments about the appropriateness of mentioning drugs of any sort in an AA meetings.  Although no less a dualy-addicted recovering alcoholic by the name of Dr. Bob Smith (AA's co-fonder) discusses both issues in his famous "personal story" that begins the second section of AA's Big Book.    By the way, not to argue with JBH,  alcohol was wholly illegal (Prohibition) when the modern recovery movement was founded in 1935.  So, embedded in our thinking (and the marketing of recovery by treatment centers) is the idea that addictions ARE different from alcoholism.  Whether this duality has a scientific basis or not, I have no opinion.  Still he distinction probably has more to do with the historical duality that is a legacy of the success and failure of recovery movements.  One other point: AA has dramatically de-emphasized the "singleness of purpose" observation and even traditional AA strongholds around Cleveland and Akron where I am active easily  embrace participation by both alcoholics and addicts.   Congratulations, /u/n8saces.        Exactly!   In the past I describe going through what you are describing, here.  Fortunately I had more time sober so when I looked up and saw my Dewar's Scotch billboard that previously called my name, I just laughed and said--almost out loud--that has NOTHING to do with me, I'm an ex-drinker.   Hey double-D here's [a pic of my Saharid Club where I resumed my AA participation in 2009.](http://imgur.com/2uYPzpX)  As you can see it's not as lovely are your venue.  A wood clad, concrete block building over a service garage owned by Indian-Americans.                 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; TGIF all over SD world, especially Cleveland.   This is what I would be concerned with.     Huge step, congrats!   /r/dinos is the super secret private sub for SDers with a year or more sobriety.     I envy you your week off.    Here's how I do vacations: I wake up and decide that I am not going to drink TODAY, only.  I usually hit a day time AA meeting and then I go for a long bike ride.  Sometimes I'll hit an early evening meeting too.  If there are any AA activities, dances, golf outings, etc. I might do those events too.  I hang out in coffee houses and I go to movies.  Have fun.  Then the next day, I do it all over again.     Have you read through the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Many of us, including me--were able to get traction with the simple actions described there.   Welcome /u/dr_eleanorabernathy to r/stopdrinking.  Thank you for the introduction.  Let me share with you the [link to the Baby Steps post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  I'm told the ideas there are helpful and "next" steps to doing this whole sober journey.  One other thing, "rock bottom" in my experience is not a place, it's a metaphor.  When we have had enough, when alcohol is no longer fun, that's rock bottom.  Oh, sure we could keep digging, or in my case drilling--but it doesn't change the fact that I hit rock bottom.  Good luck and I hope you keep posting and updating as you go along.   Yikes!  I am so sorry.  Take it easy and keep updating us so we can send out the positive vibes.   So what else are you doing /u/razmataz_90 besides not drinking and some diet improvements to recover from the alcohol abuse that put you in the hospital with pancreatitis?  AA meetings, IOP, counseling  I would think that people are asking these questions because THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.    When I was in early recovery my family and friends asked because they love me and were pulling for me to fully recover.  I had to stop being a resentful, selfish prick and learn to accept the support that came my way.  Even if it's just a question about my course and treatment, it is caring--and the least that I can do is be grateful and by sober actions show that change is REAL.     Thank you so much for this great post.  You are living the whole new way of life.   And an invite to join us on /r/dinos will follow in your inbox.  	200
             145m   Tried for hayfever and an arm injury. Neither worked (I didn't think it would).             10?   American History X   BBC and The Economist   By pointing out the spelling error in the title...?         Ah, I see. Yes.    Arguably there is stronger separation in the US. You have an executive and legislative branch, whereas our executive is made up of the legislature - so essentially a powerful Prime Minister has ability to change anything (the UK system is sometimes described as a elected dictatorship).    What?!  Liberal Democrats = 2.4 million votes = 8 seats  Greens = 1.2 million votes = 1 seat  Liberal = 4,000 votes = 0 seats    She has Corgis to do that for her   The Conservatives have a majority.   In 2010, the UK had its first and only post-war coalition, when the Liberal Democrats (57 seats) went into coalition with the Conservatives (306 seats). Labour and Conservatives together still accounted for 564 of the total seats.       Firstly, since 1945 there are only two parties with any chance of winning - Labour and Conservatives (for many years prior to 1945 it was similar, except the Liberal party instead of Labour). So in that way, it would be a two-party system.  Because of First-past-the-post (FPTP) and the Spoiler Effect (a bit) the two main parties stitched up over 550 of the 650 seats in every election since1945.   2005 marked the early rise of the Liberal Democrats, gaining around 60 seats in both 2005 and 2010. They avoided the spoiler effect by chasing local issue votes, anti-war votes, and Liberal votes (e.g. against internet snooping, holding suspects without trial etc).   What, I believe, 2010 did, was galvanise 3rd parties - they all thought they could do what the Lib Dems did.   In Scotland, the Spoiler Effect essentially destroyed the Lib Dem. Conservative, Labour vote - who were all seen as very similar compared with the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) resulting in an almost complete wipeout for the traditional parties in Scotland.   Plaid Cymru fight issue politics for seats in Wales. Northern Ireland has always had its own parties. We still have a two party-dominated system - perhaps more so now that the SNP (who have a maximum possibility of the 59 Scottish seats) are the third party, and perhaps even more now that the Liberal Democrat vote has collapsed (from 56 to 8 seats) and spread the protest vote 3 ways (I hope the Liberal-side of their vote returns, but it won't be fast).

Of all animal research in Canada, 7.8% is regulatory testing, of which a small part might be cosmetic tests http://www.ccac.ca/Documents/Publications/Statistics/CCAC_Animal_Use_Statistics_2011.pdf      I'm British so I'd have to get out pesos or USD   Heading to Colombia for 3 weeks. Starting in Bogota, then to Cartegena, after that I don't know. I would like to do some climbing at some point. Anywhere I should go. And what currency is best to have?   Ah the youth of yesterday!         So my friend, Antonio, was found short of money after his big trading deal seemed to go south. Problem was he and I had made a deal with a loan-shark called Shylock who was demanding a pound of his flesh as the insurance cost for a loan.   I was there at the trial, we had the money, but the loan-shark demanded his pound of flesh. Anyway, the day was saved by a lawyer's assistant called Balthazar, except that I didn't realise that it was in fact my wife in disguise! She managed to save Antonio but at the end, while in disguise, she demanded my wedding ring as a tribute for her service in saving my friend.  Anyway, it was a bit of a trick as when I arrived home she castigated me for giving away my wedding ring. I tried to explain but she was furious. Eventually she admitted the truth, that she was Balthazar.   We don't like to talk about it. And that is what really happened.   "Wait, so I've been busy fighting in the 'War to end all wars' and you went and had another one 20 odd years later!?"   Her parents were disappointed she didn't have A's   Everything's going to be just fine...      We definitely do have strict guidelines - in fact it was the guidelines which protect animal welfare (EU Directive 2010/63) that the ECI petition wanted to remove   Good decisions come from experience; experience comes from bad decisions   ?

Stand up and publicly explain why animal research is important.   In 2006, when I was a student at Oxford, UK, extremists were putting bombs in college buildings and declaring students "legitimate targets". A small group of us organised a counter-rally to a national animal rights demonstration despite many people saying it was madness.   In the end almost 1,000 students and scientists marched through the streets in support of biomedical research while only around 400 animal rights activists turned up for their demo (at the same time). More info on it: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/25/animalwelfare.highereducation  I have helped organise similar demonstrations in Milan, Italy and Los Angeles, USA.          I thought this would be a story about a man who owned a spoon company      I only wish my students were as eloquent when I was teaching   Looking at the Directive: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32010L0063 from=EN  The following is NOT a licensed procedure (therefore not in the stats):  "practices not likely to cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm equivalent to, or higher than, that caused by the introduction of a needle in accordance with good veterinary practice" or "practices undertaken for the purposes of recognised animal husbandry"  So measuring and weighing wouldn't. Chipping might.   I *think* Celphalapods are included (octopuses and cuttlefish; though I'mn not sure any are actually used), but you are right that nearly all invertebrates are not included. I do not know of a country where they count them (the main ones being fruit flies and nematode worms)                   Thanks      An electricity pylon   Surely however you use it as you intend to use it. If you were using it any other way then that would be your intention.

Animal trials ensure that very dangerous drugs don't get to Stage I clinical trials. Something they have a great track record for.   Then there is the development of the drugs, which relies on understanding of both disease and physiology, gained in large parts from animal studies.    This claim is very misleading, since scientists were mislead not by the fact that they were using animals, monkeys develop polio infection the same way humans do, but by their own belief that polio was spread through the nasal passages, whereas the main route of infection is through the gut.  Scientists working on polio in monkeys up to the late 1940s had found out a lot about the polio virus but theyre were seriously hampered by the fact that it was thought that polio could not be grown outside a living organism due to the failure of repeated attempts to grow it in cell culture. This failure also made it extremely difficult to obtain the quantities of virus necessary for vaccine research. John Enders breakthrough discovery that polio could be grown in tissue culture enabled scientists to grow large amounts of many different strains of polio in tissue culture which could then be assessed for their potential as vaccines. What anti-vivisectionists dont point out is that Enders relied on testing in monkeys to verify that the virus was indeed growing and to examine the pathogenicity of different strains (1,2). Enders studies also indicated that polio could grow in a variety of tissues, not just nerve tissue as had previously been assumed, and this led Albert Sabine to study in monkeys whether infection could occur via the gut.  Jonas Salk quickly used Enders technique to develop the killed polio virus vaccine Salk vaccine, which he tested successfully in monkeys before deciding to take it to human trials (3).  In the end research with monkeys was vital to gaining a correct understanding of the biology of the polio virus. Using monkeys David Bodian demonstrated that the polio virus entered the body through the digestive system, and not through the lungs as had previously been thought, a finding that was key to the development of an oral vaccine. Albert Sabin tested many different strains of attenuated polio virus in hundreds of monkeys and scores of chimps before identifying attenuated strains that were capable of efficiently entering the body through the digestive system and provoking an adequate immune response to protect against the different pathogenic strains of polio while not causing the disease themselves. These were the strains that subsequently proved successfully in human trials. Sabin could not have made this advance without the use of monkeys and in a scientific paper  discussing his research (4) wrote:  "approximately 9,000 monkeys, 150 chimpanzees and 133 human volunteers have been used thus far in the quantitative studies of various characteristics of different strains of polio virus. [These studies] were necessary to solve many problems before an oral polio vaccine could become a reality."  The true story is that before the discovery of John Enders, scientists using monkeys to study polio were making slow progress, after his discovery scientists using monkeys (and a few chimps) were able to make very rapid progress.  From the initial 1908 discovery through research on monkeys by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper that polio was caused by a virus (5) to the development of the oral polio vaccine it is clear that animal research played a vital role in every major advance.

 I get that.  Your reply is irrelevant to my comment, which was asking for a source on the specific claim made.         You could try sleeping all day for awhile.  Perhaps you need the rest.   I didn't realize they could get the half-life of caffeine in my blood from a saliva sample.  That's incredible^TM!  **The Power of SCIENCE**   I believe so.  A revealing passage from about midway into the exchange, Harris writing:  On the topic of there being a moral equivalence between al-Shifa and 9/11, Im afraid that what you have written is hard to understand. Despite your insistence that you drew no moral equivalence whatsoever between the two cases, you call Clintons actions an atrocity the consequences of which were vastly more severe than if the same had been done to the U.S., and you say that any comparison with the consequences of 9/11 is, if anything, an understatement.   This topic had gone back and forth a few times by this point, and Chomsky's meaning was quite clear before the conversation even began.  From Chomsky's book 9/11, quoted very early in the conversation:  I mentioned that the **toll** of the horrendous crime of 9-11, committed with wickedness and awesome cruelty (quoting Robert Fisk), may be comparable to the **consequences** of Clintons bombing of the Al-Shifa plant in August 1998.  (emphasis mine)  Throughout the conversation, Harris fails to distinguish between descriptions of the consequences of an action and claims about the ethical status of that action.  This is the kind of thing a philosophy student typically learns to do *before* they've even taken a course in ethics, in their Intro to Philosophy course or its equivalent.  He either has not acquired the basic thinking tools necessary to succeed in philosophical discourse, or he is trolling incredibly hard.  Either way, I see little reason to devote much thought to what he has to say about any topic that requires philosophical rigor.    Sam Harris disproved Eastern philosophy and Wittgenstein *years* before he disproved analytic philosophy.   One reasonably strong objection that I haven't seen raised in this thread is to consider the well-being of others.  Taking the Odysseus example:  Suppose that staying on the island in a drug-induced stupor *is* in fact the best way for Odysseus and his companions to maximize their utility (i.e. hedonism would work for them in a utilitarian ethic), and suppose that utilitarianism is correct.  Surely if they left their wives, children, and communities back home to grow old and die without them, that would result in great suffering for their loved ones.  Imagine if news reached home to their families that they had chosen to hang out on an island getting stoned forever instead of coming home - or perhaps as bad, imagine if they never heard a word of news at all?  Assuming these fellows have any personal ties, it seems that if by going home they can secure at least a moderately good life for everyone involved, this would maximize utility across the whole group.  Does this have any relevance for real-world ethics?  Perhaps not, if there is reason to believe that most people can be successful hedonists; but it seems to me that many of the arguments *for* hedonism presented in this thread are weakened when the focus is broadened beyond isolated individuals.  Think about it: is a hedonistic *society* really going to maximize utility?   jajajaja   Can you link to your source?  If such a wide range in rate were common, it would be quite a surprise.         You're assuming many things about how vegetarianism effects meat consumption, and why vegetarianism matters ethically, and so on.  First, though, the easy argument: vegetarianism already has a definition, and it clearly isn't your working definition.  Vegetarianism is defined as *not eating meat*.  That is an almost universally accepted meaning, and words get their meaning through consensus.  So you need a new word - what you're describing isn't vegetarianism.  That's boring though, because what you really want is to consider the ethics of your position.  So - you figure there is no ethical difference so long as you aren't supporting meat production (presumably the parts that hurt animals).  One reason this view is incorrect has to do with how vegetarianism spreads.  People generally become vegetarian because they discover a culture of vegetarianism and find it appealing.  Perhaps it's the culture they're born into (e.g. in parts of India); such people are raised vegetarian and historically have tended to remain so for life.  Others meet somebody who is vegetarian, are curious, and are inspired by this person's commitment to ethics and their empathy for the suffering of others.  Well, consider this situation where you're eating part of your friend's sandwich.  How inspiring is that?  Is your friend going to think, "Gee, maybe I should be a vegetarian, too - this vegetarian friend of mine really seems convinced that it's wrong to eat animals."  No, she won't think that.  She's more likely to think "Huh...vegetarias want to eat meat too.  Maybe they're not on to anything so great after all."  Ask any vegetarian who is a convert how they came to their decision, and see what they say.  Just about every one I've met had some contact with other vegetarians, and was gradually convinced of their point of view, and then felt disturbed by their own involvement in animal cruelty - which eventually led to them losing their taste for meat.  How will vegetarianism spread if all the vegetarians lack the ethical conviction not to hunger for a bite off someone's sandwich?  If you believe it's wrong to support animal cruelty by buying meat, then surely you believe you have a duty to not encourage others to buy meat.  Unless you believe that wishy-washy "vegetarians" who want bites of meat off others' sandwiches are going to be just as effective at spreading vegetarianism as truly convinced vegetarians who have lost their taste for meat out of disgust for its terrible origins, then you really can't ethically allow yourself to be a wishy-washy sandwich nibbler.   It really doesn't matter how big the sandwich is - if you don't eat that bite, somebody else will.  That somebody else will then be more satiated with meat than they would have been if you'd taken the bite instead.  So by taking a bite, you're adding one bite of meat to the world - it isn't a free bite.  Your argument might be able to justify eating *discarded* meat that nobody else would ever eat if you didn't.  But that's really the limit.  This may be somewhat similar to historical rules for begging monks in some Buddhist traditions, who could eat meat given to them out of charity, but only if the conditions satisfied a complex set of rules that ensured that the meat was otherwise waste.   Well...  You have high blood pressure.  Your post talks about a lot of things that probably have very little to do with your high blood pressure, but glosses over or ignores risk factors that are extremely well supported by scientific evidence.  It's unlikely that you're going to drop your blood pressure substantially with supplements, especially considering that you're already using several.  This is why I gave my advice below: to stop taking all the supplements and see what happens, and then reintroduce them to confirm the effect (if any). And more importantly, to address those risk factors that you can which are actually strongly supported by evidence - reduce stress, follow recommended exercise levels, reduce bodyweight if appropriate, reduce stimulant use if you use, etc.  My purpose in this comment thread, however, was simply to inquire about a mistaken research method - making causal attributions on the basis of self-testing without a blind.  You have no idea how much, if any, of that 10/5mmHg drop was from garlic, and you don't need to - it's a distraction from what you really ought to be focusing on if you want to address your high blood pressure.  You didn't get to 140/90 by not eating enough garlic or grapeseed extract. ;-)   Heh.  What distinguishes us from cave men is that we exist, while cave men are only a convenient fantasy invoked by people whose knowledge of human prehistory leaves much to be desired.   Look - it isn't pedantic to clarify when somebody has thoroughly misunderstood what you've said, and is putting words in your mouth.   *Ohhhhhh* that sick burn.. /s  HURR DURR GET OFF MAH INTERNETZ YOU DAMN INTUHLECTCHULLS         No, you did not.  I was seeking a specific answer about the relationship between two quite specific statements, and you gave an unsolicited and rather condescending refutation of a view that I have not expressed at all.    gaviscon  There is no reason to use it unless you suffer acid reflux.  Neutralizing your stomach acid won't prevent irritation by alcohols.  Mixing them pure in a container until they solubilize and then blend the mixture with the desired amount of water would work?   Yes.  If you want to be careful about it, add water slowly and watch for cloudiness or a precipitate forming.  If either occurs, you've found out how much water you can add before one of your substances falls out of solution (and you can add a little PG or alcohol to bring it back in).  I wouldn't be so concerned about using a little ethanol to accomplish this instead of PG.  The amount you'd need to dissolve an active dose should be far below a threshold dose of ethanol.   :-/  You didn't address my inquiry - nor do you know anything in particular about does or doesn't rustle my jimmies.  My comment is consistent with a wide variety of affective states, many of which would leave my jimmies undisturbed.   Blood pressure naturally varies within the range you've described, due to a wide variety of factors.  Standing, sitting, moving, thinking about exciting or boring topics, and of course expectations (placebo) can all effect changes of the magnitude you describe.  Your own expectations, in particular, could easily explain a consistent self-experimental finding of any dietary factor influencing blood pressure within that range.  It really doesn't make sense to believe that you know the cause of the changes you've observed.     Garlic is probably the best of the bunch with a couple of raw cloves leading to a transient drop of ~10/5mmHg. 4-8 stalks of celery/day also might be good for ~5 but isn't consistent.  Where did you get this data?  Is this from you monitoring yourself?   Bad advice.  Don't take an experimental proprietary supplement because it helped some random stranger on the internet - you should make important decisions about your health, which could add or remove decades from your life, on the basis of strong evidence.   Go ahead, if it's what you really want.  You've obviously given it some thought, and who is anybody to tell you they know better about what you should do with your life?  But you might consider that person with no qualms about dying is in a position of power that is quite rare, which could be used to do great things.  Perhaps you don't care about doing great things, but from your comment it sounds like actually you do - you care a lot about what's happening in the world, and wish that it were different.  So maybe you should do something about it instead of just ending your life passively.    I'd drop everything you have reason to believe may be raising your blood pressure for a couple weeks, and see if it changed anything.  Then I'd add it all back again regardless of the result, and note the change from that (if any).  It's pretty difficult to figure out what's going on with self experiments like this, so I definitely wouldn't start by looking for minor effects that each of these things may have on their own.  You should also investigate the things that doctors talk about when you have high blood pressure (i.e. body weight, exercise, stimulant drugs, and stress).  Obviously you're aware of these things, but you haven't been explicit about them.  It's possible that you need to address one or more of those factors, and that you *can't* deal with this using nutrition and supplements.      First, they don't conflict directly, but the common wording is unfortunate.  Please explain why they don't conflict, in your view.  It seems to me that you're simply deflecting the question, instead of addressing the apparent contradiction.    * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people   * Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)  These two seem potentially quite problematic.  How are each of these terms defined?  Who decides what is in or out, and by what process?  Is that process transparent, and is there room for community input?  For example, some people see vehement disagreement in debate on a controversial subject as harassment, as in a Canadian legal case of harassment of Twitter that was in the news earlier this week.  That sort of definition would capture a great deal of content that I believe a majority of Redditors do not want censored.      The grammar in your second sentence was indeed quite poor.   I didn't even do that. :O   :'(         /u/duckmurderer      At least we are in agreement about one thing: OP needs to burn his house down.   She's on to you - it's only a matter of time before the police come.  You need to burn down your house immediately and flee to Belize.   Sure thing.  The online tripsit guide you linked is a much better document.  It offers clear, direct advice about what to do and what to avoid, and that advice seems likely to lead to positive results.  It does seem to suffer from an excessive negative emphasis, but then again, people don't come to online trip-sitting chat rooms because they're having a good experience - perhaps that emphasis is appropriate in this case.   I haven't seen any quality guides for trip-sitting in a general sense, though if you want to get substance-specific I believe there's some good material floating around for ecstasy users.  You might get some mileage out of this classic read on psychedelic use:  [Session Games People Play: A Manual for the Use of LSD](http://www.luminist.org/archives/session.htm)  It's not quite what you're looking for, but it does lay out many of the fundamental issues in facilitating fruitful psychedelic experiences in small groups.  Interestingly, much of the advice on trip-sitting I've seen online actually plays into one or more of the session-wasting "games" explicated in the article.   Not really a guide, though there is some useful information. But it seems to me that, if presented to an inexperienced user, that page would give a person all kinds of bad ideas.  For example, the page devotes excessive space and consideration to psychotic reactions (which are extremely rare), to active guidance (which is usually inappropriate and counterproductive), and to danger (which is practically non-existent in many cases, but widely misunderstood).   Turn off the computer and lights, lie down, and close your eyes.  It's no good trying to do *anything* during a 3rd plateau DXM experience; you'll only interfere with what's happening.  Don't worry - just lie down and drift away...            Well...yeah, that is ad hominem.  The only relevance your post has is to whatever claims of expertise OP made - but most of their post does not depend on any such claim.   /u/TEHNETS **ANGRY!!**   Someone's being a negative Nancy...   I think the idea is to vaporize, and that some cannabinoids are bronchodialators.  But you know, when I vaporize cannabis, I get fucking high.  I don't think inhalers do that....maybe that's the appeal.   I couldn't say - she's not my wife!  I didn't write the article.  But I imagine it may have something to do with the marijuana not being as effective a medicine for asthma as those inhalers...         Good point; it does seem like the author was sort of looking for a story on this topic, and found it in this.   Yeah...I'm willing to bet they've looked into that, and that they know more about her asthma triggers than we do.   I suppose that could be.  Sounds like one of the more interesting, if sadly dystopian, ways current politics could play out.      I've been vegetarian for about a decade, and nobody has ever yelled at me about it.  I've had plenty of conversations, though.  I generally deflect if it's around a meal, because people who eat meat seem to invariably get quite upset if they have to talk about the ethics of eating meat while eating.  Many people have pressed the issue over the years, though.  I find they shut up quick if I just tell them why I don't eat animals:  "I don't want to cause animals to be raised in inhumane conditions and then killed, just to satisfy my desire to eat their meat.  I'd rather eat something else."  Can't really argue with a person who's done nothing but share their feelings.      **Everybody deserves good acid! :D**   Don't you think it's a bit naive for you to offer a one-line solution to such a long-standing, complex problem?  Without any evidence, no less?  It's pretty easy to poke holes in, too.  Hey, what if all the foreign workers keep being prostitutes, but just drop out of the legal system!  Huh...now your solution sounds a lot like...prohibition!  Which, incidentally, I did not advocate for.   Yes - /u/uvvapp has failed to establish any clear means of distinguishing which cases of employment are bodily exploitation and which are not.  For example, what about construction workers in developing nations?  Or [these kids in India who tear apart ships?](https://youtu.be/qhIaEEW63Sc?t=3m42s)  Are they in, or out?  Why?   I disagree that regulation is always necessary, but I certainly resonate with your view that there are strong parallels in completely unrelated industries - prostitution isn't unique in its possession of a vulnerable workforce.  But of course, it is unique in other ways, just like whichever manual labor intensive industry you work in.  They each require some care.   I don't disagree, but then again, I also didn't say anything about the morality of prostitution...   No; I'm afraid it isn't that simple.  That's why we both wrote more than one short sentence each - your summary does not accurately reflect the conversation.   Did you watch the documentary?  It's about a country with legalized, very loosely regulated prostitution. :-/  If you believe that Germany's laws about prostitution are the *cause* of human trafficking and coercion of German prostitutes, I challenge you to give specific evidence to support that claim.   I don't think the exploitative aspect is any different in the way you've framed it.  But it is, I think, much more horrible for a sex worker than it is for most other workers.  Consider the interviews with the prostitutes that they included - those women seem obviously traumatized in a way most workers are not.  https://youtu.be/QUBQLPgQ2RA?t=5m25s  https://youtu.be/QUBQLPgQ2RA?t=8m20s  So while I agree that the *exploitation* isn't really any different from most other employment, I'm sympathetic to the view that prostitution may require strict regulation to protect the workers from the trauma of that line of work.  And there is some set of sex workers who are being exploited in further ways, such as human trafficking.  This is obviously not what you're talking about, but is another reason to call for intervention.   There is better evidence for the safety of occasional moderate to high doses of psychedelics than there is for regular low-dose use, simply because regular low-dose use is not common.  That said, there is little reason to expect neurotoxicity.  You're correct that their mechanism of action is quite different from those of amphetamine and MDMA, and that MDMA and amphetamine induced neurotoxicity is not evidence for psychedelic induced neurotoxicity.  Note that amphetamine is known to have the potential to induce lasting neurotoxicity in doses not much higher than those used therapeutically, and is strongly habit-forming and addictive.  LSD has neither of these marks against it, and is likely a safer bet if you can verify your supply and dosage.      hurr durr, get off mah internetz you goddam inteellec-chul   The real question is, is supporting a mildly socialist, with some damning imperialist tendencies more important than alienating international allies?  I don't believe that this *is* the real question, or even a genuine question. It's just a false dilemma; a cheap rhetorical device.  What international allies will be alienated if American anarchists offer qualified support and thoughtful criticism to Bernie Sanders?  Perhaps none!  If we behave reasonably and with tact, I doubt that any valuable ally would be lost - as such a person would surely recognize the strategic value of offering qualified support in order to make incremental political gains.   Fair enough; thank you for clarifying.   Like the clear argument so eloquently displayed above:  What the fuck is your problem? You actually have something relevant to say, or are you just here to be a troll?  Surely the speaker of this fine example of enlightened reason would never come off as an asshole!   Hey, no need to be such a dick.  You know what I had to say?  I had two sarcastic remarks about a pretentious and infantile quotation of a line from an old song by Tool.  Oh my god - somebody said something sarcastic and irreverent in the face of a profound quotation in /r/psychonaut - she must be an asshole, and we must downvote and attack her.  This absurdly childish and hateful reaction is evidence enough to me that my comment was relevant and substantive.   They're well worth a listen.   :/   Hey, no need to be a dick about it   Hey - no need to be a dick about it.   The Rothschild political cartoon is not what /u/wumsdi is addressing - it is the title quote.  Click the link - it contains a reasoned dissection of the origins of the title quote, which is not what it is presented to be.   As much as I appreciate the sentiment, this is not an appropriate way to seek political support.  Your post is essentially spam.   Enjoy your safe space, stoners   That isn't the point.  I don't have a problem with the video.  The point is that /u/GarrottedClown is advancing a plainly false view.   Huh...well, I guess that's one way to go about arguing a point. :/  The initial permission you're referencing in no way contradicts the permissionless innovation idea - after that (blanketed and unconstrained) permission was granted, there was no need for individuals to ask permission before implementing a new idea.  Anybody with $ could start a web-based business with almost no regulatory overhead.  That the internet developed out of ARPAnet, etc, is no contradiction to that.   Oh my god what is this band - it's so good, and I definitely haven't spent hours listening to them before like every other psychedelic enthusiast that came of age in the last 20 years. /s    Video is a depiction of what is actually happening. If your conscience is clear, these things shouldn't bother you.  That is just not right.  That video bothered the fuck out of me for reasons that have nothing to do with my own guilt (I have none, in this case).  It is disturbing to see horrible things happen, regardless of one's personal responsibility.   Whoah duuude....I'm like soooo high right now...   It depends on how strictly the law will apply.  Would any business with California customers have to get a license, or would it only apply to businesses with a physical presence in California?  If it is the former case, then we can expect a ton of businesses to simply deny service to California.   Depends on how you look at it.  You can't deny that there was a period of massive growth in the 1990s that had very little to do with military spending.   Anarchists have a long proud history of critiquing even socialism for its flaws, instead of jumping right in and supporting every revolution.  This is a false dichotomy, and has little relevance to the OP.  Anarchists can critique Bernie Sanders without actively alienating all his supporters.  They can even critique him and also support his run for president.  Thats a terrible way to look at things, and a very invalid comparison.  **Why?**  It seems like a fair comparison to me, and you haven't offered any specific reason why it is flawed.    Bernie Sanders is shifting the political debate in America to include a somewhat liberal perspective.  That's a good thing for anarchists, because it makes our ideas slightly more accessible to the mainstream, and closer to admission to mainstream political debate.  It's a gift.  If we ignore that gift, and even degrade it and alienate those who support these somewhat liberal ideas, then we are essentially behaving as though we believe anarchist society will come without any incremental political gains (or that we don't care whether anarchist society ever happens).  That is extremely naive, as I think OP has shown.  Even if revolution occurred without any prior liberalization, it is very difficult to imagine a way it could play out that would favor anarchism.  Anarchists would be outgunned and outnumbered by more militant groups with greater mass appeal in the current political climate.  So it seems to me that the alternative to seeking incremental change is to hope for a lucky win, and OP's metaphor seems pretty good.  ...  His Israel stance is obnoxious and needs to go. As an American its really easy for me to support this because the chances of finding any canidate that doesn't have their mouth around Israel's cock is slim to none. Sanders and his background in Israeli Kibutzim, and notorious attachment to Israel make my endorsement embarassing to any socialist who is not American.  It doesn't matter.  All viable American presidential candidates will serve the Israel lobby; there is no other option.  Typical liberal gun control stance. He's at least admitted its racialist, where most other libs don't do as much.  Again, it doesn't matter.  Any viable Democratic candidate will have the standard Democrat gun control stance.  If things like this make a candidate unacceptable, then there will simply never be an acceptable candidate.  If that is your approach to supporting politicians, then you have no possibility whatsoever to effect positive change through the political process.  That is a poor strategy in the current political climate, imo - sometimes a candidate is better for anarchism than another, despite failings such as those above.   You're welcome!  I've never seen l-theanine at reasonable prices in local stores, though it is often available at supplement stores where they exist.  But it's quite cheap and easy to obtain online; sites like Purebulk, Powdercity, and the ubiquitous Amazon   Ebay are all good sources.   The only active component is the caffeine, and perhaps the B-complex in some weak synergy with it.  The extra B12 is pure waste; it will do exactly nothing unless you are deficient, and if you are deficient, you should see a doctor and receive better treatment.  Regarding the caffeine...200mcg is a sub-threshold dose, so I assume you mean 200mg.  200mg of caffeine is a fairly normal dose for a tolerant user.  You should be concerned in the same way you would be when taking your 5hr energy drink, which I believe has the same dose of caffeine.  In other words: if you are healthy now, you should consider alternate approaches in the medium to long-term to avoid increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.  If you are already at risk for cardiovascular disease, you should probably stop using caffeine.  Since you seem to like supplements, you might be interested in l-theanine and its synergistic relationship with caffeine.  L-theanine is a cheap, amino-acid-like supplement that is found in green tea, which has a balancing effect when taken with caffeine.  It seems to reduce the negative side effects - such as anxiety and paradoxical distraction - which normally accompany caffeine in moderate to high doses.  But it doesn't reduce caffeine's stimulatory and cognitive enhancing effects.  A couple hundred mg of theanine could greatly improve your stack.   It is worth worrying about, but perhaps not in the exact way you're worrying about it.   Where are you getting these ideas about ideal ratios and so on?  Most clinical research I've seen is addressed to dosages, not to omega 3 / 6 ratios.  It probably makes more sense to follow a dosage guideline derived from research, such as you would find on a public health web site.   That isn't true.  You haven't even specified the dosage in each pill, nor the dietary intake of omega 6 - both of which vary dramatically.  A person who doesn't eat junk food, uses non-omega 6 heavy oils, and doesn't eat nut butters may well have a single-digit daily intake of omega 6.  Concentrated fish oil pills can easily contain half a gram of omega-3.  1-1 ratio isn't necessarily difficult to hit.  It also isn't necessarily desirable.   I guess Rand Paul has had enough small, limited federal government now that his eyes are on the prize.  Sigh...      You can't.  But since the mid-00's to present there has always been at least one dried, powdered, high potency plant source that drops right in to prevailing kitchen chemistry techniques available on ebay.  Probably Amazon as well.  So you only have to make one internet purchase to do this, that purchase is a tried and tested reasonably safe purchase, and you can probably do it with a prepaid nameless card.  Everything else you need is at the hardware store etc, as you already seem to know.      Congratulations.  Feels good to do what you know is right. :)   Eh, no need to be a dick about it.    I find it absolutely ridiculous to argue that a society that doesn't attend Lion's Club meetings or goes to NASCAR events is incapable of thinking for themselves.  I agree!  But the article never argued this point - it's entirely your own.   I know what you mean.  I think you've given a good example of how social media platforms can isolate people and undermine discussion.  But then again, this discussion would never have happened at all without Reddit, and the cost was very low; it also serves as a counter-example to the article's main point.   I disagree.  It's an infantile attempt to prove a point with a contrived white savior story that did not happen, and would be objectionable if it had.   Theoretically, yes.  But it would be worth looking into whether there is direct evidence for this before choosing it as a routine method of supplementing magnesium.  It's worth mentioning, as well, that magnesium citrate often produces diarrhea - which can disrupt the absorption of just about anything.    I don't agree with his objections to electronic images, however. Many of those people staring at their phones are interacting with other people, and not just consuming corporate entertainment. Also, electronic recordings, such as those of Eric Garner and Walter Scott, are extremely important to the mass movements of today.  I agree with this objections, but also recognize what you've said: those electronic images are not necessarily a bad thing.  I don't think the author would disagree with that - it's quite obvious, really.  I would like to have seen this article in a longer form, explicating a more nuanced view that differentiates between genuine political participation and social interaction via the internet, and all the other uses of internet that he bemoaned.    It is tempting to bemoan our isolation and claim young people are brainwashed or isolated, but I think the line between corporatist propaganda and socialization is blurry when most of my interactions with friends, family and colleagues are done on social media. Using those platforms does expose me to advertising, but I use an adblocker, so that's a moot point.   The author doesn't get into this at all, but I think he could have address this by discussing how the *structure* of social media has been shaped to produce some of the negative changes he's described in our society.  The content isn't handed down to you, but through it's structure the platform produces highly stereotyped content that seems to produce isolation, distraction, and a lack of genuine political and social participation.  This is something that has been written about at length by many others, but usually without invoking this broader sociopolitical context - what the author of this article discussed as corporate totalitarianism.  What do you think?  Are all those interactions on social media a contradiction to the author's point, or could they perhaps support it?   Hehe...somebody's feeling a bit defensive. :P  I honestly did not perceive any sense of blame in the article - I didn't take it as a moralistic piece.  Of course, the author expresses their belief that the current trajectory of our society is worrying, and should be averted.  But besides that claim, it seemed like a plainly *descriptive* article to me - the author explicates their view of a set of social processes, and what he believes to be their cause.  	108
 I'm gonna be honest and say that I don't really believe in ghosts, but  it'd be pretty awesome if something changed my mind.   Yep that's the site I've been looking at lol.

 I agree he's a moderate, which is something the GOP needs more of. He's not hugely sensationalist or anything, which is why he might not go far.

It then all resets the following week.  How do I budget when my income fluctuates like this?   Thanks for the post! Just signed up and threw in $16. First time investing and everything.

There was a good /r/askreddit thread about this a while ago. Some of the arguments may not be compelling to you, but they are not based of religion.   http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/29uo38/serious_redditors_against_gay_marriage_what_is/   Are there separate rooms for those meetings for worship? What are they like?   Christ is my teacher in how to live a better life.  I'm not sure, I question if I'm Christian or not every day!   Various things. Sometimes someone will share a thought prompt which usually comes from another Meeting. The prompt might be about world events, peace, the Earth, and so on. People may respond to it, if they feel moved to.  Otherwise, it can be things like asking us to "Hold Someone In the Light" (pray or think about) because said person is having trouble. Or it can be talking about the problems of the world or your life. One girl at my meeting shared the difficulties of being a Quaker at BYU (a school that's 97% Mormon).   Yes, many Friends are atheists, or deists (like myself). This is due to the fact that Quakerism has no creed, doctrine, or religious authority to dictate what one must believe in order to be a Friend. More so, unprogrammed meetings give a place of refugee to the spiritually lost, as there are no sermons to say what is truth and what is false. All there is is silence among your fellow Friends and the Spirit.    Yes! And it's always good.    We get this a lot. Not very. Both those groups are Christians and believe in the power of doctrine. They believe in the authority of Scripture. More so, they also have defined gender roles between men and women (such as women being asked to wear bonnets).  The difference here is that Quakers do not necessarily believe in the Bible (or even God for that matter), though many certainly do. It is simply not needed to have any sort of theological belief in order to be considered a Friend. And Quakers have long been egalitarians in regards to gender roles where men and women, due to the strong belief in equality before God, have shared the same responsibilities, as they do today.  There is, however, one strong point Friends and the Amish and Mennonites all share. All three groups attempt to live simple lives, both in their consumption of materials, and how they dress. Many Amish and Mennonites will wear plain dress (and some Quakers still do, though it is rare) in a testament to their faith and oath to a life of service to God and the spirit. Though Quakers generally do not wear plain dress anymore, during a Sunday service in a Quaker Meeting you will rarely see anyone dressed up fancifully, for the reasons stated before.    It's hard to be a pacifist at all times. If someone were to attack me out of the blue, human nature might kick in and it would be hard to resist temptation to fight back. That said, yes, many Friends are against self-defense.    Super jealous! How's the program?   I would have liked that too. I've only ever met liberals.    I don't think I can answer this question in a satisfying manner, but here's a video from Quaker Speak on the topic of communion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_x1hUeIZ_c    Ha, it's no problem. That's a very, very common assumption. At least you know now!   Though I don't wear plain dress, I do refuse to wear suits, ties, and other fanciful dress, as they distract from a life of service to others and to God.

Mostly either girls have asked me out first, or I've asked them out via OKC/Tinder. In total I'd say I've had about seven girlfriends, to give some perspective. So yeah, never did it face to face...until last week! It was super nerve racking. I could feel myself mentally exploding, but I did it! And she didn't exactly say no. Even she had, still would have felt good.       Check out some of the previous threads about this, there's a lot of them!  http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/search?q=hold+conversation+ restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all   Is be fine with it. I do the same thing.    Congrats on living another day.    Campus hearings aren't court hearings. They're not legal entities.    Apple juice, obv.   1) Seems childish  2) Of course humor is subjective, but it didn't seem funny to me  3) It doesn't seem tailored to the girl's profile.  So I'd say give it some work!   Spending extra time at work tonight to get more comfy on the phone.    Facebook. Now I don't post as much.    Volunteering with groups I like.    This guy named Dan. He's pretty cool.    Yes, it's a pretty big deal you find a way of communication to set up a second date. Unless your date is a mind reader.    You can only keep three books for the rest f time. Which do you keep?    Instead of asking for a specific job, I usually ask for guidance in finding a meaningful life. But no, I wouldn't say you're in the wrong.    That's a great idea and I wish you luck. Got my only tat two years ago and have been happy ever since!   That's a great response, thank you!    Have any of you read the CES letter? What did you think of it?   I dont even know the last time I saw escorts mentioned here.   Always good to see a fellow Friend :) What YM do you attend?     Today.   Don't marry a Protestant.    If you have a smartphone there are plenty of self timer apps that you can use. Just stand the phone up on something (table, books, etc).    What do you know about actual Quakers?  How'd you get the job?   Church activities. There are a lot    Perhaps not my faith, but I would die for my fellow Brethren and Sisters.   What have you got to lose? You're both looking for someone.     Hand holding is the way to my heart    I've done things a lot of guys my age haven't and I have passion for what I do   http://okcupid.com/profile/leftclickMyFace  Do it    Yup. Nothing ever wrong with initiative.    How are you not swooned?   I'll do the Quaker AMA, please   FYI, your link doesn't work.   It was good. Went to a dating class that was somewhat useful, and I got called to serve on the service committee of my church, so that's neat.    Yik Yak, Evernote, Bookbuddy   Got to hug my crush today. One step closer, yo.    They might mean flag day in America.    Should have contacted MTV to get on *Catfished*.    It's a compliment   I just want to add that I'm in Provo and attend YSA with a tattoo and have experienced no problems, which surprised me.    	114
          That's right. Today I went on for about 12 hours without being able to eat, due to unforeseen circumstances at my job. My fastings are usually 7-8 hours long, so this was pretty rough. When I got home, I had a simple meal with salmon, shrimps, added sugar-free oatmeal cooked with water, and some spinach and asparagus.   Best feeling ever! Going back to 6 years ago, the simple thought of not making that huge meal a large 2500 calorie meat lover pizza would have felt horrible.    You don't need to drink shakes. This cleanse thing is a marketing ploy. You just need to eat less calories, and to avoid foods that are highly caloric and not very filling (such as the ones rich in added sugar). Everything else is most likely unneeded BS.          Well, if you're talking about alcohol, that is debatable, but personally, I don't find that drinking alcohol is ever worth adding an extra 300 or more calories into my body, so I don't, and it doesn't keep me from having a social life either. But like I said, with planning, creativity and a bit of cooking skills, you can totally make food that is delicious and also fairly low in calories. At least I manage to do it. Maybe that's not possible for others, I'm not sure.    You've missed my point. Having a cheat meal involves eating something that you like. My point is that, with some small compromises, you can eat the stuff that you like without going above your caloric intake. This 'cheat meal vs strict eating' continuum is a false dichotomy invented by people who don't understand that eating things you like does not necessarily equal not being able to follow your caloric goals.             If you still think that after you've read my post, then we obviously disagree fundamentally.    As a guy, I would not be able to relate to that, obviously. I just want to emphasize the idea that this is what worked for me, and nothing grounded in any science. I'm not saying that you should change your caloric intake daily according to your weight, I'm merely saying that doing this had positive results for me.    This is purely anecdotal, but during those times of 'mysteriously higher weight' as I like to call it, I would just drop my caloric intake by 50-100 calories everyday until my weight would get back to what I perceived as normal based on my progression at that time. Then I would either re-increase if I found myself starving too much to my taste, or maintain that caloric intake until progression would halt again. It seemed to work.    **1. Removed all foods that were highly caloric and not very filling.**  I feel this is by far the biggest factor. When you're constantly on a caloric deficit, everything you eat becomes more important, every piece of food becomes 'precious' and you feel like you have to make the most of the food you eat. For me, the first things that went out the door were alcohol and foods rich in sugar. This had a nearly instant positive effect. After that, I learned to tailor my eating habits and food choices to my needs over time mostly in a trial-and-error fashion.   **2. Got myself rid of the whole 'cheat meal' mentality.**  There is no such thing as 'cheat meals' or the need to have a cheat meal to me. Because it's mainly about caloric intake, and with a bit of planning, cooking skills and creativity, you can make food that is healthy, tasty, filling and not insanely high in calories and added sugar. I can make a 670 calorie pizza with ham slices, low calorie cheese and homemade tomato sauce if I want one, or 520 calorie pancakes with a sugar free pancake mix and chocolate protein powder. In other words, I can still eat whatever I want, without ever going above my target caloric intake or stuffing my face off. There is no 'eating strict' or having 'cheat meals'. To me, this is merely a false dichotomy.   **3. Weighed myself every morning and adjusted my caloric intake to my weight of the day.**  Whenever I felt like my weight wasn't going down at a pace that I was satisfied with, I would lower my caloric intake slightly, by, for example, reducing every meal by 50 calories or so. This pretty much prevented me from ever plateau-ing. Inversely, if my fat loss seemed to be going well but I felt like I was starving at the end of the day, I would do the opposite.    **4. Never listened to what other people were saying about my physical appearance.**  Personally, if I had listened to others' nice comments, I would still be at 20% body fat and with very little visible muscle mass, which is incredibly far from my own goals. I realized that I was mostly doing this journey for myself, and that, therefore, the most important was how I felt when looking at myself in the mirror. Others giving me comments about my physical appearance change always felt nice and was always appreciated, but I never let it dictate how I felt about myself or the efforts that I was taking to reach my goals. I kept going at the same pace until I reached my goals, no matter what others were saying.   **5. Kept an open mind, and was always ready to make changes if I needed to.**  I never thought that what I was doing was the best way to do things, and I kept myself ready to make drastic changes if I ever needed to. Sometimes the hardest thing to do in life is admitting that what you're doing is not working and then moving on. However, I believe that the fact that most of what I do is rooted in my understanding of the current science behind nutrition prevents me from ever being stagnant. As the science evolved over the years, so did my eating habits, and I credit my scientific approach-induced flexibility to much of my success. I tried a lot of things that I know don't work today, and as soon as I would find out, I would stop doing that thing, but the one thing that never did stop is my body changing, and I believe this to be one of the main reasons for that.           The short answer to what you're saying that I would give is that you're partially right, but that the effects of sugar are complex, controversial and not fully understood yet. But definitely, too much sugar is harmful and not really necessary from a nutritional POV. You could go on for your entire life with very little consumption of sugar and still be healthy. That's why I personally don't eat added sugar and very little sugar altogether.    It's not just about increasing muscular tissue or physical appearance. The benefits of resistance training are countless, especially as you age, and perhaps even greater than those that you get from cardiovascular training, although this is debatable and both are undoubtedly important. Proper nutrition with a resistance training regimen helps maintain functional strength and muscular tissue mass as you age, both of which will otherwise slowly decrease mainly due to a decrease in natural production of testosterone and other hormones as humans grow older. It has a huge impact on overall quality of life. On the other hand, it's been shown that being on a caloric deficit has positive effects on metabolic health that go beyond just allowing you to reduce fat tissue, i.e., it's actually pretty healthy to be on a caloric deficit for extended periods of time.   Will you be in poor health if you just eat at TDEE level? No, not at all. But I personally believe that the health benefits of being on a 'bulk/cut' type dieting regimen are greater than just maintaining energy homeostatis all year long.    What about others placing themselves in front of your fishing spot so you can't click it?       This is complex and controversial, but in my opinion, you should not ever maintain. Eating at a caloric surplus allows you to increase muscular tissue and overall strength when combined with a resistance training regimen, and eating at a caloric deficit has been shown to be beneficial for overall health, and it allows you to get rid of the extra fat that you gain while being on a surplus. However, some studies show that a high carbohydrate, low protein diet has the same metabolic health benefits as being on a caloric deficit, so if I was maintaining, I would probably aim for a diet rich in carbohydrate foods.    This is something that I wrote on the AdvancedFitness subreddit, and I figured that I could share it here as well.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedFitness/comments/3d0gmi/you_should_cut_out_carbs_especially_sugar_from/  Basically, I explain the science behind why it's completely false that eating sugar alone can cause your body to store more fat via increased insulin production. I apologize if this is complex science, but my three arguments essentially boil down to this:  1) Insulin secretion is merely one of many mechanisms that can cause your body to store nutrients as fat.  2) All nutrients, not just carbohydrates, but also amino acids and fatty acids, can increase insulin secretion, but increased insulin secretion in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  3) Whether insulin secretion or any other physiological interaction with nutrients in your body causes increased fat storage depends almost entirely on how much you're eating, i.e, total daily energy expenditure.  Let me know if you have any questions, and I will try my best to answer. I'll be honest, I didn't use any sources to write this up; I study Biochemistry and Pharmacology, so this is kind of a sum up of many of the concepts that I've studied as well as my general understanding of the current science behind nutrition. However, I do have sources to provide in case you are interested in further reading on some of the ideas that I've shared here.                               You misunderstand. I said that the importance of physical activity has been overstated in the case of fat loss, not in general. Physical exercise is obviously important to maintain muscular strength and mass and cardiovascular ability, amongst other things. And laypeople might have a rough idea of what 'healthy' foods are, but they don't know how to stop themselves from eating the ones that they know aren't, and in my opinion that's the most important. It's not that uncommon knowledge that 'sweetened fat' foods are bad, yet people are eating them on a daily basis. The complexity of it all seems to go straight above a lot of people's heads.    http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(15)00146-4/fulltext  As we are progressing into the 21st century, we are also undergoing a societal shift in body weight perceptions: it seems that being overweight is now a lot more of a standard of normality than it used to be 30 years ago, according to this new study. At the same time, obesity is now officially recognized as the leading preventable cause of death in the developed world, and those supposedly in charge of our society are hailing it as 'one of the most serious societal issues of the 21st century'. Yet, the obesity rates keep going up, with some stats predicting that 70% of the world population will be overweight by 2020.  To me, there is only solution: we need to teach kids how to eat, or more specifically, how to eat less. And it starts in the educational system, mainly in schools. The food companies refuse to reduce the amounts of calories from fat and sugar in their products at the expense of palatability, and it cannot start in the family home, since most parents are ignorant of nutrition themselves, and you cannot pass down knowledge that you do not have to begin with.  We still have a long way to go before we have fully elucidated the interactions between humans' physiological mechanisms and their environment that are causing them to overeat and gain fat weight as a result, but one thing is for sure: you cannot outrun your bad eating habits. So let's drop the physical exercise BS, and we can start off by admitting that we are simply eating too much. It's not even about eating 'healthier'... Scientists are still arguing over what that even means, but in controlled lab experiments, reductions in total daily energy expenditure that result in fat loss are by far the greatest contributing factor to improvements in overweight and obese individuals' general health. So, in the case of people who suffer from obesity, the best food choices might very well be the ones that allow them to consistently eat less, regardless of what they are.  What do you guys think?       Well they contain small amounts of sugar, yes. But it represents less than 5% of my daily caloric intake on average. But yes for the most part I do mean added sugar.     I've stopped eating literally everything that contains sugar, including fruits. I get my vitamins   minerals primarily from vegetables now.  I know it's drastic and not necessarily needed for weight loss, but when I was eating sugar I felt like a slave of my own cravings, and I was miserable, feeling like my life depended on the satisfaction I would expect from those small windows of time where I was allowed to 'cheat', but they would never live up to my expectations and would always leave me frustrated. It felt like I was caught in a vicious loop.   For me, it's a huge accomplishment. My diet is mostly made up of lean meat (fish, chicken, seafood), oatmeal, walnuts, eggs, and dried beans and green vegetables (asparagus, spinach, lettuce, avocados, etc). And I feel much better. I can eat whatever I see as optimal for my health, because my sense of reward is not dependent on my dietary choices. I started my weight loss journey years before cutting sugar out completely, but I credit this drastic change for helping me go from 17-18% body fat to below 10% which is where I am and which was my end goal right from the start.   Obviously my body fat %age still goes up once in a while when I'm intentionally eating at a surplus in order to increase muscle mass, but overall this 500 day period feels like a huge milestone and I'm really happy.                   Your inherent lack of interest and comprehension is probably due to your life background as a layperson.          This is awesome! Thank you SO much for sharing this!    The science behind meal timing is complex and controversial, but the layman explanation is that meal timing is mostly irrelevant in the context of weight loss. You can eat whenever you want as long you respect your caloric intake for the day. The biggest predicting factor of success, by far, is finding an eating pattern that allows you to consistently respect the caloric intake you've given yourself as a daily goal. A lot of researchers currently believe that most of the short-term effects of meal timing on metabolism and subsequent tissue growth are ultimately mediated by cellular energy input in the longer run, meaning that, at the end of a twenty four hour period, it really doesn't matter how your body was affected by when and how much you ate as long you didn't overeat.    This is a simple tip that has helped tremendously in the past. Sometimes at night, when returning home after a day of work, I would be really tired and still hungry for food after my planned meal, despite having already reached my target caloric intake for the day.  What was the solution that I found for this? Simply going to sleep. If you're sleeping you're not hungry, and the faster you go to sleep, the faster you can get up in the morning to eat again! Give it a try if you don't believe me.  Edit : not saying this will work for you, but it did work for me; it's just a suggestion.     Thank you. These messages mean a lot to me. However, I suffer from a lot of guilt daily and am very ashamed of who I used to be, I wonder if it was the same for your fianc as well? The only upside is that it prevents me from ever deviating from my strict diet due to suffering from guilt immensely if I ever do so, but, even though my body is very healthy now, it's not the same psychologically. Guess we all have some things to work on in order to better ourselves.    Obesity is one of many metabolic diseases, but some of these diseases can be caused by other factors, like genetic abnormalities or environmental factors, of course. But generally, when people say metabolic syndrome, they refer to obesity and type 2 diabetes, the former (and possibly the latter as well) being primarily caused by continuous overeating.    No, metabolic diseases are the outcome of continuous overeating, not the act of doing so.    Thanks!   Yeah haha! Not gonna happen though. :)  And thank you.    Not in general, but where I come from, suffering from metabolic syndrome is quite shameful.    Ugh! So many exogenous factors to account for! Good luck :(    It's not really an achievement but this is the first 'newer' person in my life that I've told about it, and she didn't mind at all. I was scared of her reaction. It's the person I've ever told about it, only my parents and a few long time friends know about the person I used to be.          It's a question that I've been asking myself for a while, but for which I've been unable to find an answer by looking at the current research. It is my belief that whey-derived amino acids act like a 'double edged sword', due to their intimate relationship with metabolic hormones such as Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and  glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).   Whey-derived amino acids:  -Enhance insulin secretion, by increasing GLP-1- and GIP-induced production of entoendocrine cells;  -Increase cellular uptake rate of triglycerides in the adipocytes;   -Suppress production of adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, thereby further increasing entoendrocrine hormone activity.   Yet, entoendocrine hormones also mediate glucose-dependent insulin secretion by increasing the pancreatic production rate of the glucagon hormone, which has been shown to reduce the stored glycogen rate of conversion to glucose (thus reducing blood glucose level), and which has also been shown to increase postprandial satiety via upstream interactions in the brain-liver neural axis upon meal initiation.   However, I am unable to tell whether whey-derived amino acids actually mediate or increase glucose-dependent increases in insulin secretion and sensitivity, let alone to what extent.   I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts on the subject, or any good papers that would help me fill the gaps in my current (and most likely partially flawed) thinking.    The scientific paper referred to can be found here:  Multigenerational Undernutrition Increases Susceptibility to Obesity and Diabetes that Is Not Reversed after Dietary Recuperation  http://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(15)00275-2      This is sort of a follow up to this [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092544391400088X), in which they found that palmitic acid induces podocyte apoptosis via hyper-activation of the mTORC1 pathway at the lysosomal level.       This is a follow up to this [study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092544391400088X), in which they found that palmitic acid induces podocyte apoptosis via hyper-activation of the mTORC1 pathway at the lysosomal level.          Also, palmitic acid is the saturated fatty acid with the highest impact on the mTORC1 pathway. More info here:  [Fatty acids are novel nutrient factors to regulate mTORC1 lysosomal localization and apoptosis in podocytes](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092544391400088X)   Really well put together! Thank you for taking the time to write this up.    Well, the 'original' purely ketogenic diet was made for children with severe epilepsy, and not for fat loss. If such a diet allows one to reduce body weight, it only does so insofar as it also allows the person to consistently be at a daily caloric deficit, in my opinion. Also, interestingly enough, it's been shown that, in high endurance sport athletes who have switched to a purely ketogenic diet, fatty acid utilization while exercising is remarkably efficient, which means that these athletes might be able to use medium chain triglycerides in the same way that someone on a 'regular' diet would use fast-digesting carbohydrates.       Maybe, but definitely not in the context of fat loss. There is some research which suggests that insulin sensitivity is particularly accrued immediately following an intense physical effort, which has lead me to believe, for example, that high endurance athletes should consume complex carbohydrates most of the time, except immediately post-exercise. In general, though, I believe that, in the short run, fluctuations in insulin production are never going to be significant enough to make a noticeable difference unless you actually inject synthetic insulin into your system.    I agree, but in the research I've looked at, short term fluctuations in circulating levels of leptin are only affected by long monosaccharide chains, and not sugars or other nutrients. This is why it annoys me when people refer to refeed days as 'cheat days'. In my opinion, refeed days should be high in carbohydrates, moderate in proteins and low in fats, especially if the person is going above TDEE, since fat is always the first thing to be converted to triglycerides when there is an excess of nutrients.    **1) Virtually all nutrients can trigger physiological mechanisms that will result in nutrients ultimately being stored as fat.**  The 'system' in your body that is responsible for the proliferation of all tissue cells, including those of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, is a multi-protein complex known as *mechanistic target of ramapycin complex 1* (mTORC1). mTORC1 commands all the complex bioprocesses that eventually result in the creation of new tissue in the human body. Its good functioning depends on five things: a) cellular energy (ATP, glucose); b) growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1); c) the essential branched chain amino acid (BCAA) leucine; d) the amino acid glutamine, which works synergystically with leucine by ensuring mTORC1 pathway leucine uptake; e) satturated fatty acids.   So, as you can see, insulin is just one of five factors that can indirectly cause increased fat storage.   **2) Carbohydrate is merely one of many nutrients that can increase the pancreatic rate of insulin secretion.**  Carbohydrates are, by nature, insulinogenic, because pancreatic secretion of growth factors is directly glucose-dependent: when there is insufficient cellular energy to carry out a physiological process, which could be literally anything, be it an intracellular transfer, an extracellular transfer, or a contraction of any kind, the body responds by producing insulin, which will transport the nutrients until they reach the biochemical pathway that will ultimately result in the beginning of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, from which ATP is mainly produced.   Does that mean that insulin secretion is solely controlled by glucose inputs and outputs? No, not at all. In fact, amino acids, particularly the whey-derived ones, are also highly insulinogenic, and when you combine them with glucose or other short monosaccharide chains, you get foods that are at the top of the Insulinogenic Index, such as whole milk. One of the reasons for this is that whey-derived amino acids increase the production of metabolic hormones known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). The main function of GLP-1 and GIP is to induce insulin secretion and increase insulin sensitivity in a glucose-dependent manner. This is important, because it means, simply put, that the more glucose is present in the bloodstream, and the more insulin will be secreted thanks to these enteroendocrine hormones. However, their role is also to mediate the effects of glucose, by decreasing glucagon secretion (which in turn decreases the stored glycogen rate of conversion to glucose) and by increasing postpandrial satiety. In other words, carbohydrates are not very insulinogenic on their own, but even when they act in synergistic manner with amino acids, the insulinotropic effects of the latter are still being mediated by feedback mechanisms. In conclusion, carbohydrates are certainly not the only nutrient to increase insulin production, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  **3) Increased insulin secretion- and sensitivity-induced increases in adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides are mediated by cellular energy input**  This is by far the most important point. Insulin secretion, as well as the ingestion of any nutrient, can definitely result in increased fat storage. The mTORC1 pathway can and will cause nutrients to be stored as triglycerides in fat tissue, but whether it does or not depends almost exclusively on the amount of cellular energy available from nutrients at a given time. The mTORC1 pathway conversion of nutrients to adipocytes is comparatively inefficient, and unless given a unecessary large supply of energy, it will always convert them for other means instead. This is partly due to biomechanical reasons, but also because the production of fat cells beyond a certain point is actually viewed as harmful by the body; an increase in fat tissue also results in increased production of adipose-derived hormones, such as leptin, adiponectin and adipose tissue-specific secretory factor (ADSF). These hormones are needed in very small amounts for the body to function and can easily become harmful. For example, too much leptin, in the long run, creates a vicious circle of continuously and simultaneously increasing leptin and insulin resistances (which typically results in type 2 diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases); ADSF increases the production of low density lipoprotein cholesterols, which can cause heart disease; etc. In short, all the factors that cause tissue growth are cellular energy input-dependent, and thus, it's almost exclusively this factor that determines the type of growth you get, perhaps regardless of the metabolic effects of the other factors discussed.     **1) Virtually all nutrients can trigger physiological mechanisms that will result in nutrients ultimately being stored as fat.**  The 'system' in your body that is responsible for the proliferation of all tissue cells, including those of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, is a multi-protein complex known as *mechanistic target of ramapycin complex 1* (mTORC1). mTORC1 commands all the complex bioprocesses that eventually result in the creation of new tissue in the human body.

Interesting point. Thanks for sharing.    The problem with the GI is that it makes laypeople believe that only carbohydrates cause an increase an insulin secretion, which is far from true.    Probably. The increased insulin sensitivity is not due to waking up, but rather due to not eating for several hours, indeed.    Well, I don't think his advice is entirely wrong, but it is incredibly misguided and very ignorant. It's true that certain carbohydrate foods can lead to an increase in the adipose tissue cell proliferation rate, but only those which have a high insulinogenic index. And it's not just carbohydrates, it's also certain amino acids (particularly the whey-derived ones) and saturated fatty acids, that stimulate insulin secretion. Also, like I said, this net increase in glucose-dependent metabolic stimulation only matters insofar as it relates to how much energy your body has to work with. Ben Paluski missed out on two important things: 1) it's not just carbohydrate foods in particular that are highly insulinogenic; 2) increased insulin sensitivity is cellular energy input-mediated. Simply saying that you 'shouldn't eat carbs in the morning' is a very blatant misunderstanding of the actual biochemical principles of nutrition.    Well, there IS research suggesting that we are most insulin sensitive after a long period of fasting. This is important partly due to the impact of growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 on the mechanistic target of ramapycin (mTOR), which is an important regulator of cell proliferation in humans.   However, the multi-protein complex that encompasses mTOR controls tissue growth based on the neural input from basically five factors, one being, like I said, the upstream neural input of various growth factors, but also, the most important one by far being the availability of cellular energy (ATP, glucose) from nutrients, in my opinion. I don't think Ben Paluski really knows what he's talking about.    The rectus abdominis muscle is made up of eight flat tendons that run across its length and which are interconnected by collagen tissues. Unless he was somehow born with extra tendons, which is a genetic abnormality that I have personally never seen, this is an 8 pack, not a 10 one.      There is no such thing as a ten pack. There is the tranverse and rectus abdominis muscles, and the internal and external obliques.    My understanding is that long periods of fasting create a favorable environment for the synergistic metabolic effects of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 on skeletal muscle tissue. But like I said, there aren't too many in vivo studies that were done on human subjects.    I know a lot of research says it does, but it seems to be mostly in rodent subjects.   In your experience, is it true? I have done intermittent fasting quite a bit, but I haven't tried it while intentionally overeating.   Let's say you're on a daily caloric surplus for an extended period of time. Have you noticed that you seem to gain less adipose tissue while intermittent fasting than if you were overeating and eating in a more 'regular' pattern, that is, every 3-4 hours or so?  I'd like to hear the opinion of those who have tried intermittent fasting while intentionally overeating.    I know a lot of research says it does, but in your experience, is it true? I have done intermittent fasting quite a bit, but I haven't tried it while bulking.  Let's say you're on a caloric surplus. Have you noticed that you seem to gain less fat tissue while intermittent fasting than if you were bulking and eating normally, that is, every 3-4 hours or so?  I'd like to hear the opinion of those who have tried intermittent fasting while bulking.    When I was a kid, I was fat. And it's because I was ignorant: I had no idea how to eat, I didn't even know what a nutrient was. As I started gaining scientific knowledge, I lost the excess weight and my quality of life improved as a result.  The moral of this short story? People become overweight primarily because they are ignorant of nutritional science, and you don't eradicate ignorance with hatred and intolerance.  During the day, I work as an elementary school teacher, and I know by experience that, if you make kids shameful for giving the wrong answer, not only will they feel bad about themselves, which is a strong predictor of how they will continue to learn from there on, but they will also certainly not learn anything as a result. That's why, on the contrary, you not only encourage them, but also reassure them that there's nothing wrong with not knowing something. This way, they will actually learn what you're trying to teach and become better human beings as a result.   I believe that this way of seeing things applies not only to kids, but also to human beings in general. Punishment might work for some people: for example, I initially started learning about nutrition because I was tired of being put on by others because of my physical appearance. But for most people, it doesn't.   So, is it okay to look down on obesity as a state of being? Yes. Is it okay to blame society for not teaching people how to eat, for letting the food companies make money by abusing people's ignorance and at the expense of their own health? Yes. It is okay to blame our culture for generally encouraging over-consumption of highly caloric and sugar rich foods? Yes.  But what's NOT okay is to look down on the individual for being ignorant, for never having been taught by his/her entourage what he needed to know in order to not end up being the way he is right now. There is nothing good that comes out of blaming the person for being ignorant.   So, when I see a person in that state of being that I despise, the only thing I feel for them, if anything, is compassion, because I know that I was lucky enough to be able to pull myself out of my own ignorance, and that they weren't. And, more importantly, I feel the need to help them.  I believe that the most effective way of eradicating widespread ignorance is the transmission of knowledge. Knowing is meaningless if you are the only one who knows, and the institutions in charge of our society refuse to take care of the malnutrition issue that plagues our society, so I believe that it is our duty, as those who have escaped obesity, to take care of it. And the conditions for effective knowledge transmission are created by being caring and compassionate, not by being spiteful and acting like you see the overweight person as a lesser human being.                     I wish I would have changed my mindset about food sooner. At first I was still eating those crappy food products such as pizza, ice cream, candy, etc, because I kept telling myself that I could 'reward' myself for respecting my target caloric intake most of the time. This didn't work very well, because my life was basically revolving about those short windows of food rewarding that would always leave me disappointed and frustrated.  Eventually, I just learned to not see foods as rewards, and I started finding other ways of rewarding myself instead, and this way I stopped eating these food products altogether. Now I just eat for basic survival and to maintain muscle mass, and not to reward myself, and my diet is mainly made up of lean meat, low insulinogenic dairies, vegetables, complex carbohydrate foods (oatmeal, sweet potatoes) and healthy fats. And I feel much better about myself.     Nope, a lifter has to learn how to eat properly and reduce daily caloric intake.    I think it's problematic only because society in general is extremely ignorant when it comes to the biochemistry of nutrients, but I usually don't say this because I have no way of saying it without coming off as arrogant.    My obsession is not irrational, unlike what you seem to imply, because it's based on my current understanding on the biochemical principles behind the relationships between nutrition and the human body, and my eating habits change as new research is published and allows my understanding to evolve.    I study Human Nutrition, and I'm obsessed with physical appearance and general health due to being overweight as a kid and having self esteem issues because of it.  Due to that, I don't eat these things that a lot of people eat. I don't ever eat things like pizza, ice cream, candy, chips, etc. I am psychologically incapable of eating things that I don't see as nutritionally optimal, i.e richest in micro nutrients, with as little sugar as possible (unless I'm intentionally ingesting sugar after an intense physical effort), etc.  BUT I don't tell others, because I find that people judge me for it, or at least do not understand. I understand that not everyone wants to or can live this way, and that not everyone has spent years studying the science behind food and physiology, but we should be able to live how we please right? Yet, I often find people judging how I've chosen to live my life.  Can anyone relate?    Irrelevant.    Agree/disagree?    I mean, I don't believe every stat I see, but some of them say that 60%+ of U.S adults are overweight and that 30%+ are obese. Some stats also predict that 70% of the world population will be overweight by 2020. On the other hand, I sure haven't seen any stats about the rates going down.  This in spite of the fact of society's efforts to counter obesity, which has now been recognized by major governing bodies as one of the most important issues the world is facing in the 21st century, and which is now the leading preventable cause of death in the developed world.  Clearly, these efforts aren't working. People are still overeating. The obesity rates are still going up. People are still getting fatter and dying because of it. I know this is without a doubt an incredibly complex issue with environmental and cultural roots, but I'd be interested to hear what you guys and girls think, as people who either are or were actively losing weight at some point.       Very true. Art is lasting beauty! Cheers to you and the awesome changes you made my friend!   Awesome! Congratulations to you, and don't listen to the ignorance of the jealous who can only dream of having the determination to accomplish as much as you. These people aren't worth your time!   Sugar free oatmeal. Dried beans. Cooked lean chicken. Low sugar peanut butter. Collard greens. Etc.    For me, it was a really difficult and tedious process that took many years. Even when I started counting calories and eating better, my thought process was still 'Oh! I've lost 10 pounds, which means I can have a pizza and cake day!' or 'I just ran 10km, I can eat whatever I want tonight and it'll be fine'. And while my eating was healthier most of the time, on these days I would really lose it sometimes and eat way too much and way too many things that I knew I wasn't supposed to. But, even though it wasn't rational to do that, that's something that took me a while to realize. And after that, it took me even more time to actually start rewarding myself with things that were not food, like buying a nice piece of clothing, a new video game that I'd been looking forward to playing or doing something crazy awesome with some friends.  I think what partly made it possible for me to change is, I came to realize that food had no inherent value besides, at the most fundamental level, allowing you to survive. And that, maybe, just maybe, it wasn't meant to be used for anything else (besides for surviving and maintaining health) and that society had been wrong for teaching people to reward themselves with food. It seems our entire society revolves around that. When people want to go out and have a nice time, they eat. When people are stressed, bored or sad, they eat. When people want to watch a movie, they want to eat along. Hell, even funerals have 'comforting' foods where people eat their sadness away. Maybe it's part of the problem? I don't know for sure, but for me it most definitely was, and I had to experience a drastic shift in perception and thinking before I could stop being stuck in a vicious pattern of eating to feel better and being dependent on highly rewarding food products that were bad for my body in a lot of ways.    Don't wanna be the Devil's advocate, but if you maintain a strict diet caloric intake wise and don't over-eat certain micro nutrients and food additives (such as sodium and 0 calorie sweeteners), then your weight should either never go up at all or do so very little. It might not go down for a while, but it shouldn't go up too much unless you overeat. In the past I used to have 'bingy' days sometimes and on those days my weight would go up quite a bit (by like 5 lb), and I knew that it was always temporary and that it wouldn't affect my weight loss in the long run, but to me it was still a sign that I had been doing something wrong. Since I've kept myself from over-eating and maintained a strict diet, my weight has not always gone done, but it has never ever gone up.     Same diet as usual. Had oatmeal with egg whites and walnuts in the morning, salmon with sweet potatoes and kale at noon, and chicken with spinach and sweet potatoes at night. Stayed within my target caloric intake, didn't workout because it was a rest day for me. I went bowling with a bunch of friends and had a great time. It was an awesome day! :)    You don't need to exercise in order to lose weight. It might help, but exercising is mainly to improve cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength and mass (both of which are also very important for overall health, like having a healthy weight). Like you said, losing weight is primarily eating less. However, to maintain overall health and avoiding losing muscular mass (which is unhealthy) as opposed to fat, you need to eat a balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. The amounts don't matter too much, as long as all three are present in decent amounts. You could also stop eating carbohydrates altogether and rely on fat as a source of energy, but it's not necessary for weight loss.   Personally, when I'm losing weight, I prefer to rely on a few staple foods that are healthy and keep me hunger free: lean meat for proteins and/or some fats(chicken, fish, seafood), vegetables with a high micro nutrient density (collard green, kale, spinach), healthy sources of complex carbohydrates (natural oatmeal, sweet potatoes) and healthy sources of fat (walnuts, natural peanut butter, avocado). I don't really eat anything else, because I don't think it's necessary for optimal nutrition.   I also try to avoid sugar altogether, because it influences insulin levels and therefore hunger as well. However, fruits that are low in sugar and rich in dietary fibers (such as blueberries and raspberries) are perfectly fine in my opinion.    For those of you guys and girls who don't know, erythritol is a sugar alcohol, meaning it tastes like sugar but has 0 calories. The reason for this is that it's not metabolized at all! The human body doesn't have the enzymes to transform it into energy, so it goes through the digestive system and then straight to the urea cycle where it gets excreted out as urine, it doesn't ever reach the metabolic pathways.  I put it in my coffees and my cooked oatmeal, it adds a lot of taste to an otherwise very blunt diet (when I'm leaning up I only eat oatmeal, lean meat (fish, chicken and sea food), eggs, veggies, walnuts and sugar free peanut butter), and it's absolutely free of calories! And even better, some research has shown that it doesn't cause any damage to your teeth unlike sugar, since it's not anything that bacteria can use to thrive! In other words, it's the best thing!    I understand how you feel. As someone who studies in a nutrition related field and used to be overweight as a kid and teenager, I don't discuss my weight loss journey with anyone because I find people to be obnoxious and extremely ignorant.    This is not surprising to me, given that highly insulinogenic foods are well known to stimulate GIP and GLP-1 secretion of K and L cells in the mTORC1 pathway.            Reading those imgur comments is giving me cancer.       This is an absolutely fascinating research summary-style paper. OP, thank you.          Ok. Thanks!    Am I saying that you need to eat meat protein in order to lose weight and dairy protein to gain weight? Nope. In fact, you can probably lose weight on a diet of dairy and vice versa. But my belief is that, if you're looking to optimize your nutritional choices for more efficient results, then these factors definitely matter. In someone with metabolic syndrome, simply reducing daily caloric intake will make a world of difference... But in a highly trained athlete with already near-optimal body composition, then I would say that nutritional choices can make a difference, although I could be wrong. Only time will tell, because, although the physical target of ramapycin has been known for over a decade now, the research on the subject is still fairly recent.    Yes, but milk creates a great insulin response for the simple reason that it's hydrolized extremely quickly. To quote a research paper that explains better than I ever could myself:  'The insulinemic index of whole cows milk (14814) and skim milk (14013) is much higher than the glycemic indices of whole milk (425) and skim milk (379), repectively [53,54]. Fast hydrolysis and immediate intestinal absorption of insulinotropic amino acids of the whey protein fraction of cows milk raise insulin levels to much higher magnitudes than intestinal digestion of structural proteins such as beef (insulinemic index: 51) [53,54]. The major insulinotropic protein fraction of cows milk is the whey protein fraction [55]. Whey-derived leucine and other whey-derived amino acids stimulate glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) secretion of enteroendocrine K- and L-cells, respectively [56-60]. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity is of critical importance for the biological activity and half-life of these incretins. Remarkably, milk protein-derived peptides have been shown to inhibit DPP-IV activity and thus increase incretin activity enhancing incretin-mediated insulin synthesis and secretion [61,62].'   This is a solid number of studies, and this is obviously extremely complex science that I don't pretend to fully understand, but a lot of the research that I've looked at discusses the idea that long term mTORC1 over-stimulation is associated with various diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. Also, regular consumption of milk during pregnancy seems to also be associated with higher risk of those diseases in adult life in offspring, for reasons that I've already mentioned in the OP. What do you think of that?    In order to understand how tissues, including both adipose and muscular tissues, grow, one must understand how the mTORC1 pathway, the central hub of metabolism, functions. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a multi-protein structure that controls the proliferation and activation of virtually all molecules in the body, via processes such as lysosomal biogenesis, ribosomal biogenesis, autophagy (catabolism or cell death), etc. Simply put, the more the mTORC1 pathway is stimulated, and the more there is tissue growth.  There are five factors that activate the mTORC1 pathway:  -availability of cellular energy (ATP);  -availability of growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1)  -availability of essential branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine (found mostly in dairy and high protein food products)  -availability of another amino acid, glutamine, which works synergistically with leucine by acting as a 'gatekeeper' that ensures mTORC1 pathway leucine uptake (also found in dairy)  -availability of satured fatty acids, especially palmitic acid (found mainly in certain oils and cake pastries).  If one wants to limit or maximize mTORC1 stimulation, for example to lose weight or gain muscle mass, then these factors must be controlled. This is mainly done through careful dieting, by controlling caloric intake, but also by controlling food choices as well. The saying 'calories in, calories out' is not entirely true, since different nutrients have a distinct impact on the human metabolism.  For example, milk is probably the most mTORC1 stimulating food that exists, since it is highly insulinogenic (since it's digested quickly), meaning that it causes the pancreas to secrete a lot of insulin and is therefore transported to the metabolic pathway at a relatively fast rate, and also because it is rich in leucine and glutamine. Furthermore, it has been shown that, in pregnant women, regular milk consumption causes the transfer of biologically active exosomal messenger RNAs, which increases the mTORC1 pathway's overall effectiveness in offspring. Milk should probably not be consumed by mostly sedentary people, and should only be used by athletes and breastfed babies.  Inversely, meat/animal protein is less insulinogenic than dairy protein, and contains less leucine and glutamine. In other words, in comparison, dairy protein creates a greater insulin response, and has an animo acid profile that is more conductive to igf-1 and calcineurin-NFAT signalling in regards to adipose and muscular tissues. Meat/animal protein should therefore be favored if one's goal is to lose weight, and vice versa.                          I wonder to what extent that reduction in ribosome biogenesis could be mediated by increased mTORC1 pathway stimulation from diet.          That is very likely indeed.    Exactly.    In the article they discuss pasteurized milk specifically, but if you understand their justifications to any extent, then you also clearly understand that the problems they highlight also apply to milk consumption in general, not just to pasteurized milk.                         It never really slowed down, due to the fact that I continuously further reduced my caloric intake as I lost weight.    People have different standards of what looks 'good' or 'enough'. Don't mind what others say, it's about how you feel, about your own standards. For example, a lot of people will think that being slightly overweight or having fat-covered abs is okay. I personally don't, but to each his own opinion, so shoot for what makes you feel good about yourself.    I don't tell people that I was fat as a kid and teenager, because I'm extremely ashamed of it, even though it was not my fault that I was ignorant and that no one was there to teach me proper life habits.    https://www.facebook.com/derekweida/videos/911705428888433/?pnref=story  I was pleasantly surprised by this video. This guy is really entertaining, and I find everything he says to be quite true as well.   Basically, his advice boil down to:   -eat mostly lean meat, complex carbs and fruits and vegetables  -don't weight yourself everyday  -focus more on building strength and muscle in the gym, less on losing fat  -have fun losing weight and have a beer once in a while, it's about what you do most of the time  What do you guys and girls think?    22 subjects, not 2.          Technically, you don't need to eat anything. Humans are not born with the need to eat any food product in particular. We are born with the need to eat proteins, carbohydrates/fats, and vitamins and minerals. Both the various forms that these nutrient combinations take and our desire for them are social constructions, not actual nutritional needs.    Congratulations on your progress! :) But in the long run I would aim to get rid of this habit of having 'cheat meals' altogether. There is no need for that. You can make all your regular meals healthy and tasty and satisfying to eat all at the same time and thus have no need for such foods!!   Personally, I would feel either complimented or insulted depending on what I would perceive as their reasons for asking me that lol.       Over 30%, 6 years ago, when I was 15 year old. I'm 21 now.    Yes.    It's not about me. For the good of humanity, this thing simply shouldn't exist. I can't think of a positive reason for keeping it. It literally brings the worst out of humanity in every possible way.       I don't, but your body does need a relatively large supply of amino acids from foods in order for all of your physiological processes to function correctly. And decades of research have lead researchers to suggest that protein intake should be higher for people who exercise regularly, with 1.2 to 1.4g per kg of bodyweight being the numbers often being thrown around.    Yogurt and cheese are good, but not the healthiest options. Yogurt tends to be rich in sugar and therefore not very filling. Cheese is highly caloric and so you can only eat it in relatively small amounts. 'I don't like it' is not an excuse IMO, because tastes can be changed and expended over time.    Doing resistance training is healthy, it allows you to maintain the basic muscular mass and strength necessary to keep functioning well in your daily life, especially as you age. If you're not doing any, you should be IMO.    My bad for the eggs. And I'm not too sure where I mentioned beans lol? In fact, pretty sure I did not.    Yes of course. The equivalent would be 15-17% I think for a female. And thank you!   My assumption was that most people understood what each of these terms meant as well as the difference between the two. I might have been wrong. Thank you for this really clear and concise explanation.    About 30% of your protein intake should come from dietary proteins IMO, perhaps more if you do a lot of resistance training. Also, you must not have done a lot of research, because there are tons of non-meat foods that are rich in proteins... Dairy: Egg white, natural Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, etc.; vegetables: peas, spinach, brussels sprouts, asparagus, etc.; grain products: chia seeds (one of the world's healthiest foods IMHO), hemp seeds, pomegranate seeds, etc.; that's just a few examples of non-meat food products that are healthy AND rich in proteins and that you can easily make part of your daily diet.    This fat was very hard to get rid of. I got more or less stuck at around 10% body fat, as for a while I was struggling mentally to drop my caloric intake by another 100-150 calories. But I did it, and my lower abs finally show very clearly. Pretty sure I'm at 7-8% now! I know it might sound silly to some, but I am really happy, as that has been my goal for a while now.    That's interesting. I was asking, because I know of a few people who use GHRH off-label in combination with growth hormone secretagogues; they inject them subcutaneously multiple times a day (for example, in the morning before breakfast and at night before bed), because they believe that the two compounds work synergistically and have 'body-sculpting' effects (reduction in adipose tissue and increase in muscular tissue), but I have never seen the evidence for that in healthy adults.    Based on your study, would you say that, in healthy adult subjects, an increase in growth hormone secretion (induced, for example, by regular subcutaneous injection of an amino acid peptide hormone, such as growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF)) would cause similar effects, that is, a significant increase in muscular tissue and reduction in adipose tissue?       Fact.    The pleasure is mine! Good luck to you! I'm sure that with the determination necessary, you will succeed!   I was only half serious there, but I think you got my point. Of course there are cases in which you shouldn't lose more weight. But I don't think that applies to the vast majority of people on this subreddit.   	174

 So what if Kanye did it, Kanye is a bell as well but doesn't claim to be a comedian.  Paul Kaye has done it, Sacha Baron Cohen has done it plus more I can't think of off the top of my head   It really isn't, it's just been done before by far superior comedians rather than an attention seeking wanker clinging to his dying fame   Ran out with city players on a warm up, jumped in photos with the England team jetting off, stormed the stage at Glastonbury when Kanye was playing and I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting. All those he was chastised for as it was twattish, he's done the same here but he's been lucky that's why I said he lucked out that everyone is saying it's funny. If it wasn't blatter everyone would just call him a bell per usual like he is. He's also the "star" of one of the worst shows ever produced called The Lee Nelson Show   Because he lucked out, he has done several things like this over the last couple of years and its twattish, it's just that us football fans have been desperate for something, anything which is why this is seen as funny. He is at the very heart of it an unfunny attention seeking bell and one good thing doesn't stop the rest of them being shit. Broken clock etc   Too right, he's an attention seeking prick who has lucked out with this one   He been trying this for ages, sneaking into the photo with the England team jetting off for Brazil, getting on stage with Kanye at Glastonbury. He's a prick, he's ladbible in comedy form. Genuinely hope he gets locked away in a Fifa gulag hidden under the Swiss mountains forever   2 good things have come from this then, great photo of blatter and hopefully never have to see him do "comedy" ever again      She was my ex's tutor for orthoptics and said she was really nice. Her daughter Rebecca always suffered with anorexia and she passed away a couple of months ago. Gail then found out that she had a brain tumour and sadly passed. Horrible really   Meant same if not more as Stones but Shaw did play in the game against Costa Rica   I love how much you hate United, it's top seeing a "Southampton" fan go on  Also Rio had played in champs league and World Cup and shaw had the same if not a bit more experience   Obligatory Ronan fucking up Ravenous from Annihilation http://imgur.com/dRs25Hv   "You will make a big loss"  IF we do actually sell him and according to L'Equipe we aren't going to sell for less than 75 million euros which PSG don't want to pay   How unlucky for Crolla, thought he set the tempo and he was looking good even without the deductions. Not great. I am pretty gutted for Crolla though after coming back like he has    Quigg started cold in the first but holy shit what a 2nd round. Really happy for the lad   We subbed in youngsters as well, I'm not saying you were shit or flaming I was explaining why United didn't look great as well. Surprisingly not playing for 2 months can affect how a game is played.   K. Also it's you're. You're obviously just a troll, can't believe I've wasted part of my life with you   The dirty American team who have played more games and are in better shape or a new team having to learn a new formation/philosophy. Easy isn't it making excuses. And Depay and Darmian and Schweinsteiger add a couple of youngsters like McNair and Pereira who are just breaking into the first team   Only seeing an arsehole here mate   Ok...it's still the very first game these players have played in 2 months with new players to integrate and the whole 11 swapped at half time, it's not going to be cohesive. Dunno what Chivas must be like first game of pre season   It's the very first game of pre season and we swapped our whole 11 at half time, not exactly going to be going full whack    No he could be sold for 10p it's just that that's what Valencia will ask for as they don't have to sell and will want as much as they can possibly get for him   The legend himself   Ah sachin nakrani, a man more famous for...other things than football reporting  	24

 Petition to have Christoph Waltz to play every villian in every movie from now until the end of time, please.   I have a dream that I want to pursue, I want to be an animator. I want it real bad. But I find myself trapped in an endless cycle of browsing the internet and laughing at memes and so forth. Is there any motivation you have that you could share with me? How do I just stop wasting time on reddit and go work on my dream? Please help me, I really feel bad about this internet addiction.    [Another angle](http://imgur.com/Pwtxlkb)  It's also stated in this [official Star Wars article](http://www.starwars.com/news/the-cinema-behind-star-wars-2001-a-space-odyssey).       IMO there's no point in buying merchandise if the movie hasn't come out yet. What if you hate the movie? Imagine all the people that bought a Jar Jar Binks toy before the movie even came out.   What you're describing is Rogue One. And I don't know about you but I don't want it to be too "techy". Star Wars (the original trilogy) had a visual theme of "aged future". That's more appealing to me then bright and shiny Clone Wars.   I've never seen any of the Star Wars movies on the big screen however I absolutely love it. I was only 7 when RotS came out, so that was too young for me to see it in theatres. I would love to see Star Wars IV-VI on the big screen before I see TFA, because I plan on marathoning them before the new movie anyway.   I reached out to Cineplex (Canadian movie theatre chain) on Twitter to ask if we would be getting some screenings, but to no avail. I was wondering if anyone here had heard about theatres planning on playing it, news articles suggesting something, or if you think it's likely/unlikely to happen.   This here is what I hate about Reddit. A man expresses his views and gets downvoted because it goes against the hivemind circlejerk...   op's mom's pussy   I hope no one in this thread is narcissistic enough to believe that they are "super-smart"...    when i banged op's mom   Reddit is basically a hugspace already. The "circlejerk" as it is called.    This was actually not done with CGI like you'd think. The whole city is built of miniature buildings, and the flying police car is also practical effect. I believe this is just bait to get everybody rowdy.   This is too different from the Joker we know! It's shit!  This Joker is so unique, I'm glad they're doing something new! It's great!   I'm heading off to university this fall where I will be hopefully learning some valuable skills in the field of film. The course I'm taking balances both film study and also hands on moviemaking. From there I hope to get a job in the industry I love.  So, I was wondering if some former students of film or people who would consider themselves well versed in film could recommend me some movies that are sure to be discussed and studied by my class. Or films that you personally think that everyone should watch before they try their hand at making their own.   Thanks!   It would definitely be in the character of Han to pull that kind of thing...   It was an obvious mistake in the script and they covered it up with some EU story. If it seriously pisses you off when someone points that out then you might need some help.   I'm in a movie xD epic      Who is champ?   Why are you being downvoted? Jesus Christ the circlejerk is strong around here...   On a serious note, does anyone know how I can apply to be an extra in the background of a Star Wars movie? I'd literally pay to do it.   Now I kind of do want to see her in a slave outfit...   Not 100% sure on this one, but I think it's a possibility that they used practical effects in this movie.   Carrie Fisher is much funnier that I thought she'd be, Adam Driver seemed like he didn't really want to be there, and of course it's great to see Harrison Ford happy despite how he allegedly hates his character.   Guys, I'm wondering, did they use any practical effects on this movie?   I would honestly freeze myself in carbonite and miss out on 6 months of my life just to see this sooner.   Guys, guys, have you considered this?....  PRACTICAL EFFECTS   Threepio with a red arm is confirmed! And damn, Leia looks so much better than I expected!   Mods? May he be banned?   Will this footage be up on youtube later do you think?   No footage as in they're not showing any or people aren't allowed to videotape?   /u/00-----00, you created another account?   The entire cast of TFA is skydiving into hall H   That's nice but I'm here for SW leaks, not to partake in some random guy's power trip.   Petition to ban this guy? At this point I don't care whether he's right or wrong I just don't want this petty subreddit drama in the way of actual content.   So basically, if a black bear attacks you, you're fucked.   Can we just ban this guy? Whether or not he's right this subreddit is about SW leaks, not petty user drama.   "Hey guys you wanna see something?"  *crowd erupts in cheers*  The room goes dark. Footage begins to play.  It's Kylo Ren. He removes his mask to reveal Benedict Cumberbatch.  "MY NAME IS KHAN!"   Thanks, watched it and thought it was great!   epic troll friendo   I'd rather get nothing if we're not gonna get a trailer. I mean what's the point of seeing the behind the scenes of scenes we've never even seen the front of?   Nah, 4chan says ebin not dank.   What's "current" depends on where on the internet you are. For people on Facebook, they've never even heard of "dank memes". For people on Reddit, it's current. For people on 4chan, they would cringe if they heard someone say "dank".      Yeah, I've heard, but I'm not about to watch a romance movie to find out!  	46
 Did you ever ride RAGBRAI? Where in iowa are you from? When were you last back?    Have you seen everything a deer as ever done? Have you seen them poop on their children? I'm sure that happens sometimes. Have you seen then give birth? http://25.media.tumblr.com/ae7b461cb5634cbdbc0e61d731858649/tumblr_mjv01jjGTq1r9odzco1_500.jpg shit happens, twat    The prince of darkness has antlers that cease to stop bleeding, hail him       Okay but honestly you should watch True Detective for the real plot.    My man!    Bee probably high as fuck too   DOOM   Did you have a protocol set up for if there were words written on Pluto's surface?     ":c"  -that fish    Clean up on isle five.       Being at the front for Kendrick a few hours early,  I got to see Alabama Shakes real close up. Being that close, I also was touching the VIP walkway. I had been keeping my eyes peeled for a few celebs to maybe have their fame melt off onto me, but ended up forgetting about that for a bit. That was until a man walked by in overalls and a straw hat, a man I immediately recognized as Matt Shultz from Cage the Elephant, one of my favorite fucking bands. I screamed,  CAGE THE ELEPHANT after he had passed and he turned around and gave me a huge smile and pumped his fists. I also yelled I FUCKING LOVE YOU and he did another wave. That was pretty fucking cool. Then Chance the Rapper walked by and high-fived me.       I did!    Homie,  it could be THE Wrong Way Wooten!    HERE IS A VIDEO FROM 2009 https://youtu.be/JPaIEmiyG7o      Like a damn water dancer          NSFW to be safe.    RemindMe! 1 day.       There was an episode of the original Pokemon where Ash finds a group of Pikachu and decided his Pikachu would be better off with them. He essentially "Whitefangs" (Airbudding for the illiterate) Pikachu and cries as he does it. My mom wouldn't let me watch it because I would cry too hard.   How did you get involved with Ninja and Yolandi of Die Antwoord? I loved seeing you in Ugly Boy!   I think that's what this is, I was there too   We can go toe to toe on bird law and see who comes out the victor   What the hell is nightcrawlers? It's not what it sounds like. It sounds like you crawl around at night like goddamn worms. I guess it is what it sounds like.   Mr Jon bon Joni himself!   Your ruining this for OP   When rob trujillo played enter the sandman I lost my fucking mind       Or just skip them, like world war 5 did.   Hm. I thought you were going to go with some like along the lines of hell actually being empty until the end of the first person's 100,000 years. Anyone snide enough to ask for the spoon got to help run hell from the inside.   I haven't slept for ten days because that would be too long.   I haven't slept for ten days because that would be too long.      This is probably the most 2010's thing you'll ever read.   Your home bar is the exact same as mine. I had been tapping your back button for more than I would like to admit   I love Smarter Every Day! How did you start doing your show, and how did you get access to so many fantastic facilities?   My little brother's (3) daycare lady had on a shirt that sported proudly, "Jesus Is My Anchor." To my amusement, I began to think about what an anchor *actually* does. It hold a ship back from going anywhere. Just like closing one's mind with religion holds back the possibility to learn anything new. Jesus was the anchor holding her back from an open mind!   The time warp episode on skating is really cool too. https://youtu.be/rjScAVh7q0o      I'm getting real sick of these naked but covered ladies. Its like smelling candy bars.   I love your Trale Lewous character! How did you find Brube and does he still think you're a trailer louse?   This is kind of haunting. Watching this toy makes me realize how immense the real one was...and how there are still people in the rooms.   Flush the fatties.   Wait, that's NASCAR      I lined those pages with $10,000! There's always money in the porn box!   Don't you think it was unfair for Amy to get mad when she was stuck for 30 but you waited for 2000 and didn't complain? What's it like to kiss another actor with such passion?   "That sucks" or "sucks to suck." As a writer, there's nothing more infuriating than lazy, thoughtless, uncreative sayings when I have an actual problem. To be honest, it really sucks.    "That sucks" or "sucks to suck." As a writer, it's infuriating when people cop out say something as lazy and as thoughtless as this. I mean, it really sucks.   Wait, they haven't banned you? I thought using any proxy would cause Netflix to ban you!   When you started doing your high-voice interpretation of the audience during your show, were you afraid of how they would react? The real audience, not your voice.   And that's how I met your mother    I see you've played knifey-spooney before!  	58
 Not a really long video but a good reminder to keep your training your own.      That's also true. But even if was found to be true I would hardly call gaining 4.4 lbs "becoming fat".   I'm not sure I 100% agree with the headline. Gaining 4.4 lbs doesn't necessarily make you "fat".      I've got a 7 yo but I've always trained at night after he's gone to bed. Luckily he goes to bed about 7:30 so I can train without it taking too much out of my sleep.   Make sure to make time for both of them though else there will be some resentment.    It's a very pretty graphic. I love that it's easy to read and I can tell that you thought out how to best present the information.   I'm questioning how useful this data is though. California has a really high housing cost so of course the mortgage debt is going to be higher. It might have been more useful to show debt as a percentage of income.    I'm assuming he is at Pendleton? North or south? O'side isn't terrible and is cheaper than either Encinitas or Carlsbad. I would find something temporary in O'side then take your time to look around more to figure out what you want.      HBR often has some really good articles related to the business world. In light of the recent changes here I thought it would be appropriate to post this. It's an opinion piece but I think it's pretty accurate and probably nothing you haven't already thought of.      That will be a reverse commute do it won't be bad at all. You definitely don't want to live in Santee.   Are you working from home or commuting? Beach towns can be tough to get in and out of simply because there's typically only one or two routes of egress.  When you say close to the beach do you mean you have to live a few blocks away or are you OK with living farther. I lived downtown for several years (East Village - by the ballpark and Little Italy) and while not at the beach it was only a 10 minute drive. But then you've got to park which makes it a bit more of a hassle.    If you want to be by the beach then that's Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, or La Jolla. All three areas have a different vibe but all are nice in their own way.    Could be a great deal or could cost him 5 times that amount. I'm a former 748 owner (and have owned several other Ducs) so am a fan of that series. But he should know what he's getting himself into.   I believe that's a '98 if the tank and tail are original. The side panels most definitely are not which might mean crash damage.   Was he able to test ride it at all? Start it up? Take it to your mechanic if you don't know how to check the valves but you'll want to check the rockers (although I'm not sure if the '98s had the flaking problem).  It's a really nice bike but we don't know just from that small picture if he did really well or not.     I also typically don't like HD's but that is a really nice bike. You did an excellent job!  	16

Late, but tossing this in:   http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36228/ballad-of-the-sad-climatologists-0815/   Just for the record:)    FAQs: H5N1 influenza    Q1: What is H5N1?  H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60%.  Q2: How does H5N1 influenza spread to people?  Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.  http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/h5n1_research/faqs/en/  Also http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/   you're mixing your Stephens:)   Perhaps Earth will implement citizenship through descent.

Tossing in this comment taken from the comment section of the article, posted there by Kay Kay Segel  Hillsborough Community College            "This is about more than the food bank. It is people controlling others lives.           Its about the porches flooding every time it rains.           It is about residents being locked out of the club house for 3 months.           It is about bullies getting drunk and harassing residents, it is about people being evicted with out just cause. or then numerous trailers that have been sold with out tittles. it is about the owner telling people who they may associate with and if seen you are harassed.          It is about following people and embarrassing them for reaching out for help.         It is about them telling people no one needs food in this park.          It is about a Disabled vet being threatened by her employee and her standing by and doing nothing about it. There is a video that clearly shows it.         No one is starving, that is news embellishment.

MADRID (AP)  Spain and Portugal  known for their sunny skies  are seeing record high temperatures for May, with thermometers hitting levels normally only seen in midsummer.  Spain's meteorological agency says the eastern town of Xativa recorded 42.9 degrees Celsius (109.2 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, breaking a 2006 record of 40.1 degrees Celsius (104.2 Fahrenheit) at Cordoba Airport.  Portugal also set a May record, with the southern city of Beja sizzling Wednesday in 40 degrees Celsius heat. Portugal's previous May high was 39.5 degrees Celsius (103.1 Fahrenheit) in 2011.  The stifling heat stretched across to Spain's Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where temperatures of 42.4 degrees Celsius (108.3 Fahrenheit) were recorded Wednesday at Lanzarote Airport.  The town of Pego in Spain's eastern Alicante region was also fighting a wildfire Friday.         An outbreak of lead poisoning in Nigeria has killed 28 young children in Niger state, health officials told local media Wednesday. At least 65 cases were identified in Niger state, where the poisoning was linked to illegal mining. Although lead poisoning is not contagious, officials expressed concern that the affects had already spread into neighboring Kaduna state.  As of Tuesday, 17 girls and 11 boys all under the age of five have died from lead poisoning and more sick children are being treated. Farm animals were also affected by the lead poisoning outbreak, junior health minister Fidelis Nwankwo said Wednesday.  The devastating impact of this outbreak is associated with new mining sites, which were found to contain more leaded ores, which are often brought home for crushing and processing, Nwankwo told reporters during a press conference in Abuja. Additionally, the finding revealed a serious impact on our livestock with cows, goats and chicken most affected.  Illegal gold mining is a lucrative business for impoverished locals, who have concealed or denied fatalities and sickness from lead poisoning in fear of consequences. Local who bring rocks inside their homes and use unsafe mining techniques to process gold ore are at risk for lead exposure. Lead poisoning cannot be spread from person-to-person, but lead-containing particles can be transported and thus inhaled or ingested by more people.  [The outbreak] is currently spreading to neighboring localities in the state and Kaduna state, Nwankwo added.  Lead poisoning has killed hundreds of Nigerian children in recent years. In 2010, at least 400 children died and some 2,000 others affected from lead poisoning in Zamfara. The outbreak was caused by the processing of lead-containing gold ore in the northwestern state and lead contamination was identified in about 50 villages. The dangerous mining practice produced fine particles that contaminated water and food crops and were easily consumed by young children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  When inhaled or ingested, lead can cause damage to the brain, kidneys, bone marrow and other body systems in young children, the CDC said in a report last year.

I am irl, but I suck at it on the net, so I have mostly given up :)   Whoa. Hold up.  The meningitis outbreak is in Niger I thought...Yes Niger has meningitis, Nigeria to Niger's south, has the H5N1 outbreak.  Also ..No more Ebola in Nigeria:)  So that is good.  http://digg.com/2015/how-nigeria-beat-the-ebola-virus-in-three-months  Now if we were able to keep the diseases in their assorted corners..meningitis is a b.  EDIT: Nigeria does have a Niger state however. That's where the new lead poisoning outbreak is.    I like mountains.   I once found myself up on one in Vermont in August, only to have the snow start spitting!   Socks do not always make the best mittens:)  Stay warm.   no I wasn't being sarcastic.    yea, lot of appreciation for the attacked officer's partner, I'm sure.      Good habit:)   I agree, its a lot more fun!  (you should see me staring at the soil, or at the baby plants:)  I tend to save my seeds from year to year, which I also find oddly satisfying:)   Lol, IK:)  The article has been updated.

TESTIMONIALS  We Have Found You Wanting  By Rose Schneiderman  Addressing the same audience [a memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911], Schneiderman (1866-1972), organizer for the ILGWU and the Women's Trade Union League read the handwriting on the wall. First published in The Survey, April 8, 1911.  I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting.  The old Inquisition had its rack and its thumbscrews and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.  This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.  We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.  Public officials have only words of warning to us--warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.  I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.  Leon Stein, ed., Out of the Sweatshop: The Struggle for Industrial Democracy (New York: Quadrangle/New Times Book Company, 1977), pp. 196-197  http://trianglefire.ilr.cornell.edu/primary/testimonials/ootss_RoseSchneiderman.html    Key facts  Avian influenza (AI), commonly called bird flu, is an infectious viral disease of birds.  Most avian influenza viruses do not infect humans; however some, such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people.  Outbreaks of AI in poultry may raise global public health concerns due to their effect on poultry populations, their potential to cause serious disease in people, and their pandemic potential.  Reports of highly pathogenic AI epidemics in poultry, such as A(H5N1), can seriously impact local and global economies and international trade.  The majority of human cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) infection have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly cooked food.  Controlling the disease in animals is the first step in decreasing risks to humans.  from http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/   (IMHO you may also be seeing a good price increase in food such as eggs, chicken, turkey, duck, etc. Not an expert!)       I seem to have misread your's as well:)   Actually..I'm more responding to your original statement:)     In my experience, when people and their children are hungry they will work under the most horrid conditions, even at the risk of their life.  Also how often do we hear people that are the victims of awful events say, "You hear about this on the news. I never expected it would happen to me."  I'm pretty sure the workers there recognized a danger.    we haven't seen pissed off yet! (sorry it reads as 'distant')    President Obama said the prospect of peace between Israel and the Palestinians is now "distant," but "A two-state solution is absolutely vital ... for the long-term security of Israel as a Democratic and Jewish state."  He said he was aware that some members of the newly formed Israeli government "don't necessarily believe in that premise ... but that continues to be my premise."  from: http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/14/406829649/obama-tries-to-calm-arab-fears-over-iran-talks          U.S.- Gulf Cooperation Council Camp David Joint Statement (White House press release)  https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/14/us-gulf-cooperation-council-camp-david-joint-statement  (White House needs a TL/DR person)      "CAMP DAVID, Md.  President Obama on Thursday offered Saudi Arabia and smaller states in the Arab world new defenses against potential missile attacks and maritime and cyberthreats from Iran, an effort to allay their fears that a nuclear accord with Tehran will empower their main rival in the Middle East.  But in a daylong meeting here, Mr. Obama stopped short of offering a formal defense pact that would obligate the United States to come to the nations aid if they were attacked."

Efforts have also been made to raise public awareness of the situation and to encourage domestic water users to take more responsibility for the conservation of this increasingly scarce commodity.  Turkey is building a water pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from Anamur on its southern coast to the northern coast of Cyprus, to supply Northern Cyprus with potable and irrigation water (see Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project)."     The hailstorm that lasted about half an hour, destroyed vineyards and half-grown tree crops and grain in Paphos, and cherry crops in Kampos tis Tsakkistras and Amiandos in Nicosia.  According to reports, vine growers said the damage was so extensive that their vineyards will not be able to produce grapes next year either.      I've taken to adding this comment to this article:  If you garden at all, beware of where you are buying your plants.  http://www.foe.org/beeaction  http://www.foe.org/news/news-releases/2015-04-lowes-commits-to-protect-bees-and-pollinators   Exactly, this is worrisome.   The carefully negotiated bill, which President Obama is expected to sign, gives Congress the power to approve or disapprove of a nuclear agreement with Iran during a 30-day period when economic sanctions could not be lifted.  Should the House and Senate vote to disapprove of the deal, and then override a likely Obama veto, the administration would be barred from waiving some economic sanctions on Iran as part of international accord.         A woman who is believed to have sold around 30,000 poppies during decades of fundraising for the Royal British Legion was found dead just two days before the 70th anniversary of VE Day.      "An unseasonably cold storm will bring a blanket of snow to Southern Californias mountains Thursday while foothill residents in Los Angeles and Ventura counties could be in for potential mud and debris flows, the National Weather Service said."  There is a potential for isolated thunderstorms with dangerous lightning, small hail, gusty erratic winds, and isolated water spouts, a statement from the weather service said.

She does not expect the conditions to improve over the next few days.

 I only noticed when I was looking at that photo xD         I am confused, are you talking about the ass on the wall?   Hattori is either A or S, and she is a girl. Thatch is S. Queen Nai is B. In my opinion.   Yep, keep on putting more and more hastags.   Well... fuck that   OH SHIT! I figured out how to make red text! :O   Game is "Northernlion Returns Home"      ###MattRapesSaxophones   (dan told all of us in the stream to shit-post on the subreddit. Dan also teased a new sonic 06 vid and a Dad3 Sonic 06 vid HYPE!!)   He said he was married to another man. (This post was a joke, in stream he told us to shitpost)       Stop sending me this, it is annoying.   How can you spoil battle bots? Unless you say who wins a match there is no way you can "spoil" it. It isn't a drama, it is a... I don't even know what to call it, sporting event? Like in sports, saying Mr. Football broke his leg! isn't a spoiler.   This is the incorrect use of this meme... [but...](http://imgur.com/gallery/DRDrtmL)   and his face   I had the Fantastic 4 AND the Spiderman one. :)   Probably that one time OP's mom hired me to take some photos of her and her son...   Damn, need to go to the Dark Room more often xD   whoops, sorry   Oh, sorry, just saw it now :(   Hey, I like Dan just as much as Jon, I just thought it was funny.      What mod is that?   This is not enough! I need an-udder cow joke!   Post this on /r/bindingofisaac ? This is a NL sub, not a general isaac sub.   Not really a way for me to get money though.   My lack of moneys makes that hard. Being young kinda sucks.   9 comments and 0 upvotes, thanks alot guys. :p   Hey, it's better than what I got. xD   It is, but at least I have more games... and reddit.   But you pronounce it as EX-BOX. Kinda like you say an possum. An o-possum, is that right? I may be confused. xD    a XBOX, an XBOX? I think it is an XBOX, oh well.      Meh, with the Razer gear, you are getting a sweet fucking deal. PC is not to good though.   Dragonball is a nine, yet Dragonball Z is a 7?! WHAT IS THAT LIST?!   I want some preferably short anime series, as I am not currently watching anything. I like Dragonball, SAO and Attack on Titan. Any suggestions?   Yeah, I guess you are right, but Lion has something to do with Rose. Maybe she created him, but he wasn't made from her? idk    It annoys me how they aren't confused by Lion and all his connections to Rose.    Well, it is the most logical way to explain lion.   So, we know it took at least PART of Rose to make Steven, and Lion has so many links with Rose... isn't it safe to say that the parts of Rose that weren't needed to make Steven, made Lion. I mean... HE'S FUCKING PINK! He had Rose's sword in him, and her battle flag. Rose told Pearl all her secrets, so if Lion was around before Rose died, Pearl would have known. There are also some BIG holes in this theory, like, wasn't someone there when Steven was born? Wouldn't they see Lion being born, and why would Lion be in the desert and not with the gems like Steven was his whole life? If I think of some more I will post in comments.   :O   Dwarfs!?, Fez *(shivers)*, Proteus, Scribblenauts, Universe Sandbox, and Thomas was Alone, also, you can never go wrong with Bad Rats.   I was playing as Teros and won maybe 4 times in a row and didn't get one of those gold things on the banner?

Also, they actually have some high quality shit. Still over priced, but great. Specifically it's stain remover.   Exactly what you said is the big deal, reddit but diffrent. Also, they allow free speech, so there's that.   Tell me what it is like being a closet in the body of a man.   Sleep tight, pizza   Even if you do know what he is from, he is still pretty racist. lol   Oh snap! That is one nice hamster! :O            Well, first they ban FPH then they ban everything until only a few innocent subs remain.   More freedom and less censorship. Also, less Ellen Pao.      Over all it is a better experience than reddit is providing now. Everyone on the internet is an asshole, at least these are honest.   Yeah, so many people bitching about free speech, like WE GET IT! THAT IS WHY WE ALMOST LEFT REDDIT!      The second. Pretty sure, someone correct me if I am wrong.   You put other names before referring to yourself.      What video is this from?   /r/Fallout is a mansion of shitposts. A text post that says "I got falout 4 pitboy aditioin" Will get you to the front page.   Quietest day in history.   When someone expects to see something other than a cute animal on /r/aww    My wife and I.   It will runb shit and look shit, but it might be fun, no one has played the game, so we don't know.   Basically, children have more time off of school in the summer, so we get more shitty reddit posts from kids. /r/summerreddit will show you what the typical "summer reddit" is.    If you like monster hunter, it is great. If you get it cheap it is amazing. Defenantly a game for hard fans though.   Damn, wish I could edit the title.

    Democrats are upset that Martin O'Malley said that All Lives Matter.      "Dats racis"    The recession only ended for the rich. The rest of the nation is still in recession.  This statement is false. That is what I am referring to. The recession didn't just end for the rich. It also ended for millions of middle class Americans, like myself.   He committed a crime (theft) and went to jail. Whats the issue?   He still sells to Blacks and Hispanics. He is not a very good racist.   I am not rich and am doing just fine.   The Obama admin was warned. Iran does not play by the rules. They never have.      Funny that he still sells to Blacks and Hispanics. He is not a very good KKK member.   Muslim is not a race.   Muslim is not a race. He didn't say he wouldn't sell to Blacks or Hispanics. He doesn't make a very good racist.   haha   We called it flirting back in my day.         Not really sure what Trumps play was on this.   I Stand With Rand   McCain is a badass!   ITT: Religious persecution; bigotry      Recruitment centers are gun free zones. Can you tell us all what the [sign](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150716175657-10-tn-shooting-recruitment-center-door-super-169.jpg) on the front door says?      It's like Tumblr puked on Reddit.   I took two words to the face and had to get stitches.    You may not like Trump but he is a very smart man. He did not get where he is today because he is stupid.   This would be huge.       Go with 365. I prefer in-house. To each their own.   I believe everyone should get legal unions. Marriage should be a "religious ceremony" that has no bearing on the law. Straight or Gay, in the eyes of the law, you are a legal union. If you want to get married then that is a separate and private religious ceremony. IMO   Legally you would be equal.   "Oh, you mean I have to actually pay for that student loan that I signed for saying I would pay it back?" "I WANT EVERYONE ELSE TO PAY FOR MY STUDENT LOAN THAT I SIGNED FOR SAYING THAT I WOULD PAY IT BACK!!!!!!"   haha thanks!   I will not vote for any candidate that wants to expand the Federal Government. The Fed gov is already too big. We can't even hold the Fed Gov accountable now. The larger the Fed Gov is the less accountable it becomes. I want smart Fed Gov not larger Fed Gov.   What does me supporting Rand have anything to do with the fact that Bernie doesn't stand a chance?   I would vote for a rabid dog before I would vote for Hillary.   Mirror?   So, his solution to a corrupt and irresponsible government is more government? Sounds like the perfect plan. Give the corrupted more power. Perfect!   Bernie will not make it out of the Primaries. Democrats have already chosen their candidate. Bernie should just bow out now.   No. The media wants Hillary and the media gets what it wants.      lol   If this was the other way around everyone in this thread would be crying pay discrimination.   Actually, its because he doesn't cower to the PC crowd.    The media really wants Hillary as President.   And that is why Bernie and his supporters will lose.   All he did was say some words and now he is the Obama you voted for? Well, technically, you are correct. All he did was talk then too.   haha Reddit is so fucked.               How does Seattle become "everywhere you go"? I have been all over the country. Seattle has the highest concentration of feminazis of anywhere I have been. Just speaking from experience. I will no longer open a door for a woman in Seattle. It's not worth the in-your-face rage you encounter from the woman you are being courteous to.   You are misunderstanding the true reasoning. They don't care if you submit multiple times. It's the fact that this article shows Hillary in a bad light is the reason it was hunted down and removed. They will allow multiple posts showing a politician they do not like in a bad light. You will not get by with multiple submissions if it has anything to do with showing a Democrat or Progressive in a bad light. I have tested this theory over the years. It's sad that /r/politics has no neutrality to it.   Sometimes people just need to fight it out. It's natural. This is a good law.   This is a civil case. The murderers will still go unpunished if they win the suit.   Wouldn't a settlement also be a public acknowledgement that they were responsible for something that required monetary damages?   Selfishly? Yes.   So, you are encouraging the assassination of a US citizen at the hands of a violent drug cartel leader.    Does this mean I can take a shit in the womens bathroom now?    Bernie is in no way comparable to trump.  You are correct. Trump has actually created jobs and wealth. Something Bernie has never done.   Caliphate News Network   You sound excited about the thought of a violent Mexican drug cartel leader assassinating a US citizen?    Hillary Clinton, who represented Wall Street as part of her constituency when she was a U.S. senator from New York, has long looked to people in the finance industry for large campaign donations.      Ever been to Seattle? Feminazis are prevalent in Seattle.   ITT: Religious persecution; bigotry                  Birmingham is consistently ranked as one of the top 10 most violent cities in the US.

Don't get your Redcoat in a wad. Why knock the guy for knowing a great prime rib when he sees one.    I agree. Just felt the F-22 was better suited for dogfighting than the F-35.   Found this decent comparison.   F-22 and F-16 have two major things in common: both are relaxed-stability designs and both have LEX. As such, similar wing loading figures and thrust-to-weight ratios will result in similar maneuverability, especially since F-16 was designed to achieve optimum performance when two wingtip AAMs are present.   With 50% fuel, 2 Sidewinder and 4 AMRAAM F-16C has wing loading of 392 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,186 and weights 10 936 kg. F-22 has wing loading of 313,5 kg/m2, thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 and weights 24 579 kg. Thus, while F-22 will suffer maneuverability penalty due to its size and weight, it is unlikely that F-16C will be able to outmaneuver it.   With F-16A it is a different story. With empty weight of 7 076 kg, it has wing loading of 349,5 kg/m2 and thrust-to-weight ratio of 1,29 (figures for 50% fuel and 2 Sidewinder). While its wing loading is higher than F-22s, F-16A is far lighter and smaller, so it is possible that it could be capable of matching the F-22.   http://i.imgur.com/68qtpMn.gifv   What about the F-22 vs the F-16? That is a dogfight I want to see. The F-35 and F-16 are two different types of aircraft. The 22 would be a better fit for dogfighting the 16 than the 35.

     Modern utopias tend to be different because instead of criticising our current world, they imagine what it could become if mankind makes the right choices etc...   are those mutually exclusive? I would think most utopian fiction tries to do both: both show what's wrong with current society and show a better way.     Yep, agree. Although 1 and 2 will normally win out in the long run even without luck.   In fact, maybe I'd say you really need two of three. You can have luck and talent (e.g., I know people signed by big agents when they were in grad school and not even close to finishing a book), work ethic and luck (you grind it out and never do that well, but then one of your ideas just happens to catch on and be in the right place/right time), or talent and work ethic.... but you can't survive with only one.          Yeah I mean don't get me wrong, you still have to put in the hours and be dedicated. But tons of people put in tons of hours into things they love (basketball, acting, writing, fashion design, whatever) and never get anywhere because they don't have innate talent.    depends on how naturally talented you are. I know people like to pretend that talent doesn't exist, and that's it's just hard work, but some people sell a book 3 years after they start writing, others can't sell one for a decade or more.       It sounds cliche, but go with the best and most original story. Don't worry about what will appeal to the larger audience. EITHER could, depending on execution.    It probably needs to be above average, but it depends on what you mean by debut/unknown. I think it is really really hard for a debut author with no credentials, platform, or name recognition to sell. It's much easier for a debut author who can get blurbs from authors, who publishes fiction and essays regularly, who has a couple thousand Twitter followers, etc. Having a famous agent helps too.   There is so much that's a crapshoot and unpredictable though. You might have a hard time if your book happens to be too similar to a big book that just came out, or you might have a better chance if your book happens to be in a genre that just had a big seller. etc.    The one thing it does prove is how meaningless being a "#1 Amazon bestseller!" is. Self-published books always slap that table on, when 99.9% of the time they just reached #1 in some tiny niche category on Amazon by selling like 10 copies.              Creative writing courses - what is the consensus on these?  If you have a good class with a good professor, it can do wonders. People grow leaps and bounds in writing courses and MFAs. Seriously. However, I do think it's true that the biggest reason people grow so quickly is that they are putting aside the time to dedicate themselves to the craft. So you can get a similar experience by just truly making writing and reading your full time job.   MFAs and genre writing classes don't really provide a great return on investment, so I wouldn't take them if they cost tons of money. But plenty of MFA programs are fully funded.    I assume by "lesser" you mean a smaller audience?   I think in this day and age, these boundaries are less important. Jeff VanderMeer's popular and acclaimed Southern Reach trilogy was called science fiction, but was published by a literary publisher (FSG), and nominated for both literary and SF awards.   That kind of thing is increasingly common in 2015.             yeah, I used to like to read in bed at night but now prefer to read in the day sitting upright.    50% of what though?   What I mean is, the market is FLOODED with crappy books. That's true. Bust most of those are books by celebrities, books by genre authors who pump out 10 books a year (normally with ghostwriters), lackluster efforts be veteran authors, and so on. Lots of others are in specific niches, like certain types of erotica and romance, that sell well no matter what.   My point: a lot of the crappy books put out by traditional publishing are books by people or in niches that are almost guaranteed to sell some copies.   The bar for being in the top 50% for debut authors or general literary fiction is probably higher.                      No one will want to license anything from a book that isn't selling well or getting great press.   I'm confused why you'd be into publishing traditionally in papers, magazines, and foreign countries but not in doing so in your country?   I'd say the odds are low BUT can be improved quickly by you building a name and reputation: publish stories, or publish essays, or start a blog and get traction in a niche, etc.   All authors need to help sell their books in 2015, so having platform and reputation and readers really helps   it was good!   Yeah that's a little less impressive. 30k is barely even a novella.    Adjuncting is a total scam no matter what department you are in.

Google "joffrey is misunderstood"!

Yes accidental murder is still a crime. If you build a paintball gun you think went hurt people, but kills five you'd go to jail. Wreckless endanderment   Historically, it's really crazy and unique for it's time. No one was writing bizarre magical realism like that back then. It's hugely influential, and has inspired magical realists, surrealists, postmodernists, and fabulists for generations.   The story itself is filled with meaning and can be read in many ways with many interpretations. I think that kind of ambiguity is the hallmark of great fiction.    Sure, but fact remains that superheros often say "the end justifies the means"   Would actually be an interesting comic idea, like iron Man gives 20 poor people in haiti armor    I think you are right about Tywin, great acting on Dance's part in the show   Comic book heroes frequently dole out the punishment too. I know Batman drops a lot of criminals off at the police station, but superheroes frequently injure or imprison criminals. Hell, Superman has the whole Phantom Zone prison dimension that he sends villains to!  It's true that most heroes have a "no kill" policy, but they are normally happy to dole out every other form of punishment.      Cool, I was just reading about terrorist groups who thought they were doing the right thing by using force to achieve what they thought were "good" ends....   Fair enough, although in Star Wars Luke and Darth Vader clearly have way more super powers than the normal humans. I wouldn't say everyone is super in those films!  I can't really remember the specifics of GotG, but I do think most of the crew are indeed more special than the average characters they encounter. Gamora is one of the greatest weapons in the universe, right? Drax has been modified into a living weapon too. I guess Star Lord is pretty much just a dude with a few gadgets though.   heh, well I don't think the heroes or villains in the F F movies (i've only seen first couple, not 6 and 7) have actually magical powers equivalent to Jedi force powers or Thor, or even Captain America.   I realize they are ridiculous action movies where the laws of physics are... frequently bent. But that's true of basically every action movie from Die Hard to Kill bill, right?      Well the heroes aren't just threatening force...they use force on a daily basis.   I mean its one thing in-universe where these heroes have been private for decades. But in the real world, if people were suddenly leveling buildings like Hulk while claiming to be heroes we'd pretty sure damn well want them trained and accountable to people. Obviously that's less narratively interesting, but that's what we'd really want, right?   And it's really no different than real life. We don't let just any rando person own a nuclear bomb, and no matter where you stand on gun control you probably think it is a good thing that assault rifles are registered, etc.    But there's no skill to doing a pushup, it is really just muscle. You build up the muscle by doing.   Writing is more of a skill that you can learn techniques for.   As I said in other post, you can learn to shoot a jump shot by just shooting blindly forever until you develop a shot, but you will learn better by having some guidance and learning the right movements while also practicing.    You do need to practice, but I actually agree with you: learning the craft is just as important as practicing.   If you want to play basketball, it will be helpful to just go shoot around on the court by yourself for 100. Sure. But it will be MORE helpful to have a coach teach you the proper shot movements for 20 hours and shoot by yourself for 80.       But personally I think the idea that you should always obey the law (no matter what) a much more disturbing and dangerous lesson to teach kids.  Certainly you don't need to obey every law, but the laws that superheros break aren't unjust laws. Like it is a good thing that our society tries to prevent random citizens from breaking an entering, violently assaulting people, and so on.    Even when they work with police is normally illegally, like the commissioner works with Batman but in secret. Superheros rarely have official training or oversight.    Yes, it is weird to me how many people claim that superhero comics teach good lessons to kids. The main lesson of superhero comics is that if you count as a "good" guy, then you should break the law and use physical violence to save the day. That's not a great lesson to learn.    I'm the opposite. I never understand the point of reading full length non-fiction, when 90% of the time I can learn what I need from a book in a short article online. Non-fiction books feel pointless.   Fiction, OTOH, has to be experienced as a whole to understand it. It can't be reduced to a bullet point list.    you gotta work your way up in books, start as an assistant of some kind and you might be able to move up   I'm not sure what we are arguing at this point, but what I'm getting at is that guys with magical superpowers defeating evil villains through physical violence is SOOOO far removed from how morality really works in the real world that it really just doesn't have much bearing on real life. Not sure it really "teaches" anything or reflects our reality at all.   Does that make any sense?   Like at no point in most people's lives are they ever confronted with the change to save someone by beating up some being of pure evil. That's really not how it works in life, unless you are like a detective who hunts serial killers. In real life for 99.9999% of the population, people are rarely purely evil or purely good, and fixings problems is almost never solved by one good guy beating up one bad guy.    Yep. Emily Nausbaum had a good essay on "bad fans" in relation to Breaking Bad.    Yes, I think part of the appeal is fantazing that you, the reader, are Batman or Spider-Man or Wolverine or whatever.   My point, I guess, is that good art IMPLICATES you, the audience. The audience is forced to question their own assumptions and morality in some way, ideally. But in most superhero comics, the good and evil sides are so clear and simplistic that you are never implicated. That's what makes it escapism. It doesn't challenge you, it soothes you.   That's totally cool. Soothing fiction has it's place too. But I think Moore's point is that this kind of fiction has so utterly overtaken the culture that it is out of balance.     fair enough! I'm all for a shirt towards more rollicking space adventures myself.    I think maybe we're both mixing up "fantasy" as a genre and "fantasy" as unrealistic escapist fiction. When Moore is talking about superhero comics being a simplistic childhood fantasy of having powers to beat up "bad" guys, he isn't talking about it in the sense of "fantasy" like Game of Thrones or whatever.   Fantasy, the genre, does not require childish escapism or black and white morality (though it does feature both sometimes.) Moore himself almost always includes some kind of magical or fantasy elements in his fiction and comics. He's not shitting on the idea of magic or unreality in fiction.   What I meant is that even in speculative fiction, SF and fantasy and superhero comics, you can have complex morality. It doesn't have to be an escapist fantasy.    Thanks! Yeah I didn't think I was being controversial, as you note is a plot point in plenty of batman stories   Well... you could say the same thing about a ton of superheros. Batman is just a rich guy with fancy toys. Tony Stark is just a rich guy with fancy toys. Lots of heroes are like Cap, "peak" ability humans with some faux-science enhancements.    Which is the essence of all superhero comics, isn't it?   It's unethical to break and enter... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to spy on people's minds... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to destroy tons of property... unless a hero does it. It's unethical to go outside the law for justice... unless a hero does it.   etc.    I don't think you're understanding me, or I'm not being clear.   What I'm saying is that in the real world, real good mostly comes from empowering other people and with smaller personal moral choices. It does a lot more good to give people in a third world climate the means by which to improve their own lives than it does to fight one bad guy. It does more good to root out structural racism in policing than it does to take down one racist cop. It does more good to fix the campaign laws that let corporations run our politics than it does to bust one politican for a sex scandal.   But the superhero fantasy is this abstract one of a special individual with magic powers fighting some purely evil being. When I say it is a selfish fantasy, I mean it's one where the fantasy comes from the idea of you being in the place of the hero and you flying around saving the day one bad guy at a time. It's not about empowring people or fixing structural problems, its about "taking out he bad guy" all by yourself.      yeah that's what I was saying, the fantasy people like is being a rich handsome dude with tons of fancy tech toys. But maybe that makes the creeping right wing morality even worse? Because people dont' realize that's what they are reading?    I thought Civil War was completely ruined, even though the premise could be good. Instead of presenting the two sides as both having real points, they turned it so the pro-reg people were basically totally wrong and overreaching and willing to violate their own morality while the anti-reg people were the clear heroes.   It's doubly annoying because the pro-reg people are obviously right: in the real world, we wouldn't want private citizens with no regulation to be using superpowers in public like that... just like we don't allow any random citizen to purchase tanks, bazookas, and nuclear bombs. It takes a lot of narrative twisting to make people who are against registering what are essentially nuclear bombs held in private hands into heroes.    Oh sure I love all those characters as characters because they are well developed, but what I'm saying is that there are a million Tumblr posts with titles like "Why Cersei is a feminist icon" or "Why Tywin is actually the most moral commander" or "Littlefinger is the true hero, go Peter!" or "Why Joeffrey is misunderstood and not responsible for his actions" etc. THAT kind of fandom is scary.    Both reading and writing will help you.    Like a big element of Fantastic Four is the Skull / Kree conflicts, and DC has the whole New Gods jack kirby stuff. The Inhumans (which are being made into a movie I think) are literally a race of superheroes all with unique powers living on the moon.    In addition, even when superheroes are shown to have truly made a mistake--which is rare, but happens sometimes-- they are never actually punished.   Take the last avengers. Tony Stark tries to play god with a machine defense system, and ends up causing the deaths of thousands and almost the destruction of life on earth. Not only does he not actually, I dunno, get sent to jail for life or suffer any kind of punishment he saves the day by... playing god by making a superpowered machine. He literally saves the day the same way he threatens the day.   Same movie: Hulk goes crazy and does massive damage, probably killing many. We see him sulking and feeling bad about it, but he again isn't imprisoned or hidden away from society to stop him constantly killing people. (I know the movies don't show him killing exactly, but if you are smashing over buildings then people are dying).   Batman hacks everyone's cellphones, suffers no punishment for it. so on and so forth. The good guys "learn a lesson" but never get punished. That's part of the fantasy.     The superhero genre is one of the best at pointing out that altruistic motivations do not justify any action.  Totally disagree! I think the ENTIRE fantasy of superhero comics is that the ends justify the means if you are a good guy.   Superheros are at their core vigilantes: people who illegally fight crime outside of official channels. They break and enter, assault people, and do lots of other things that legal law enforcers are not supposed to do. But the idea is that since they are "good" and have good motives, it's cool that they constantly break the law.   But it goes beyond just that. Every psychic character violates not just the minds of evil villains but also, at some point, heroes/friends/family in order to save the day. Every tech genius type violates privacy and hacks into databases to save the day. You can go to Cracked.com types sites and see tons of lists of "insane punishments by Superheroes" where they do really messed up things to supervillains that would certainly violate our ethical standards if a police officer did them.   etc.   Superheroes embody the "end justifies the means" ideal.    I guess my disagreement would be that both Marvel and DC have huge "space" elements to their universes, with heroes and races who take place on different worlds and rarely interact with earth.    A vigilante is just anyone taking law into own hands without legal authority. It has nothing to do with killing    A vigilante is just anyone taking law into own hands without legal authority. It has nothing to do with killing    A vigilante is just anyone taking law into own hands without legal authority. It has nothing to do with killing    Yep, and even people trying to be conscious can fall for it, like all the "Cersei is a a feminist icon!" posts by supposed feminists who just want to root for a powerful female character and ignore all the horrible things she's done (including to many other female characters!)    They are all (sans Ozy) getting credit with the audience. That's the power fantasy. They sacrifice themselves, but the audience doesn't. They just get to watch and project themselves.    Sure, and it's not unique to comics. There's a reason that like every Disney protagonist is an Orphan. We love rooting for the underdog, and while it's kind of absurd to think of a superhero as an underdog when they have magic powers we can KINDA view them as such if they are orphans, victims of prejudice, loser outcasts pre-power, etc.    It's not short sighted, and we aren't talking about real life. We are talking about FANTASIES, children's comics and superhero films.   Yes, obivously if it was real life then the Avengers saving humanity from evil aliens is "good" and "builds a better world"  That's not the point.   The point is that having a handful of magical misfits beat evil alien invaders is just a simplistic and childish narrative structure. That's fine if it is a kid's movie, but Moore's point is that the culture as a whole shouldn't get so wrapped up in that kind of childish fantasy.   Like someone else pointed out, even in fantasy you can have more moral complexity and a more interesting fantasy world with something like Game of Thrones.    I certainly agree that most people in the modern era like a little shade of grey to their heroes: they want them to be either an outcast, a rebel, or some kind of anti-hero. So they prefer the X-Men, Batman, and Spiderman types to the goody two shoes Superman/Captain America types. (I do too)   Cat's Cradle is my favorite. It's even better than SH5 somehow.      He doesn't have the authority to do that.   Batman doesn't have the authority to do anything. He's a private citizen. All his activities are basically illegal. (He goes far beyond what's legal in citizen's arrests or citizen crime prevention.)    They are often considered that way, I agree. Like they get lumped in with SF on IMDB's top movie rankings and stuff   To be more clear, I'm not saying the fantasy has to involve getting public credit. The twist that you DESERVE public credit but the stupid public doesn't understand (ala Batman or X-Men) is just a version of the same thing.     seem to appeal more than patriarchs like Captain America and Superman.  What are you basing that on? The Captain America and Iron Man films were HUGE successes, and the 2 most popular superhero films ever are far and away the 2 Avengers films, where Captain American and Iron Man are basically the leads.   I think the fact that Superman's last couple films haven't been reviewed that well is just that they are bad movies, not anything about the character's lack of appeal.   There is certainly an appeal to the X-Men/Spider-Man "losers who turn out to be heroes" school. For sure. But that doesn't really have anything to do with what I'm saying. I'm saying the fantasy tends to be about an individual saving the day, as opposed to a community empowering itself or a hero spreading power to the disenfranchised. Like, you never see a superhero film where Iron Man gives technology to the inner city poor or Spider-Man helps lead a revolution.   That's all fine. Superhero films don't have to do everything. But it's a narrow, individual fantasy.    Yeah uh... sure. The comedian's point was that Batman is written as a right wing fantasy: a rich white CEO who beats up street criminals with "broken windows" theory of city saving.   Look, I like Batman, but nothing you are saying is disagreeing with the guy's point. You are just saying how Batman comics are written to be that way. Yes, I know they are written to be that way. That's kind of the point. Batman isn't a real person, the writers could have written him differently.    yes, whoops!   Honestly feel that the rise in superheros movies has more to do with general market dynamics than with anything about millenials or our current political situation.   Basically, movies are driven by the global market now and the only thing that does well in the global markets are flashy big budget action films that can be enjoyed across cultures even if you don't understand all the subtext.   On top of that, people flock towards familiar names, so turning widely known comic book characters who have been around for decades into movies is just the obvious course.   I'd lump these Superhero films in with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and the rest of the big budget action franchises in this regard. The trend is towards that more than superheros per se.    I don't mean that as an insult?   I just don't understand thinking, "I'm tired of all these big budget action films about people with super powers overcoming evil... can't wait for Star Wars!"    Oh come on, 99.99% of the time Batman is beating up on street crime or organized crime types. He is almost never going after corrupt politicians or CEOs polluting the world. Even rich guys like Penguin operate mostly street crime operations in most batman comics.    how was his comment a straw man? the majority of conservatives DO think gay people shouldn't marry, and major GOP politicians talk about it all the time. That's not a straw man, that's an accurate description of the standard conservative position!   I mean... sure, but there are still degrees. And as a fantasy, there is a difference between say fantasizing about a world where women don't have to worry about being raped and fantasizing about a world where you, the big strong man, saves every woman and gets to be the hero.    Yes, it general it is best to be consistent with your story elements.    And what makes it more of a SF adventure than The Avengers? The only real difference is the trappings--(more) space travel, (more) alien races, (more) flying ships--not anything inherent to the genre really. Or at least I can't see what the difference is beyond the trappings.    but the same problem persists here. There are tons of people who actually think Littlefinger or Cersei or Tywin or even Joffrey are "misunderstood" and actually horoes we should be rooting for. (Believe me, I spend too much time in ASOIAF fandom and I see this all the time.)   People aren't just drawn to shitty characters because they are well crafted, but realize they are monsters. They often root for the monsters.    But notice how it's "I wish I had the power to save people and be a big hero!" and not "I wish I had the power to empower other people." The superhero fantasy is ultimately a selfish one, one about saving people and getting all the credit and feeling good about your powers... not about working to create a better world or helping to empower the disenfranchised.    No, I'm saying "good vs. evil movies featuring special individuals with super powers" are superhero films.   What makes the Guardians of the Galaxy different from Star Wars? One is called a superhero film only because it started out in comics first, but the structure of them is basically the same. Even the feel and style are the same with those two examples.    I've read a shitload of comics in my day, and they are pretty simplistic 99.999999% of the time.       Sure, but I don't think that the appeal of Iron Man or any other comic film has to do with Tony Stark's position on tariffs or school vouchers. It's just the power fantasy, and fun to see big explosions.   Also, on a narrative level having an individual overcome enemies through their own boot-strappiness is always going to work better for a story. So when you are writing about superheros fighting governments or rival armies or whatever, it's always going to lean to this right wing individualism thing.    I feel like if you try to apply "hard SF" standards to most science fiction you'd end up deciding no science fiction is really SF. I mean, Dune or The Left Hand of Darkness or The Martian Chronicles or almost anything you can name are basically just fantasies set in space.    Sure, and Harry Potter could also be argued to be a superhero film of sorts. Certainly, for the purposes of Moore's critic, it is equally childish and simplistic.    That's true! But I still think the basic structure of a Star Wars kind of film is very similar to a superhero film: seemingly normal human discovers they have amazing powers and have to use them to defeat some evil force.   I'd still prefer the Star Wars type film because you get cool aliens and sets and stuff. Guardians of the Galaxy was my favorite Marvel film, and it was basically just a Star Wars film.    No no, I meant some of the other posts in this thread about how it's "REALLY about being disabled" or it's "Really about not having self-esteem and thinking you are a bug" or it's "Really about.." this or that.    maybe, although aren't the star wars movies basically just SF superhero films? The Jedi have super powers, they save the world from evil bad guys... it's all the same stuff basically.    Yes, if you don't focus on actual views and just represent the rich lifestyle people will love the fantasy. People want to be Tony Stark because he is a super rich playboy with fancy toys.    Superheroes really are pretty messed up if you try to think about them as anything other than children's fantasies. They are masked vigilantes with no control, oversight, regulation, or anything else to curb their destructive powers.   In comics, we can pretend it's all good because they are "good guys" but in the real world we'd never want individual humans with no oversight to be judge jury and executioner or use massive firepower in populated areas.     If this is the most famous short story in literary history, why hadn't I heard of it until I was an adult?  That seems like something with your education... although why do you think you should know about short stories as a child?   I think "The Metamorphosis" is clearly up there as one of the most famous short stories of all time. I'm not sure what would be more famous... maybe "The Dead" by James Joyce?   folk tales aren't really considered "short stories" though, and they don't have single iterations. Plus most of those fairy tales in Grimm's collections aren't that famous themselves, they have famous adaptations in film but most people don't read the tales in written form.     Though I'll agree that the literal, the symbolic, or the metaphorical readings are probably all as valid as each other as far as this story goes.  Great art should be read on ALL these levels. But suggesting that one simplistic and children's book level morality reading of the story ("it's about how you should be yourself!" or whatever) is the "real" meaning of the story shows how much we fail students in English class. That's now how fiction should be read.     After saying this in a different way after those questions, the ones presenting never got it, they kept saying he was a bug, or insect.  They were correct! He is quite literally a bug in the story. Not sure why that's hard to grasp.  have you read Kafka's other work? Almost all of it involves the surreal and the fantastic. These weird goings on are "literally" happening in the same way there are literally dragons in Game of Thrones or there is literally a man with giant wings in Gabrial Garcia Marquez.      I answered saying that insects breathe through their skin, and he couldn't actually let out a breath if he was one.   Then how do you explain his ability to crawl up the wall? The fact that Kafka didn't know the anatomy of beetle breathing is more likely a mistake (or a mistranslation on the translator's part).    So if Kafka's character was actually a huge bug, then why would his family or sister take care of him? how would she know it was him?  Only his sister takes care of him, his parents try to kill him and... succeed!     What did they think it was supposed to represent, how much people hate bugs?  Most authors don't write things that are supposed to have simple singular meanings and some easy 1 to 1 representation. The story doesn't "represent" something, it deals with multiple themes and has multiple meanings.     Their argument was that Kafka wrote such straight-forward pieces the rest of the time, that this was his venture into the fantastic  waaaah? Kafka wrote straight-forward pieces?   What Kafka are you referring to? The Trial and the Castle both have completely surreal bureaucracies. A Report to the Academy has an ape turning into a gentlemen to avoid the zoo. "A Country Doctor" is the height of the fantastic and surrealism, weirder than any Dali painting.    basically all of his stories have the fantastic and aren't straight forward at all?   It's worth remembering that Kafka DID publish a lot of work during his life, including The Metamorphosis. Presumably, he was only tasking Brod with burning his unfinished manuscripts and his letters and such, not asking him to go burn every copy of his alreayd published books (which wouldn't be "unread")   Fantastic story, but honestly I think a lot of Kafka's other stories are even better. I believe Kafka felt the same way, that the Metamorphosis wasn't his best.    Canon is just anything that happens that "counts" in the world, so I think what you mean is not canon but backstory and exposition? It definitely drags down the pacing of a book to put too much of that in the text.   Even a writer like Tolkien who was obsessed with his world remembered to stick a lot of his backstory in the Similarion where most readers wouldn't bother with it, so LOTR doesn't get too bogged down.        When I write, should I lean for a more "neutral" text, or more of something that the character would say?  There is no "should" or "shouldn't" here. Lots of amazing books come from an omniscient or neutral 3rd person POV, and lots of other amazing books use what is called "close 3rd person" or "free and direct speech" (that's when you dip into the characters heads, and thus speak more child-like when using POV of child).   There is no right or wrong though, it depends on how you like to write and what you want to achieve.       Good writing is original, and you need to know what is unoriginal to be able to do something new.   So yeah, I think it is good to know the general tropes and try to understand how you can tweak or change them.                Let me note here that I actually don't even like Franzen's work much, it just isn't for me. I don't care about realist depictions of the American middle class. Snore.   BUT I don't think any of Franzen's hate is about his fiction, which is wildly popular among readers despite the claims of him being a snooty highbrow elitist. It is all about his persona in interviews and in essays.    Franzen is basically hated because he's a grumpy opinionated guy who is willing to state his opinions even if it means getting people mad. He doesn't play the "like/reblog/share!" economy of modern technology where it pays to be super positive about books and authors all the time... unless you are attacking one of the preapproved targets like EL James or, well, Franzen.   I don't even like Franzen's work much, but the hate he gets is silly.   What are the roots? There are two main ones  1) In the early 00s he picked a fight with experimental and literary authors essentially arguing that good fiction is popular with readers and follows conventional narrative structure, and posing experimental literature as some kind of threat to good fiction. A lot of experimental writers took issue with this, especially because... why bother picking on writers that so few people read anyway? How are experimental writers a "threat" to reading when most people have never even picked up a single book of experimental writing?   2) The Oprah Book Club debacle where he expressed some ambivalence about being picked for the club, worrying that he'd be read as a beach read instead of as a serious work of fiction. This got him accused of sexism and cemented his reputation as an elitist literary snob.... despite item 1).   So. After the above, Franzen was kind of hated by BOTH the postmodern/experimental/forward thinking lit world AND the populist/middle brow fiction world. Not a great position to be in.   Then two pretty crappy chick lit writers, Picoult and Wiener, decided to boost their own careers by whining about how Franzen was getting too much attention for FREEDOM and claiming it was proof of both sexism and of "popular fiction" being overlooked. There IS plenty of sexism in literature, but the second claim is pure nonsense because Franzen is a massively best-selling author. The Corrections and Freedom both are in the top 10 year-end best seller lists... no Picoult or Weiner books are. So by their own logic, he should be getting far more attention.   Anyway, both of them have big twitter followings so they convinced an army of chick lit fans that Franzen was this evil literary snob. So now he was hated by the high brow/experimental set, the middle brow/Oprah populism set, AND the low brow chick lit world.   After that, every time Franzen whines about something--and to be sure, he does whine a lot--(twitter, global warming, whatever)--or says anything negative about an author (DFW, Salinger, Edith Wharton) he gets a swell of hate from all sides.  If he'd just sat back and been positive about everything and cheered everyone on, no one would hate him.     Franzen is a huge seller whose last two books rank up with King and Patterson on year end best seller list. It makes no sense to say average readers don't like his books   An apostrophe s is always either a contraction or a possessive. It's Palmettos          Historical authors do this all the time. People can and do get mad, but you certainly wouldn't be alone in doing so      what's the lowest price listed on amazon?       those are all pronounceable! Plus they serve the purpose of actually sounding alien   Word is correct in this case. If you have a character speaking and you want to render their colloquial dialogue, you can maybe use her, but the correct grammar is "she"   I think that some applications will count hyphenated words and contractions as either single or two words. I've also heard some applications either count or don't count numbers.  So "I've got 2 word-counting programs" could either be 4, 5, 6 or 7 words depending on how the application counts.    Yeah, there are tons of industries built on exploiting people's dreams.   One thing really weird/sad about self-publishing is that scammers, corporations, and crooks have managed to infect all sides of it. Writers get tricked into the kind of services in this link, while readers have to contend with "books" that are 20 pages long flooding the market and purchased Amazon reviews.         I expect every publishing company from Amazon to the big 5 to start doing this soon. Lots of money to be made it people's dreams. It's gross, but so widely practiced...          hmm, yeah not the best way to produce great literature   Indie bookstores have bounced back a little in the last few years, but only after they were closing down rapidly for most of last 15 years and I think the overall number of bookstores is still down since the big chains keep going out of business.    Yeah that is an idiotic article.   No matter what you think about the whole issue, Amazon is working to undercut prices to levels that aren't sustainable for print books and which put bookstores out of business leaving Amazon with a monopoly on distribution.   Now, you can certainly think the above is fine and say that ebooks are the future, print and physical bookstores should die, and that if Amazon becomes a monopoly another eretailer will emerge to compete. I've seen plenty of people here even argue that publishers should all die and serve no purpose. I disagree, but that's fine. Still,  it is certainly easy to understand "why publishers are hostile"!   I like it, but I think that his novels BLOOD MERIDIAN and CHILD OF GOD are even better      I've never been a systems analyst, but being a copywriter, social media manager, and so on can be just as soul crushing.   If your goal is to be a creative writer of some sort, my suggestion would be to get whatever job pays the best for the least and write your stories/memoir/novel on the side.   If you want to be a content writer, you can actually get paid pretty well to be on the staff of a place like Buzzfeed, Gawker, etc. But you'd have to spend a while building up a freelance portfolio--which pays much worse--before getting that kind of gig.   It's also possible to get good gigs as a copywriter or copyeditor, but again I think freelancing some is the best way to get there.             well, agree to disagree. This is one of the best selling books of all time. Shitty porn is rarely racking in as much money as Avatar or The Avengers, you know?    I'm certainly not "upset" about it, but I gotta disagree with you: lady porn can still have grammatically correct sentences and at least okay writing. 50 Shades really does read like it was written by someone whose second language is english and which was never edited. Just basica grammar and narrative logic are lost... and it's funny!               Best book!      Well we may just have to agree to disagree. Having worked some in film, the constraints of budget and other outside factors like shooting schedules for actors can drastically impact work. Scratch that, I'd say they ALWAYS impact every single TV show or film.   It's why TV shows do "bottle" episodes, or why certain segments of TV shows can be so much worse (example: the Dorne storyline in last season of Game of Thrones had a rush turnaround and much smaller film team).   Yeah, sure, of course all art forms get impacted by money and other factors, but a novelist will never have to write off a character because the actor lands a better gig or cancel their plan for an army of dragons because the FX budget can only make one. Those factors in film are huge.   But that doesn't mean film is better or worse than books. It's just one difference.          To be clear I'm not saying it is BETTER necessarily (although I think I agree with you) only pointing out that the FX budget does change what they can do.    If you want a good example of this, take Game of Thrones. It's the most expensive TV show ever and has a gigantic cast... yet it still has to drastically cut down set pieces, characters, and battles to be filmable. I guess I shouldn't say more without spoiler warnings, but if you've read the books you know what huge set pieces get left out for budget reasons.   And, again, that's with like the most popular and expensive show on TV. For more moderately budgeted work, you get even less.    but the difference is that filmmakers have the limits of their imagination AND the limits of budget.   I'm not sure what you mean by "detailed" but it is certainly true that books have unlimited scope in what they can depict in a way that films (at least non-animated ones) don't have.   That doesn't make books better or worse than films, it's just something different.    if you have readers, publishers will be interested.... however it might be tricky if what you want to sell is something in a genre where you are saying you don't have readers.    seems like a fun thing to do on a blog to build an audience      Yeah, totally. Part of the problem is that great genre fiction gets labeled literary. Even people like Kurt Vonnegut wind up in the lit section of bookstores   But that isn't all that literary fiction is. Plenty of non-naturalic,  non-real world writing is shelved in literary fiction: Kafka, Murakami, David Mitchell, all the Southern Gothic and Gothic writers, Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, etc.    Gotta respectfully disagree with you on the first point.  First off: "genre" means more than SF/Fantasy. Erotica, Romance, crime... plenty of genre work takes place in our world and there is no alternate world/timeline/ or anything else to juggle.   On the flip side, plenty of "literary" writers from Shakespeare to Kafka to Murakami use unreal elements in their literary fiction, so lit fiction can juggle the unreal too.    It's also intentionally cheap, the "pulp" stuff. Like bookstores are filled with "how to write [x] genre in 10 steps" and writers in certain reddit writing forums brag about being able to pump out 10 books a year using same formula.   And that's totally cool!  But always good to keep in mind there ARE great innovative genre writers in addition to those.    In addition to my other post, it's worth reminding your friend that much of what is "literary fiction" now used to genre fiction in genres that just don't exist anymore. Wuthering Heights is gothic fiction, Flannery O'Connor and Faulkner were Southern Gothic, Jane Austen wrote Novels of Manners, and so on and so forth.    I could type an entire book length reply here, but here is the TL;DR version:   "Genre" means multiple things. If by "genre" you mean formulaic pulp fiction that tries to be as generic as possible and repeat what's been done, then yes, that kind of genre fiction is less meaningful and artistic than great literary fiction. This kind of "genre" really does exist too, bookstores are filled with it.  BUT BUT BUT "genre" also refers to books that are every bit as artistic and meaningful as "literary fiction" but just happen to feature some tropes that we've clumped together and called a genre.   Ursula K Le Guin, Gene Wolfe, Raymond Chandler... great "genre" (2nd kind) authors are every bit as good as great literary authors.   Basically any line in 50 Shades of Grey      I'm just pointing out that book succeeded in being a #1 bestseller by Amazon's silly standards, if that is the book from the experiment.    Yes and no. It's true the mass market publishing industry uses a lot of ghostwriters, but they don't pump out 20 pages "books" ghostwritten by some schlub in Asia being paid 100 bucks.    Huh? HP Lovecraft didn't put out many books in his lifetime, much less ghostwritten ones.    James Patterson has a ghostwriting team that does all his books, even the non co-authored ones. Open secret in the publishing world.    #1 in Kindle Store  Kindle eBooks  Romance  Historical Romance  Ancient World #1 in Kindle Store  Kindle eBooks  Literature   Fiction  African American  Historical   I find this totally fascinating and creepy   You are totally right, but this also feels kinda pedantic. I've worked as a copywriter, freelance writer, social media content writer, and so on and those jobs bare little relation to fiction. Yeah, technically words on paper, but it's like saying you can still have a job as a "director" by making flash animation advertisements, or you can still have a career in "music" by programming the playlists in department stories   yeah, I have several in the air at all times... unless one comes out really quickly.             and true of anything, not just writing. Like, you can love sports or acting or whatever and still not make it broadway or the NBA         yes, but even more in /r/writing and the writing subreddits       Do what you love passionately and competitively, and the money will come.  This sounds nice, but obviously not true. Most wannabe artists don't end up making any money, and even many of the greats died in poverty only to have their work discovered or get popular after death  	200

Here's a great answer by /u/holdoffhathcock:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3djsya/soldiers_of_reddit_what_is_something_you_wish_you/ct68lra?context=3  You have to memorize a truly, truly exhausting amount of information and be able to make calculations on the fly. You'll probably carry a calculator wherever you go as well as a little notebook full of tables. Some guys glue their notes to the stock of their rifle.  Look at the problem of putting a bullet on target at 300-400 meters, which is a little bit longer than a city block. At that distance, it's more or less point of aim point of impact, which means you don't have to do any adjusting, just point and shoot, pow. Past 500 meters, things start getting fun, and past 800 is basically magic. At that range, you're not pointing your rifle at the target. At that range, you're aiming at the air above it and somewhat off to the side. A bullet doesn't arc up and down like a basketball.  Gravity pulls down on the projectile as soon as it leaves the barrel. Air resistance pushes against the projectile, slowing it and sloughing it off to the side. The density of the air does the same thing, and makes the curve more lopsided and steep. How high above sea level you are has a huge effect on the path of the bullet, at higher altitudes, the projectile will travel farther and faster. Humidity has to be accounted for, for the same reason. Temperature, not only the ambient temperature but the temperature of the propellant in the ammunition you're loading. A bullet that has been warmed in the sun is going to hit about 20 inches higher at 1000 meters than a cold bullet. The rifling spins the projectile, at a 12 inch twist it will make a full rotation once for every 12 inches of travel. This means at 1000 meters it's going to spin about 3600 times, and the spin makes it drift to the side, sort of like a curveball if you like baseball comparisons. Are you aiming uphill or downhill? Aiming downhill you'd probably guess you need to aim a little lower, and you'd be right. But you also aim low while firing up-grade.  That's all math, that can be accounted for and adjusted for pretty simply with practice. It's wind. Wind is the motherfucker. A soft breeze will push you way off target when you're shooting out past 500 meters. But, when the projectile travels past 500 meters, the air it travels through isn't going to be the same that whole way down range. Think about the way a bird floats on swirls of hot air, and imagine trying to make a bullet travel a straight line through a whole series of those. Maybe where you're standing the wind is 3.5mph traveling north. Well, 300 meters out the wind is pushing in the opposite direction. 500 meters out it's blowing harder. 800 meters out there's dead air, and at 1200 meters there's a draft off the side of a tall building. There's no way to account for that, so you learn to scan your environment and make educated guesses. Watching the way dust and trash blows down the street, and watching the way laundry flutters while it dries on a balcony. Watching the direction grass and trees are bent in the breeze. You have to visualize this bizarre corkscrew of wind patterns that you want to shoot through.  You're still not done! Have you fired your rifle recently? Because a clean cold bore shot will come out slightly different than a warm shot, after the inside of the barrel gets coated with copper from the path of the bullet. You're constantly zeroing your weapon, finding out how it digests different loads of ammunition at different temperatures. And again, the temperature of the bullet is going to affect the path.  So we'll take a shot at 1250 meters. Pretend we're using an M24 with M118LR cartridges that came from a cool, dry place. You know your zero, you crank the bullet-drop compensator as high as it will go, to 1000 meters, calculate the ballistic correction for the extra 250 meters, which is probably going to be another good 9 feet, so you'll hold off using the dots on your reticle, which means you're aiming with the little dots below the crosshair instead of dead center. Slightly off to the side to compensate for the spin you know is happening, and what you guess is sort of going to happen when the wind throws it off balance. You're ready, you pull the trigger.  In the space between pulling the trigger and the propellant igniting, which is 22/1000th of a second, the average walking pace puts a person an inch away from where they were when you fired. If they're running, they move about two inches. For simplicity's sake, let's pretend your target isn't moving. 1250 meters is far enough for a bullet to float above the ground for several seconds, which means the earth rotates underneath the projectile and causes it to hit off-center even more than if it weren't beaten by wind, cutting through the air, fighting humidity, and everything else.  After all that, it's going to be an absolute miracle if you hit your target on the first shot. You're probably going to miss. Luckily, you have a spotter who can watch the path of the projectile and tell you exactly what adjustment to make before firing again. You're almost always going to fire two or three times at extreme distances before you actually hit what you're aiming at. But "sometimes one shot, sometimes one kill" doesn't look as cool on a t-shirt.                  *ahem* **The** Victor.      You don't burn your hand on the stove.                                    It doesn't really have to. With that much platinum available it would become feasible to develop fuel-cell batteries for electric vehicles. What I'd do is partner with a bunch of car companies in an equity-for-materials exchange (e.g. Tesla) where I became the supplier of the platinum and they give me stock instead of cash. Refuse to partner with anyone who doesn't give you favorable outcomes, while leaving enough on the table for friendlies to profit. With the cash you'd encourage R D into fuel-cell technology with the goal of putting a fuel-cell vehicle in 20% of American homes by Year 10.   Keep in mind you already have the reputation of being the first company to harvest materials from a gigantic space asteroid, that's guaranteed to give you brand equity. Pump a few stories each year in the media on fuel-cell battery progress, get the first electric vehicles rolling off the assembly line in 5 years. Pretty sure all the stock in companies you exchanged your asteroid for will skyrocket. Continue development into heavy vehicles, promote a CO2 free future agenda, and continue expanding on your 20% monopoly. You'll probably be a trillion dollar company in 30 years.   As far as how a government could profit, you'd do the same except that your target would be a net 1% increase in GDP instead of stock ownership in car companies.   Started out as a baby. Now I'm 6 feet tall.      It is in every conceivable way. With small businesses you're starting from the bottom up with an arbitrary goal, without any meaningful way to quantize what you set out to achieve. You're basically running on hope. With a big business, or at least an SME in a dominant local position, you can say with reasonable certainty that we'll make X dollars on Y date. With a small business you're at the mercy of the business gods, e.g. big retailer moving in and draining demand, economic crisis sapping the pockets of your would-be customers, fire started two blocks down blocking the street, bad publicity from unrelated event halfway around the world, Paypal blocking your account for 90 days, etc. Ever heard stories of Greek mortals trying to defeat the gods of Mount Olympus? It's not an inaccurate representation. With business, it's more about luck and persistence than it is about actual finance.  You hear a lot about the heroes who survived; you never hear about those who died in vain.

The Outsider CEOs  Its Earnings That Count       I'm a longtime Apple shareholder. Apple's only major asset right now is the iPhone and associated assets like brand. iPad/Mac doesn't really have room to grow. Apple Pay isn't going to kill anyone anytime soon, and its contribution to bottom line for the medium term is negligible. Apple Watch isn't going to be the next paradigm. I say this with the authority of someone with a decade of tech experience.  At this point you can kinda expect growth to be powered exclusively by the iPhone and buy backs. I'm giving it about 9% EPS growth going forward. Unless there's a new development I'd say the 17x P/E is a pretty accurate valuation.   Google on the other hand is killing it, with sustainable 15-20% EPS growth going forward. They're pretty much like Visa or MasterCard in the FCF department. They also rely on only one thing to power earnings, but Search is such a huge moat I don't worry about it. The only problem is the high P/E of 28. That puts it pretty much on par with AAPL as an investment.    ...about what?   Why are you still here??   Gesundheit    In what way is this passive aggressive?

He's all smiles making $5 a day (!) and his kids finally get to go to school again!   I see, thanks a lot! This was exactly the kind of answer I was looking for.   I guess I mean bourses? like BATS, but listed?   That's a scientist not an accountant. Traitor!   Found one which looks pretty attractive       OK thanks for the correction. I guess what I meant was how does one analyze exchanges?   It's fine, I find that passionate people make better investors than professionals. Yeah I'm doing that now, just want to get some feedback from others who have done the same. At this point profits seem to mainly depend on: i) volume/activity, and ii) tracking the stock market in general. So when it's up it's up, and when it's down it's down. It can't be as simple as that, so I wanted to ask if there is anything I might be missing.   Magikarp used Flail! Mewtwo fainted!         I'm thinking the main one is frequency of activity. Anyone else researched exchanges?      Remember to time it just as the F-16 passes.   There's actually a good reason for this. The medical logistics system is extremely fractured and messed up. It may seem like there's one cohesive system with programs like Medicaid in place, but it's more of an umbrella of a thousand little fiefdoms (hospitals) than a single kingdom (government). Each of these hospitals closely guard their costs so that they can remain competitive, while suppliers individually negotiate with each hospital to secure the best prices. It's a cutthroat world in medicine; if your prices were known publicly while others kept theirs secret, you would quickly go out of business as suppliers and customers picked and chose.   As a result, literally nobody, not even the government, can pinpoint the actual average market price for a particular strain of medicine. That's why you get very different prices for the same medicine between different states; you can even see huge spreads between hospitals in the same state. Add to this the fact that medical aid isn't exactly a price elastic market - if I break an arm, I'm not going to go to a hospital in the next city just because it's cheaper there.   Since the insurance companies don't know the average prices, they have to model their risks based on the price quoted by the highest hospital. As a result, insurance becomes very expensive; so the hospitals adapt to the insurance environment by billing the maximum amount possible. Billing the actual costs isn't feasible if they are to recoup what they pay for insurance; and it isn't feasible for insurance companies to provide coverage at the level mandated by governments by modelling risks on median costs. This creates a vicious cycle where hospital bills and insurance prices become grossly inflated, but nobody wins. Add to this the fact that provision of medical aid is mandatorily and vigorously encouraged by the government, and you have very little incentive for the market to withdraw to a lower price level.   tl;dr: it's not a problem with any particular individual; it's just the way the system is. The only way to correct prices is to publicly publish prices in all hospitals; good luck with that.                           	171
    Meanwhile, in 'MURICA, women don't have the right to paid maternity leave for giving birth to actual human babies.    Hell, if you want to be really "fancy" make your own pasta - you have eggs and flour, which is all you need. With $10 you can be pretty liberal with whatever sauce/topping you want. You could do a classic tomato sauce - be sure to get San Marzano tomatoes, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. Or something like brown butter with sage and mushrooms. I mean literally anything.

Long story short, the Japanese government banned graphic representations of penises. As a work around, the already existing erotica industry created the tentacular substitute.   Coat hangers are my personal nemesis.   They always get tangled in impossible ways and never behave the way that I think they should. I've broken a lot. And thrown piles of them around in rage.

Afterwards, we were outside waiting for a shuttle. I, being tired and bored, leaned against a pole. A car full of dudes drove by and yelled "HOW MUCH?" to me. I didn't even know what they meant. My mom had to explain to me about stereotypical prostitute poses and what they may signify. I was mortified.     I remember being on a JAL domestic flight in the early 2000s and it was actually on the very last day that smoking was being allowed on airplanes. This had the effect of every smoker trying to smoke as many cigarettes as humanly possible. I remember the dude getting well into his second pack - just going from one cigarette to the next.    Is that a yatsuhashi stuck in the side!? My favoriiiiiiiiite!!    I've heard more than one say that he is a young Sami   I have a legitimate question. And I'm too afraid to actually google it.   Is each waifu pillow unique? Like could two people run into each other with the same pillow? And then would they create an elaborate twin fiction? Or can you customize it?    I sometimes do this to my husband. And my cats.   Can we appreciate the dude on the left's cheekbones? Damn.    I have been to plenty of onsen and ofuro, where, depending on the size, you could be with anywhere from 5-20 people. And yeah, not a big deal. It was the best, really.   I have been hanging out naked with probably upwards of 250 people. Maybe more.  This was in a magical place called [SPA WORLD](http://www.spaworld.co.jp/english/).   It is a huge 8 floor building in Osaka, Japan. The main attraction is the "Onsen from Around the World." There are two separate floors, one is themed to different Asian spas, and the other is European themed. And depending on the day, one will be for women, and the other for men.   So the day I went, women got Europe. There were hot tubs, onsen, ofuro, saunas, cold baths, weird showers - all of them themed to different countries. The place is huge - you can walk around for hours and still not try every type of bath. I remember their was a a fancy Parisian-type bath next to a cafe where you could have a croissant or cappuccino. The Finnish one had a sauna and a cold pond. And everyone is naked. Even the cafe.   I think there's a kid's water park (be-swimsuited), and some other stuff there too. But you go their for the glorious, naked, global onsen.    Oh god yes. I tried in vain to make this point to a friend. He kept waiting for the "perfect moment" to express his romantic feelings for a woman. I urged him for *months* to just do it and stop trying to create a movie scene. The perfect moment never came and she got back with her ex, and moved to New Zealand.    I have done the same thing. I had just met up with some friends when someone decided to surprise jump on  a friend's back. They tripped and the jumper went face first into the pavement. Folks wanted to call an ambulance, but since she hadn't lost consciousness and I was able to rule out a concussion (I had up to date first aid training) I convinced them not to call an ambulance and I took her to the emergency room myself.    OMG, this is irrelevant to the cuteness of your puppy - but I HAVE THE SAME MUG AS YOU. It's from Starbucks probably over a decade ago. It's technically a Christmas mug but I think it's so pretty I keep it in the cabinet year round. The other Christmas mugs get jealous, but I tell those creepy nutcrackers that they should just be less creepy and maybe they would get to stay too.    He has already played him, albeit briefly, in the ["Maya Angelou Prank Show" Sketch](https://screen.yahoo.com/maya-angelou-prank-show-000000680.html).    How is this not the top comment? This isn't fucking rocket science!  Full disclosure I'm a lady with lady parts, not man parts. But I have long pondered why men just don't use toilet paper. Also, dear /u/GregtheMad has indicated that he uses the "normal toilet," presumably in a stall. Why don't urinals have stalls? There seems to be so much anxiety over people standing next to you, watching, etc. JUST PUT UP WALLS. Why is it necessary that you pee in front of each other?  I JUST DON'T GET IT.     Generally, we know more about history now - mostly in part due to the advancements of technology and the widespread availability of information.  1450 happens to be right around the time Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press which revolutionized how information was spread in the Western World. The technology spread like wildfire in the first 50 years and became adopted all over the continent. Coincident with this, you have the greater availability of knowledge to a wider group of people. It is no coincidence that the spread of ideas and technology happened much quicker after the 1450s. (C.f. Protestantism, Age of Discovery, Age of Enlightenment, Revolutions across Europe, etc.)   Prior to this, in Western Europe, there was certainly knowledge of the past but it was typically only accessible to small groups of people, and even then, only a select amount of information. So, let's say you're a scholar in the 800's. You're probably a man, and you're probably a monk. The knowledge you have is contained in your monastery's library. You may have a hundred books, and that's pretty good. You may travel to a few other monasteries, and they may have some books that are different from yours, and you may be able to read them. And if you have a lot of time and money, you may be able to create a copy (by hand, remember), of that interesting book and take it back to your monastery. To make a codex/book at this point, you would need enough animals to make enough vellum for all the pages. You would need the time and labor to copy the book word by word. So you see, the information was quite limited, difficult to come by, and even harder to disseminate. There was a guy called Gilbert the Universal (died 1134, Gilbert Universalis), who was a bishop of London (1127) who was so named because he was widely judged to know pretty much everything. I think if anyone were to make that claim now-a-days, they'd be laughed out of town.  Things did get easier over the medieval period, as literacy, infrastructure, and the efficiency book production did improve. This was also helped by the foundation and development of universities.   I hope this helps answer your question - not a scientist, but a rare book and manuscript historian/librarian.  If you have any follow ups...hollaaaaa   He was super nice!      When I took my driver's ed test in North Carolina about a decade ago, I took it in my manual.    But hey, medieval studies actually did something practical! See dad? My degree chosen field of study has saved someone's LIFE.   At the end you can tell he's like, "shiiiiiit, that was on camera. STRAIGHT FACE IT UP, ABBOTT."   I know those people. If a horse were to whisper in their ear to murder their whole family, they would do it without question.   My husband and I have a plan to convince any children we have that horses are mythical creatures.   They are called "supertitles" because they are above the stage rather than below - 'super' being Latin for above. Conversely, subtitles mean that they are below the action (typically the case in tv shows, movies, etc.) - sub being Latin for below.   So - same thing, just different positioning! :)   My life, or rather death plan, is that if/when I reach a ripe old age and if/when I outlive my husband, I will get a one-way boat to Svalbard where I will promptly find some polar bears and snuggle them to death. My death.      Well, it could be worse. It could be one or two toothbrushes for three people.  Also, I keep trying to pluralize toothbrush to teethbrush.      Haha yeah, a testament to my passion for rare books and manuscripts I suppose..   Yeah I do! I love to pause it before they give their valuation and my husband and I try to guess correctly.   I think a lot depends on their expert. I've seen plenty where I think they are pretty accurate, but I've also seen some where, in my opinion, they've given very poor valuations. In particular, I saw one with a First edition of The Hobbit that was shockingly undervalued, especially since out had a near mint dust jacket (a big.deal with modern works). I had just seen one in worse condition sold at auction for much, MUCH more than what the appraiser told then. So as tricky as hard valuation can be, certain things, such as something with a good history of auction results and is perennially popular for the last few decades (i.e. The Hobbit) is easier to put a value on. But I suppose everyone has an off day :)  In general, the more unique something is, the harder it I'd to value. Manuscript collections are a devil to value...    Hi! I'm a rare books and manuscripts librarian/curator. I'm on mobile so I can't really do any research for you, but first off OP well done for keeping good care of your family's book! It looks to be in a presumably acid free box and that's just what you want. When looking at it try and make a cradle for it so the covers aren't bending the spine. We typically use big foam wedges for so etching of this size.  In terms of valuation, looking up books from around the same year won't give you a clear idea of its value. The Bible, like it or not folks, is the most printed book ever. There are thousands of editions of early Bibles, and their value can be determined by a lot of things such as it being the first Bible printed in a certain geographic place or the first edition to include a particular new translation, etc. So you see, the specific edition and year of publication can make a huge difference, for a second, third, or fourth edition printed someplace new, is not nearly as I interesting as the first edition.  Quality and other factors unique to the book are also important. Yours looks to be in quite lovely shape, but a detailed evaluation would have to be made to figure out the collational formula.* OP, is there any place in the book where someone has written a family tree or anything close? It maybe in an unexpected place. This can often be of interest to collectors. There are a lot of lovely graphics in your copy, which could also certainly be of interest to a buyer.  Long story still long, you aren't going to get a good valuation simply by googling. That being said, a complete codex from the 17th century is rad and its very wonderful that your family has kept good care of it. Get an appraiser to take a look at it if you want a value. Don't take it to a museum or library. We can't give you a value, its a conflict of interest.  One last word on value. Most people tend to want a hard and fast dollar amount for something. But rare books and manuscripts have their own markets that fluctuate and have their own trends. It can also be finding the right buyer. A lot of times dealers and auction houses are making educated guesses.  *a collational formula is a rendering of exactly how a book is gathered physically together. This tends to be pretty straightforward with modern publishing. So, for example, you might have a very logical 20 gatherings of 12 pages each. With old books, it is rarely so neat or tidy. You often find huge idiosyncrasies from gathering to gathering. Librarians do this for two main reasons: 1. It helps them to see what changes the publisher may have been making during the printing process. Often publishers would make edits and changes while in the middle of printing a single edition. 2. This allows us to figure out if/how a codex has been altered over time. Are pages missing, replaced, or added? This is the best way to find out.    I always preferred, "don't be a fool, wrap your tool!"   Ugh, as a former Barnes and Noble employee...this is about on par with finding porno mags hidden in an Algonquin dictionary.   	35

If the world's population moved to Texas it would have the same population density as NYC   So if we say there are ~7bn people in the world we need ~49bn trees?   Besides the fact that large forests are aesthetically pleasing and provide wood etc for use; how many trees would we need to survive in relation to the amount of oxygen they provide?   Is there a way to work this out?  How much oxygen is already in the atmosphere which would need to be used first before we were surviving off x number of trees?

 Both is ideal, but i honestly believe that real balance can only come from significant play testing by many different people.   I'm just surprised no one died.

There are serious weather consequences to a tidal locked planet. [This PDF talks a bit about it](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1405/1405.1025.pdf) - basically one side would be super-hot, one side super-cold, with a more-or-less tolerable but very windy area between the two.  Interestingly enough, the planet the Twi'leks in Star Wars hail from (Ryloth) is a tidally locked world.    I'm just excited to see a good becky plot.    Sometimes i do deluxe, but usually i just do the tier below that. It's so easy to find eggs via foraging that it's not awful to just spam it.    Yeah, suicide is a bitch. What's worse is that medication doesn't work for everyone :/   Stay strong though!    I gotta say, my grandmother's generation (born in the 30's) was light years different than my mother's generation (born in the 60's). I've never known anyone as selfish as baby boomers, and i've never known anyone as short-sighted, either.    If you'd want a rational critique, it's simply this:   Parenting is not an auto-pilot job. It's not a job where you can become complacent. They became complacent. They made bad choices that, at every turn, lead them to the negligent act. They choose to (evidently) exhaust themselves at a park. They chose to go take a nap. They choose not to double check the car. They chose to (apparently) take in the other kids, but not do a headcount, not even notice one of them was gone.  As to the strangeness of the 30 minutes they were giving CPR and on the phone with 911, i can offer no explanation at all, which is troubling.   This isn't a case of parents caught in the throes of some unavoidable situation; it's not a situation that could not be avoided or that any parent could have happen. This was parents who were over-extending themselves, complacent in their duty, and who failed to practice common sense and good policy.   It was a fully avoidable, negligent death. Hell, their response to finding her might be negligent on it's own, depending how the 911 situation shakes out.    i'm surprised he didn't thrash around enough to unplug it; that had to be so painful and so awful.    Simple: it'd be cold as fuck, likely to be snowing, everyone would be out of the giving spirit, and the days would be incredibly short.    Sadly you're probably spot on about damon. Damn shame, too.  Zoe-Zig forever. It'd be way, way better than any tired gang storyline.   I suspect it won't be around long as story arcs go.   Honestly i don't mind Damon. The actor's working with some *awful* material but he does a decent job of it. He comes off as genuinely mean and genuinely threatening which is good. Plus, props to them for not just blackholing him.  The gang situation is so awful that i don't even know where to start complaining about it. It feels incredibly forced, as though they were desperate for some way to drive drama for Zig. Frankly they should have just set up a love plot for him, as it'd be more believable and less credulity-straining.    Would depend how they were displayed if i'd like it or not.   cheap nursing home hell - i'd throw her out in the street the week after christmas without a coat and tell her she's on her own. She'd probably make it to a homeless shelter, maybe.    Well, for example, the new principal and the rules. That's an immovable object. They have to find some way to deal with/change the rules, that doesn't involve direct confrontation or talking about it or what have you; it'll take some kind of clever or fortuitous solution instead of a natural solution.   The gangs' the same way: Zig is powerless against the gang, and all of his normal mechanisms for coping with things don't work. So he'll have to create some new method (or some outside person will have to step in, as has happened before).   It's cheap story telling because it doesn't work to the characters strengths, and it doesn't move any kind of emotional or psychological plot forward. It's just straight up "Solve this problem, but not as you normally would"   I'm sure there's some proper name for it in storytelling, but i always call it "whoever vs. Immovable object"; it comes up all the time in all sorts of storytelling situations.   Their pretty awful about it. I understand why they do it - they want the show to seem topical (and for people to talk about the show in the future for how dated it'll sound) but it often comes off as very very forced.    Eli's a lot more tolerable than most of the people on the show, that's for sure. He's one of the very few who has an actual personality and real interests, instead of just being kind of a cut-out that gets put in various places and situations.  I am curious who'll replace eli/claire with the new network.   i have no clue; i long ago tried figuring out anything about how TeenNick conducts it's business, they seem to be more like weather than like any kind of rational entity.   need to see Season 14, Episode 13 *and* Season 14, Episode 14 for it to make sense, which were both aired last night. If Teen Nick posted both? That i cannot guess.   SE IV, i recommend adamant mod.   It's always a shame when someone takes their own life. Tomorrow might have been a better day.   If ever there was a news story for them, this'd be it.   There was blood on the walls and ceiling and he had suffered serious injuries from an electric saw, which was near his body and still plugged in.  Good grief, what a way to go. To be that desperate must be truly unfathomable.   Hopefully where ever he is, it treats him better than this life did.    Absolutely fucking vile, i was totally baffled how someone could even be so callous.   stealing the money for herself is pretty scummy, but that just took it to a new level for me.   I'm of the opinion that people should use what advantages they have in life to get ahead. I generally operate on the principal that people don't do things altruistically; if someone flirts with me i figure their after something, whatever that may be.    Yeah i'm the problem with society, not the people who side with negligent parents instead of a dead kid. Keep on trying to convince yourself of that.    best of all once he crashes the local housing market (by bringing in non-millionaires) he can do whatever the fuck he wants because the rich people will move out.   No, i'll find a way, just might be delayed.   Tiny getting shanked surprised me greatly. The gang situation is absolutely ludicrous, and is just another example of "kids vs. immovable object".   Hopefully! the rest of the season is pretty intense, as would be befitting.    I dunno, i keep hearing about this vast army of Eli-Claire Fanatics, but they never seem to show up here in any volume, and we're one of the largest communities.   They need to just quietly sunset the couple and have them go off to new york or something.      If thinking with "more complexity" means "giving a pass for blatent negligence leading to the death of a two year old" i'll take a pass, thank you.   As to your frustration, well - i hope other people don't frustrate you, or you might get violent with them. But it'd be their fault, right? They should know not to frustrate you so much.    I'm actually legit surprised there isn't a type of demo derby that has remote controlled cars.    if they could control steering, brake, and gas, they could finally achieve the greatest dream of any car owner: they could drive all the jeeps to the scrapyard, into the scrapper, and dispose of them properly.    Real life, Paul Bernardo. Decent looking, charming, and a notorious  serial rapist and (later) serial killer. Pretty much every book about the case goes to lengths to mention how well-regarded he was.   In fiction, i'd guess the prototypical serial rapist-as-charismatic-monster would be Krug from Last House on the Left. He's good looking, charming, and also a sadistic monster. Same with the lead attacker from I Spit On Your Grave (both versions + the sequel).    I think degrassi is at it's worse when it's "kids vs. external force", and this entire episode set was basically that. They should have spent more time on Lola/Winston/etc and less time on claire/eli who almost everyone is tired of. The new principal plot is a lame macguffin.   Other than that, though - not bad episodes, just not what i was hoping for for the season premier, i guess.     Yep. What's amazing to me is that that's a pretty significant action for something as small as a roach to take, but they do it all the time; it'd be like me or you hiking 20 miles to a new house. Crazy that they'd even know it was time to go, let alone where to go to!   yeah, designers have a vested interest in keeping everything the same. After all, if you've got an empire built on simple, easy-to-use rules, you don't want to rock the boat by suddenly saying that maybe the existing methods aren't so great and need to be revised or discarded. That's not the kind of talk that gets you tenure, after all.   I love the shutter sound, so it works out for me. Plus it's nice to know it actually took a picture instead of not; my fucking camera is totally silent, and i never know if it actually took the photo or just pretended to.   Probably perfectly legal in most places in the US, although it's the kind of thing that the cops would not be amused at finding.   Amusing story:   For about 100 years, my town had this old, abandoned, decaying church that was sitting there rotting. The inside was so bad that it was full of pigeons who had melted into the floor as they decayed.   So the town fathers decide to demo the (increasingly health-hazardous) building. They level the place with bulldozers, push everything into the basement, and then shovel dirt on top hauling off whatever wouldn't fit in the basement cavity.  Sure as shit, *every house* on the block got rats and mice, for three years running.   I've always admired rats, because their just so good at surviving and thriving in the very worst environments. I just don't want them near me.   Got that right. A private subreddit is deniable, and not apt to draw much media attention. So the admins are probably pretty OK with them existing.   It's already been done before, by better authors.    True crime writing is full of uh...interesting personalities and views. I'm not at all surprised the guy's a little off.       Better man than I. I see some asshole in a swastika shirt in distress, i'm gonna develop a sudden inexplicable blindspot and find somewhere else to be involved.    I would still contend there's a difference between "what people are used to seeing" and "what is good design".    Probably mental illness of some kind. The only real issue would be why she didn't get/seek treatment, and what we can do to prevent incidents like this in the future.    My only concerns are if they were stored in a way that was both safe and secure. I'm not even sure what'd happen with that much ammo and a housefire, but i bet it's not good.    Doesn't surprise me at all. Post-Partum mental illness is very real and very scary.   Brutal. TeenNick has screwed this show so hard it's almost unbelievable. They really must be some bridge-burning assholes.   Amusingly, having the show on their site was the *one and only way* they could monetize me watching the show, and they blew it. I would sit through every (repetitive, bullshit) ad just to support them putting it up on the net for free.   i would be surprised if it was only a million worth of stuff - that's a LOT of ammunition, depending on caliber, and an enormous pile of guns. Makes me wonder what the story behind it is; that's way past a casual collection, and into the realms of either a serious almost obsessive collector or someone running a business.    I always feel it's important to represent the null stance, and to remind readers that their not alone in not really caring who gets precious internet pennies of video views.    *shudders* that sounds absolutely awful.  It's amazing the conditions people can live (and even thrive) in, though - and i bet the kids who grew up there almost never get minor illnesses like colds or coughs.   incorrect assumption. Glossy magazines exist because - at the time they were invented - it was a cheap and easy way to produce content for people to consume. It isn't the case that people inherently like the format, it's just *what they are used to*; there is a difference between what a person's used to seeing and what's objectively good or bad from a design standpoint.   the real question is, should we even be replicating a glossy magazine? The magazine format is an artifact of the technology used to create it; i don't see any good reason we should be bound to it with new medium.    Perhaps it's the case that the developers of the software are idiots themselves, and that's why they don't set sane defaults.   I wonder what bizarre traditions have been forgotten over time, from armies long beaten and countries long erased?       "A record of     Our little lives     The clothes we wore     Our spoons our knives      The games of luck     Our soldiers played     The stones we cut     The songs we made"  - Leonard Cohen, "Nevermind"   This is more or less how i feel. It'd be a *tremendous* historical find (especially if it contradicted some of the history written in the Torah or expanded upon it) but i doubt most people would even care very much what it actually said, in terms of ritual and practices.  Not to mention, of course, many religions previously practiced quite terrible things, in antiquity, but have moved on from them since. If their not doing evil things now, the majority doesn't care about what they used to do.   Every time gawker takes a hit, an angel gets it's wings. They are trash-mongers of the first order.         It'll be interesting to see how it holds up over the long term, and how difficult it is to repair/upgrade. I'd also be kind of curious how it's ice/snow performance is as compared to asphalt.    I find the entire topic of combat videos and the morality thereof such a morass that the idea of "who makes money off it" is the bottom of the heap in terms of issues. It's such a tarball that i just don't think about any of it.   Yep. It's so frustrating this is gonna get swept under the rug because of who the victims and perpetrator are.   he opened fire at a building full of people hitting two of them; if that's not a mass shooting then i don't know what would be. Certainly  the FBI [would consider him](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/office-of-partner-engagement/active-shooter-incidents) an "Active Shooter".  What's frightening is that had he gone into the building where they were hiding in the bathroom, it could have been a repeat of the Adam Lanza shooting where a bunch of people got slaughtered in a bathroom.   I'm still having problems. I actually took a nap, hoping that would fix things, but no. MTV.ca tells me that my (canadian) VPN is not in their approved region, and teen nick doesn't have the episode yet, for me.   I'm staying zen though.   There's many a shady thing i have done under the guise of being a writer doing research, ever since stephen king recommended it in one of his books (maybe dolan's cadillac?)    ahh yes, resorting to name calling and violence, the mark of the reasonable, thoughtful person. You ever consider why you might have both anger issues and a desire to excuse negligence? It's something you might want to think about.   Finally got to watch the episodes. Comments below!    Imagine the outcry if instead of shooting homeless people, he shot at a school and used the same excuse. There'd be an unbelievable hue and cry, it'd be national news.    I'm just absolutely appalled at the article's overall tone. It's so insensitive it borders on the callous.  Also, if he wanted to kill homeless people, why would he shoot up a detox center where they are, by definition, *getting better* and on the road to recovery?  I dunno, i hope they throw the fucking book at this guy and give him the needle.   I'm here to watch people get blown up and to see combat stuff, and the politics or economics of that do not enter into the equation for me.       it's the UAE, odds of finding out anything bordering on the truth hover near zero.   I'm disinclined to give any organization with the size and reach of the catholic church the benefit of any doubt.   As to francis's behavior over time - i'm sure that's why they elected him, he's someone who's got a relatively clean record that's difficult to slander in the press. That he's from latin america certainly didn't hurt.    I remember when that happened; doesn't seem to be many updates on it.    keep telling yourself that.   I think ti's more likely that it's a slow race, news wise, and writing about anything is better than writing about nothing.    I'm a realist. The catholic church hemorrhages membership, it's demographics start looking pretty sour, and they have a spectacularly unpopular pope *and* a bunch of scandals.  Then suddenly, here shows up Pope GoodGuy(tm) who says everything that a disillusioned world wants to hear. He wants to win over the people with money, who are activism minded, who he knows will be a real benefit to the church if he can just but lure them back. So he goes and stumps for all the popular causes that the kids today love - the environment, global warming, populist movements, income inequality, blah blah blah.  It's laughably transparent, but reddit just keeps on falling for it.   Sure; and are they going to leave the church - and eternal salvation - over it? Or will they just suck it up and bear it like good catholics?   The thousands upon thousands of submariners around the world - who live and work under water for weeks to months at a time - beg to differ.  Plus the ISS is a *terrible* value for the money. The main science it's taught us is that humans do very poorly in prolonged zero-G and that it's obscenely expensive to keep them alive in space for any amount of time. Hell, the astronauts there spend *85% of their working hours on construction and maintenance of the station itself*. If that's not a statement of how impossible it is to practically keep people in space,  i don't know what would be.   They likely got disoriented and flew either into a remote location or into water. Even experienced pilots can get disoriented and end up going the wrong way for miles.   If the plane was anything like a [Cessna 140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cessna_140) then it would have a cruise speed of about 100 mph. Let's assume he pulls 80 average. that's a range of *240 miles* the plane could have gone down in.   That the wreckage hasn't been found says it's either high in a mountain, deep in a forest, or underwater. I'm voting underwater.   I mean really the bigger mystery would be if these two didn't meet a bad end due to ill-preparedness and lack of skill.    Don't worry, I've heard the message of cases like this loud and clear: i see some nutbar waving a knife around, i'm scooting out of there, and anyone who chooses to stay is on their own. I don't need the lawsuit, thanks.   Seems sensible to me. Here's hoping they never have to use them.   I am shocked that detroit stuff isn't bigger news, i thought sure it'd take off like fucking wildfire. It hits all of reddit's buttons!   Of course he won't be quiet - he still needs to get those asses in the pews, and the only way he can do that is if he's out there saying the crap that the people who've abandoned the church want to hear.    Got it in one. It's cost-neutral to have gay marriage and it actually makes money to legalize pot, but attacking climate change is a big money hit.  Also, of course, fixing america won't do anything if other countries in the world don't follow suit. It's possible they'd just buy our now very cheap coal and keep on burning away.      If it's like most personals sites, there's 10 actual users and 39,990 scam accounts.   Indeed so. It's crazy how much the world has changed in 20 years.    yeah, they lucked into a reporter willing to soft-ball the story and paint them in as good a light as possible. Lucky them.   A lot of people today absolutely do not remember/know how bad and awful crime used to be. We live in what amounts to a *utopia* compared to late 80's early 90's america.   correct.    you did not just insult Postal, one of the funniest fucking movies i have ever seen, did you?   I do not approve of vigilante justice, nor of using violence to resolve problems, but frankly when someone's been so clearly abandoned by the system, what are they to do? It seems there's no good answers, when you call the cops repeatedly and nothing gets done.   Congrats!!!!!!   Not only are there eggs, but they make the delicious scrambled eggs, which my character has lived on for weeks before.   yeah, that tired-ass article gets dragged out every time some parent is negligent. If i was concerned with the logic of why they were negligent, i would care. But i am not concerned with *why* they were negligent; their excuses are irrelevant.   We hold parents to a standard of accountability. They failed that standard. They should be punished for failing that standard.  Also, a table spoon of honey, a table spoon of vinegar, and a 8-ounce glass of water makes a superb summer drink, when chilled. Refreshing and delicious.    Pretty much all those pictures are boss. I had no clue the mexican military had falconers.    It's less wrong than thinking it's harder to colonize the sea than it is to colonize space.   Noway. The ocean, furthest you are from escape and help is about five miles. Worst case you fly in a rescue sub from somewhere and pull people out (as we do with submarine disasters, now). The area around you is a good heat sink, water is plentiful, and air can be made by simply cracking water into oxygen. We have over a century of experience with submarine issues, living, and technical challenges. Resupply is as simple as sending down some crates of food and whatnot. Realistically, having an under-sea habitat wouldn't be a whole lot worse than having an oil rig (of which we have thousands)  Space? space is *unbelievably* unpleasant. Help is days and days away at best. There's no resupply coming unless it's planned far in advance. There is no oxygen, no water, nothing for vast, vast areas. Everything that you want to have costs thousands of dollars a pound to bring up  and that's if you're lucky. There is unbelievable radiation in most areas, it's difficult to dump waste heat (an enormous problem) and if your ship gets punctured, you are bleeding away precious, difficult to replace supplies.  But maybe worst of all, there is *nothing there*. It's rocks, it's dust, it's cold. That's it. Even shipping back resources would be prohibitively expensive.   sure to tell us that the sun is very hot, space is pretty empty, and that money may not buy happiness but it can certainly buy pretty pictures of celestial objects   Or maybe it's the case that it's *simply not practical* to ship people into space, which is literally the most hostile environment available?    We already had one - [Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(spacecraft%29). There's been a few others, too.   haha indeed, there's been many a night i've sat down to play "just a half an hour" of dwarf fortress, and ended up running it for 6 or 7 hours...   My issue's not so much the blood, but that there is *so much of it*. Also odd: mushrooms in bbq sauce?    "i'm a writer" has to be the single best cover story/excuse/etc i have ever encountered.       No sweat!   I heard about that, absolutely awful. This kind of negligence is just unacceptable.   It's a shame because it is *so awesome*, once you get into it.    That's my attitude. No point even getting worked up over stuff, it'll all pass in time.   you ever wanna feel awful for how far america's fallen, [check out this link](http://www.eastliverpoolhistoricalsociety.org/Trolley.htm) - and then google up the town today. It's an area that would direly benefit from a light rail system (notably it'd link together liverpool and stuebenville, which would greatly help both communities) but instead it's a giant, soulless highway town.   Brutal, the mods are the best part!    That is really bizarre; i wonder if it's a typo, or if something more unusual was going on. You'd think 911 would rush an ambulance for a kid left in a hot car in dallas who's now unresponsive. I wonder if they delayed calling or if there was some miscommunication or what.   Yep. I kept thinking about that when i was reading these replies. Dog dies? Get the pitchforks and torches. A kid dies? No big deal.  I hope it's just because reddit's full of highschool kids.   All members of society are accountable to other members of society. That kid that died was one of us, and would have grown up to be a contributing member of our nation (and world's, for that matter) economy, and culture. They had their entire lives ahead of them, where they could have done *great things*.   Instead, they died in a hot car in dallas. And it seems some significant number of people on this site consider that no big deal and not something that anyone should give a shit about. Shit, with that attitude, why ever incarcerate *anyone*? After all they probably feel bad about what they did, and isn't feeling bad good enough for any crime, if it's good enough for the negligent death of a two year old.   Yep. To give a drunk access to a car is to enable their dangerous behavior, and is a sign that the judgement of the car owner should be in question.    High class typically comes with "strings" of a sort:  1. There'd be familial enemies and allies, perhaps going back generations.   2. There would always be people seeking to curry favor with the family, either as patrons, customers, or allies in a conflict   3. It was very common in the old days for aristocrats to receive both exotic gifts and to send their children to far off places for schooling or training, or to have highly-skilled tutors for them  4. The rich are often taken with fads and eccentricities, and are known to do things "just because they can" (like the Folly Towers)  Plus, of course, aristocratic individuals and families are often well known in their communities, and are given special consideration (both for good and ill!)    Only on reddit is seeking accountability for parents considered a fault. One dares not imagine the worldview you must have.    The 12 year olds called and want their edge back.   I definitely think that in the future, we will have some kind of technological solution to this problem, but i have no idea what form it could take. It would seem any system that could get the attention of someone outside the car would be a system that might be a pain in the ass enough for people to disable, so i dunno.   It disturbs me that a car can tell me it's low on wiper fluid, but not that someone is in the back seat when no one's in the front seat.    I'm actually totally graphics agnostic; if a game has great graphics, that's fine, but if it has awful graphics i just get used to it. I really like diverse and deep gameplay; to me, if a game has 500 different units and 60 weapons they can have, that's a good game, and if it has virtually unlimited units (like Dwarf Fortress) that's even better.    Oh i have no doubt they exist (the dominions 4 game i'm in right now has a chick in it, who's actually winning against 5 other people) but not among my friends, sadly :(   That said a lot of my female friends play like, terraria and don't starve and what not.   Yeah i might well toss up a discussion thread for the premier.   it's gonna be *really inconvenient* to manage threads every day because of how reddit does threads and how it handles front page posts. Just one more thing teen nick is pissing me off with, i suppose.   That america lacks good, well-regarded mass transit is something that forever pisses me off.   Where i live, many people drive 20+ miles to work, 5 days a week. With better (or any) mass transit, we could save enormous amounts of resources and definitely some lives. That we don't is appalling.    I am absolutely terrible at games, but it's fun to play them.  And yeah, SE IV without mods is pretty rough; i almost always run Adamant mod because of the balance issues.   Thank you.    if someone's negligent and no serious harm comes of it, then that's not a crime. If someone's negligent and a 2 year old cooks to death strapped in her car seat, then, that is certainly a crime of some kind.  Only on reddit would someone holding parents to a standard of accountability be considered enough to make someone a douchebag. Unbelievable.   haha right? Only sub i've ever been in where RT links are posted with any frequency.   Quite so. Any society that abandons it's most vulnerable members is a society not worth living in. I have zero complaints about my taxes going to disabled people.   Glad you're alright!   jesus christ, someone backed over their own baby in their driveway? That's appalling, i can only imagine the disgusting and awful scene that must have presented. I dunno about locked up (without knowing more about the situation), but they should definitely be carefully examined to determine if they were negligent or not.   And if there's issues with the foster care system, we should be working towards *fixing those issues* rather than refusing to use the system.    I went there once, but immediately caught fire like a vampire in the sun and so ran away from it forever. I only read negative news.   Right now: Dwarf Fortress, Dominions 4, Gemcraft (OK everyone loves Gemcraft..), and sometimes oddball stuff like OpenXCom or Space Empires IV   a two year old cooked to death in a car, and you're talking about the need to avoid *punishing the people responsible*? I've seen some bullshit moral relativism on this site, but this takes the cake.   When you have a kid, you have responsibilities. If you fuck up those responsibilities, you hurt your family, you hurt the kid, you hurt society itself. No amount of "sorry, my bad!" makes up for that.    Is he really unaware of Neoclassicism?  Probably. I think when you're as successful as he is, it's easy to lose sight of all the stuff you *don't* know.   It *really* bothers me when people call kids "crotchfruit". Like it gets right under my skin.  Everyone knows "Fuck trophy" is a 100% better term to use, and more accurate, as well.   i only like them boiled and plain, myself. Adding other stuff does nothing for me.   Broccoli or Brussel sprouts. Could eat both of them every day, i absolutely love them.    I kind of wondered that, myself.    LOL! Thats fucking hysterical, what universe do you live in?   edited to add: I think that not penalizing people who commit blatant acts of negligence like this sends a horrible message to society and does very little to further anyone's well being. They fucked up, there should be some consequences for that.   All sorts of things, but mostly video games. Most of my female friends don't see the appeal in the video games i play (which i guess is not surprising considering most males don't, either).    That sounds like a pretty legitimate case for disability to me. I wouldn't consider you in any way lessened by making use of the support that's available.   Wonder if there's some biological thing at play, or if it's just an equipment issue (where sometimes the connection's not perfect or what have you).    that's actually an interesting point - because we already know (as an example) batman's story, re-visiting his origins can be interesting in it's own right. Since there's assumptions we make about him, those assumptions can be challenged or confirmed (or subverted).   As to the repetition of stories, I'd say that, really, there's only about 7 to 10 real stories in all the world, and we just keep telling them over and over in different ways with minor variations. If there's a truly unique story to be told - I've never heard it.      Welcome to /r/worldnews where literally *any* source is a good source - so long as it supports the poster's agenda, of course.  	155
 Well, I'm especially looking forward to Cemetery of Splendor (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) by Hong Sang-soo and Taxi (2015) by Jafar Panahi. The films by Panahi and Weerasethakul have already been screened at various festivals, but none of them have been released on DVD/Blu-ray yet, so I'm waiting for that. Hopefully I'll get to see all three movies by the end of the year.      Check out these great directors:      * Andrei Tarkovsky         * Bla Tarr                 * Theo Angelopoulos                They have lots of long tracking shot in most of their movies. Some recommendations:      * Andrei Rublev (1966)    * Damnation (1988)     * Landscape in the Mist (1988)    * Nostalghia (1983)     * Stntang (1994)      * Solaris (1972)    * Stalker (1979)    * The Sacrifice (1986)     * The Travelling Players (1975)    * The Turin Horse (2011)     * Ulysses' Gaze (1995)       * Werckmeister Harmonies (2000)     Some examples:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBZsj8FPSbo    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykpJkf76X04     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB7RUwZuDZc      To also give you another idea, Stntang (1994) by Tarr is almost 8 hours long and there are roughly only 150 shots in the whole movie.   Paris, Texas (1984) and Tokyo Story (1953).   Stalker (1979) by Andrei Tarkovsky.   Odd list. I really don't know what to say if someone includes movies like The Last Samurai (2003) and 47 Ronin (2013) on a top list of the best samurai movies ever made. Anyways, if I made my own list, I would for sure include these five at least:     * Harakiri (1962) *(Masaki Kobayashi)*       * Pandemonium (1971) *(Toshio Matsumoto)*    * The Loyal 47 Ronin (1941) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*    * Sword of Doom (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*    * Three Outlaw Samurai (1964) *(Hideo Gosha)*      Well, you probably know about Tarkovsky's other movies by now, but be sure to check out Letters from a Dead Man (1986) and Visitor of a Museum (1989) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy if you want something that's also science fiction and similar to Tarkovky's films. Lopushanskiy actually worked as an assistant director on Stalker (1979).        Come and See (1985) and The Ascent (1976) are two other recommendations if you want great war films. And when it comes to the silent days of Soviet cinema, I recommend Bed and Sofa (1927) and Battleship Potemkin (1925).   If you liked that Dassin movie, check out some of his other films, especially Brute Force (1947) and Night and the City (1950). Pickup on South Street (1953) by Samuel Fuller could be up your alley too.   Michael Haneke.   Teizo Matsumura: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBB1vlExQFo   I have seen 98 of them. The Shanghai Gesture (1941) by Josef von Sternberg and 25th Hour (2002) by Spike Lee are the ones I haven't seen yet, although I've seen several other movies by the two directors.   I would pick 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solaris (1972) for their scales, set designs and photography as two of my favourites. The [opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGI9E70Pe4) scene from Solaris (1972) pretty much shows how fantastic Tarkovsky was on a visual level, even if he was fantastic when it came to everything else too. Amazing and dreamlike atmosphere.   Some great examples are Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Udo Kier, and Harvey Keitel.   Well, the first one is a Czechoslovakian movie from the Czech New Wave that is set in 1930s Prague, where the cremator Karel Kopfrkingl lives and works. Because of the Czechoslovakian situation with Nazi Germany and his crematorium, he gains some advantages. But when he discovers that his wife and daughter both have Jewish blood, he starts turning against them. Kind of a mix between horror, drama and comedy, it also takes some influences from German Expressionist. A masterpiece!         The second one is set in during a civil war in the fourteenth century somwhere in Japan. It's about two women who are killing samurai men and selling their belongings for a living. One of them is having an affair with a neighbor, while the other one meets a mysterious samurai with a mask. This will also threaten their friendship. Great atmosphere and a very moody soundtrack. I love how it's shot in the very high susuki grass.            The third one is about a surgeon called Dr. Gnessier who is kidnapping and killing women, only to obtain faces for his daughter Christiane, a young girl that got her whole face spoiled in a car crash. Bizarre, yet beautiful.         The fourth one is another one from Kaneto Shind, who also directed Onibaba (1964). Just like Onibaba (1964), this one is also about two women, but more of a ghost story. The two women in this movie are raped and killed by samurai soldiers, and after that, they reappear as ghosts in the form of cats to seduce and brutally murder the passing samurai. And just like Onibaba (1964), this one is just as stylistic and great.           And yeah, now we're at the last one, Possession (1981). A story about a woman who starts to show disturbing and strange behaviors after asking her husband for a divorce. The suspicions of infidelity soon give way to something much more sinister and bizarre. I'm not going to spoil anymore about it, it's just not needed. Very special flick. Especially Isabelle Adjani is amazing in this one. Chaotic and thrilling with great camera work. If you like Cronenberg and Lynch, this is something you must check out.   Woody Allen.   Some examples:     * Irm Hermann   Eva Mattes:       The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972)   Woyzeck (1979)      * Tatsuya Nakadai   Toshir Mifune:         Sword of Doom (1966), High and Low (1963)   Yojimbo (1961)     * Setsuko Hara   S Yamamura:       Sound of the Mountain (1954)   Tokyo Story (1953)         * Kuniko Miyake   Chish Ry:      Late Spring (1949), Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice (1952), Good Morning (1959)   The Golden Demon (1937)   1. The Cremator (1969) *(Juraj Herz)*    2. Onibaba (1964) *(Kaneto Shind)*     3. Eyes Without a Face (1960) *(Georges Franju)*     4. Kuroneko (1968) *(Kaneto Shind)*    5. Possession (1981) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*      Woody Allen and David Lynch, that would just be amazing, surreal and funny.   1. The Seventh Continent (1989)     2. Andrei Rublev (1966)     3. L'eclisse (1962)    4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     5. The Face of Another (1966)      I think my list would look something like this:      1. Andrei Rublev (1966) *(Andrei Tarkovsky)*    2. Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*    3. An Autumn Afternoon (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*    4. L'eclisse (1962) *(Michelangelo Antonioni)*    5. Eros Plus Massacre (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*      Well, I'm absolutely going to watch those three you mentioned, but here are some other movies from this year that I'm looking more forward to and that I've put on my watchlist:        * Aferim! (2015) *(Radu Jude)*       * Cemetery of Splendor (2015) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*    * Cosmos (2015) *(Andrzej Zulawski)*     * Eisenstein in Guanajuato (2015) *(Peter Greenaway)*    * El Club (2015) *(Pablo Larran)*    * Every Thing Will Be Fine (2015) *(Wim Wenders)*    * Far from the Madding Crowd (2015) *(Thomas Vinterberg)*    * In the Shadow of Women (2015) *(Philippe Garrel)*    * Irrational Man (2015) *(Woody Allen)*    * Le Louvre sous lOccupation (2015) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*     * Mountains May Depart (2015) *(Jia Zhangke)*     * My Mother (2015) *(Nanni Moretti)*    * Nahid (2015) *(Ida Panahandeh)*       * Our Little Sister (2015) *(Hirokazu Koreeda)*    * Queen of the Desert (2015) *(Werner Herzog)*    * Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) *(Hong Sang-soo)*         * Schneider vs. Bax (2015) *(Alex van Warmerdam)*    * Seances (2015) *(Guy Maddin)*    * Sweet Red Bean Paste (2015) *(Naomi Kawase)*    * Taxi (2015) *(Jafar Panahi)*    * The Assassin (2015) *(Hou Hsiao-hsien)*    * The Forbidden Room (2015) *(Guy Maddin)*     * The Pearl Button (2015) *(Patricio Guzmn)*     * The Treasure (2015) *(Corneliu Porumboiu)*    * Youth (2015) *(Paolo Sorrentino)*     Some of them have been already screened at various festivals, so I'm mostly waiting for DVD/Blu-ray releases, because they'll probably not be shown anywhere near me. We'll see when they will come out. Oh, I also forgot about the new stuff from Miguel Gomes that's in three parts. Also, Lav Diaz is working on a new movie. I also hope Michael Haneke, Aki Kaurismki and Abbas Kiarostami are going to release some new flicks soon, I just don't know if it's going to be this year.   I'm guessing that it won't be even near Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) by Fred Niblo or Ben-Hur (1959) by William Wyler when it comes to quality, even if those two aren't my favourite movies exactly. The new movie will be directed by someone who did Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012) and Wanted (2008), and if my expectations were really low from the beginning, I probably can't find words for where they are now. Good luck to the guy if he even comes close to achieving Wyler's depth of field when it comes to the cinematography. The new movie will probably look like shit and be bad as well, I'm almost certain.   Good movie, yeah! Is it something special you are looking after? On an instant note, I would recommend looking into Michael Haneke's other films, like Benny's Video (1992) and Funny Games (1997). Another movie that is a bit similar is La crmonie (1995) by Claude Chabrol, it also features the great Isabelle Huppert as well.   It's got nothing to do with that. I'm talking about the saturation, contrast and brightness for example. Look at movies like Walkabout (1971) and Wake in Fright (1971) that perfectly captured the Australian outback without overworking it like they did in Mad Mad: Fury Road (2015). Even Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and The Last Wave (1977) did it visually, even though those two are not only set in the outback. With the technology and opportunities of today, I felt it was too bad that they just went with a typical mainstream movie look and oversaturized things with that orange and teal look, while those other movies I mentioned really could capture the dry outback look in more realistic and better looking ways, they didn't even need to change much. I know that the movie was supposed to be over the top in many ways, but the visuals could look much better and still fit in.   No No Sleep (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang.   Well, this is only my opinion, but because people everywhere were (and still are) going apeshit over it and seem to view it as one of the best movies of the last 10 years and every second Tom, Dick and Harry hands out the highest rating to it.          Was it a horrible movie? Absolutely not. Was it one of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years? Not even close to it. It was absolutely overhyped if you ask me. But then again, my taste is often not that close to the majority of Reddit and/or the mainstream audience/critics. I just feel that people are exaggerating. I gave it a (weak) 2 out of 5.         If we take away all the action scenes that were supposed to be over the top all the time, it just felt like an empty and a bit silly over the top movie with not much to say really. A quite forgettable flick for me. And then I'm not a bit impressed by the action the movie had, and don't feel like it would compensate for anything either. I appreciate that Max was pretty much in the background and that Furiosa stole the show, because it's refreshing seeing female characters in this way in these kind of movies, but it wasn't fully without problems and couldn't lift the movie that much for me.        And I don't really know about the thing concerning George Miller's vision. He even said himself that the best version of the movie should have been in black and white, but instead they still went with the disgusting and typical teal and orange that you can see in random Hollywood movie today. That was a shame. I think the saturation and brightness of some of the colors would have ended up looking a lot better too. It was at least better than your typical blockbuster, but that doesn't say too much anyways.   It's a very cool, smart and even funny science fiction film with a lot of interesting themes, such as the ones about artificial worlds and illusions. I have seen a big amount of Fassbinder films, but I wouldn't say that this one is the easiest to start with. I would rather recommend starting with something like Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974), The Merchant of Four Seasons (1972) or Fear of Fear (1975), just to get familiar with his style. World on a Wire (1973) is also a bit longer than those. With that said, it's totally up to you what you feel like, this is just a heads up from someone who has seen the majority of his films.   Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).   My Neighbor Totoro (1988).   Here's ten great ones:      * Winter Light (1963) *(Ingmar Bergman)*    * Pickpocket (1959) *(Robert Bresson)*    * A Geisha (1953) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*    * Le rvlateur (1968) *(Philippe Garrel)*    * Violated Angels (1967) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*   * Pictures of the Old World (1972) *(Dusan Hank)*     * I fidanzati (1963) *(Ermanno Olmi)*     * Kamen (1992) *(Aleksandr Sokurov)*    * A Moment of Innocence (1996) *(Mohsen Makhmalbaf)*    * The Day He Arrives (2011) *(Hong Sang-soo)*            Masculin Fminin (1966), Breathless (1960) and The Mother and the Whore (1973).   [Here](http://www.theyshootpictures.com/resources/StartingList.xls) is TSPDT's starting list of 13,664 films.   Three of my favourites:      * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sClBFDt4jSE    * Rengoku eroica (1970): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOnETIFQCY      * Solyaris (1972): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGI9E70Pe4        1. Werckmeister Harmonies (2000) *(Bla Tarr)*    2. La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000) *(Peter Watkins)*    3. In Vanda's Room (2000) *(Pedro Costa)*    4. In the Mood for Love (2000) *(Wong Kar-wai)*       5. Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (2000) *(Hong Sang-soo)*    6. Yi yi (2000) *(Edward Yang)*    7. Songs from the Second Floor (2000) *(Roy Andersson)*     8. Freedom (2000) *(Sharunas Bartas)*     9. The Circle (2000) *(Jafar Panahi)*    10. Blackboards (2000) *(Samira Makhmalbaf)*        Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975), Le trou (1960), Andrei Rublev (1966) and the films by Teshigahara on Blu-ray as soon as possible would be great.    How do you start a movie 5 times and not manage to watch it full once?      Maybe OP got stuck in a time loop.               Do watch! Now! A beautiful and mellow movie. Ozu was a true master and everyone should see his films.   So it was that one? Great! Heh, I guess I just recognized it quite quick. It's a good movie!   I don't know. I thought it looked quite bad, like something you do in Photoshop when you're 14 years old and learning Photoshop. The abrupt line in the middle and the added grain felt quite amateurish as well. Nothing wrong with the composition and balance of the three lines of text, but all the lines of text could look better and have nicer fonts. But that's just me.   I didn't actually like the movie myself. It just seems that you were very disappointed and reacting surprised over the good reviews? As I said, people don't have the same taste, it's just simple as that. It's okay if you don't like certain movies and it's okay being disappointed over them. If you are wondering why some people liked it, you'll probably find the answer in their reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes for example, the Tomatometer for the movie is at 52%, which isn't really that high. 50 critics liked it and 46 didn't, so it's quite much in the middle on that site.   It sounds a bit like Targets (1968) by Peter Bogdanovich, could it be that one?    What I don't understand is how it can have good reviews? There aren't many so can they be fake reviews? Or is my family actually detached from what is considered a good Sci Fi movie nowadays.      Everyone doesn't have the same taste. If everyone liked the exact same films, there wouldn't probably be many reviews in the world at all.   It was "announced"/teased a time ago, so I wasn't that surprised regarding it being properly announced today, heh. But the cover they have on the website actually looks horrible!   I agree with you. It looks like something you do in Photoshop in eight grade in half an hour! Heh. I hope they change it or something. They have some great covers, but this one was really disappointing, they can do better!   A bit underwhelming. I was expecting something "bigger" because of the Twitter page. Mulholland Dr. (2001) was already "announced"/teased some time ago, so that wasn't a surprise really. And if you ask me, that cover looks quite bad. Wasn't a big fan of Kwaidan (1964) or My Own Private Idaho (1991) when I saw them, so I'm not that excited for those two.  I haven't seen The Brood (1979) yet, but it looks a bit interesting, and I like some of Cronenberg's other films. I haven't seen A Special Day (1977) either, but I have a DVD of it, although I'm not that into Scola of what I have seen so far. Well, at least I'm saving some money. The Yoshida box set from Arrow is coming by the end of October, so I have that to be happy about instead!   It's already on the front page on "Coming Soon".   * **Ingmar Bergman's religious triptych:**    Through a Glass Darkly (1961)   Winter Light (1963)    The Silence (1963)     * **Michelangelo Antonioni's alienation trilogy:**    Lavventura (1960)    La notte (1961)    Leclisse (1962)     * **Yoshishige Yoshida's trilogy on Japanese radicalism:**      Eros Plus Massacre (1969)    Heroic Purgatory (1970)    Coup D'Etat (1973)      Absolutely no idea. I'm hoping for A Brighter Summer Day (1991). Or something else interesting. Mulholland Dr. (2001) was already quite "announced"/teased, so that shouldn't hopefully be the "surprise".   Huh?   Speaking of Bulgarian movies, I've been meaning to watch The Peach Thief (1964) by Vulo Radev, I have to do that soon!   Here are my favourites from each of those years:     **1975:** Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     **1976:** The Killing of a Chinese Bookie (1976)    **1977:** Providence (1977)    **1978:** Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)    **1979:** Stalker (1979)      **1980:** The Long Good Friday (1980)    **1981:** Possession (1981)   **1982:** Fitzcarraldo (1982)    **1983:** L'argent (1983)   **1984:** Paris, Texas (1984)   **1985:** A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)     **1986:** Blue Velvet (1986)    **1987:** Wings of Desire (1987)    **1988:** Damnation (1988)    **1989:** The Seventh Continent (1989)    **1990:** Close-Up (1990)    **1991:** A Brighter Summer Day (1991)    **1992:** Kamen (1992)    **1993:** Naked (1993)    **1994:** Stntang (1994)      **1995:** Dead Man (1995)     Although I wouldn't really recommend getting drunk and watching them, but that's your call. I don't know if you are looking for something that's ideal to watch when you're drunk or just curious about other users favourites, it's a bit hard to point out exactly, I was just answering the question in the title.   [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eR6ZPZwEpU) scene from Winter Light (1963).   When Paul (played by Arno Frisch) uses a remote control in Funny Games (1997) to rewind the movie itself and change the consequences. One of the best moments ever when it comes to breaking the fourth wall.   I think Kurosawa has made several great films, I just don't feel that they're on the same level as my ten favourites. You also have to remember that it's only ten movies in that list, that's not so much. If I made a top 100 of the best Japanese movies of all time, I would probably include some Kurosawa. Other than that, I think you've pretty much answered your own question when you said that you haven't seen many older films that weren't directed by Kurosawa. You have so much to discover, I don't even know where to begin! For someone who has seen a fair amount of Japanese films, there's so many Japanese movies out there besides the ones made by Kurosawa.   **2006:** Lights in the Dusk (2006) *(Aki Kaurismki)*      **2007:** My Winnipeg (2007) *(Guy Maddin)*    **2008:** Night and Day (2008) *(Hong Sang-soo)*    **2009:** The Limits of Control (2009) *(Jim Jarmusch)*     **2010:** Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives (2010) *(Apichatpong Weerasethakul)*    **2011:** The Turin Horse (2011) *(Bla Tarr)*    **2012:** The Act of Killing (2012) *(Joshua Oppenheimer   Christine Cynn)*     **2013:** Norte, the End of History (2013) *(Lav Diaz)*    **2014:** Journey to the West (2014) *(Tsai Ming-liang)*    **2015:** No No Sleep (2015) *(Tsai Ming-liang)*        Do you watch movies before your time? Or watch old black and white movies?     Of course. Very, very often. I'm in my late twenties and I watch movies from the beginning of cinema to the newest ones today. There's not a single good reason to limit yourself to any years. If you're doing that, you're just limiting both interest, references and knowledge about movies overall. Some of the best movies I've seen are decades older than me. A movie's age is totally irrelevant for me, if something is good, it's good. I think it says quite much about you if you only have seen one black   white movie before the 70s. It's your own choice, but I don't even know where to start when it comes to what you are missing. But of course, maybe you just don't have a big interest in cinema?   Be sure to make him watch Norte, the End of History (2013) by Lav Diaz.   I vote for Michael Haneke.   Most bizarre news of the week!   You're quite wrong there. Great movie, but it definitely has a plot, a story where events relate to one another in patterns/sequences through causality.   * La chambre (1972)    * My Name Is Oona (1969)   * Process Red (1966)            I have no idea if you have seen it, but one of my favourite ones set in Los Angeles is Mulholland Dr. (2001).   Have you seen The Face of Another (1966), World on a Wire (1973) or Letters from a Dead Man (1986)? Those are my favourites if I don't count the obvious and well known ones like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Stalker (1979) and Solaris (1972).   My top ten Japanese movies of all time:     * The Face of Another (1966) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*     * Eros Plus Massacre (1969) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*    * Woman in the Dunes (1964) *(Hiroshi Teshigahara)*   * An Autumn Afternoon (1962) *(Yasujir Ozu)*    * Late Spring (1949) *(Yasujir Ozu)*    * This Transient Life (1970) *(Akio Jissoji)*   * Silence Has No Wings (1966) *(Kazuo Kuroki)*    * Double Suicide (1969) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*    * Harakiri (1962) *(Masaki Kobayashi)*    * Violated Angels (1967) *(Kji Wakamatsu)*      Ten Japanese movies I've seen recently that were great:     * Violence at High Noon (1966) *(Nagisa shima)*    * A Wife Confesses (1961) *(Yasuz Masumura)*    * The Munekata Sisters (1950) *(Yasujir Ozu)*    * Five Women Around Utamaro (1946) *(Kenji Mizoguchi)*    * Mother (1952) *(Mikio Naruse)*    * Sword of Doom (1966) *(Kihachi Okamoto)*     * The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On (1987) *(Kazuo Hara)*    * Sound of the Mountain (1954) *(Mikio Naruse)*     * Himiko (1974) *(Masahiro Shinoda)*    * Confessions Among Actresses (1971) *(Yoshishige Yoshida)*   Some nice picks, especially Ozu, Naruse, Buuel, and Bresson. With that said, I really want to see Costa's new movie.   There's many examples. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) that we already talked about is one. The River (1951) is another one, a film made by a French director that is based in India, shot in India, but has a lot of dialogue in English. Some of the cast are from India and some are from the Western part of the world. The countries IMDb lists are France, UK, India, and USA. All of these things doesn't really make it easier to categorize it by country, if you are going to do that.   Cra cuervos (1976) by Carlos Saura.   Oh. There's a ton of great ones.     My personal top ten:     * The Seventh Continent (1989)    * Andrei Rublev (1966)    * L'eclisse (1962)     * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      * The Face of Another (1966)     * Eros Plus Massacre (1969)    * Woman in the Dunes (1964)    * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    * Winter Light (1963)   * Stntang (1994)      Ten foreign movies that aren't my top favourites, but are good and should be seen:    * The Bicycle Thief (1948)    * M (1931)   * 8 (1963)   * Rashmon (1950)   * Metropolis (1927)    * Battleship Potemkin (1925)    * The 400 Blows (1959)    * Seven Samurai (1954)    * Breathless (1960)     * The Seventh Seal (1959)     I would suggest looking up the big list TSPDT has, you'll find many great and important foreign movies in it that should be seen. It will also get you introduced to directors like Ingmar Bergman, Andrei Tarkovsky, Yasujir Ozu, Fritz Lang, Akira Kurosawa, Franois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, and the other big ones that one should know about. One suggestion could be to find the list on ICheckMovies and sort it by "in # official toplists", that way you'll see what foreign movies will be in the most lists, something that can be useful when you want to see the ones that are most popular, important and acclaimed.   Here are ten good ones:     * A Brighter Summer Day (1991)    * A Summer at Grandpa's (1984)   * A Summer's Tale (1996)     * Contempt (1963)    * Do the Right Thing (1989)    * Early Summer (1951)    * Farewell to the Summer Light (1968)    * Il sorpasso (1962)    * The End of Summer (1961)    * White Material (2009)      I would suggest starting with reading some of the reviews of it. There's a ton of reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a ton of reviews on IMDb (both from the users and external reviews). There's also probably several analyses to find through Google on the movie as well. There's even several older discussion about the movie here too. I feel that it's very easy to find out why a big majority of people liked or didn't liked a movie.      I don't know if "Incendies" counts as a Middle East movie since some parts are set in Canada, but it is also awesome.     I think it's a real stretch to call it that. It's a Canadian movie (and maybe a little French too because IMDb lists France as a country on the movie's page) by a French-Canadian director that was shot both in Canada and the Middle East. Certain parts of the film are supposed to be set in the Middle East (because the movie is based on certain events during the Lebanese civil war), but the director tried to make to make the location of the plot a bit ambiguous. So yeah, it wouldn't be quite right to call it a film from the Middle East.   I don't know. This is a quite small list though. I agree with you that it's a great movie, the whole Koker trilogy is really worth watching, especially considering the interesting meta perspective. Maybe most people rank Kiarostami's other films higher, I don't know. But I must say that Close-Up (1990) is my favourite by him so far.   What makes a film's nationality is a thing that always can be discussed, because there's always films that transcend it a bit and can be a bit harder to place in certain categories. So yeah, you have to have to look at the things you mention and see how it can be categorized from movie to movie. Where it is set and where it is shot shouldn't on the other hand have too much to do with it. For example, Schindler's List (1993) is an entirely American movie by and American director, even though it is set in Poland, which shouldn't make it Polish by any means.        Speaking of A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014), I still don't feel that it's a film that should be categorized as a film from the Middle East, even if it's of course "more Middle Eastern" than some other movies. It also feel like that the movie has been discussed on Reddit previously several times, so maybe it would be better to highlight some other films that are entirely from the Middle East that should deserve more attention instead. I understand how you were thinking at least. But yeah, it's a discussion that can be interesting in some ways.   A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) isn't really a film from the Middle East, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call it that. It's an American film in Persian that is supposed to be set in Iran that was filmed in Californa by an Iranian-American director that was born in England and spent most of her life living in the US.      Besides that, it's nice to see Close-Up (1990) by Abbas Kiarostami on the list, it's a great movie. I'm actually waiting for the Criterion Blu-ray to be delivered to my mailbox.   You've got it all worked out for you, don't you? Good luck.   Now that is a boring poster, even if you are going to stick with the more minimalistic look, it looks like a tired job. And that "tagline" sounds like a big clich. I wonder if they payed someone to make this. There's thousands of people out there that make great posters who could do a much more interesting job. This is something you put together in Photoshop after a couple of minutes. The premise of the movie sounds interesting though, especially because it's about feminism, but I doubt that the movie will be even above mediocre, I really got that feeling confirmed after looking at the trailer.   A Man Escaped (1956) by Robert Bresson, the best one!   There was a discussion about the list in another subreddit recently, so I'll be repeating myself a bit. First of all, I don't think a list like that should be taken seriously. Not because of what movies are on it, but because every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start rating movies, because some people only use 1 and 10 as ratings, because other people vote on movies they haven't watched, because people can use multiple accounts, because others try to vote up and down certain movies for stupid and irrelevant reasons, and that's just some of the problems with the list. Anyone can make an account and start rating movies on the site. There is no sincere seriousity and commitment behind the rating system, and that's because of the users. Another thing that's easy to notice, is that new and big movies tend to get heavily upvoted, especially just when they've premiered. People seem to go apeshit. So the list is based pretty much on popularity as well, we can see that on the required number of votes a movie must have to be able to be on the list too. Because of that, a movie that's a bit more obscure hasn't got a big chance of entering the list.      Also, it feels a bit strange to compare what I think should and shouldn't belong on the list. The list is made by thousands of users, and I'm only one person. But if I made my own top 250 list, I would not include the majority of the films that are on the IMDb Top 250.     I would put films like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), The Dark Knight (2008), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Fight Club (1999), Forrest Gump (1994), Inception (2010), The Usual Suspects (1995), Interstellar (2014), Lon: The Professional (1994), Life Is Beautiful (1997), American History X (1998), Saving Private Ryan (1998), The Intouchables (2011), Whiplash (2014), Memento (2000), Gladiator (2000), Django Unchained (2012), Batman Begins (2005), and some others quite far from my own top 250. And that's just some examples. There's hundreds of movies I would "replace" them with if I made my own top 250. But as I said, it feels a bit strange to compare it this way.   Possession (1981).   A Man Escaped (1956) by Robert Bresson and Le trou (1960) by Jacques Becker, the two best ones of all time when it comes to prison escape movies.   Money.   What I think is that a list like that shouldn't be taken seriously. But that's because every Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account and start rating movies, because some people only use 1 and 10 as ratings, because other people vote on movies they haven't watched, because people can use multiple accounts, because others try to vote up and down certain movies for stupid and irrelevant reasons, and that's just some of the problems. Anyone can make an account and start rating movies on the site. There is no sincere seriousity and commitment behind the rating system, and the big problem about it are the users. And I'm not even commenting anything about taste so far.   I'm waiting for that Criterion Blu-ray of Hiroshima mon amour (1959) to be delivered to my mailbox. Feels great.      Sure, he's an actor in the film, so of course. OP didn't ask for movies with him as the lead character or something.   I disliked it because Scott seemed to have forgotten what makes good and effective science fiction, catching what's big in the little things. To make it simple, Prometheus (2012) was just generic, nobby, stupid, superficial, silly and tiresome. And talk about ruining all the mystique surrounding the "space jockey".   Apocalypse Now (1979).         Harakiri (1962) by Masaki Kobayashi does this as well. Such a good movie.   2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) for me too. It looks amazing, diverse, has breathtaking cinematography and a great atmosphere. It also manages to cover a wide array of themes, such as man versus machine, the mysteries of the universe and the origins of humanity in interesting ways. One of the most important and best things about it is that the movie asks questions, and doesn't simply provide the answers for you, as well as being very open to interpretations. A milestone.   Rififi (1955), one of the best heist movies.   A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954) are two classics. Apart from The Godfather (1972), Last Tango in Paris (1972), One-Eyed Jacks (1961) and Apocalypse Now (1979) would be considered important as well, even if I wasn't a big fan of One-Eyed Jacks (1961).   No, I haven't actually watched a single one yet! Too many movies to watch, to little time! I have to get started soon.   I did it. With the sale at Barnes   Noble going on, you probably won't find it in new condition to a much better price. It costs a bit more on Amazon US for the moment as well. If you're not satisfied, you could always sell it or trade it. It's a very nice looking set, both DVD and Blu-ray, which isn't bad at all. Also, if you're going to blind buy any set, this is the one, even Zatoichi is blind!   The Complete Kazuo Kuroki, where we get all of his films on Blu-ray and a lot of extra features. Gimme!   Pickpocket (1959) by Robert Bresson and The Man Who Sleeps (1974) by Bernard Queysanne.   It's a bit hard to find something that's really similar when it comes to the music, but you should anyways check out Odd Man Out (1947), Brighton Rock (1947) and Touch of Evil (1958), all those three have about the same atmosphere as The Third Man (1949). Carol Reed directed Odd Man Out (1947) about two years before he did The Third Man (1949) too.       This is a movie made when movies couldn't use special effects or CGI but instead had to rely on great story telling and great acting.     I think you should read a bit about special effects, especially if you believe movies couldn't use them in the 70s. You have a lot of homework to do.   Double Suicide (1969) by Masahiro Shinoda.   * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)    * Contempt (1963)     * Cries and Whispers (1972)    * Happy Together (1997)    * Pastoral: To Die in the Country (1974)    * Pierrot le Fou (1965)     * The Color of Pomegranates (1969)    * The Cook, the Thief, His Wife   Her Lover (1989)     * The Holy Mountain (1973)     * Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets (1971)      You have some good stuff left to see there!      Here's what I would pick for you from each row:      * Double Indemnity (1944)    * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    * Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)     * Wings of Desire (1987)    * Naked (1993)    * Tokyo Story (1953)    * Ivan's Childhood (1962)   * Wild Strawberries (1957)    * Ordet (1955)    * In the Mood for Love (2000)      Well, there's a lot I like that I didn't list, I only listed three movies from each decade, just like OP. It's quite hard narrowing down everything to such a small number!  I've seen Pickpocket (1997) already. I've seen Platform (2000) and Still Life (2006) as well, but I can't say I'm a big fan of Jia Zhangke so far. I'm still eager to see more by him though, maybe I'll like some of his other films better.   Heh, that's great to hear! Just ordered a Blu-ray copy of Close-Up (1990) from the Criterion sale Barnes   Noble is having, so I'm waiting for that one and two other titles to enter the mailbox. Feels nice.   Chelsea Girls (1966) by Paul Morrissey   Andy Warhol, the whole movies is presented in a split screen with a single audio track.    I haven't seen movies prior to the 60's       But you namedropped a Buuel movie from the 50s in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/37to7t/nonamericans_of_reddit_what_are_your_favourite/crpvqsp) discussion? Heh.   Fantastic Planet (1973) by Ren Laloux is probably my favourite one.   I'll do the same decades that you did, so here's my list for the moment:      **2010s:**      * Norte, the End of History (2013)     * The Day He Arrives (2011)    * The Turin Horse (2011)       **2000s:**     * The Limits of Control (2009)    * Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks (2002)    * La Commune (Paris, 1871) (2000)      **1990s:**     * Stntang (1994)    * A Brighter Summer Day (1991)    * Close-Up (1990)     **1980s:**     * The Seventh Continent (1989)    * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)    * Paris, Texas (1984)      **1970s:**     * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     * The Mirror (1975)      * The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972)      **1960s:**     * Eros Plus Massacre (1969)    * Andrei Rublev (1966)      * The Face of Another (1966)      **1950s:**     * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    * Pickpocket (1959)     * Wild Strawberries (1957)       **1940s:**     * Late Spring (1949)    * Day of Wrath (1943)    * The Loyal 47 Ronin (1941)      **1930s:**     * Modern Times (1936)   * M (1931)    * City Girl (1930)     **1920s:**     * Diary of a Lost Girl (1929)     * The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928)    * The Crowd (1928)      **1910s:**     * I Accuse (1919)    * The Dying Swan (1917)      * Ingeborg Holm (1913)       The robot dance.   * Andrei Rublev (1966)      * Eros Plus Massacre (1969)     * Stalker (1979)     * The Face of Another (1966)      * Woman in the Dunes (1964)      Stalker (1979) and Letters from a Dead Man (1986) are my two favourites.   You'll have to ask the judges if you want a proper answer for that.   Here are five great ones:     * Eros Plus Massacre (1969)     * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    * Last Year at Marienbad (1961)    * Solaris (1972)    * Stalker (1979)       	123

    How about not safe for feelings?    Two portapotty's? I mean really? Is there some sort of BBC regulation that requires segregated bathrooms to be made available?      yes I did!  Now back now work for another 2 min.      I was thinking it would be fun to have back yard movie nights with my friends. I wanted to get an HD projector without going to crazy price wise (around $500). However when I started looking around I noticed projectors on places like ebay for 50-300 dollars that claim to be HD while other vendors charge 10 times as much.   I was wondering what exactly the catch is. Why are they so cheap compared to proper projectors. Also any recommendations you guys have for projectors would be really appreciated.  Here is an example  [Example 1](http://www.ebay.com/itm/3000-Lumens-HD-1080P-Home-Cinema-Theater-Multimedia-LED-LCD-Projector-HDMI-3D-/161621153797?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item25a15f1805)  [Example 2](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HD-Home-Theater-Multimedia-LCD-LED-Projector-1080-HDMI-3D-AV-DVD-TV-Paystation-/281633294609?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0 hash=item4192a70911)    This post must be fairly new because I can see your awesome reply instead of 10 people bitching about their "asshole" parents and how they overcame it to become a top poster on /r/raisedbynarcissists.

 I think it was amazing, minus just a few tweaks. It was very moist while still holding a good shape. The only two things Id change were:  A.) add more lemon flavor than I did  B.) wait until the cake was completely cool to pour the frosting over so it didn't just roll down the sides.    Overall, great cake and definitely worth a try.  The sweetness of the cake was a great offset to the tart blueberries!   Thanks for the tip! I'll try that next time.        	4
 It looks like you are in a turn, couldn't tell until i checked your attitude indicator.  Edit: spelling   That Shockwave on the ground at 1:49 is crazy.   but it looks so cool, and that sound.   To be fair this It is pretty suspicious to have this many guns.  If i were the police I would be suspicious as well.      Not true there are inspection ports.

I remember when I was little that I was obsessed with symmetry.  Everything had to be symmetrical, and it bothered me when it wasn't but as i grew older I outgrew it and stopped caring about it so much.   I Think this as well, I thought I was alone. We should start a social movement. or maybe just start a subreddit lol.   Really I got it right away.  I was like what is spain doing on the bottom?   Imagine how pointless the Channel tunnel would be if water levels were suddenly to be what they used to be.   Thats what I wonder, How cool would it be if you could find the old banks and stuff.  My guess is they are still there, but are covered with silt.   The point is not to bring those resources back to the surface of earth, but to leave them in orbit.  A huge cost in space, is just getting things from the surface of earth to orbit.  A great example is water. Water on earth is pretty cheap, you would think what is the point of mining an astroid for water it is so cheap already. The thing is, water is really heavy, and and just taking one gallon of it to space can cost tens of thousands of dollars. So if you could produce water in orbit for say 1000 dollars a gallon. that price would be ridiculous on earth, but in space you would actually be 10 times cheaper than the price of launched water.  Water can be used for tons of stuff, like obvious stuff like supporting humans, but also separating it into hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel, fuel cells, oxygen for human, and much more.   You are missing the point.  The whole point of mining an astroid and making stuff out of it in space is because it is really expensive to launch it off the earth.  the point would not be to bring those resources back to earth, but to refine the materials and use them to build stuff in orbit.    A great example is water.  Water on earth is pretty cheap, you would think what is the point of mining an astroid for water it is so cheap already.  The thing is, water is really heavy, and and just taking one gallon of it to space can cost tens of thousands of dollars.  So if you could produce water in orbit for say 1000 dollars a gallon.  that price would be ridiculous on earth, but in space you would actually be 10 times cheaper than the price of launched water.   Those are choices not really uncommon for things like this.   https://www.facebook.com/929theBULL/videos/vb.359093871871/10153055562271872/?type=2 theater  your welcome   I wish they would have done more with the interior.  I feel like the really lost an opportunity making the dials and buttons look like apollo.  But if I wanted to get a Mustang it would totally be this one.      It is a great book definitely worth the money very inspiring.  The crazy part is it is all true.            "In 1965, 16-year-old Robin Lee Graham began a solo around-the-world voyage from San Pedro, California, in a 24-foot sloop. Five years and 33,000 miles later, he returned to home port with a wife and daughter and enough extraordinary experiences to fill this bestselling book, Dove."      You seem to be right.  Cool   http://www.rvharvey.com/minifish.htm   Yea one of the motors went bad, they were almost unable to use the arm.  Pretty cool to read about how they managed to deploy it.  Here is a little more info  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_mission_timeline#Shoulder_troubles  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_mission_timeline#Inspecting_Victoria_crater      Thats not a Sunfish.  Does anyone know what type of boat this is?   New Horizons did do a flyby of Jupiter when it was doing the gravity slingshot maneuver it was able to get some pictures of Jupiter and some of its moons during that time.   Link to some other really cool ones for Sol 4079.  Magnificent desolation.  It looks so wiry to look across that whole crater into the distance.  http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/gallery/all/opportunity_n4079.html      yea I really liked it.  I thought it was really cool to see the traverse start to finish.  Also if you look carefully you can see in the second half the robotic arm stops getting stowed, and the rover starts driving backwards.   The top comment was suggesting a 3 cell, do you think that would be too much?   How do these glasses work?  What would a normal person see if they put them on?   It is easy to forget that quite a bit of time passes in the book it is quite possible months had passed from when he cut it to the scene in the bear pit   Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl-Soh4aWik feature=youtu.be  The thumbs up is the best part.   I completely agree.    You should comment on his post an see what he thinks about that argument.   Sorry I did not realize I was talking to a new person lol.  Yea i feel like the problem with continuing sanction on Iran is it has the potential to turn the younger Iranian generation against us where right now they are pretty supportive of western culture.    The last thing we need to do is make ourselves new enemy in the middle east. and by continuing sanctions it would play right into the propaganda of the Iranian government.   What do you mean?  After 50 years nothing has happened, and now we are reopening diplomatic relations.     But what is the point of keeping them in sanctions indefinitely?    The idea with sanctions is that you are incentivizing them to do something, in this case it was to come to the negotiating table.  Sanctions only work so long as everyone is in on them, and most other nations in the world are willing to make a deal now that Iran is ready.    I think if you were to attempt to continue to sanction Iran, it would turn out like the Cuban Embargo where pretty much every other nation in the world has normal relations except the US.   What would you have us do?     It is really amazing, how cool would it be to send a lander of some sort.   I think for most people it won't make a difference though.  Unless you are subscribed to some of the really crapy subs then you probably won't ever notice a difference.      I don't know where you are getting your information, I have heard that basically the US has gotten a great deal of what they wanted.    http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/14/422920192/6-things-you-should-know-about-the-iran-nuclear-deal    this paper, this paper, this one, this one, this one (not behind a paywall), this one, or this other one,   lol     Yes this photo is from about 14 hours before closest approach.   I feel like highway labor and stuff was pushing it but generally excepted.  This just feels different though like what are we going to do next have inmates working at Mcdonalds?   This is so messed up, we should not be using our prisons as free labor.  Its so surreal to see prisoners doing office work.   Yes there is no way, but we have shown similar capabilities in the Iraq war.   Basically they are talking about how gravity assists transfer momentum from a planet to a space probe, or if you are trying to slow down, from the space probe to the planet. The thing is though when comparing the mass of a plannet like Jupiter to the mass alf a space probe you quickly realize that it is unlikely that this change is even measurable.   I think that we should allow people to come here if they want to come here.  We should not treat our country like some sort of gated community for the rich.  On a side note, I really wish that there was some way that we could start a nation exchange program with countries in latin america and such.  I honestly feel like even just going there for a few months and living with a family there can completely change ones perspective on issues like this.    Having illegals certainly won't increase the crime rate! It's a crime to even be here. If you think illegals keep the crime rate down because of all the vigilante-like crime reporting they're doing then I'd love to see that source.  That is exactly what I am saying.  There have been many recent studies showing that immigrant communities actually have significantly lower crime rates than other comparable communities.  * http://www.livescience.com/4872-immigration-reduces-crime-rates.html * http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charis_Kubrin/publication/227690045_THE_POWER_OF_PLACE_Immigrant_Communities_and_Adolescent_Violence/links/00b4952bd08cf4ae70000000.pdf  In the US there is the ongoing misconception that just because someone decided to move travel from one piece of land to another, they are suddenly dangerous criminals.  Merely stepping form [one side of an invisible line to another](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1432/5101130350_5889fd728d_b.jpg) makes you a dangerous criminal. We make the laws and just because it is a law does not mean that it is justified or equal to other laws.  Imagine if we made it illegal for the people living in South Carolina to go to North Carolina.  People would still do it, does that make them the same as murderers?  I would say no, and statistics would say the same thing.    Ps: One thing that I found especially interesting about those studies is that the statistics seem to show that it is actually 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants that tend to commit more crime, not the 1st generation. So if you are part of a latino gang or something like that, it is very likely that you are actually an american citizen.      Because the republicans don't want Obama to have a victory.   I think you mean 1 million total.  I think that we should redesign the way we do immigration in the US.  The problem with our immigration system is we allow the same number of immigrants from every country in the world.  So we allow the same amount of immigrants from Iceland as we do from China.  I think a simple fix that would help would be to make it based on population so larger countries get more Visas, and smaller ones get less.

But then again "whitey" from Europe would probably not be willing to pick lettuce 12 hours a day for 4 dollars an hour.  People do not realize that our economy and many businesses benefit enormously from having illegal immigrants working here providing incredibly cheap labor.    How many people should be able to come into the US?  I think that immigrants from latin america should be treated similarly to immigrants from other countries.  I do not know how many should be allowed to come to the US, but I definitely think it should be more than what we are allowing now.    I have personally experienced the impunity of our immigration system.   I have a friend from Mexico that was trying to get a tourist visa so she could come to the US and visit.  But because her visa was denied. If she had been from Canada she would be here, but for the sole reason that she was born in Mexico suddenly she is treated like a criminal.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city  Here is a source I can find more if you would like.  If you look you will see every major city in the US is on that list of cities that have this policy.  I was slightly mistaken, the police have a policy of not inquiring into your legal status when they are patrolling and such, it seems that once you are arrested the policy is still to turn you over to immigration.  In what world do you live in that you want people illegally invading our country?  Can we keep the personal attacks to a minimum.  Stop putting words in my mouth.  I said nothing about allowing illegal immigrants to invade our country.  Where did you think that I said that?  What I did say is that i support this policy that cities have.  I would rather my city cut its murder and violent crime rate in half than have the police focus on finding illegal immigrants that are minding their own business and not committing crime.  The illegal immigrant in San Francisco was a mistake, and by no means the norm.  Like I said the policy does not prevent you from being arrested and charged with a crime its not a get out of jail free card, it is just a policy that police will not inquire into your legal status if they are responding to your report of a crime or find you walking down the street.   I would like to ask you now what makes people from Latin America so horrible?  We get immigrants from all over the world, illegal and legal, what makes Latino's so horrible?   Like I said immigrants are coming here no matter what, you can't seal off a country it is impossible to do.  You forget that more people coming into the US legally will mean more money being spent more tax revenues, and more revenues for businesses which, you guessed it, means businesses can hire more people.  I think the core of what I was saying above, is not about letting any body and their friend come into the US, but opening up the system so that the people that already come here can do so legally.  Businesses make a ton of money by being able to hire workers for very low rates, and not pay taxes on that labor.  If those workers started making more money, it could mean more money being spent at local businesses and more money being spent in general, because low income people spend way more of their income than rich people do.  I think you also need to ask yourself if we were getting big influx of people of people from countries like the UK, France, and Germany and western Europe to work here in the US would you care as much?     That is debatable, we sort of did it with our hand behind our back.  If we had really wanted to we could have done a full invasion kicked butt and ended the conflict in less than a month, instead we played politics and didn't fully commit.   I have a feeling this was not an accident by the Republicans.  They seem to have been doing this more and more lately, where behind closed doors they agree on a way where they can vote one way and get the opposite.  Nobody in their constituency cares about how they voted 6 months ago.  But when they all vote no and Obama overrides them, they can call Obama a dictator monarch president and talk about how he is taking over america and trying to ruin the country.  It seems like even Fox should be able to ask the simple question of if you really did not want this Iran deal, why did you vote for a bill that you fully knew would allow an Iran deal to happen.     It looks like we have gotten a good signal from the probe so I would say that it has been a success.   No, New Horizons is on an escape trajectory and will not return to the solar vicinity.  It will escape our solar system in a similar to [Voyager 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1), [Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2), [Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10), and [Pioneer 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_11)  Here is a [nice picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Outersolarsystem-probes-4407b.svg) to show you the relative locations, it is important to remember that this image does not show you the third dimension though as some of the probes are quite far from the plain of the solar system.   Ok while conservatives have spun the city sanctuary thing as some liberal scandal, it is actually common practice for most large cities, and it makes a lot of sense.  The whole reasoning behind local authorities officially not turning over illegal immigrants to immigration is to fight crime.  Cities were having huge problems with crime because illegal immigrants were afraid to call the cops when crime was happening for the rightful fear that they would be deported.  So most cities began making it official that they would not turn over illegal immigrants to immigration in order to incentivize them to repot crimes.  For the most part it has proven to be very successful with large drops in crime.     What these laws/policies do not do, and what conservative media fails to mention, is they do not protect criminals.  If the police find that you are a criminal they will arrest you, and if you are an illegal immigrant they will turn you over to immigration.  Edit: Source on major cities comment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city   First of all we do not allow "endless, unchecked, unregulated immigration"  Compared to many other countries our laws are actually quite strict.  What is quite obvious though is that even with these laws people are still coming here because of the economic opportunities available.  When you can make 10 times as much doing the same work you would do back in your home country it makes a lot of sense to come to the US.  Opening up our immigration system would help a great deal, because we could make a lot more of the immigrants who are going to come in anyway, legal immigrants.  This would allow us to   * tax them properly,  * prevent them from undercutting wages in the market * make it easier to track criminals  Those were just the things I could think of off the top of my head.  Edit: spelling/grammar   Can you explain why they were getting denied when they were showing passports?  It does not get any more official than that.   Is NH simply taking pictures/doing a little science before spending the last of its days hurdling towards interstellar space?  Pretty much.   If New horizons wanted to enter into orbit around Pluto, it would have had to go on a much larger rocket, likely go much slower, and would have had to carry much more fuel.  This is not really that unusual, I believe most if not all of our other first times visiting planets were flyby missions. In fact Voyager 2 is the only probe we have sent to Uranus or Neptune.  It did a flyby of those two planets in 1985 and 1989 respectively as well as Jupiter and Saturn, and is now flying into deep space.  In general For the purposes of first time encounters, especially to a planet this far away, a flyby mission makes a lot more sense, mainly because it is   * Faster, it takes much less time to get somewhere when you don't have to slow down.   * Simplicity, you do not need to know that much about another place to just flyby it, whereas entering into orbit requires you to have a much better understanding of the system you are trying to enter into orbit around,  A great example is until only a few months ago we did not know about Pluto's 3 other moons.  If this is your first time going to a place, you probably do not know what instruments to take either.  It would be a shame to spend a whole bunch of money to take a bunch of optical instruments to Venus when all you are going to get is some pictures of clouds.  If you are going there you probably want to use radar and such so you can see the surface below the clouds.  * Finally cost.  All of these things add up to a much lower cost, for the mission and a much easier sell to the higher ups paying for your mission, which makes sense when you have no idea what you are going to see when you get there.  Make no mistake though, we are going to get a ton of science from this mission.  In the AMA today The scientists talked about how it is going to take [16 months to download it all](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3d9luh/were_scientists_on_the_nasa_new_horizons_team/ct3272a?context=3).      OMG someone just wrote on the street.  I saw it happen.      This is almost a Fahrenheit 451 Reference      Information Page  http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/view_obs.php?image=data/pluto/level2/lor/jpeg/029899/lor_0298996724_0x630_sci_1.jpg utc_time=2015-07-12%3Cbr%3E08:46:45%20UTC description=OpNav+Campaign+4%2C+LORRI+1X1 target=PLUTO range=2.5M%20km exposure=100%20msec      Why did they do that half orbit thing?  Why not just wait half a day and launch strait up?  Wouldn't a direct assent save fuel allowing for a higher escape velocity?   I don't believe that businesses will fire thousands of people to account for higher wages, as many employers are already working with the minimum amount of workers they can get by with.      That is not really the same thing though,  planes have large surfaces to counteract off center thrust.  This rocket does not.     I think you mean .2 mph/h (miles per hour/per hour) this is because acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity.  MPH is a measure of velocity.  If you need more clarification on that, just ask.    To your main question.  I am not sure if it is .2 MPH/H but New Horizons is decelerating.  The reason New horizons is slowing down, is because of the Suns gravity.  As New Horizons moves away from the Sun, it slows down, for the same reason that when you throw a ball strait up in the air it slows down.  The main difference is that New Horizons is moving fast enough that it will never fall back to the Sun it will just slow down over time.  Does that make sense?   What was the reasoning behind the ban?   I don't think I ever saw season 1.  I only saw one episode, and basically they were repoing a helicopter and the owner comes running out onto the ramp, starts the helicopter and takes off directly from the ramp(no air taxi) with the repo people running after him.  It was just ridiculous.     Wow awesome explanation, this was exactly what I was wondering about.  So cool to get an inside technical explanation.   But if it were to help with the gravity turn wouldn't the SRB need to be on the bottom?  It looks like it flies on top for most of the flight.  Would this help at all with generating lift over the rocket body?   I was reading about the Atlas V recently and realized that in a few of its configurations it only has 1 solid rocket booster.  One of those configurations has been launched 3 times.  The configuration can be really well seen in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dME5amgp0Ug  My question is how is the vehicle able to deal with the loading, because it is quite obvious the rocket seems to be flying slightly sideways to compensate for the off center thrust.  How is the rocket able to fly like this?  It's so odd to see a non symmetrical rocket design.          It was supposed to be an example.  What happens when you live in a heavily conservative area where the majority of people are against Homosexuality. Instead of it being that one store where you don't go because they refuse to serve you, now it is 90% of them.    Imagine if this town is small enough where it only has one super market, or one mechanic.  What happens when you need to buy food or get your car repaired and they refuse your business for religious reasons.  In many rural areas this is not that much of a stretch.  We would not be ok with it if they refused your business because of your race, why is it suddenly ok when it is your orientation.   wow I can't tell if they are joking or not on that sub.  Thats pretty messed up.    w.e bye.  ?   It depends which news you watch I bet both sides would think they came away victorious.   I am going to link you to this thread.  This is how bad it can get when you choose to let people discriminate.

By being in the Eurozone it means they are part of Europe if they are to leave Europe then who else would they turn to?  Russia? The Middle East?  It is not necessarily about the benefits it supplies, but what it means.     you have to remember this is very political imagine what it would mean if Hawaii had to succeed because they were so far into debt, it would throw a lot into question about the viability of the US.      Original post from the front page of reddit 2 days ago  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cul3k/fan_gets_owned_by_bryan_cranston_at_comiccon/  Original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLEfrulUEcs      You could have saved fuel by not brining your fairing all the way to Jool.  Why did you choose to wait until Lathe to get rid of it?         I would be worried about pulling off some paint those sticky mounts are serious stuff.   You will never get the mount off if you do that, and i think this would cont as adding something to the exterior which is at the very edge of legality.   There is a difference between punishing them, and handicapping them.  How would you feel if for every person we sent to jail we cut off a their foot.  The worse the crime the more you loose, so shoplifting it a toe, grand theft auto is your foot, and murder is leg below the knee.  If you proposed this people would say this is horrible.  People would be unable to care for themselves once they leave prison.  What people do not recognize is this is what we already do this to people mentally.  When you treat a person like an animal and don't give them the chance to better themselves, than they are going to turn into an animal.  Are prisons these days are the breeding ground for even worse criminals, and even if you do get out we make life so hard for you once you get out that it is likely that you will be forced to return soon.  We are basically cutting their leg off as "punishment" and then blame then when they can't contribute to society when they get out of prison.  So we should ask ourselves is it worth it to "punish" these people with the enormous amount it costs us both monetary and soacially to everyone else.   It is not as uncommon as you think, and often times it can be accidental from factors like stress lack of sleep and being mentally frayed.  Still tragic either way.

    Yes, Trump's not dangerous at all.....   Most of those defending Trump have to be paid sock puppets. Half of the people (or more) who showed up for his candidate announcement were paid to be there. It's highly likely he's paying people to leave comments too.   You have just made a friend for life.      I was referring to fighting in war, not starting them.   Um, maybe they are now. However, I'll take a douche who's served and bled for his country than a man who would bleed his country dry for himself.   But I've never heard Cheney, despite his faults, disparage POWs.  It's one thing to avoid war. It's another to avoid war and then insult those who served.   There's a difference between self-awareness and wisdom. Gaining one does not mean gaining the other.  	9

 Hello! My father is 49 years old and lives at home with his parents due to three suicide attempts.  He has been diagnosed with a mild case of schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and a mild bipolar disorder.  With his latest suicide attempt he had a minor stroke and now has difficulty speaking (slight stutter), and his hands shake.  He used to go bowling twice a week but insists that the people there talk about him and don't like him so he doesn't want to go back.  I am desperately trying to find a hobby for him to add more meaning to his life.  He doesn't like being out in the sun, he doesn't like crowded places, he can read but doesn't remember what he just read, and he doesn't have to motor skills to draw or paint (according to him).  He has a truck and can drive, and he used to go fishing a lot but doesn't want to do that anymore due to being out in the sun.  Please help me brainstorm potential hobbies that would be within his comfort zone!  *note - I am in the military stationed overseas, so spending more time with him isn't an option right now :(   You don't say?   For example, if a person is laying down and someone asks "what's up?" Is the ceiling still up or is above the person's head up?

I actually often think to shoot some video but then I get so excited taking photos that it never enters my mind to make video.  Maybe some day.

You indicated that their comment "is simply not true" but then later clarified that it's not true that all breeds have the "ability to kill you." So, the disconnect is that "potential for destruction"  "ability to kill you". I believe that /u/Cookiesandcardio's statement is true that all breeds have the potential for destruction  a quick Internet search indicates that even [wienerdogs have been known to seriously injure small children](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/12/27/dachshund-put-to-death-after-mauling-md-baby/d05a3d2a-f857-4c1a-8f6e-c0156477c548/). I also believe that your statement is true that not all breeds have the potential to kill you, e.g., [there is no record of a Dachshund having killed anyone in the last 30+ years](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf).

 Baby steps. Sounds like you're doing things the healthiest way you can. Keep it that way.   Part of the problem here is that it sounds like you're attempting to gain muscle and lean out at the same time. While this isn't impossible, it can certainly be tricky.  I would recommend bulking and then cutting. That is, if you still feel the need to gain more muscle mass. If you're already satisfied with your muscle mass, bump up the cardio and limit your lifting to focus more on toning rather than growth.    is it more likely that I am just shit at counting calories?  Calorie consumption sounds okay, 1800-2100 is a good ballpark (don't know your stats). However the fact that you even have to ask yourself this question probably means you could be doing better at keeping track. Perhaps you already answered your own question!  [If you're curious](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bmr_calculator.htm)  Good Luck!   Ended football right before my senior season in high school. Had to help with bills anyways and work full time since my mom was out of work. The high school I went to practically breeds D1 recruits. When I think back, sure I would have loved to continue on and play in college, and it HURT LIKE HELL to have to give it up.  However, before I even graduated that year I already had a foot through the door in the finance industry, started expanding on my hobbies, and even leaned out and got signed with a top modeling agency.  All in all, the class before mine graduated 8 D1 recruits and things hardly worked out for any of them. I on the other hand had a great resume, academic scholarships, and multiple income sources. It was one of those changes that took some time to respect and truly appreciate.

 When I was little my mother used to tell me the same bedtime story over and over again. And while it might not sound like anything bad the particular story used to me the not afraid of having monsters under the bed, but it did something worse. The story made me afraid of walking on the carpet with no socks or shoes on and the story goes like this. Once upon a time when the house was first built it was owned by a lonely man and he was very fond of feet. No one knew when his fetish began, but when it did he obsessed over it to the point where people began to avoid him as much as possible. And it made him go a little crazy, so one day he came up with a plan to cut someone's feet off and keep them, but it didn't go as he expected. He did find a girl, kidnaped her, and drugged her, but when he left to get his saw, he came back to discovered that she was gone and do you know what happened next? At this point, I would be shivering underneath the covers scared and even though I would nod my head she would continue the story anyway. The girl snuck behind the man and hit him in the back of the head once, twice, three times with a vase under he finally fell. But that didn't stop the girl from continuing to beat his head until his blood was firmly soaked into the carpet and his head was no longer recognizable. Then the girl left and everyone lived happily ever after, but no really. The man lived a few ways from town and when he suddenly disappeared no one wanted to check on him because they were disturbed of his fetish so people started to pretend he didn't exist and started to pretend that they didn't smell the stench of decay coming from his house. But exactly one year after his death strange things started happening, people started disappearing and some woke up with their feet missing. But all the reports had one thing in common, all of the events happened when the victim walked barefoot on a carpet. And after the conclusion was made the people in the town just knew that the feet loving man was responsible, so they band together and made way for his house, but when they busted the door down they were surprised at what they saw.   There was blood on the walls and dripping from the ceiling, there were dead bodies littered everywhere, but no feet to be found. So everyone split up into groups to search the house and some people were left outside due to their weak stomach. The house was stuffy and the dark, but the townspeople didn't care they wanted to find the culprit of the bloodshed and murder and that's exactly what they found. A young woman by the name of Ruby was ahead of the group who were chosen to explore the basement she opened the door and peeked her head through before she shined her flashlight. At first she didn't see anything until she saw a lump in the corner, she thought about yelling behind her and telling her group about what she was about to do but decided against it. She thought it was nothing and wanted to get out of the house as soon as possible, so she kept the door the open and crept slowly and quietly towards the shadow in the corner of the basement. She shined her flashlight on it and dropped it when she finally realized what she was looking at, but that attracted the shadow's attention.   It was a gray blob of ashen flesh with feet stuck around it, some were so buried into the blob that only toes were visible. And the worst part is that the feet flexed and moved they were alive, some toes on the side of the blob wiggled at Ruby as if in greeting before the mass began to slowly make its way towards her. Poor Ruby was too petrified to move or speak and the only smart thing she did was the thing that saved her. Someone from her group noticed that she was missing and went ahead to find her and got there in time to save her. And when Ruby finally got her breathing under control and told everyone what had happened the monster got out and attack two people already. So the mayor had everyone leave the house and had it closed down, since nobody wanted to kill the monster and no one knew if condemning the house would kill the monster of free it.   "But why can't I walk on the carpet?" I asked in my scared little child voice.  "Because the monster had to get his feet from somewhere." My mom said in a mushy voice, trying to mimic me.   "I don't wanna get my feet eaten." I would say in almost crying.  "Well wear shoes or socks to confuse the monster so he won't eat your precious little feet." She said in a chipper voice, before she shuffled from the side of my bed in her house slippers and closed the door to my room, leaving me in darkness.   And so nosleep I have come here to tell you that I'm going to face my fears and walk barefoot on the carpet of my apartment. I had called my mother to tell her about what I was about to do, but she sounded confused on the phone and told me that she never told me that story before. That gives me even more insurance that it was just my imagination and that there's no monster in the carpet, wish me luck!     How do you know that you have only one to four days to live?   Welp, be got what he deserved. But what about the police?   You just made me throw up in my mouth. Baby legs... why? That's just so gross.   Sooo... we're screwed?   Nooo! I don't wanna be a robot, or a gateway, or whatever mehhhh.   I wish you the best of luck, and you might wanna take a weapon with you, for saftey reasons of course. You could like... tie up the bald man and torture him into telling you where Sophie is.   Nooo! I don't wanna, but fine.   What's that, I'm to lazy to Google.   Well... you shouldn't have done the ritual in the first place, isn't dangerous.  Umm I don't know what to tell you, good luck?    What!?! I thought he was a vampire, I guess I was wrong.   Don't you think that a little bit of this is your fault, I mean you probably didn't mean to send someone to their death on purpose. But you should have probably called the police when you heard screaming.   Or, or, or, everthing you said BUT she a ghost and died waiting for her kids n stuff. Hmm? Hmm? Hmmmmmmmm?   I was looking through the horror stories you were wrote and found this, I didn't know reddit had this kind of stuff. But I totally love your onesie!   My thoughts exactly.   Maybe you should call organization 440.   I think OP should have put his mother in a nursery home since he couldn't take care of her properly. He was wearing himself out trying to mange the barn and take care of his mom, but that's just my opinion though.  	17
       I knew it was fake but I couldn't stop laughing as I read it                Lies. Heard this joke a couple years ago. Still funny though lol    As a 17 year old male just coming out of high school, I can tell you that studying is important. Make sure you have a firm grasp on all concepts you learn in math because they all come back. English is incredibly important as well because of SAT and ACT tests. Study your butt off and do well in those two subjects.    British spelling is mould. American (woot woot) is mold.    So like, 1/30th of a grape per day?

 Sometimes I get weirded out. Like, can you imagine Voldemort taking a dump?   This one is so cool.      It's normally 'Jennisfit'. but right now it's 'Jennistired'..........................   Okay...This is an update from [what happened to me one night at my parent's house](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3dsri4/im_so_glad_i_didnt_make_eye_contact/).   I was pretty sure it was just my imagination after the sun started to come up and I finally drifted off. When I woke later that morning it all seemed like a dream. One thing that I remember is when I got out of bed I noticed an old photograph of me was on the floor. I was standing in my parent's driveway and I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' shirt. I figured it had just fallen off the shelf and put it back.   I talked to my parents and husband about the crazy nightmare I had. They agreed it was unnerving, and we all laughed it off.  My husband and I returned home and I started to put that night in the back on my mind. However, since it happened, sleep evades me. I lay awake and stare into the darkness for hours, it's only when I see the grey light of day that I feel my eyelids grow heavy.  Last night I was having my usual night of insomnia. It was nearly three in the morning. I was sitting in my studio just browsing the internet. I should mention it was a very clear night. All of a sudden the lights flickered and went out. the only light was coming from my computer monitor.  I didn't think much of it, because the power went out only a few days ago, due to a bad storm.  I still had a full battery on my computer and I decided to shut it down in case the power was off until morning. I walk out as the computer shuts down to get a glass of water and a book. After my computer completely shuts down it's pitch black in my studio, except for the faint moonlight coming from my huge window. The window is curtained and takes up a five by five foot square in the wall. It faces my massive backyard. [Just took this picture of it about a minute ago](http://imgur.com/4dZl5Gy).  I feel relaxed and look at the clear night sky though my window. It's darker inside the house than outside and it's a beautiful view. As I'm gazing up, I notice a tiny movement out of the corner of my eye to the left of my back yard.  I glance over an see a figure of a man walking through the yard. At this point I'm a little shocked because our backyard is completely secluded and fenced off for about .5 acres.   I decided I would just watch and see what he did since I was confident that he couldn't see me. He started to make his way across my backyard, moving away from my house. I felt relieved. Then he stopped, facing away from me. He just stood there for a good five minutes, about 50 feet from my window. I didn't move a muscle. I just watched and waited.  Then he turned completely around. I swear to god, he looked right at me through my window and I could see the whites of his eyes. Through the pitch darkness, I could see them. He started to move towards me. I was completely petrified but still didn't think that he could see me. I backed up to the wall of my studio. He started to move faster. He was only about 20 feet away from my window when the lights came back on.   He could see me! He could see me and I couldn't see him! What the fuck?! I ran out of my studio down the hall into the bedroom and grabbed the gun off the night stand. I shook my husband awake and told him there was someone outside in out back yard.  I walked to the back door with him, both of us with our guns drawn. I flipped the back light on and slowly opened the back door. We looked around with the flashlight and we couldn't see anyone. My heart was about ready to come out of my chest.  We walked out into the yard, with all the lights turned on and with our guns and flashlights, everything started to seem less sinister.   I calmed down and we made our way back to the house. As we were walking back, something caught my eye. I looked over and saw a photograph laying in the grass. As I walked over I noticed it was of me.  Bemused and feeling a bit giddy from the adrenaline rush, I picked it up. It was a photograph of me standing in my parents driveway as a kid. I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' tee shirt. I flipped the photograph over. Scrawled in red letters, were the words, "I can still see you."   A whole new wooooorrld!!!   Ah! I made one of these as a kid! It was mesmerizing...still...is....    Aw, yay! Happy tears!   This is one of my favorites. :)   We would have to walk around the class room in a line, one behind the other and drop our valentines in everyone's box as we passed their desk. Everyone was supposed to give one to everyone else. Through 3rd-6th grade, almost everyone would skip me... :( Kids are mean, and I didn't give any for sixth grade. I didn't even stand up.   That's so clever!    Abalone is a specific animal and produces a distinct color and swirl pattern that consists of nacre similar to most mollusks. However, the shells in the photo supplied by OP are not from an abalone shell. The shells are too white and too smooth. But it's all pretty!    /r/woahdude    It's a cuttlefish. It's this in the same family though. :) Cephalopods are neat.   I've recently heard the term Octopode, from a marine biologist. I think it sounds a bit more eloquent than Octopuses.   I love cuttlefish. Hands down, my favorite (non human) creature on the planet.   I don't think they would appreciate me hawking my stuff. I just wanted to share something that I created. If you're seriously interested in me making you one, PM me for details.   ...that escalated quickly.   It's mother of pearl   I believe those are actually white labradorite. Often called Rainbow moonstone. Is so pretty!    Most people that I know, who wire wrap have gone through a ton of time and materials to hone their own techniques. It's something that takes a ton of practice and patience. I'm not half as good as most of the people on here, but I've gone through my fair share of wire and broken gems. I'm still learning too.    Oh wow. That's beautiful!  	22

    Quitting the herb is a mental game that requires lots of discipline and self respect. Remember that this is for your own good and that there's more to life than just weed. Follow your passions for whatever you like go find a hobby and dedicate yourself to it. I would suggest focusing on cardio and running in the morning to get your metabolism going. You can do it and remember that the first ten days are the hardest ones    Thanks for taking me back to memory lane! I can't wait to trip again.    My pax, nine grams of high grade silver haze, expensive grinder and all of my papers crutches and backwoods were all thrown out this morning. I am so sad and disappointed but I had messed up. I got caught by my mom when she was looking through my car and found a nug. She started looking through my stuff popped open the trunk and inside my backpack were all of my essentials. This weed reeks and just grinding buds inside will leave the car smelling for a couple of days even though we stay airing out! I am 18 and I don't really know what this is, a kind of rant I guess... I hate disobeying my parents and I never smoke inside of bring any form of paraphernalia inside. It's just that I've been fighting depression for 3 years and I keep on putting meds off even though my psychologist and doctors recommend it. Maybe I'm wrong but cannabis has actually helped me. I felt especially good this week due to me starting to catch up in my classes and eating healthier and even sleeping better all because of this wonderful plant. Unfortunately my mother does not see it this way and was furious and greatly disappointed when she found my stash, she even broke down and cried and that made me feel like the biggest scum on earth.      	5
    Humans are cancer to this planet, unless we hurry the hell up and progress in science and intergalactic travel. Religion sometimes holding it back... It's a shame we won't be around to see our species around the galaxies. Sci-fi movies will have to do for now! :)  .  Going bed now! (2am) [Farewell to you sir.](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.11640658.0674/pp,375x360.jpg)   Hahahaha yes! xD     This is the answer for everything! The human species have not yet matured! ;)   Yup, the big guys cause evil too.  ISIS? [Funded mostly by the US.](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#q=does+the+US+fund+isis)  .  Why?  .  Money.   [xD well it's true!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o28xBkVcpsw)  .  My dream is that humans will all wake up from this religious lie that has been cursed upon us since birth. Progress is being made! :3   Exactly my point. Raised to be a good boy and work for the big companies who take control of your life on a daily basis, being used to make money. And leading you into believing in this fantasy heaven, or you'll go to hell.   .  "Be a good boy or else santa isn't coming."  .  Money. It's all money.  .  Why don't we all just treat each other nicely, remove religion (religion, not faith.) and progress as a species and stop bombing eachother?   Religion won't die out, for sure, there'll always be strange people who believe in magical small arab jews capable of answering over 7 billion prayers each day including on their day off, which is when most of the praying takes place, and who have big beards that also get eaten by fish and build big boats and live up to 9,000 years old   (Wow if religion never existed, you'd think I was absolutely high as fuck right now.)  but I hope the main kind of 'religions' do die out and people start realizing that the evidence of life and all its answers are all around them.    "I'm Jewish"   "I'm not religious"   "I'm agnostic"  Make your mind up?  .  From a religious point of view (pretending i'm religious) from birth you grow up thinking santa is real, and thinking that religion is real. But with santa, you find out it's just your parents. And there's evidence for it. Thus making you no longer believe in santa.  .  Now I know that's a very blunt and narrow minded way to put it, but you get the jist of what I'm saying. In addition to how Christianity always needs money, doesn't pay taxes, and leads you to believe that after you've worked your entire life to make big companies money, you'll die, and go to this fantasy land. But when you die you'll realise that they all lied to you.   Haha jk, you'll be dead.   I'm not on about Darwin, I'm straight up on about the fact that the UK is marked as a christian country. National religion type stuff.   "Modern society has decided that selling your daughter into sexual slavery and owning slaves isn't okay, so we don't do it. We've decided that there's nothing abhorrent about human sexuality, gay or straight, so we've tossed that out. "  So how did this bit manage to make its way into the holy bible? I'm not being sarcastic, but isn't that kind of... weird? To have a holy bible then to ignore it? Not that 'it' being rape is a good thing to do. [Bo hits on some good points too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxc20saM8DA)  In terms of having Charles Darwin on the note, that's awesome. Showing science advancing the understanding of the entire human species all done by one person is an outstanding way of showing how well we can perform once our minds are free.   You grew out of santa.  Why not religion?  It sounds random and silly, but just have a little think about that   I'm atheist, thanks for announcing that you're a jew or I wouldn't of known that you are of higher status than myself.  So we've gone from asking a question about Darwin and religion, to me trying to look 'cute' 'bias' and 'clever'? Correct?  Science and religion can coexist side by side. I didn't say it couldn't.  The bible states that you can sell your daughter for sex, own a slave, cannot be gay or eat shrimp, and even goes on about living over 9000 years old. Tell me more about how we're not adapting the bible to fit modern society?    Very much correct, though I'm unsure about the anti-science in terms of *SOME* believers / anti vaccines.   I'm aware of the percentages of religion, I'm not on about them. A quick wikipedia search reveals that the UK is tagged as a christian country. Dominantly. Hence why we have churches all over the place. The uk is a christian country.   Finished high school. Your turn.   Well it's first of all not very easy to do, and there are many challenges faced in order to do so.  Firstly, the body or brain may choose to reject one another. Meaning that you'd die basically. Much like heart transplants, but precautions can be taken to try and minimise this risk.  Next we'd need to connect the brain up to the body, this will take hours on hours to complete, and it'd need to be attached to the spinal cord which is extremely / impossible to do as to date.  We need to connect all the of neurons, each of which contain up to 10,000 synapses EACH. And in some places such as the cortex, will even be in trillions. (Yes spelt with a T.)  And quite frankly, the technology needed is no way near to the advance level of the human brain.  While it may be possible to do a brain transplant. We simply don't have enough understanding and technology available in order to proceed. Though this may change in years to come.  	15
 My girlfriend recently has started taking antidepressants (Lexapro). I have known she has been depressed, but she really struggles talking about it. Anytime it ever comes up, she says that she hates talking about it and quickly changes the subject. How can I get my girlfriend to try to talk about her depression with me?   What are better ways to phrase questions such as "What do you think the source of your depression is? Is your depression situational or clinical? What exactly have you been diagnosed with (All I have been told is she has anxiety and depression, nothing like the name of a specific disorder).   I know that a depressed person has trouble explaining how they feel to a person without depression, but how can I get her to open up to me so I can help her more? Am I actually completely wrong in trying to do this?   My girlfriend just started taking antidepressants for her depression. She is really struggling to open up to people about her depression. I want to help so badly, but all I really know is that she's depressed. I don't know what's causing it, if its situational or an actual disorder. How can I get her to open up to me/how can I help her cope with/overcome her condition?   I need shoe help   Madeon [Only Way Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXGk_GcQ09g).

 Dark Mysteries is the name of that channel, it has videos on other things like the deep web that aren't mysteries as well :) meaning it doesn't only upload mysteries im guessing      I will, thanks for your comment!   Thank you for your reply, and no, unfortunately  I don't have any professional programming experience, I was thinking in starting to work on opensource projects to add to my resume but I don't know how valuable it would be, by any chance do you know any resources to strengthen my data structures/algorithms knowledge? I didn't really cover much about this at the university.  Thanks again for your time.   Hello everyone and thank you for taking time to read my question, so here is how it goes.  I graduated as a Computer Systems Engineer from a local university in my hometown in Mexico about a year ago, I'll be going to the US (most likely Houston) in a couple of months with my wife, my questions are:  1. Is my degree as a Computer Systems Engineer valid in the US? or do I have to redo the career?  2. What are the chances of getting hired by a company even though my degree is from Mexico?  3. What technologies do you recommend I go more in depth in order to land a job as quickly as possible when I go to the US(I would like webdev, but anything in the programming area is good enough, I have some knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, Python,C++, Visual Studio, and a little bit of Java)?   4. At the moment I run a local business on computer repair, what can I do to add something valuable to my resume, since there aren't many programming jobs in my local town?   Thank you again for your time.      Find a way to open it and deliver OP  	7
 Film recently released called "It Follows". I'd recommend it.      Her influence and rule are two different things. She has direct physical rule over all of Slaver's Bay as of Season 5, that includes Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen. However her influence actually spreads further than that. There is a scene in the latest episode where a group of people pray for her in Volantis, which is much further west. It would be hard to calculate, however I'd say she actually has influence over a large portion of Essos.   She is a red head. Epsilon tracts talk about red heads  	4
 I'm sorry that I used the word eight and then numerals for 12.      My mom had this CD with a whole bunch of seemingly random songs on it that she would play for me when I was a baby. The first track was You've Got To Hide Your Love Away (Anthology version).   Let's make something wonderful of someone's life!   You guys aren't fu   What?    If you could add any feature to the next GoPro (Ignoring cost, plausibility or impracticality) what would it be?

 I guess the thing that I find most interesting is that this "crush" also known as transference, from what I've read online, can be a very useful therapeutic tool and can be used to figure out a lot of things from my past.  So I mean as awkward as it feels, and yet still feeling like it's awesome to talk to her, apparently it could play out for the benefit of my mental health.  Assuming she's comfortable enough with taking on this thing.   So, I'm a 35 year old guy.  Since I was 16 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder.  I have been on medications and in therapy almost the entirety of the last nearly 20 years.   I have had many different therapists over the years.  Some I outright hated, some were just kind of meh, and some I thought were awesome.    So a year ago I got a new therapist when my old one left the agency.  Up until this point all of my therapists had mostly been older women, motherly or grandmotherly.  I've had a couple male therapists and I noticed I tend to butt heads with them or just feel like they are aloof or don't care.  But I always purposely avoided younger female therapists.  This new therapist I have had the last year is maybe a 30 year old woman, very attractive, and very funny.  I was leery of sticking with her after our first few sessions as I felt uncomfortable around a younger female therapist as I always felt like I was being judged or something.  But I figured I'd stick with her for a few sessions and see how it played out.  To my surprise, I found myself more comfortable and safe around this therapist than any I've had with any in years.      I've gone back to college lately and have been working on my degree, and I had a bit of a mental breakdown towards the end of the last semester.  I started to put schoolwork on hold as my therapist was insisting for a while now that I write her a paper explaining why I am the way I am.  This paper ended up turning into over 80 pages of typed history from my past, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, old girlfriends and relationships, old friendships, etc.  Since writing all this I've started to have crying spells again, I haven't had these in years.  I also keep ruminating about the past now.  So in the last few months I started to notice that I was starting to feel like I had a crush developing for my therapist. I always look forward to my therapy sessions, and even sometimes count down the days to the next one,  and in the past therapy was more of a chore to get over with, and many times I would blow it off or outright cancel appointments.  I haven't done either since I've had this therapist.       Now my therapist is married, but even despite that, by virtue of being my therapist she is literally the most unattainable person for me on the planet. I fully understand the ethical and legal ramifications of any breaking of the therapeutic boundary. So I know my thoughts are unrealistic. But I can't stop thinking about her.  I was disturbed by this as I had no idea what it was and I did some googling and discovered that what I was experiencing was called transference.  I also got the impression that this is something I should tell my therapist about and try to work through as it probably reveals something about my past.  It took me a couple sessions to work up the courage to tell her.  My fears were that she might refer me to a different therapist, or being that the atmosphere of my sessions are very light hearted and joking, I also feared that maybe telling her would make the sessions more rigid and stuffy.  After telling her she assured me neither would happen, but other than that she seemed unphased by my confession.  She simply said, "I must remind you of someone.  Do you know who?"  I don't know who.  This will probably be a discussion for future sessions.  But it still bothers me that between sessions I still think about her more than what feels healthy and how overwhelming the feeling is.  Has anyone else here experienced this?   I play this same conversation in my head.   Sex.   The point is it's not real...actually.  I don't REALLY know her at all, and that's by design in the therapeutic relationship.  By feelings are not really for HER.  It's something that I'm projecting onto her that speaks to something in past, that's what we need to get to the bottom of.   Well for starters, I haven't disclosed this information to my therapist yet.  As far as currently it means in regards to my treatment is that I never miss an appointment, but like right now she's on vacation and I've been having a rough time and I feel kind of slighted that she's gone when i need her.  But I know she has her own life but I've decided I HAVE TO tell her or else this is going to impede my treatment and actually after googling about it a bit, I found it's so common an occurrence that there is a term for it: transference.  Apparently also this can be therapeutic to work through as to why I am having these feelings, so when she returns from vacation I intend to actually share this with her, not because I think anything will become of it, because she is most certainly, by virtue of being my therapist, the most unattainable person on the planet for me, but because I need to work on whatever underlying issues are causing these feelings to be projected onto my very attractive, very young female, married, therapist.   I have a crush on my therapist right now.   I had a math program from the 90's that had a catchy theme song called Blaster Pals that I remember and found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1PnP11Dgw0  	8
 It was shutting down the entire 30 minutes I was there so I'm not sure if it works.   Very true! XP wasn't too bad though.    Just thought i'd add this is taken in a rural city and this is the only time i've seen one.    I can kind of understand. Mine just lost his job and now stays up until 3 am (usually I'm expected to also stay up) and sleeps in until midday. Wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't dealing with horrible morning sickness and a teething toddler haha.   Edit: He's a couple years my senior so same thing. He's always right lol.   	4

 One?                        He is saying that these more flippant responses dont really address his question, and may only have the appearance of profundity.    So if it is perpetrated by a military, it is not terror?   Around for what?   He overestimates the competence of *every* government.    What's the scientific consensus on it?   Hillary is a warmonger.   You don't have a mobile phone so you could check this at work?   That first paragraph nails it.    Yes, that hike cut short by a rage meltdown reminds me of many outings I had with my SO that were ruined for no reason. Painful times. I hope the damage isn't permanent.    No.    Alan Watts talks about Confucianism and Taoism here: http://youtu.be/Iv9zocKASsM   Excellent. Thanks!!!   I kid you not - just now someone came into the room and asked me: "What are you doing?"  Me: "Surfing the internet....literally."    Can you give a nutshell version of Wittgenstein's take on Kierkegaard?   Horseshit. The banksters are the criminals. Debtors can and do sue lenders and third parties all the time. As signed contract doesnt absolve the parties of wrong doing, nor does it mean all future wrong doing is shared.    Right. I thought this person should be aware of both since he/she was asking about it.    I found that from chapter 8 on it was much easier - after the "inner chapters". Im reading the Penguin edition/translation.     It is another way of spelling Chuang Tzu. (For some reason, there is an aversion to acknowledging this here.) He is the other big Taoist author, along with Lao Tzu. "The Book of Chuang Tzu" along with the "Tao Te Ching" are the two primary Taoist texts, in very different styles that complement each other very well. The Penguin editions of both are superb.    Also known as Chuang Tzu.    Nothing is accurate when describing a person. No word or words or linguistic reduction of any kind is 1:1. Meyers-Briggs is a provisional convention, a tool, to communicate - not to be confused with people themselves.    It was because the monkey didnt even turn around to see where it went.    I see what you mean now.    Oppressed? Most of people on facebook have a rainbow profile picture. Gay people were dancing in their underwear on the street here two nights ago. Try again.   And how and why are we all supposed to know another's sexual preference anyway?   Ha, as if i care what someone like you thinks.  So you call someone a fucking cunt because of a silly rainbow flag. What happened to all the tolerance?    Go call your wife's parents and see if theyll smoke some dope with you. Would be a better use of your time.    I'm not even going to read that.  Go get a life.  You have issues, you're ugly and angry and should be shunned.  I guess that's why you're here in the internet.   The authority of those getting married, manifest by getting married.  If they want to sign a legal contract, they can do that too.   Tell us what exactly about my comment had to do with *any* kind of ideology.  And try responding substantively to what I *actually* said.      No one said anything about the kindness of strangers, for one thing.  I wouldn't suggest the kindness of politicians is any better though.  It seems you're the one projecting and imagining things. Beyond that, I'm done talking to you.  Waste of time.   Your comment has zero substance, other than just plain dumbness.    Liberation? Ha ha. Not quite.   Name calling over a flag? There's progress.    Because a person's sexual preference has nothing to do with me or anyone else, and because the government should have nothing to do with marriage of any kind. And because support for homosexuals need not be explicitly different from support of anyone else. And because the explicitness of it doesnt make any substantive difference.    Id much rather it was a rainbow flag.    Where, over the Bering Sea?   What deluded sanctimony!   You always have been, and always will be free to pay *more* than you are charged. You can give as much money as you want to any downtrodden minimum wage employee you like, regardless of whether they were recently given a raise or prices were raised to account for it.    Shows you just how dumb the former is, and how it is good that everyone isnt that stupid.    Exactly. That's one basic reason these books just aren't that good. It was that way with Atlas Shrugged too, which people worship anyway.    Like the behavior of bears is consistent and predictable one moment to the next?  Watch 'Grizzly Man' and learn something.    Because it means debt slavery to entities that want to loot as much of their livihood as possible.    There are much better words for it than competitive. Truly competitive people are always extrovert, and of the choleric temperament, where it comes with jealousy and other things.    This is a piece of shit comment, buttercup. He was asking for help and advice. You framing this as "being negative" is disingenuous as best.   If you are highly competitive, you are not INTJ.   Pure evil, corrupt, wasteful, deceitful. Etc. They exist to take your money and energy.    TIL: This whole article is full of crap.    DJ doesnt owe us a thing. It is his life, he can go where he wants. He is from Texas. It isnt a huge surprise.   I love the guy, but really dont like the liability that his FT shooting is, in the playoffs especially.  I wish him the best - except when he plays the Clippers.       This has to do with the Ni in us not seeing 'things' as thing per se. We don't see differentiation in objects of activities.   Plus, we don't want to just take the world as it is, and live a mindless, soulless, ready-made life jusr because.   Nonetheless, this does present practical difficulties.   Edit: And we see ourselves as outside the world, reflecting on it instead of acting in it.    Ive been reading a lot of Taoism lately (Lao Tzu, Chuang Tzu, Alan Watts) and it is amazing how it counters, or preempts, about every one of these.   I recommend it to everyone here!   My girlfriend diagnosed me with Asberger's too. :)   Im a licensed architect. I like architecture, but practicing it in the real world is a joke. 95% of what you do is not architecture. You don't get paid anything.  Real architecture is a profession to serve those who can pay gor it: the rich. I could go on. Let me know if you have any specific questions.    He is from Texas too.    Exactly what they needed!  A guy who can finish big games.    Exactly.    Thrre are always two sides to these contracts: debtors and creditors. For some reason, when they go south, many people only see the debtors as responsible. The creditors are just as responsible, if not more so, due to their fudiciary duties and supposed expertise - and due diligence as to where their money is going.    Not everything falls into the category of 'science'.    At was at a bar once, and Bruce Willis bought everyone there a drink. Generous guy.    Every high school student should have to watch this.    Yeah, throw out the "manipulation has happened before".  Certainly don't want anyone to tell you that.     What's beyond ignorant is implying that this sort of thing never happens, and faulting someone for suspecting it is.  Further, the fact that it has been reported elsewhere has *nothing* to do with whether or not this report is actually an attempt to influence the markets.   Well, generalizations are generally true. Have you ever been to a gay pride parade? You think most homosexuals would even deny they externalize? (How else would anyone even know theyre a homosexual?) Only when the wrong person makes the claim.   You're trolling a subreddit you moderate.  Pretending to spot bigotry, or is it homophobia? Then delete comments that you dont like. I have friends who are gay, but they dont wear it on their sleeve. Whatever happened to tolerance?  Youre a confused hypocrite. And are actually counter productive to your cause.    You mean me saying that gay people externalize everything is bigotry? Can you tell me what exactly I said that was definitively bigoted? You're making general and elusive comments, that sound so serious and certain. Well, be specific. Only after I question your warning do you tell me a comment is removed?   What is it? Treading a thin line or bigotry? Warned for saying *what* exactly?   "Why would Belichick cheat?"   Evidently Pau told him about Kobe.    Besides, there already is a name for bigots. It's "bigot".     Yeah because for gay people their behavior is *everything*, especially identity. Whereas with anyone else, the behavior is distinct from who they are. Gay people for some reason have to externalize everything, even the most private.    And if you have no problem with gay people, but just think they need to get over themselves, stop making their behavior an identity, and stop putting their gayness in people's faces, you're still a homophobe. And that's not the definition of that word. But precision is not something that easily furthers the gay agenda.    What a load of delusional dishonest bullshit. I guess now Im a bigot and a homophobe.     Rubber bullets sounds like a gay sex toy.   "Enjoying sex" isn't what anyone is talking about.  Has anyone *ever* said there was shame in *enjoying* sex?  No.   Calm down, it's just the new Homeland Security terror alert system.   "Often cited" by people who wish it to be true by virtue of repeating it, a common practice here on reddit.  But this has nothing necessarily to do with actual reality.  Though it isn't hard to believe that it sometimes occurs, study or not.  Another theory that isn't new is that some gay people wish to stigmatize those who don't like their behavior.  So they call anyone who doesn't support in-your-face flamboyance, for example, a homophobe, as if that is a scientifically established category - because it sounds like it might be.  Actually, *homo* means "the same" and *phobia* means "fear of":  Fear of the same.  This is the furthest thing from scientific rigorous thinking, which is supposed to be cool on reddit.    Good enough for reddit though.  You know, "because science".    Yeah, everyone already knows it.  Just like everyone knows that if you are racist, you're just reacting to a deep internal fear that you might actually be black, for example.   Was going to recommend Camus.   Right, but no one here is talking about any plan, just dogs.       Dogs = detailed plan ?  Shhhhh, be bery bery quiet.  I hunting wabbit.   This was obviously edited.   Banksters use the same tricks to get around every law that is so zealously thrown at them.   How about post the sign *before* the bridge, not *on* the bridge.  Doesn't matter how big it is, or if there already are two signs there, or a hundred signs there.   The "chatter"  is 50:1 in favor of gay marriage.       Exactly. I heard they were using those. But where are they?   I literaly just read that today. And Chuang Tzu was bashing a battered tub and singing.    Ok but how do you know, if it hasn't been reported?  I haven't seen any dogs on TV.    Can someone tell me why they aren't tracking this guy, David Sweat, with a team of hound dogs.  They know where they saw him last, literally just over an hour ago, as I type this.  It seems they could put some dogs on that trail and have him captured immanently.  Why not?   it's ok.  forgive me for being harsh.  it is just that with this subreddit, 9 out of 10 comments are, to paraphrase: "words don't matter, it is all about what *is*.  so if you stop using words, your question will magically disappear."  but the TTC states explicitly that the Tao has an essence which can be tested.  the TTC itself, in fact, uses words.  i would say that these commenters are immature in their experience of Taoism, and happen not to add to the value of the subreddit.   You are using a lot of words to say that words don't matter much.  *I understand the the Tao is the way, things just are, words are convention, etc, etc, etc.*  The TTC and Chuang Tzu talk about all sort of things, directly and indirectly, but they never mention marriage or human family relations even in passing.  If your "explanations" held up, there would be *no* talk of any relationships of *any* type in these books, but instead, there is much talk of them; a ruler's relationship to the citizenry, for one.  Your adherence to supposed principle is keeping you from seeing what is right in front of you.  Not very Taoist.   No, he's agreeing with me.     Misleading title.   Not sure what you mean. Are you saying that talk of relationships assumes that things can go bad?   Immaculate is a good word to use, and I won't argue with his potential. But he needs at least a bit of fire in his eyes.    So it is either/or, feel or theorize?  Do you feel your relationship with your parents?  The Tao Te Ching and Book of Chuang Tzu talk about the relationships of other things, but human relationships are off limits?   In several plays in the Final Four, I saw him make some really half-hearted effort.  He appeared to not *really* be trying, looked unmotivated.  They were plays that just a little more effort would have resulted in a score, but didn't.  This isn't good to see in a game of that importance for someone with his potential.  They are things one *never* sees in a star, and never wants to see in a potential draft pick.  I understand it is a small sample size, but if I were a GM that would still bother me.  Also, Skip Bayless later tweeted about seeing the same thing which tells me I wasn't imagining it.   But it doesn't refer to relationships in that sense either.  Whereas regarding some things, it does say X is something to avoid, is not the way of the sage, etc.    Nor does it refer to physical/sexual relationships like man-woman, procreation, etc, or even that of animals.   I don't know, but when I smoke cigars, I get the urge to call people (to talk).   They say that was Watts' best book.  'Cannery Row' and 'Of Mice and Men' were also very Taoist.      Yeah, I would've probably taken him above Okafor.  I think Okafor was over-rated and Winslow probably under-rated.  Miami got a steal.      You should post the letter.   18 million government workers?  That's about 1 out of every 17.7 Americans.  What a waste.   Go after *real* racism because you really want to stop racism.  Not symbols just because you want to appear to be doing the right thing.  (By "you", I mean everyone.)   What these people are talking about is this:  The more hypocritical politically correct things are done in the name of fighting racism (but actually don't do a goddamn thing because they are only meant for politics and headlines and *appearing* to care), the more real racism is allowed to perpetuate.  Apple is OK with people killing each other, and worse, in video games, but they suddenly have a problem with the Confederate flag?  If that's the best we can do to fight "racism", then there is never *not* going to be racism.  Stop protecting the counter-productive hypocrites.   The parties contradict each other; if not in practice, at least in their rhetoric.  Your comment contradicts itself.  The media follow their own corrupt corporate interests.     He is one of those players who doesn't pass the ball.  Most stars will not want to play with a guy like that.  Phil should trade him to a dumber team and rebuild.   I hope Uber destroys these taxis, their unions, and their protectors in the government.            You absolutely should read Alan Watts' "The Watercourse Way".  John Steinbeck's novels are very Taoist. I recommend "Of Mice and Men".  And you should read the "Book of Chuang Tzu".  I suggest the Penguin version.    I would second the taking of Hoff with a grain of salt.    This reminds me of a boss I used to have. Secrecy was the handmaiden of his incompetence.    He's always posing.   Who is the blond?   Thanks for clarifying that.  Yes, I pretty much agree with your assessment of why he brings up the 5 colors/organs/sounds, etc.  Though to me it seems like he's not throwing the 5 elements/phases in with all the other groups of five.  He doesn't give them the same treatment.  The 5 elements/phases are left out of those discussions.  I was wondering if I was reading this correctly, and if there was a reason they weren't given the same treatment as the other groups of 5.   Thanks.     I did cite the passages, but perhaps you're asking if I can quote them.  Here is Burton Watson's translation:  *** FROM CHAPTER 14: The shaman Hsien beckoned and said, "Come - I will tell you. Heaven has the six directions and the **five constants**. When emperors and kings go along with these, there is good order; when they move contrary to these, there is disaster. With the instructions of the Nine Lo, order can be made to reign and virtue completed. The ruler will shine mirror-like over the earth below, and the world will bear him up. He may be called an August One on high."  FROM CHAPTER 12: The hundred-year-old tree is hacked up to make bowls for the sacrificial wine, blue and yellow, with patterns on them, and the chips are thrown into the ditch. Compare the sacrificial bowls with the chips in the ditch and you will find them far apart in beauty and ugliness; yet they are alike in having lost their inborn nature. Robber Chih, Tseng, and Shih are far apart in deeds and righteousness, and yet they are the same in having lost their inborn nature. There are **five conditions** under which the inborn nature is lost. One: when the **five colors** confuse the eye and cause the eyesight to be unclear. Two: when the **five notes** confuse the ear and cause the hearing to be unclear. Three: when the **five odors** stimulate the nose and produce weariness and congestion in the forehead. Four: when the **five flavors** dull the mouth, causing the sense of taste to be impaired and lifeless. Five: when likes and dislikes unsettle the mind and cause the inborn nature to become volatile and flighty. These five are all a danger to life. And yet the followers of Yang Tzu and Mo Tzu go striding around, thinking they have really gotten hold of something. This is not what I call getting hold of something.  If what you have gotten has gotten you into trouble, then can you really be said to have gotten something? If so, then the pigeons and doves in their cage have also gotten hold of something. With likes and dislikes, sounds and colors you cripple what is on the inside; with leather caps and snipe-feathered bonnets, batons stuck in belts and sashes trailing, you cramp what is on the outside. The inside hemmed in by pickets and pegs, the outside heaped with wraps and swathes, and still you stand in this tangle of wraps and swathes and declare that you have gotten hold of something? If so, then the condemned men with their chained wrists and manacled fingers, the tiger and the leopard in their pens and prisons have also gotten hold of something!  ***  I looked up Wu Hsing [here](http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/taoism/yinyang.html) and [here](http://www.iep.utm.edu/wuxing/), and it is clear that the 5 colors, sounds, organs, etc., derive from the 5 elemental phases (constants).  I understand Chuang Tzu's method of exaggeration and humor, but that doesn't mean that the book can be reduced to a one-liner which shall not be discussed, or that everything that isn't clear can passed over as a joke.  The TTC states that the Tao has an essence that can be tested.  Asking a question for clarification is hardly "overthinking".     Just wait til Kobe hears about this.   Excellent.  Thanks.   Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's?   Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's?   Do you know how Kaufmann's would compare to Safranski's?   In Chapter 14 of Chuang Tzu, in the first real paragraph, it mentions the 5 cardinal elements (fire, wood, earth, metal, water).  These are also known as Wu Hsing.  Elsewhere in the Chuang Tzu, the 5 colors and the 5 smells, etc., are mentioned, as in the last paragraph of Chapter 12.  It seems to mention the 5 colors, in particular, as something to avoid.  That is, the names and limits of 5 colors trap our minds into assuming there *are* only 5 colors.  But does Taoism similarly suggest avoiding the 5 elements, for the same reasons?  Or is there a difference in how the Tao approaches the 5 elements vs. the 5 colors?  Am I wrong to assume there is any similarity in the treatment by Taoism of the 5 colors and the 5 elements?  Any clarification or explanation you can provide would be most helpful.  Thanks.   yeah, i was also wondering about safranski.     I just got the Walter Kaufmann bio yesterday. Will read it after Ray Monk's bio on Wittgenstein. Both Nietzsche and Wittgenstein were pure INTJs.    we lead mostly by competence, not by authority or vision or force. also, treat others with respect and like they should respect you, and dont antagonize.    I never said anybody said that.    It almost sounds like you're serious.    Go to work?  I was hoping you wouldn't say that.      Yeah, aren't wealthy parents terrible?   They bribed the reporters not to mention it.   That's what I was thinking. Thanks!   Leaning toward getting the Walter Kaufmann one, but what do you think?  Thanks.   You can still vote and join the military at 18 though.    ok. fair enough.    So the consensus percentage was off by 2%.  Is the temperature prediction more accurate than that?   but he says it when hes sober too.    If they simply enforced laws against fraud and breach of contract and theft, and didn't bail these guys out....We should start there.  More laws are meaningless, when we don't enforce those we have.   I'm with you on some of that.  But we don't even really have a democracy today.  Maybe it's the best type of government there is, but we don't even really have a true democracy these days.  Besides, we're supposed to be a republic.  I just tend to be against those in power, no matter who they are, because they're always corrupt, etc.  And they tend to hide behind a false democracy.  For instance, almost no one is for the TPP, but they're ramming it down our throats anyway.     I appreciate your work and that you're not taking a politician's word for it.  But my spreadsheet could (would) have errors as well.    This is what Hayek called "the pretense of knowledge".   That's not an argument so much as gangster racket.  Also, it could be just as well argued the other way:  The money the "unsuccessful" *don't* make should be paid to them by society because the society contributed to their lack of success.  Who says what is successful?  What about the success we never see?  In short, compared to what?  Check out Fredric Bastiat's "The Seen and the Unseen".  There is a free pdf online somewhere.   I'm all for challenging force of whatever type, whether it is corporations, governments, anything.  Democracy is just herd mentality though, and rule by majority.  Nothing inherently good or just about that, just that when it comes to the (unually inevitable) conflict, they already have a majority in support of it.  I say, if the majority wants something, they should do it themselves as individuals, because they believe it should be done - instead of waiting for it to come up on the ballot and vote for it.  But back to my other comment:  Free markets, per se, don't lead to abuses and corruption, like we've seen on Wall St. recently.  The banksters make the laws and are enabled by DC to do these things.  DC and Wall St, the government and the banksters/corporations, work hand in hand to screw us all.  Enforce the law, enforce contracts, punish crime and criminals, for a start.    So....other than this there are no glaring errors in your work?  We can trust that it is 100% correct, right?   Right.  But one side wants to use force to take money.  The other wants to let people keep what is theirs, and says coercion is wrong, illegal, a problem, counter-productive, etc.  The former says they don't care who disagrees with them, it is imperative to take money from people.  The latter says lets agree to disagree, disagreement is to be expected (and probably valued), just don't hurt me or take my stuff.  EDIT:  I'm not suggesting you're saying otherwise, just adding to what you wrote.   Are these the same forecasters who were wrong about the costs of Obamacare in the first place?   Bill O'Reilly should be the next to go - for his documented and proven lies in the JFK book.  Edit: Look [here](http://jfkfacts.org/?s=bill+o%27reilly) before you downvote and run.   Oh fuck you.  No one is talking about a "presumption of innocence".  I'm talking about simply being able to fire someone, cops in this case.  Anyone in most non-government jobs can be fired, sometimes for inconsequential things.  People have recourse in courts if they want to pursue it.  People get fired all the time without their "lives being damaged".  Cops do things all the time that warrant firing, but they don't get fired because they have these protections.  Respond with substance or shut the fuck up and go away.     Because the cops know they get paid time off for bad behavior. This, if not incentivizing bad behavior, doesn't discourage it.    You keep bringing it back to guilt or not guilt as determined by a court. Courts don't always get it right, especially when it comes to cops. No other line of work has these protections.  If you think they are so necessary, advocate that ALL professions implement them.    It doesnt protect the public.  So police shouldnt be fired for anything unless/until found guilty in a court of law? What a load of horseshit.    You're not reading very carefully.  What a waste of time.  Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you're not sure if the murder was justified.    Why should police be protected any more than any other line of work?  If your boss thinks you did something stupid at work, he can fire you, without giving you paid leave until further investigation is complete.  You can pursue it in court if you want.  Cops can pursue it in court if they think they were wrongfully terminated too.  Plus, there is a difference between not following police procedure, police abuse, killing someone, all kinds of gradients.  They could be fired for not following procedure and the court could still find them innocent.  You are saying that cops should be paid unless and until the court finds them guilty.  Why the fuck is that?             Paid leave could be said to be corruption itself.  Plus, there is corruption and cover-up all over the place in these police departments anyway.  Further, it's not obvious how it would deter corruption.    [Look at this](http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/search/?q=police) if you think police don't get paid that much.  What if they did something heinous, but the court found them not guilty?  OJ Simpson style?  Still give them paid leave and let them keep their jobs?  Watch the Kelly Thomas [murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yaeD-E_MY) and tell us you aren't sure whether the cops should be fired.   Of course not.  What's stupid is thinking I'm saying any such thing.    But should a police department *not* fire an officer for proven abuses?  The extreme, but all too common, example is when police have video evidence of officers killing a guy for no reason.  These guys should be fired, period.  Whatever the court determines is another matter.     You just need to look for yourself to see the original context. Should I have quoted it whole? If I had it wouldnt have made the least bit of difference. Try again.    "Comes to light" usually means when then public finds out about it, even though fellow officers already knew.    And the problem is that these officers are put on *PAID* administrative leave until the procedures run their course.  They should be able to be fired on the spot, and certainly not be *rewarded* with paid time off.  Police unions are the big cause of much of the police abuse problems today.  They defend and protect and enable it.  Cops should have to pay their own legal fees like anybody else.  The unions don't want any accountability.     I was just going to say:  Loyalty to a fellow frat boy trumps all for these goons.   Except we dont have control issues.    So making billions and billions is bad?  	169
 Classic Joker.   It's tough finding six women.   Forza Horizon 2. It's a lot longer than I thought it was. I've played for hours and hours, and I'm only at 27%.   haha I actually thought of you literally masturbating over her before I read the punchline...   This is /r/jokes   I don't understand why short women are insecure about their height. I prefer short women.   yep   I used to only listen to particular songs by an artist that I heard before, but now if I hear I song I like by an artist, I listen to their albums in full to fully appreciate the artist.   I have not seen every movie ever created, so I can't really say, but I think the Joker's introduction in The Dark Knight is masterful.    She is only 5 feet tall. Shouldn't she be called Ariana Petite?    Educational video games? Never heard of those.   [rolls eyes]   Is this a good Pug Film? Is it a respectable addition to the Cinematic Universe of Pugs (CUP)?   pretty much the movies I really like   haha I guess I have to wait until it gets legalized in Ohio   I 3 pugs!!!!!   Death Proof    yep. I am in complete agreement. upvote for you   The Place Beyond the Pines, Blue Valentine, Pulp Fiction, Alien, Aliens, Miyazaki movies, Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Drive, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Pan's Labyrinth, The Terminator, Terminator 2, Mud, Se7en, Zodiac, American Beauty, Taxi Driver, American Psycho, Requiem for a Dream    Do they have to be super recent? You should watch Miyazaki's films if you haven't already. They aren't necessarily made specifically for kids because adults can enjoy them just as much.   The Place Beyond the Pines, Blue Valentine, Pulp Fiction, Alien, Aliens, Miyazaki movies, Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Drive, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Pan's Labyrinth, The Terminator, Terminator 2, Mud, Se7en, Zodiac, American Beauty, Taxi Driver, American Psycho, Requiem for a Dream   hahaha   theFLICKpick   I don't condone animal cruelty, but personally I just judge a movie by the quality of the film itself. I won't avoid a good film just because I don't think the creators were behaving morally when creating the film.   Ok, cool. I actually rented it yesterday, so I guess I'll watch it now.   ok fair enough   ok cool. does the pug get a lot of screen time? if it does, I'm definitely buying it on blu-ray   what if they knew nothing about that?   you mean Drive?   I guess I agree with you to some extent. He doesn't play the exact same kind of character in every film, but they do feel similar in nature.   wat   I'm just going to quote what I said in a previous comment:   I was going to say Jake, but then I remembered Ryan's performances in The Place Beyond the Pines and Blue Valentine, and now I can't make up my mind.     lmfao @ second paragragh   Do you think I would like it? I'm an adult male who is a huge lover of pugs.   But can an adult still enjoy it? As I said, I'm a huge lover of pugs, so a movie with the protagonist as a pug really grabs my attention.    Haven't seen Prisoners. Do you just like Jake's performance, or is it all in all a good film?   Is the only film Gosling starred in that you saw Only God Forgives?   Wat   I really, really love pugs, but I don't think I want to watch a movie made specifically for kids and not adults.   Jesus Christ, please don't tell me this is going to turn into a Nic Cage circlejerk thread where everyone comments "Nicolas Cage."   Yes, that's why I think he's such a good actor. I was going to say Jake, but then I remembered Ryan's performances in The Place Beyond the Pines and Blue Valentine, and now I can't make up my mind.   I thought it was a very well done film and definitely creepy, but I wouldn't exactly say is was "horrifying."   I'm being serious.   I honestly can't decide which is better.   when he still had hair   Well you have to love something to hate something.   Christian Bale as Steve Jobs with Fincher directing? That would have been awesome   oh, thanks for sharing that. I didn't catch that   Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Zodiac, End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy   Yeah. I mean, I personally think Mr. G is a great actor, but I understand that not everyone is a fan of his work. Idk why you would get downvoted just for expressing the fact that you are not interested in his acting.   Yeah, I have the same question you have with #2. I'm pretty sure the implication is that she got gangbanged, but there's no way of knowing for sure.   You know that I'm joking, right? Sorry, I can't tell if you think I'm serious or if you're playing along with my joke.   Isn't Saw just sadist porn?   Blasphemy! How dare you express indifference towards Jakey G!   ok cool   are you male or a really tall female?   The Dark Knight Rises. I was so hyped for this film after watching The Dark Knight that I cried for like an hour straight after watching the midnight showing of TDKR because it was nothing like I thought it would be.   Is the movie as intense as the trailer makes it out to be? How emotionally gripping is it? Judging from the trailer, it looks like Jake Gyllenhaal is giving a great performance as always. How does this performance compare to his other performances in film?    Is the movie as intense as the trailer makes it out to be? How emotionally gripping is it? Judging from the trailer, it looks like Jake Gyllenhaal is giving a great performance as always. How does this performance compare to his other performances in film?    This is my favorite movie, and it would mean a lot to me if someone made this theme.       No, it's called being pedantic.   Umm... like *every* movie? Pretty much every movie has a male and female character that are not romantically involved. For example, in The Place Beyond the Pines, Romina is not romantically involved with Jason. Why? They are mother and son. In Birdman, Michael Keaton's character is not romantically involved with Emma Stone's character. Why? They are father and daughter. In Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar is not romantically involved with any human female character. Why? That's bestiality. In The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne is not involved with a random female extra. Why? They never even met.   damn right #feminism #insectsarepeopletoo #checkyourprivilege    yeah, Alex should definitely do more comedy skits like this         https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i2QZM_WLss  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEGke8kzeZM   Huh. I thought that was the best part. Haven't you seen the Trix cereal ads where the kids go, "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!"? That's what he was referring to.   How did you train him to do that?   She's eating more than you think.   That's damn good. I went from like 220 lbs. to 106 lbs. in around 6 months as a 5'11" male.   would [this picture](http://www.picschamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Natalie-Portman-pic.jpg) be compatible?   Well, I mean if you're fat technically you are not starving yourself even if you eat nothing because you are being fed by your fat reserves.   I don't know how to get it...   Wait, can I set any picture from the Internet that I put on a flash drive as the background for my Xbox? If so, I might put a picture of Natalie Portman on there.   I wasn't copycatting. I noticed his post and decided to post the outcome of a race that was even closer. I imagine I would have posted it even if I did not see that post. Also, I honestly do not care about karma. If I have an opinion that I know will get downvoted to the extreme, I still post the comment. The expectation of karma does not impact what I post.   Well to be honest I don't really have any energy to work out right now.    What? Some other guy posted the same kind of post and it never got removed, and this race is even closer.   I also find this relatively unbelievable  What would be my motivation to lie? I am an anonymous user on reddit. And I don't think this is exactly an achievement.    Well, for me personally, no. I can play it all day.   Yeah I like weightlifting, but I just do it because I enjoy it, not to get bigger or stronger. Yes, by fasting I mean not eating at all.   Sometimes I fast for up to weeks at a time. Not willfully (I'm pretty underweight, so there is no logical reason for me to fast.), but because I simply do not feel like eating. Just the thought of eating nauseates me during this time. Once I feel like eating again, I do a huge binge, sometimes lasting multiple days. Then I start fasting again (again, not willfully, but because I just don't want to eat).   Could you please tell us what you've already played so that we know what games we should recommend? The obvious answer is The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as it is over 200 hours long (as a user has stated before me). Arkham Knight isn't nearly as long, but still a respectable length. Halo: MCC is 4 games in one (5 if you buy [or receive for free if you played MCC around the month span after its release] ODST) with an addictive multiplayer. If you like racing games, Forza Horizon 2 is huge: I've played for God knows how many hours, and am only at 27% game completion.            Alien, Aliens   The Place Beyond the Pines   The Place Beyond the Pines   The Dark Knight Rises   Yes, that is exactly what I am trying to say. TDK is similar in tone to Batman Begins.   Is that a serious question? All the brooding darkness that made Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so special is completely gone in The Dark Knight Rises.   Also, do you think Maggie Gyllenhaal would make a good Harley Quinn?    Why do you think that TDK and Begins have a more consistent tone than TDK and Rises?  What? No, I said that The Dark Knight Rises is a huge departure in tone from both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.    I feel that Christopher Nolan didn't really have his heart in the project. It felt more like he was trying to fulfill a contract and get it over with rather than make a film he was passionate about. I theorize that Heath's death depressed him and put him off track. The Dark Knight Rises is a huge departure in tone from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.    were the best for me     No, he means Mark Wahlberg.     When I first saw it, I was overwhelmed with hype, so it was hard for me to really judge the film.     The Dark Knight Rises. When I first saw it, I was overwhelmed with hype, so it was hard for me to really judge the film.   What about Alien?   The 1979 (btw that's a great Smashing Pumpkins song, sorry Billy Corgan made me do that plug) theatrical version or the 2003 director's cut? Also for Aliens, should I watch the 1986 theatrical version or the 1991 special edition?   seriously? *another* Spiderman reboot? wtf   The Place Beyond the Pines   I'm a virgin, so HA! Nothing's following me!   is that a good thing or a bad thing?   It Follows because I'm scared   do you really think it's a good one because I took like five minutes writing that, and I don't want to feel like I wasted my time   The David Fincher version   Yeah I just said "fuck it" and decided to watch it with her. I'm a half-hour in, and she said, "So is this just a movie about 'tag'?   what's that?   uhhh... alright, fair enough   [I walk away, then once you can't see me I run to the bathroom and cry my eyes out. You come to the bathroom door and knock, asking if everything is okay. The I scream, "NO! EVERYTHING IS NOT OKAY! IT IS NEVER OKAY! AND YOU WONDER WHY I CUT MYSELF!" You sigh, apologizing, then say, "Father Magoo, this can't keep going on like this. I don't know why you are so hell-bent on destroying your life. You need to turn this shit around, Father Magoo. You know... umm... Father... I never told you this, but I love you... I really do." I open the door slowly, tears falling from my eyes. "Really, BubblegumIPA? Really? Do you mean it?" I sniffle a little bit. Okay, a lot. I sniffle for like five minutes straight. "Yes, Father, I love you. I didn't know how to express it to you, so I have heavily insulted you this whole time as I grasped for a way to show my affection. I didn't quite understand how you were making me feel until now. I love how you smile when the blue moon reaches its peak. I love how you grasp flowerpots before kissing the flowers. I love the way you do your little dance after every heartfelt sermon. Father Magoo, I love everything about you. We need to be together. I know how much you care about the no sex 'til marriage thing, and I understand that. So why wait? Let's get married today. Right now." I graze my right index finger across my lip, contemplating the impact of this revelation. "I... I love you too, BubblegumIPA. Let's get married, Bub!" You grace me with a half-smile, subtlety rewarding me for using the pet name that I so often use for you and you alone. "I now pronounce us..." I inhale deeply. "...husband and wife!" I smile jovially. "I may now kiss the bride!"

I guess I could watch it some other time. maybe you can suggest some horror movies that my sister can watch with me. quick, because she won't stop pestering me about it.   Yeah, but if someone asks what my favorite movie is, and I say The Place Beyond the Pines, they say, "What's that?" or something similar   I just bought these films on blu-ray, and am wondering how they compare to each other:  End of Watch  It Follows  Pan's Labyrinth  Enemy  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  Prisoners   The Place Beyond the Pines. My favorite movie, but hardly anyone knows about this masterpiece.   She really wants to watch a movie with me before I leave for college, and she says that it has to be this movie because she likes the cover. She is 10 years old. Also, her name is Jessica, and you know what they say: Jessicas are always tough girls.

The person who "made" this did nothing other than generate a world in Minecraft and throw it on a USB.   After that he sold the idea of the particular world created by the seed could only be played by one person as it's on a USB stick. If you want to play that particular world yourself... you need that USB stick. A good idea in itself but hardly worthy of a game design award.  Again, he did nothing, he did not create a game, he did not code anything, he merely generated a world in Minecraft using "Chain World" as the seed.  I like the idea though, if passed around each new player would shape that particular world. But in the end thats the same as playing online and limiting the server to one player at a time.   Is it an Asylum production? Sounds like an Asylum production...   Even if you go by the Movie Man of Steel version of Superman he can still move faster than any human could ever react. He can still fire lasers from his freaken eyes powerful enough to cut through buildings etc as well as damaging Kryptonian Amour.  Hell, in the trailer for BvS he's shown ripping the Batmobile apart with little effort. He could do the very same to Bats new armour if he wanted to without much effort.  If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead before Bats even reached for the Kryptonite.

I'm almost tempted to download the ROM just to prove I can beat it as an adult...    No. You really don't.   Some say he's still in the 5th grade this very day...   No he won because Sups held back, like majorly, out of respect he didnt want to hurt or kill him. Where as Bats went all out giving everything he had.  Superman can move faster than Bats can even perceive let alone react against, he can rip through solid metal like butter for fucks sake.  Without plot armour Bats is a joke, just a rich fuck in a suit that would get destroyed by one hit from any metahuman.  If Sups wanted Batman dead he would be dead. No questions.    Best role he's ever done was Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder.  Seeing him in that movie made me wish he'd take more risks... He's a good actor when he's not phoning it in.   I think EB near me has a bargin bin with like 3 Vita games in it... That counts as a display right?   Looks like a beefy Catwoman...

Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

Nope, near the end he states very clearly what his intentions were from the start:  Hans: As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance.

Hans: You were so desperate for love, you were willing to marry me, just like that. I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.  He played nice, did what was required, only because he was not sure if his position was secured yet.

 I'm hoping he is just taking care of some mob business. I'm hoping I never see him again.   Todd was an unserious man with a very serious problem; he was in love with painkillers and happened to wash them down with hard, hard liquor. Of course physically his liver was obliterated but the true damage was done on a metaphysical scale. Todd was deranged and even derailed since his problem started. The man who was once destined for greatness had lost all of his credibility; well actually he had lost all of his ability.    The loss in Todds ability and the birth of Todds problem truly started during his senior year of high school. Todd was the teams varsity football captain and a highly coveted national recruit. Yet the quarterback entered the season uncommitted to any college program; he claimed he liked to tease the coaches. Not only was he uncommitted to a collegiate team but Todd was also uncommitted to almost everyone and everything else around him. The boy had no regard for high school, teachers, his family and even his friends. Todd held a myopic vision of himself that left space for nobody. This hurt Sam Feeble more than anyone else; Sam was Todds old close friend.   It was fitting that Sams last name was Feeble because in essence thats what everyone saw him as a weak, weak man, although this was not the case. Sam was a wise boy who had a handle on life and understood the importance of all important things. He had strong morals and displayed respect at all times. Sam was a good kid, yet Sam had a downfall, well a down fall in height. Sam was a sheer five-foot-one.    Todd, who believed he could only be surrounded by the best, quickly distanced himself from Sam. He honestly thought Sam was not tall enough to be his friend anymore. This would hurt most adolescent boys, but Sam was happy to see Todd succeed. Thats why when Todd tore his ACL during his senior year of football Sam was devastated. Sam had a heart big enough for the two of them.    Anyways, thats how the problem started. Todd was given prescription painkillers and he soon became addicted. He lost his scholarships; he lost everything, even Sam. Sam wanted to stick around to help Todd but college took him elsewhere. It seemed as if the two would never be seen with each other again, until Todd saw the future.   Twenty years later, Todd knocked on Sams door. Todds stomach was racing like he was on a rollercoaster. He had heard Sam had been living with his mother ever since he finished college. He had hoped the rumors were true since he came from miles away but was very uneasy. Luckily, Sam opened the door and at a loss of words smiled.   Todd didnt wait for him to speak or even wait for him to stop smiling he shot Sam through the head. And as crazy as it may sound, Todd was doing him a favor. A week earlier, Todd had received painkillers from a new dealer. But he quickly discovered he had taken much more than a painkiller. Todd blacked out and saw his entire life flash before his eyes. Yet, this was not the end of his visions into the future. Todd then saw what happened after his life was over, first blackness and then well he was a mouse, a small mouse that scavenged for food and had no company. Todd theorized that his terrible human life had led to a reincarnation of punishment. He then pondered what would happen if he had lived a moral life. This immediately led to his interest in contacting Sam again.   As the bullet pushed through Sams brains, there was only darkness. Blackness, nothingness Todd would never know that his vision was just a bad trip, or was it. Minutes later Sam opened his eyes and looked around he saw lions. He saw hundreds of lions bowing beneath him as he gazed over  a large white rock. Sam Feebles was now the king of the jungle.    Imagine a young boy, growing up without his father, in one of those edgy coming of age films... that was me at seventeen. I was just like any other seventeen year old boy at the time, I played sports, had friends, all that, except I didn't know my father. This was an issue that never really bothered me until the age of seventeen, an age where youthful boys want answers. People had always asked me what it was like not having a father and to me this was an arrogant question. Not because it was a touchy subject but because my mother easily played the role of a father. She supported me in any stereotypical masculine discipline. Whether it was throwing a football or teaching me to stand up for myself... my mother did it all.    But at age seventeen the mystery was begging for an answer, (I like to blame my raging hormones). I was at a point in my life  where I wanted to know who I was, what my identity was, what my worth was, and most importantly, where I was from. I felt that the only way I would truly find myself was through finding my father. I knew he was alive, my mother always told me, "your father is out there, just not with us."   This left me with a high level of inquiry. Yet my questions were always met with the same sharp response,   "Stop asking questions! He left for a reason!"   Of course I wanted to ask what the reason was but I didn't dare. The tone in my mother's voice was enough to keep me quiet. It was odd how she could make her voice bellow so deeply at times. In the end, I just assumed she was still hurt by his abrupt disappearance. I know I was, I had no memory of him at all, he left when I was a mere two years old.    Most of my friends thought that it was outlandish for me to want to meet a man who deserted me, but I couldn't help it. Ever since I hit seventeen I was intrigued with who he was. It was painful for me but finally during my eighteenth birthday I gave up the search. I thought if my father ever wants to see me, well then he will. Months later, I wrote my college application essay on growing up without a father and finally found some closure.... or so I thought.   Years later on a Friday night during my junior year of college I got the call. I picked up the phone and on the other end was someone claiming to be my mother's friend. At first, I thought it was a prank call but then the caller said my mother's name. This moment shocked me, my mother did not have any friends I knew of. The caller who sounded like a man told me that he and my mother were friends before I was born. He then went on to say my mother passed in her sleep.I instantly teared up and for the first time that year I did not go partying on a Friday night.   The funeral was quiet and quick. Like I said my mother didn't have many friends. Additionally, she was the only child of my already deceased grandparents, so no one was around. After the funeral, I went back to my house to take any belongings before the house was put on the market.    When I got to the house I sat in the kitchen and made myself a sandwich. As I was eating I heard a knock on the door that nearly made me fall off my seat. Could it be my Dad. It wasn't. I opened the door and in front of me was a tall man. The man claimed to be the man who called me, my mother's friend. He asked to come in and I didn't deny him, he was beyond intimidating. He wore a black, leather trench coat and had a black top hat on his head.   After talking for a while the man told me he had business to take care of. His speech was frightening to me, even though I knew he meant well. He left but as he walked out of the front door he told me to keep my mouth shut. I questioned him but like my mother he never gave me an answer, he got in his black sports car and sped away.    Once he was gone, I decided to go through my mother's things. I was in her closet when the floor seemed to easily wobble. I jumped a little and it felt as though the floor nearly collapsed. I lifted a panel in the floor and discovered a large opening under the floor. Shockingly, in the floor opening was boxes, I took them out and placed them on my mother's bed. The first box held a bunch of track and field trophies. I just assumed my mother had held onto my father's track and field awards, she always said he was a star.   The next box is where things started to get weird. The box contained guns and knives. I had no idea why they were in my mother's closet, then I opened the third box. The box was full of pictures and newspaper articles. I was blown away at the first picture I saw. It was of my father and the tall man who was supposed to be my mother's friend. It was especially startling due to the cigars in their mouths and large guns in their hands. A mystery was unfolding in front of my eyes. I looked at one of the newspaper articles and it was about a man who murdered his mistress. Afterwards, I read another article from the box that was published five years later. The article  claimed they still had not found the man who murdered his mistress. I then solved the mystery, my father was a  mob man who ran away once one of his murders was uncovered. This explained why my mom never spoke of him, she was ashamed. He not only had a mistress but he was a killer. This also explained for the tall man telling me to keep my mouth shut. It was solved... or was it.   I wondered how the tall man who was truly my father's friend knew of my mother's passing. There was one box left and little did I know that this was the box to all the answers I ever wanted. I opened the box and in it was enough estrogen pills to last a lifetime. Next to the pills a blonde wig, the exact same shade as my mother's hair. Goosebumps. Pure goosebumps followed. I understood right away.   My father never ran away... he was right in front of me the whole time. It all made sense. My father had killed my mother and then to escape legal prosecution transformed his sex. I was outraged, I lived with a villain for eighteen years of my life. I was sick, I threw up, I cried. I'm now just releasing the story because it has haunted me for years. I'm once again hoping to find closure. I would call the police but I've been warned, that's why I apologize for being vague. All you need to know is that my father was a mad man. My father was a mobster. My father was a murderer. My father was my mother.   	3
  Did the Pew study rank AGW among other concerns?  Yes, didn't you read it? [Here is a nice interactive summary graph.](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2015/jul/17/interactive-whats-the-world-scared-of)  Did you say "substantial cuts" or did you say, "all 97 national scientific academies have formally endorsed IPCC Assessment Report 5, which plainly says that we have 27 years to quit fossil fuels at present trend, and that means all fossil fuels."?  I quoted the text, which says that *in order to have a 66% probability of meeting the 2C threshold* the CO2eq limit is a trillion tons. And, yes, I realize that various groups are in hot debate over whether we have 485gt or 390t or 355gt left to burn, but the IPCC is on the conservative end of that spectrum.   I'm saying government bans of oil are very unlikely, and you are supporting that by saying they don't lead, they slowly respond.  I'm saying that political will is building, but don't look for it in the halls of Congress; it's in the electorate. Just remember that the electorate is not very well represented, because the Constitution apportions far more voting power to less populous states. The most climate-concerned are concentrated in larger cities and larger states, which are also where the fossil fuels are; each voter in coal-rich Wyoming has nearly twenty times the voice in the Senate as a voter in climate-concerned California. We are also unique among rich nations in the way we allow moneyed interests to dominate television political programming and political advertising, so advantage fossil fuels biz.  Yes, we are agreed that it will be replaced. I just think the road to replacement is long enough that we won't see governments banning them in a couple of decades.  I never said I expected this to happen in a couple of decades! A better estimate would be 30-60 years.    Both towns are effectively doing the same thing.    The study I cited was from the UN and was scientific. Please don't embarrass yourself by pretending you read the methodology.  I'm afraid it's my turn to be pedantic, because there is *nothing* scientific or weighted about this voluntary online survey. Read its disclaimer: "Use the MY World data as trends rather than as evidence, as they may not be statistically significant or representative." For example, did you notice that 80% of respondents are under age 30? Or did you see the gender skew, or the geographic ones? I'll go with the recent Pew study instead, thanks.  AR5 made no such statement. They use the RCP (relative concentration pathways) framework, and they make no statement about what combination of mitigation and/or adaptation should be used.  From the WGIII Summary: "Scenarios reaching atmospheric concentration levels of about 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep temperature change below 2 C relative to pre-industrial levels) include substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions by mid-century through large-scale changes in energy systems and potentially land use (high confidence). Scenarios reaching these concentrations by 2100 are characterized by lower global GHG emissions in 2050 than in 2010, 40 % to 70 % lower globally16, and emissions levels near zero GtCO2eq or below in 2100."  Being a conservative IPCC product blessed by the world's leading oil nations before publication, the report also omits known potential large feedback forcings such as methane hydrates. Crazy but true.  your desire to see those things become a reality doesn't mean governments are ready to do those things.  Governments almost never lead. They respond, and slowly. China excepted.   If we invest in all the alternatives you suggest, to the point that they become cheaper than fossil fuels, there is still use for them as feedstocks for fertilizer, petrochemicals, etc.  Of course. Let me whisper one important word in your ear: "plastics!" Honestly, it will be a great business to be in when it becomes the primary market for oil and gas sellers.  The public is tired of all the cries of "the sky is falling!" They are willing to do their part, but they just don't respond any more. This was already true six years ago when researchers started to report on Apocalypse Fatigue  There is some truth to this, but much also has to do with the public's mistaken sense that we lack solutions--an attitude that is carefully cultivated by the largest industry that has ever existed, whose products will lose value as alternatives become clear.  I've been following energy research for years now and have found nothing that does everything oil does.  No single thing does everything oil does, nor will. Instead, a combination of many energy sources and methods will replace oil. You seem informed enough to know what they will be.         We all know that Miami, New Orleans, Mumbai and Rotterdam are future scuba attractions, but this study suggests that nearly *every* port city may join them beneath the waves within a few decades unless we decarbonize in a hurry.   Keegan's *A History of Warfare* and *The Mask of Command* both qualify. Loved them both.   True, to the best of my knowledge, no national academies have actually called the threat existential (although plenty of their fellows have). They dont need to. When a normally restrained, stiffly phlegmatic national academy uses words like very serious or grave, they may as well say its time for us all to update our wills.  One thing is certain: all 97 national scientific academies have formally endorsed IPCC Assessment Report 5, which plainly says that we have 27 years to quit fossil fuels at present trend, and that means all fossil fuels. The alternative is to run unacceptable risks with millions of lives, with the global economy, and potentially with civilization itself. Although I doubt that we'll make the 27 year deadline, we certainly won't stretch it out to the 85 years that the G-7 leaders just agreed to.   Oil alternatives exist now and theyll be far cheaper in years to come. The total cost of decarbonization is credibly estimated at 0.1% of the global economic growth rate, maybe shaving the forecasted 3% growth rate to 2.9%, so there is literally no excuse for delay. We should be massively building out renewable and nuclear power, putting a high and rising price on carbon, investing in energy efficiency at every level, and crafting government policies to encourage urban living. Soon after, all fossil fuels will almost certainly be outlawed by global agreement, and they will be outlawed first in the nations most responsible for the past 150 years of carbon pollution. That would be us. If I had to guess, I would say these bans begin around 2050, assuming that the world makes some major cuts long before then.  The kicker is the strong likelihood that even more alarming evidence of risks will emerge in coming years. For example, something like [this just-released blue ribbon study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/20/the-worlds-most-famous-climate-scientist-just-outlined-an-alarming-scenario-for-our-planets-future/), which suggests that our grandchildren may be in for vastly higher costs than we knew. We should be prepared for more revelations like this, and even worse.  Is the public ready for this? Globally, yes (and please dont cite another non-scientific online poll to claim otherwise). Americans, Canadians, Aussies and Saudis are among the only true foot-draggers left, but even in these countries the political will to address the climate mess is rapidly growing--as it must.    Is this offer for all of Romania or just Transylvania?               "Hey, you, the troublemaker with the protest sign...you look a little too likely to become radicalized for our taste, so get in the truck".  Crikey.          This. Is. Huge.   Low-wage workers are routinely jerked around by disorganized, uncaring employers who demand that employees be available at virtually any time, leaving them no way to schedule other work, school or family needs. It's not uncommon for employees to be suddenly called in for work on short notice, and then, after dropping everything to suit up and get to the job, to be told they aren't needed after all.   This has to stop. Lousy, unreliable jobs like these comprise a larger and larger share of employment opportunities.          ...for one day.   The oil ban is decades away, but I have no doubt that it is inevitable. According to *every* national scientific academy, and the IPCC, and any climatologist one can find, our only choice is the existential one. The risk of igniting a runaway warming excursion is simply too great, and the potential costs of that too devastating. We are risking many millions of lives, and even, potentially, putting civilization itself on the ropes. Against that, quitting oil is a tiny price to pay. Other options do exist and will improve over this period.  On public opinion, your vision needs to extend beyond the United States (forgive my presumption, but you sound American). World opinion on climate is much different than American, as [this new study](http://www.efe.com/efe/english/technology/pew-research-center-says-climate-change-biggest-global-concern/50000267-2665247) shows.  For a preview of coming attractions in the oil biz, look at the stock performance of the largest U.S. coal company over the past five years: BTU share price plunged 98%--including a 12% drop just *today*. If you're in oil, not to put too fine a point on it, GTFO.   Good article, and thanks for posting, but on GMOs I'll have to go with the vast majority of scientists who say there is no evidence of their widespread harm as foods.   Baby steps. Breaking up the largest banks would do far more good, faster, than any indirect effort to "encourage smaller banks" through reserve rules.   Plague and aging tend to be inversely related.   How old are you, and do you need the money soon? If you're young, putting away life savings, an aggressive fund or two may be the way to go. You have time to ride the rises and falls.  By their blended nature, lifecycle funds are all pretty conservative.            Well, no; if you drive SUVs and live in a sprawling, inefficient detached home miles from work and stores, you cannot claim to be "green" under any circumstances. Even EVs won't solve the larger problem, which is the overall inefficiency of far-flung living. To beat this, we have to live closer together, especially in places like the US, Canada and Australia.  If we had a hundred years to make the switch to clean energy, this wouldn't be hard to pull off, but we don't have anything near that long. This requires major changes that only government can handle, and it means destroying the largest, most powerful industry that has ever existed. All starting yesterday.   Carbon regulations are "subjective"? I don't think so; they are simple math. All national scientific academies agree that we must cap cumulative emissions at one trillion tons to stay within the 2C warming threshold that provides a good chance of livability, which means phasing out fossil fuels entirely within 25-60 years, depending on when we begin and how fast we transition. Period.   However, I take your wider point, that Americans are more likely to support expanding freedoms than restricting them, even if the restrictions are tiny. Still, as we awaken to the stakes here, I'm sure we'll do the right thing, and the author is right to say that change will come in a wave.  I love Washington's attempt to pass a carbon price, offsetting it with sales tax cuts. That's smart and balanced, and, along with efforts in California, could easily spread nationwide, although probably offsetting the tax by returning revenues to citizens through dividends.   Why would an A.I. care about self preservation?    McKibben's science and current economic assessment are on the money. So is the idea that warming will cause broad and diffuse obstacles to the global economy, which may be headed for a major fall. He might also have put more attention to the effects of rising warfare in a world like that.   Still, it's probably unlikely that this crisis would lead to McKibben's hippie dream of a peaceful, decentralized global economy of home gardeners and bloggers. Capitalism at scale will probably survive and revive...or the world may indeed decentralize--into poverty, death and constant war. For more on the economic consequences, from actual economists, read William Nordhaus for optimistic scenarios or Nicholas Stern for pessimistic ones (and read Martin Weitzman no matter what).   I think Fareed's point is that concern over job prospects has driven the flight to STEM, but at the expense of national competitiveness. To a certain degree he's right, although the privileged kids who are likely to start blockbuster tech companies are probably getting plenty of high-quality humanities education no matter what. Think of Zuckerberg at Harvard or Jobs studying calligraphy at Reed.     Yeah, it wasn't hard to see how unpopular this idea would be with redditors.    No doubt you're right about the easy availability of the world's cheapest oil, but I believe the Saudis and Emirates are also preparing for the banning of oil as fuel, which will occur over coming decades. That is why they are selling it even more cheaply, and why they are building out alternatives like solar. As the world awakens to the depth of the climate crisis and gets serious about switching energy, oil will crash just as coal already has, and for similar reasons. No one knows this better than the Persian Gulf states.   Damn. Was hoping not to see this conclusion...  Can meat be sustainable? The answer, based on the evidence I was able to assemble, seems to be: Yes, but only in moderation. And because we are currently eating so much meat, those who give it up altogether are probably making the most environmentally friendly choice of all.   Dutch elm?    The global oil biz takes care of its own.   I think of it more like discovering that smoking has weakened your heart, and you'll die unless you quit. A weak heart doesn't mean the end of life, however; it just means that you'll have to 1) live with medication, 2) deal with bouts of weakness, 3) never smoke again.   Desal is incredibly energy intensive, and the Saudis are trying to liquidate their oil reserves before climate regulations reduce their value.   The last thing any company wants to do is to invest in products that cannibalize the core line of business, especially if that means stepping into gigantic fields that are already full of big competitors. Simply put, the oilcos have chosen not to compete with General Electric, Siemens, Emerson, Sunpower and the like. Rather than compete in the electrical space, they've decided to stick to their knitting with chemical energy, mostly by betting that natgas will solve their problems for the next fifty years. Companies like Shell are also doing some work in biofuels.    I think this is both stupid and immoral, given that the scientific consensus says we must quit carbon fuels in 27 years at present trend, and that biofuels have very limited potential, but no one ever accused oil execs of being the sharpest knives in the drawer.   Hello once more, global warming. We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when...               Really, Brad? Improving chicken farming is your cause?    Americans worry about anything foreign. Our greatest weakness, as history repeatedly shows, is our inability to worry about Americans.   The Keeling curve's blips are annual. Because most of the Earth's land and vegetation is in the Northern Hemisphere, global CO2 falls when it's summer here. The plants gobble it up.   We can stop making it worse, can't we? There's a huge difference between a 2C warmer world in which civilization survives, and a 4-6C warmer world where all bets are off.   http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html   I don't know about yours, but my usually-awesome local ski season was absent without leave last winter.   It isn't local, but Google "before and after" photos of mountain glaciers. Most have dramatically shrunk in the past century.   The US East was the planet's largest major cold anomaly last winter; almost everywhere else was unseasonably mild. The U.S. West Coast was weirdly warm and dry, and now it's burning.   Wow, an actual Norwegian in the house. My apologies if it sounded as if I called all your countrymen drunks and oil roughnecks. I'm sure they aren't all oil roughnecks.    Thanks, and that's funny: I thought I was the only English speaker on the planet bothered at the way "chauvinism" has been monopolized by feminists. I feel so much less alone now!               Just as we have generations of data showing that efforts to break the spirt of enemy populations by bombing their cities almost always fails, and often unites the very people one is trying to defeat.   If anyone threatened my family with random attacks from the sky, I'd join the fight against them, too.   It's fantasy to think that we'll someday hold Republicans accountable for their climate science denial. They're already old, their worst deniers are older still, and they know that the public has a short memory anyway.    1998 actually, but you're definitely right about the cherry picking.   The instrument record extends to about 1880. However, reliable proxy data goes back millions of years.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_temperature_record   Doesn't it actually work in both senses: extreme nationalism and prejudice against groups of any kind other than one's own?   1) The US caused the problem [far more](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Cumulative_energy-related_carbon_dioxide_emissions_between_1850-2005_for_different_countries.png) than any other nation did.   2) On a per capita basis, Americans each emit more than [three times as much carbon pollution as Chinese](http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png), and more than twice as much as Europeans. Together with Aussies, Canadians and Persian Gulf nationals, Americans are still the world's worst polluters.  3) China is now making huge strides to control its horrible pollution problem, leading the world in installation of carbon-free energy, taxing carbon, beginning to take a positive role in global climate negotiations. They have far to go, but they've made quite a start in the past five years.  4) US "progress" is due to the rise of gas, which is [leaking so much unaccounted methane](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/leaky-methane-makes-natural-gas-bad-for-global-warming/) into the atmosphere that the claim to vast emissions cuts is a huge lie.    Europeans each emit less than half as much carbon pollution as Americans do.  http://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/list-countries-co2-per-capita.png   Same thing with the long, successful fight to ban ozone-destroying CFCs. There, too, industry predicted economic disaster if we enacted regulations, yet somehow we survived without a scratch--and recent studies say the consequences of damage to atmospheric ozone would have been even worse than we knew.   Half of Norway works for the oil industry, and the other half sells them drinks.    Poor food options and bad habits. The poor eat more starch and sugar, drink more soda pop, get less cardio exercise. Good groceries are harder to find in poor neighborhoods, outdoor exercise in the evening may be less safe there, the poor more often lack personal discipline, etc..    I saw a Senator with a snowball once. You must be right.                                 The GOP is caught in one helluva bind. Nothing motivates their base as much as bigotry and chauvinism do, yet the party is doomed until it can attract more Hispanics, blacks and women.   It's not as if they didn't see this dead-end coming.   Military standards now often prevent many from enlisting because a larger share of the poorer half don't meet educational requirements, or have weight problems or drug issues, or a criminal record. The result is that present military demographics are more upscale than they once were.   My observations may be anecdotal, but I sure know poorish, small-town kids who'd *like* to join the Air Force or Navy, but who can't for some combination of the reasons above.   [This may help as well.](http://www.eesi.org/files/climate.pdf)   The article at issue breaks "electricity" and "commercial   residential" into two categories, when really they are one because 70% of electricity is used in buildings, especially for air conditioning, water heating and appliances.         Amazing how fast this rumor caught fire among US far-righties, whom I heard guffawing over it the very day the research came out. Thanks once more for the firehose of bullshit, Fox News.   Based on the sea of gray hair I see at most climate rallies, I'd say we already have this segment aboard.   Well, around 75 percent of the fossil fuels industry is nationalized, so we'd have to begin by buying out Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, China, Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria. And, in truth, that may be what some of those countries are hoping for.   In the US, all agriculture accounts for only [9% of greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/sources/agriculture.html), while globally the figure is around 12%. Some isolated studies claim much higher figures, up to about 33%, but those appear to be biased. Both in the US and worldwide, the largest emissions source is the heating and cooling of buildings; second-largest is transportation.   Unless the revenues return to citizens, the tax won't survive and escalate for long. Give the revenues to the poor and the rich will kill it; give the revenues to the rich and the poor will kill it; but give the revenue back to all, and most will continue to support it.   The one we have is Nike HQ. Seems pretty healthy, but appearances deceive.   Unsaid: obesity is especially high among low-income and rural folk who are most likely to enlist, so it's a double whammy. Then add the *other* disqualifiers mentioned...  lack of adequate education, a criminal history or drug use. All those put together mean that 71 percent of Kansans are ineligible for military service  In other words, it sounds as if *most* of those in the demographic segments where the military draws most of its enlisted personnel are now ineligible to enlist.                With better, cheaper batteries they can, and those are on the way--along with solar panels multiples cheaper than today's.    Solar isn't the only option though, wind and hydro energy could be very promising for the US.  The US is maxed out for politically acceptable hydro, as are Europe and Japan, but the developing world is still full of opportunities.   Nuclear, wind, solar, hydro, biomass...  The energy system we need is as simple as ABC: Anything But Carbon.   Gas doesn't qualify. Not even close.   Better Kardashian than their previous cover featuring Tsarnaev, the Boston bomber.   Not just the GOP. Studies show that in *every* country, it's hatred and mistrust of foreigners that most unites conservatives. We 'Merkins just take it a step further, invading and occupying any country that makes us nervous.   I'd just love to see one of these conventions hosted by their actual funding organizations--Koch Industries, Exxon, Suncor, the American Petroleum Institute--rather than by their front groups like Heartland and Friends of Science.   So much for that petrostate thing.    Only around cities and crowded bike paths. On the backwoods routes where I spend much of my time, a stranger appearing on my wheel without so much as a "howdy" is downright creepy.    Immigration? Naw, Americans just want to feel superior again, even if it means following a flag-waving clown.   If Trump can't manage a small campaign communications team well enough to prevent botches like this, I'll pass on letting him run the country.   Venting and leakage are two separate problems, and leakage is the larger one. There's debate about where all the gas is leaking, but much seems to be from poorly cased wells where gas flows up the *outside* of the borehole, while in other cases the local rocks just easily leak gas when disturbed. Almost none of this is deliberate, and even less is monitored.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/09/15/study-bad-fracking-techniques-let-methane-flow-into-drinking-water/   Do I have this right: the leak rate is 1.5 times the previous EPA estimate of 2.4%, so it's really 3.6%? And the cutoff point for benefits from switching to gas is a maximum leak rate of 3.2%, so the gas business is actually *increasing* our carbon footprint?    We are in an "interglacial period". A long summer between ice ages.   Polar ice has been around for about 30 million years, as the climate has gradually cooled due to the rise of the Himalayas leading to increased weathering of rock, which sequesters carbon. By contrast, ice ages come and go every 100,000 years due to the Earth's orbital cycle.   Don't drive so much or you'll spend most of your time and money doing so. I'd drive the West Coast seeing cities and national parks, then fly to New York for a week, then maybe drive down to DC. Maybe finish with another flight to New Orleans and a drive over to Austin to see music in both cities.   Yosemite, Crater Lake and Mt. Rainier are not to be missed, especially if you enjoy hiking. Hit the rugged coasts: drive California's Big Sur and the northern half of the Oregon Coast, staying in small beachside motels or campgrounds.          http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/   Most global surveys show that attitude is pretty limited to the US, Canada and Australia.    Not a *very* protracted timetable, however. Carbon pollution has already brought us crop failures, record hurricanes, the Arab Spring revolts and the Syrian mess. Severe droughts are beginning to plague the expanding subtropics with increasing frequency. It's on.    Unless we stop the madness, which I'm reasonably sure we will do. Decarbonization is relatively cheap and easy. All we lack is political will, and that is about to change.   Well, the climate *has* swung through changes in the past, and we know why--which is how we know that we are responsible for this particular warming swing. Watching a rerun of the PETM in fast motion is indeed terrifying.     Not that simple, unfortunately. *Cumulative* emissions matter as much as *present* emissions because the carbon pollution now warming the biosphere was put there over the past 150 years, not just now. By that measure, Americans and Europeans are responsible for most of the problem *and* Americans still each pollute at nearly triple the rate of Chinese.   Call it all "carbon-free energy", then. Many leading scientists working on climate agree that nuclear must be part of our solution, and very few disagree.   Thanks for posting this. Yeah, I think we're coming to terms with the fact that carbon pricing will delay the outlawing of fossil fuels, but it won't eliminate the need.   You mean the photos of women riding on detached urban cycle paths? I think you'd have trouble finding *any* cyclists wearing helmets in downtown Copenhagen. You simply don't need them in a place where bikes move at a stately 10 mph, separated from traffic and pedestrians.   It amazes me to see how fast and far this crazy conspiracy rumor has traveled. I've heard deeply conservative folk agonizing over this 1,500 miles from Texas, speculating that this will be a Federal takeover of Texas followed by a UN takeover of the US government. The nut bone is connected to the whacko bone...   A rather isolated study. Solar activity is already remarkably low, yet temps continue rising in accordance with IPCC forecasts.   Already jailed them.    I don't know about you, but my mortgage broker nearly busted a vein trying to sell me a fraudulent mortgage in 2006. "Think of the house you could buy! The trips you could take! The investment properties you could acquire!"  I can only imagine the enticements Goldman mentioned in conversations with Greek leaders.         We agree. I simply mean that individuals all have the capacity to improve the world, and rich individuals can obviously do more, but no individuals can do as much as governments can. Collaboration counts.         Yes, they controlled for income. However, we probably don't need a study to tell us that. Take any two neighborhoods of similar socioeconomic status, one with trees and one without, and, more often than not, you'll probably find residents generally happier and healthier in the treed area.   And no neighborhoods are more depressing than ghettos without a tree in sight.   Plenty of cities do have tree planting subsidies worth looking for. I've gotten scores of beautiful, big trees at no cost for neighborhood tree plantings.   They controlled for wealth.   Yes, sea level rise will take time, but this study's point is that even the damage we've done to date will cost plenty, and if we don't start decarbonizing soon we'll lock-in much, much worse.  Unsaid: drought, floods, storms, wildfires, crop disruptions and associated warfare will grow intolerably horrible long before the oceans rise by several meters.   To be clear, this is mostly about Shell positioning itself as a gas company. Renewables are a very small part of their plans.               Disagree. The hyperwealthy are most definitely capable of improving the world. So are the modestly wealthy, and so are you and I. The issue is that in a $75 trillion global economy, even the $40 billion Gates Foundation can merely nibble at a few narrow challenges. None of us can do much alone.    "Women cyclists are the 'indicator species' for how bike-friendly a city is. If there arent at least as many women as men, then usually its because cycling is not safe enough. Its an indicator that you do not have good enough cycling infrastructure.    To be clear, the diet problem is nearly all about *beef, pork and lamb*. Poultry and seafood have [vastly lower carbon footprints](http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html). By cutting out beef alone, a typical American can reduce their carbon footprint nearly as much as going vegetarian would.   Quote of the day: If youre war weary, dont vote for me.         The heating started a century ago, picking up speed since. It is nearly certain that the loss of reflective ice will further accelerate this.   Big difference: FDR was a stealth socialist who [barely hinted at specific policies](http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/fdroosevelt/essays/biography/3) while campaigning, and who then revealed his New Deal proposals when in office. Before then, plutocrats loved him as one of their own.   Joe the Plumber?   Old Republicans must pass from the Earth before the party will ever regain sanity. By my calculations, I'll be able to vote Republican again in 2040.   "I'm no scientist, but..."   If Exxon was merely pumping oil, I'd agree. But leading a costly, twenty-year global campaign of deceit, all to keep selling a product they knew to be massively destructive? That puts this in an entirely different legal category.  Personally, I doubt the game will change until bastards like these are held to account with multi-billion-dollar judgements against them, as the tobacco companies were. The stakes are vastly higher here than they ever were with tobacco companies.   So...we and the next ten generations all pay taxes to move every coastal city, to accommodate a billion people flooded out of deltas? No one gets out of this without paying.         ["Globally, subsidies to fossil fuels may be on the order of US$600 billion per year, of which the GSI estimates about US$100 billion is provided to producers."](https://www.iisd.org/gsi/fossil-fuel-subsidies/fossil-fuels-what-cost)  We're talking direct handouts here, not vague calculations of externalities.   Go with the Planet X for the carbon frame.    Except that the vast majority of subsidies in those developing countries are *consumption* subsidies, not production subsidies.   One of my go-to quotes, but this isn't just willful ignorance. Exxon spent at least $30 million on a concerted campaign of lies to attack climate science that they knew was true, and we can safely assume they also knew of the millions of deaths and the global calamities this would likely bring. Welcome to the Crimes Against Humanity Zone. Punitive damages, anyone?   Did you read the linked GAO report? Excerpt: "From Fiscal Years 2003 through 2012, State Funding for Public Colleges Decreased, while Tuition and Out-of- Pocket Costs for Students Increased. State Funding for Higher Education Decreased by 12 Percent Overall and by 24 Percent per Student."  This began with states shifting costs to students. Federal student loans then grew to help ease the pain of that shift, but they did not cause it.   By guaranteeing everyone's loans and throwing in grants, they have created the same "blank check problem" that medicine faces.  Not really. Most post-secondary funding comes from the states, not the Feds, but state governments have recently shifted most of these burdens onto the students themselves. That higher tuition, in turn, has forced the Federal government to step in with more loans to meet the higher costs, but students still end up with a bill that was once picked up mostly by state taxpayers.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2015/01/05/students-cover-more-of-their-public-university-tuition-now-than-state-governments/   Interesting articles as well, and thanks for 'em. There's no question that Syria and the Arab Spring were due to pent up frustrations, along with heaping helpings of greed and fear. Climate disasters and resulting food shortages were merely triggers.  Those triggers go much farther than the Syrian drought alone, however. The Arab world lives on other countries' export crops, and *those* crops suffered [repeated climate calamities in 2008-2011](http://www.americansecurityproject.org/climate-change-the-arab-spring-and-food-prices/) that drove MidEast food prices sky high in 2010-2011. The "squares" protests across Arab countries began mostly as food riots.     Very few Arctic methane plumes are dense enough to ignite.    http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-hastened-the-syrian-war/   And it still is...warming.   Funny you should mention it. Exxon later paid some of those same PR firms and the same tobacco scientists, such as Fred Singer and Fred Seitz, to pose as climate science experts and cast doubt on the scientific consensus on climate change. In 1989, Exxon led the formation of the [Global Climate Coalition](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Global_Climate_Coalition) to grow this into a multi-industry push that included carmakers, utilities, construction companies, chemical companies, aluminum companies and many others.   Look at it this way: the last time the globe warmed enough to melt the ice caps 55 million years ago (probably due to giant basalt eruptions and outgassing causing greenhouse warming) much of Earth's life died, continental interiors turned to deserts, sea levels rose hundreds of feet, superstorms were common, and summer heat in most places would kill you.   Professor? Of what, petroleum engineering?   Why wait for Bangladesh to submerge? Syria and the rest of the Arab Spring revolutions show the results of climate calamities and resulting food shortages here and now. We'll see lots more of *this* kind of climate chaos long before we see Bangladesh, The Netherlands and South Florida vanish beneath the waves.   Used to be "climate science denial", but phrases are hard.   Loved Merchants of Doubt, but I'm way past being shocked by psychopathic greed.   Sounds as if you had a bad teacher in 1981. The scientific consensus on warming goes back to the 1960s, based on solid published research that began in the 1890s.    These crimes go beyond reckless endangerment. With thousands now dying from climate disasters caused by carbon pollution, and with abundant evidence that oilcos have known this for decades yet actively misled the public with massive campaigns of lies, we're talking manslaughter at the least, and possibly mass murder. If corporations are people now, Exxon should be on trial for its life.     Exxon has done precious little in alternative energy, and the other oil majors have backed out of most of their renewables initiatives. Many of these programs still exist, but, in most cases, they are now barely funded.  http://www.eenews.net/stories/1060006834   God help us if Arctic methane concentrations ever get dense enough to ignite wildfires!  No, except in a few odd cases, such as when methane builds up beneath lake ice, these tundra methane emissions are very diffuse. A big problem for the world, but not for plants and animals nearby.   Organize! None of us can do this alone. Add your voice to others. There are scores of great organizations looking for volunteer help, participants at rallies, writers of op-eds and so on.  Meanwhile, vote, recycle, and live in a walkable city.   The oil majors (minus Exxon) did briefly flirt with developing alternative energy technologies, but most have cut back those initiatives. Why cannibalize your core business when you can simply deny the climate problem, confuse the public and keep the cash register ringing until you retire on a carbon-spewing yacht? Leave it to the grandkids to handle the worst calamity in human history.    Don't count on the starving poor to become that organized. Do count on them to create violent, costly chaos in all directions.   Business analyst here. Some manufacturers and real estate trusts look about fifteen years out, but they look only at a slim number of variables, like the future prices of aluminum or suburban land. Most companies just muddle through, trying to repeat what worked in the past. No wonder that decarbonization scares the living shit out of them.   Before you jump, please persuade as many Republican science deniers as possible to join you.          A long pattern of malfeasance by a $350 billion company that threatens millions of lives and global prosperity? I wonder how many litigators are licking their chops at this.   It's a bar graph, Einstein.   ...Koch Industries...   Against countries? Probably not.   Against companies that lied about climate science while peddling fossil fuels that they know will kill millions? Absolutely.         [Relevant.](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21569017-artificial-cooling-makes-hot-places-bearablebut-worryingly-high-cost-no-sweat)   "Edelman has struggled for the last year to serve its fossil fuel industry clients, including Shell and Chevron, without putting off other clients or staffers who see climate change as a moral issue with clear rights and wrongs."         The only way one gets wiped out by a normal correction after a big run up is by by being greedy. They were over leveraged.   Not so whacked when one looks at the past 18 months, where the index more than doubled. It's just giving up some of that gain now.    You do realize that the entire world scientific community, and all of the G7 leaders (including Harper), just announced that we have no choice but to quit fossil fuels altogether within a few decades, right?   Yes, train them. Canada can do that for peanuts, as the US has. http://energy.gov/eere/education/find-trainings   Well, I call for an end to Koch Industries, and I expect my initiative to be exactly as successful as theirs.   Interesting that's piece published five years ago, yet still seems current.   SO2 is not a greenhouse gas.   It's all about carbon pollution per ton of freight. By that measure, trucks are nearly four times worse than ships.   It isn't just the military. Government cutbacks have accounted for a [huge chunk](http://www.businessinsider.com/public-sector-jobs-2014-4) of the job losses in recent years.   Marine shipping is actually the most efficient, least polluting means to move cargo. Trains are next-most-efficient. Trucks are very inefficient. http://cm3.missiondata.com/uploads/65/Image/Picture1.jpg   Living in the woods is typically 6-12 times more carbon intensive than living in an urban neighborhood.  The most effective action you can take is to join with others to create political change. Pushing for a carbon fee and dividend is a good place to start. Check out Citizen's Climate Lobby.   	200
 I run a bar in Cambodia, and each night we screen two movies on our back wall.  I've been trying to keep the movies tied together with a common theme, whether it was Dan Akroyd Night (Ghostbusters and the Blues Brothers) to Real Life Infamous Violent Criminal Night (Chopper and Bronson).  Tonight's Music Mockumentary Night (Spinal Tap and Fear of a Black Hat).  I was wondering what you guys would pick for a theme and what movies!   Thanks! That's what I kind of figured. It's been a nightmare keeping healthy backups of everything!  Lots of no name brand or fake brand name hard drives; I'm gonna try to make it to Phnom Penh next week and get some better drives, maybe replace the internal if I can.    I'm in Cambodia, trying to make the limited equipment I have available work for me.  I wasn't expecting to work on this trip, but I got sucked into a project with my editing laptop back in Texas.  My question:  I bought a laptop where the internal drive has two partitions. Looks like it's 5400 rpm.  Right now, I have Premiere on one partition and my raw footage on the other.  I also have a USB 3 drive that's 5400 rpm that I'm using as a backup.  Is it better to have my raw footage on the same disk but different partition as my OS and Premiere, or should I be working off of the USB drive and use the other partition as a backup?  I'm also doing some light After Effects work, if that matters.   I was confused when I first read it, but the article's saying that the data will be returned to earth, not the probe.    Hello! I'm in the middle of a six month solo motorcycle trip across SE Asia. So far I've gone from Hanoi, down to Ho Chi Minh, and across to Phnom Penh. I tried going into Laos earlier in the trip, but got denied at the border multiple times, with the guards saying that there is a new law forbidding foreigners into Laos on Vietnamese bikes.   I'm hoping a Cambodian registered bike will be a little easier to get into Laos, and it would be nice to upgrade from 125 cc's anyway, so I wanted to sell the Win here and upgrade. Has anyone here done this? Any good places or websites I should look at for decently priced, used dirt bikes? Ideally, it would be along the line of a Honda CR 250 for under $800. Any good spots to sell a Win with Viet plates and registration?  Thanks!  PS: is there a Facebook group for expat/travelers in Phnom Penh? Hanoi Massive and Saigon Expats groups were extremely useful when I was in Vietnam   Geez, this is such a sad story. Nobody should have to go through that. I'm glad you got out of there and that you're doing better.    I kinda figured. I'll be heading to Cambodia next, then Laos, and I'll get to Thailand around February.  I was hoping to get this thing sooner, but I'm guessing Cambodia and Laos would be even more difficult in terms of shipping things to myself.    Cool, thanks!  	8

Wie bersteht ihr die Ferien in Wien?   It is also soccer shoes, baseball bat, what about basketball ball      Well, hilarious thing happened right after. The teacher who doesn't give a damn, laughed at us when we met him at the toilet Haha    Yeh :(   So this happened two days ago.  On a class trip to Italy, it was ordinary for us to get drunk daily. We are all 16 so it is legal for us to drink beer and wine, both in Italy and in Austria.  Every night we would leave the home and buy drinks, come back and fuck ourselves up. Two teachers attended the trip; one of them didn't two shit about how drunk we were; the other was incredibly interested in what we drank and making sure we stayed legal.  On the first night we went out and bought a 4l (1 gal) bottle of vodka. Of course the barkeepers didn't care about our ages. As long as we pay no one asks for a pass. This enabled the 6 most eventful nights of my short 16 year old life.   Well it was the last night in Italy and we decided; why not drink before we leave for the train? We can drink on the train as well. (We drank on the way there)  As only a quarter of the bottle was left friend 1 left it on the table. Friend 2 told him to "hide it better". Friend 1 put it behind a pack of chips and went, "That's the best hiding spot ever". We all went, "NO". And left it at that.  And so we drank, playing drinking games and being noisy causing the teacher who didn't give a fuck to enter the room. He immediately noticed the bottle and asked, "Are you retarded? You can't just leave a bottle of vodka out like that" Doing his duty as a teacher and because the other teacher was there he confiscated the bottle and told us to think about it and tell him the truth.  Friend 1 took the fault on himself because his parents didn't give two shits about him drinking, unlike the rest of ours, and left the room. (Have to note he was very drunk, so one of us went out to assist him.)   Turns out all our parents will be notified on this anyway. I'll keep updated.  TL;DR Got caught by teacher with vodka bottle on class trip.  	21
    Why does everyone downvote me the second I post something?         Alwaaays things relating to mental health huh..      Orientation is kicking off day after tomorrow and I, as an awkwardly shy guy who struggles to hold conversations with everyone both friends and strangers am fearing that I will not be able to make friends... Help?   Why not? When I first learnt the piano I didn't find super fast double thirds or clean scale runs that impressive and now that i'm older, I do! :)   I call BS on OP. Who the hell names their worker just Employee? Ever heard of names to avoid confusion?   Knowledge of something only adds to the beauty! I paraphrase Feynman on physics of course! Take a look at this video to see what I mean! (I highly recommend it)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmbwczTC6E   Yes of course! But I don't see how that relates to the picture of a piano!   Well to be fair, his 1812 overture did require live cannon fire!    I just read from /r/classicalmusic that these pianos would usually be trapped with bombs that were sometimes trigged by hitting a certain key. Terrifying to think about it. Sad to see how even traces of beauty and humanity can be manipulated for grim purposes.   Reposted this and made note of it on /r/pics so that more people hopefully will see this!       Makes me wonder if there were any pianists who were soldiers at the time who were lured to the piano and were killed or had their hands incapacitated as a result of the trap :/    Edit: Here are some breathtaking pieces I have discovered recently!  [Anton Rubinstein - Piano Concerto No. 4 \(1864\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3tS05YROlY)  [Anton Rubinstein - Symphony No. 2 "Ocean" \(1851\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YBu5QzHPoo)  [Charles Villiers Stanford - Requiem \(1897\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfHi6rfHiEU)  [Norbert Burgmller - Piano Concerto in F-sharp minor, Op.1 \(1829\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKX8NXOH55I)  [Franciszek Lessel - Piano Concerto in C-major, Op.14 \(1810\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4N95zeJugM)   So it's pretty late where I am and amidst my state of half-sleep while listening to [Moszkowski's Piano Concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1dDAs0fZic) I just realised something..   Music.. is huge...  I've been playing the piano and cello my whole life and i've had my fair share of music classes and performances. However, I just only realised that MUSIC IS SO GODDAMN MASSIVE.   I'm just sitting here in awe just looking at these random youtube channels that have posted hundreds upon hundreds of masterpieces that I have never heard of in my life with composers I have never even seen or know how to pronounce! There are entire operas, gargantuan symphonies, oratorios and masses by composers, basically entire worlds out there that have eluded me for a lifetime! Composers I discovered recently include Marx to Giere to Beach to Spohr to Scharwenka to Walter to Elmas to Martucci... the list goes on and on and on forever!   Admittedly I always thought I was the classical geek who knew tons about music but now... I think I know nothing and am completely aware of my ignorance.   When I was much younger, when I learned that our massive planet was just one of trillions in our universe and how there are more stars than there are grains of sand on Earth, I was overcome with a feeling of both awe and fear of the huge scale of things. Once again, I feel this feeling again but now, for music.   "Music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music.' - Rachmaninoff  I know now what Rachmaninoff meant.   Sorry for the rant but I just had to let this feeling of euphoria out! Music is amazing.      I have been looking at every bit of information on my college's website/handbook/guideline/etc. for the past 5 months, even before I received admission so I think i'm at least providing all the info.  There are other classes in the informatics department which would fulfil the requirement but... it's restricted as well.    I'm sorry, I should have specified. I'm not in an American college and thus there are no differentiated COMP courses in the beginning!    You see, the problem is that the intro classes listed as a COMP class which I am, according to my major, not allowed to take. This is where my confusion stems from.   Here's the initial one:  Dear Prof. X,  I am a prospective student intending on majoring in X for the 2015 intake. However I have but one concern with the course. The breadth restrictions state that I am not allowed to take any COMP or INFO courses outside the core and thus, may I ask why this is the case?  I ask this because our Database Systems course later on requires a COMP courses outside of the core and I do not understand how I can counter this problem if it is a restriction. Could you please advise me on what I could do in this situation?  Regards,  Rumitative_Lychee   I just need insight as to whether this app is legit and safe, never used something like this before..   Here is one of them:  Dear Prof. X,  I am currently a prospective, incoming student to the university intending to major in X and have one question to ask if you don't mind answering.  One of the breadth restrictions are any courses labelled as COMP. If I would like to take a COMP breadth in my first semester as I have a deep passion for programming and have read that a COMP course is a requirement for the required INFO course later in the major, will I be able in any way to take the COMP courses as a breadth/diploma?  Thank you very much, ruminative_lychee  To which he replied with a single "yes"   So one of my majors requirements is a 2nd year programming course. On the website, it states that to do this course, I need to take at least one 1st year programming course. However, my major restricts me from taking programming courses so I shot an email to the professor in charge of coordinating the major, asking him why this is the case and then gave details about my problems.  He then replied days later simply saying that he found my email offensive and that it was the case because they actually planned their major. I was taken aback but politely resent a rephrased email which was just ignored. Weeks later I ask a similar question in great detail about my plans and he just replied with a single Yes.   What's happening? Was I really that rude?      I'm pretty much straight but i'm just sexually curious to try it out one day. I've downloaded Grindr a few hours ago and have a page full of messages sent to me but i've never used these kinds of apps before.. help?      I remember seeing a very brief except of the concerto with Lang Lang as the pianist a long time ago on Youtube but I forgot where I saw it now. Does anyone know where I can listen to Tan Dun's Piano Concerto (The Fire)? Can't seem to find it anywhere on youtube!     	31
 I'm not really sure, it's probably 480p. I'm watching it on TV and it's a non HD channel.   But yeah the lighting is dimmer and not as sharp, which suits Alien which is why the idea came to mind.   Watching Alien right now in regular format and it seems it suits it better than HD.    The masks that they have on when they rob the bank   I will never be good and that's not bad.   He scouted all the locations and got a lot of the casting done, but it was ultimately too expensive to finance.    The whole script is online if you're interested, I believe they're trying to make a miniseries based on the script.   Napoleon by Stanley Kubrick would have been the movie to end all movies.

 What? How? And FUCK YEAH!    It was.. Dana Carry ad libbed the line to mess with Mike Meters. The reaction was so good they kept it for the film   This.... I am so glad this is a thing   Are those really 20's?? Would have guessed 16's maybe 18's tops... Either way I fucking love your ride man.    Sons of Anarchy fallout   What about adding the Kuchi Kopi to the Louise tattoo?       That must have been tough.. Sorry you and your family had to deal with that... Is she okay?    I went in to the bathroom to get her a cold wet rag.. Even though she had cleaned it all out while she was in the shower the smell was so strong I threw up   Really? No shit? I would have guessed by some of the signage hanging that was a WF.. Great display.. Going to have to check that one out   To me the white balance in the video (all be it unintentional) reminds me of the filming style of begotten. Also looking at Alice Coopers face, particularly his eyes while he's singing The Second Coming, to me is just creepy.    No.. But blood pressure drop..

Retaliate with Lingenberries    Wine   Ftfy   I'd get it tattooed to look like NASA's Saturn V Rocket   On vacation in a hotel.. My ex who had multiple health problems had a digestive hemorage in the shower and bled out profusely anally. The smell was so bad they had to relocate everyone within two rooms of ours.

Good candidate for /r/idiotsfightingthings   Super fucked up, not arguing that... But my guess is this kids case is more an "oh shit I fucked up oh shit" than being arrogant or entitled.. Super fucked up either way   I had something for this.. Shit...

But it stops them in their tracks and weakens self confidence   You know... Not that you'd want to   I started with two upper body days and two lower body days with a mid section day and 2 rest days and was getting results before I stepped it up...   My routine was 10 - 15 minutes light cardio to warm up, deep stretching, weights for the day, 30 minutes of cardio just intense enough I thought I couldn't make it and finish out with 2 or 3 core exercises and more deep stretching.. Do core every day (my trainer says even just one or two quick core exercises on rest days)  Change up what weight routines you do weekly so your body doesn't adapt and essentially "get bored" of your work out.

Something unnerving about being alone in a hospital   There's no build up to any of the scares... Shot just comes out of no where without warning.. No false scares... The opening credits alone are unsettling.    Awesome.. Can we edit a little yellow jumpsuit on him   Zip disks   Your not alone. Recently I've been thinking of dropping Reddit and this just kind of affirmed my decision. Blacking out and choosing who gets to be a part of major subs goes against what Reddit is about. IMO it's also a little elitist. This whole blackout and random uninformed people jumping on the bandwagon just proves to me there is a sheep mentality even here, it's just better disguised.    Am I the only one who really thinks this is all one big case of cutting off noses to spite our own faces? What guarantee is their that any of this will even work?    In short: CEO fires important employee. In return the admins of the site protest by becoming incredibly exclusive. The exclusivity (which goes against everything this site was stands for) will drive people away lowering traffic numbers and forcing the CEO to either higher the admin who was fired or shut the site down, thus punishing the vast majority of users who are uninvolved.   Tl;dr: an odd case of cutting off your nose to spite everyone else's faces.    If you think the start is hard core wait till season 3 finally   It's a hale mairpiece   I don't know. That would mean he'd have to believe in something that he can't take credit for creating himself...    I figured scuffs, wasn't aware of the adhesive. Admittedly I've jumped in twice, both recently. I saw the scuff but they buffed out, no sign of adhesive or anything stuck to it. I wonder if it fades in the weather or with contact.    Please specify. I think we might be thinking of two different groups of people. Not sure where you're leaning.    Those poles are kind of a joke. A 4cyl 2 door honda civic can make it through. They bend over very easily.    So please enlighten me... Please list all of the nations that would actually join into a holy war in the name of the church. Please find some sort of educated source beyond your own personal opinion, that supports States supporting a religious war, in the name of the Catholic Church, against Islam.    I figured Donald Trump was just Joaquin Phoenix in great make up reaching his highest acting challenge ever.    Notice I said American Catholic. Not a lot of Holy Wars being waged out here in the suburds... Besides, isn't most of the fighting going on in Northern Ireland for political control? Granted, historically religion played a part decades, even a century ago. But isn't independence and social control the real issue?    Sorry. American Catholic with German Irish and Norweigian roots. The Catholic church (especially on the community level) is a peaceful one.   Edit: And yes. I believe I said back woods rednecks... Of course that includes Scotsmen.    So it's bush league to not pick up the phone, but it's not to take EVERY beef you have with someone to social media? When is DEBC going to learn that their president is their own worst enemy.    The FAR vast majority of Catholics wouldn't even consider it. I think if anyone did follow it'd be back woods rednecks claiming to be Catholic just for a chance to jump in.    Anodyne is solid. I liked it a lot. Whole foods park lane has it on and they have a Crowler machine. I talked to Waide their beer specialist,, he said it holds good for up to two months   That's the coolest Holy Shit moment of the week    32oz of 9.25%abv.

I didn't know that BOB SAFER RAPED AND KILLED A GIRL IN THE 1990'S    Obligatory myopic, cliche and sexist joke about wanting to see the honeymoon, from a male Internet user.   Congrats y'all. Don't let anyone take your happiness away.   Edit: wow, apparently the sarcasm in the first half of my comment got missed      Not a fan. Was very excited. Thought if a brewery was going to do a raspberry Wit community would be the one to nail it. Had an unpleasant bitter after taste like fruit or berry seeds. Also just seem to be a 1 demensional beer. Was kind of let down.    You have captured the exact reason I don't watch me a soccer   Much smaller leagues back then. To get to a full season and series playoffs you had to have more series.    Ideally yeah... A separation between church and state with a union would be great... But realistically our government is run by corrupt and flawed humans. The only function of the government is to provide public service and protect citizens from harm. In no way is it the right for the government to decided what moral decisions we should make if they do not cause financial or physical harm to others. Saying a governing body of a nation this big should be the moral police is horrifying. Historically theocracies kill more of its own citizens than they protect. In now way now, nor ever was it the United States governments job to decide what was morally right for its people... That's up to the person to do. Don't look to the Hill for moral guidence, look to the Gospel, your family and yourself.    Wiki can explain it better than I can. In short,, tradition from the 50's revolving the playoffs   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_the_Octopus   You are correct, sorry for the incorrect information of squid v octopus   On the upside: this is further distancing the gap between church and state. Our Gov obviously does not always govern based on moral decision... Laws are supposed to be written to keep people safe. For some reason our government thinks it's their job to tell it's people what is right and wrong, it's not, it's their job to tell us what is legal and illegal. I hope this reminds everyone to remain faithful to their faith before their country.    It doesn't work if you don't remain abstinent... If you actually maintain abstinent you won't get yourself or someone else pregnant. Once you have sex how ever abstitence only is null and void.

Well done sir   There's a scene from the Fron Files season 4 ep 12 where Tina is dancing and seducing the zombie basketball team. Does anyone have a gif of this?

Almost every time I've switched jobs I've had success because I had time to get in front of people.  I worked as a line cook for years training to be a chef.  Almost every job I got was because I went in and worked for free for a few days to show my skill.  A few jobs were because I knew someone who was opening a restaurant or they had a friend who was.  After a while in had success working in several great places and the resume got me the job.

Yeah, one or two early on was okay (at best)  Her voice reminds me of that one awesome lady who sings really well at church.

I've seen him in everything from a flashgordon hawkman costume to a ladies night gown.  Whatever is weird, light and breathes.  I totally dig the fact that Buzz only wears PF Flyers   They tour almost non stop, their shows are on the inexpensive side, all you have to do is show up early and not move from your spot       Yeah, who really uses fructise shampoo, that stuff is horrible for your hair   Gemma singing   Edit: Katy Sagal singing    Holy shit, I was not prepared to see that   I love Hemmingway.

Fuck Yeah   2 months into my journey and I've made progress.  I finally have the discipline in hitting the gym everyday.  I've been disciplined in my diet and taking steps.  I'm now 2 weeks into no diary, no bread, no booze.  But today I've been having intense cravings for EVERYTHING I've committed to no eating. Do you practice cheat days?  24 hours of whatever I want.  Or should I stay strong?  	113
 They aren't spammers if they're genuinely happy with their service.   I've used Straight Talk Verizon for 5 years now and never had a problem with coverage or service.

Boobs hanging down to their belly buttons, underarm flab just flapping in the breeze becoming rhythmic after a while...slap...slap...slap...slap.  Grandmas, grandpas, Old Aunt Sue.   Ask yourself if that's really what you want.  Think of all the people in this country who are overweight, because that's mostly who you'd see at the beach.  Flab, flab everywhere.   Wrinkles.   Hit them for something they did wrong.   It's illegal. A variety of different offenses, such as "indecent exposure", "public lewdness", "public indecency", "disorderly conduct" and so on, may involve exposure of a specific body part (genitals, buttocks, anus, nipples on women), a specific intention or effect (being sexually suggestive, offending or annoying observers).   A former friend of mine showed up at my house around 3:30am demanding I give his damn dog back.  He was yelling and cursing so loud the neighbors came outside.  He ripped the railing off my porch and the shutter from a front window because I wouldn't let him inside to get his dog.  I couldn't convince him to leave, so I called another friend to come get him, which he did.  I didn't have his dog because he never had one to begin with.  Cocaine.   "In Walker's police report, he said when Acker refused to sit down in a chair, he pushed her. The video shows her trying to kick him and that's when he picks her up out of the chair and slams her face down on the ground with her hands still handcuffed behind her back."  What a harsh video.  If this is how he controls a 110 lb. drunk girl maybe he needs to rethink his effectiveness as a police officer.   I was thinking a Disney princess.

Perhaps you should try again.      I've had no problems for a couple of days now.  It's so much less snarky and more akin to what reddit used to be.  What a nice change, eh?   I think you've summed things up quite nicely for many of us who've been here for a while.  It's kind of like the feeling you have the day after graduation, it's over and it's never coming back.

Despite being regulated in Military Housing areas and over 700 U.S. cities, pit bulls contributed 78% (25) of these deaths. Pit bulls make up about 6% of the total U.S. dog population.  Together, pit bulls (25) and rottweilers (1), the second most lethal dog breed, accounted for 81% of the total recorded deaths in 2013. This same combination accounted for 74% of all fatal attacks during the 9-year period of 2005 to 2013.     42 U.S. dog bite-related fatalities occurred in 2014.  Together, pit bulls (27) and rottweilers (4), accounted for 74% of the total recorded deaths in 2014.

He will make a lot of new friends where he can learn from. Fitness is far from ideal because you barely have contact with others.  Taking him out for a shopping spree is nice but make sure he chooses the clothing with some tips from you, instead of you picking out all the clothing and he just tries it.  Let him develop his self and advice him where necessary or when he asks for it.  He is lucky to have a caring sister like you just take him out to do fun stuff.     I always read books in the past when I was younger from age 6/7 to age 14 and that went all fine, but now I have such a hard time remembering what I just read. Is this a concentration thing that you have to train again?  Do more people have this problem? Any tips?  Didn't know another subreddit to post it in.     Heb mezelf nog nooit onveilig gevoeld op Schiphol, berhaupt in Nederland.

Je vind wel beetje verschillende statistieken zo las ik net ergens dat tussen de 15 en 16 het gebruik verdubbeld is.   Blijft een lastige kwestie, ben zelf niet voor legalisatie van hard drugs maar dat is mijn mening. Kan moeilijk me gedachten erbij krijgen dat als het legaal word je als verslaafde minder gaat gebruiken? Bij Heroine is het bijvoorbeeld zo dat wanneer je dat 1 keer binnen krijgt je echt gelijk behoorlijk verslaafd bent.   Er zit een psychiatrisch ziekenhuis hierbij mijn huis in de buurt en ook verslavingszorg, die mensen zijn er echt heel erg aan toe. Dat ik echt gewoon moeilijk kan begrijpen dat als het gelegaliseerd word het beter word.     Positief? Het totale drugs gebruik Is naar beneden gegaan idd, maar de hard drugs verslavingen en hard drugs gebruikers zijn omhoog gegaan.   You are very attractive .

De serveerster zegt in het filmpje het broodje was er al afgehaald want die was al op? Erg logisch. Terwijl ze eerst zeggen dat het halve broodje op was.   Het word gewoon compleet uit ze verband getrokken terwijl dit in de eerste plaats gewoon nooit op internet had mogen verschijnen. Iedereen heeft recht op privacy.    Wat is er achterlijk gedrag aan om een melding te maken van dat er een haar in der eten zit? In het filmpje vanaf 57 seconden word er duidelijk wat er speelt, Meisje: "Er zat een haar in me broodje" Man: "Ojeej dan haal je hem eruit of je loopt er heen, maar je gaat niet zitten wachten als een prinses." Hier is dus de hele ophef over. Niet over dat ze niet willen betalen of iets dergelijks. Die man had zich gewoon met ze eigen zaken moeten bemoeien en de beste man die filmt had het niet hoeven filmen en anders had die de dames moeten  blurren of onherkenbaar moeten maken.  Aanvulling: Iemand publiekelijk terecht wijzen is inderdaad fantastisch als iemand dat durft/doet maar dan wel als iemand echt onrecht word aangedaan of zich niet aan de regels houd.   Wel beetje vaag dat die man zich ermee bemoeit, als er echt een haar in het broodje zat is het terecht dat ze er wat van zegt tegen het personeel, alleen dat hele stuk missen we.  Overigens moet er gewoon een regelgeving komen dat je niet zomaar iemand ze gezicht op het internet kan tonen in filmpjes of dat je het in ieder geval moet blurren.

Protesteren doe je op een andere manier.     and they didn't advice you to go to a urgent care facility, what is much cheaper?   Ik denk dat al de NYC producten niet duurder zijn dan 5 euro zijn en dat dit product van NYC 1.99 kost.      Je kan een rekening openen bij Binck bank, hier kan je met een schaduw portemonnee  "oefenen". Dit is een portemonnee met nep geld erin en kost niks, afgezien de kosten van het hebben van een rekening zelf.    Beetje apart stuk, alle schuld word afgeschoven op iedereen behalve de grieken zelf. De mensen werken inderdaad gewoon tot hun 60ste maar vanaf hun pensioen rond hun 40ste levensjaar werken de meeste zwart en betalen ze geen loonbelasting, ook bouwen ze hun huizen niet volledig af zodat ze er geen belasting over hoeven te betalen.   Telkens maar naar Europa wijzen en de bankensector/bedrijvensector de schuld geven vind ik niet echt correct.    10 waarschuwingen is toch behoorlijk veel? Lijkt me als een agent wat tegen je zegt dat je gewoon na 1 keer luistert 9/10 keer is het gewoon terecht wat ze zeggen.    If you are already thinking that your mom is gonna commit suicide call 112 or the Huisartsenpost (GP office) I wouldn't wait a second, calling them would never hurt you, they have the appropriate knowledge to help you further.    What a fantastic news!    Bizar, zag laatst ook dat ze het gewoon niet offline haalden en dat de persoon in het filmpje eerst sorry moest zeggen in het openbaar. Dat is toch gewoon chantage?      Wow, does your manager have a boss? I would contact him, this is insane.   O Never knew that, but do the Cardiac MR techs also do Cardiac CT's or seriously only MRI's? And the Radiologist are regular radiologist with sub-specialty Cardiac imaging.  Cool! Well i'm eagerly awaiting my results, the sooner the better and the sooner the treatment can begin, but my Cardiologist said he is gonna ask if the radiologist can do the study as fast a possible. So fingers crossed.   Thanks for your explanations!   The job anxiety is something what will fade a away, everybody is scared at there first couple of interviews, I seriously almost shitted my pants during the first time I had an interview I didn't want to take a sip from my drink I was offered because I was shaking a lot.  But during the interview it faded away, these people totally understand you are nervous, in fact I never heard of somebody who wasn't nervous for his job interview.    You probably know more then you think other wise you wouldn't be able to graduate.      Ah are there also different specialties inside the radiology department?    uhm 2 days ago, it's gonna take a well i think, a year ago it also took a month, it's a good hospital but terribly slow.   But is what you see in the bottom of the heart in the RV wall a small aneurysm? Because it doesn't look entirely straight/smooth?      No I have only all the images, still awaiting the report. But requested the images so I can look a bit by myself because it's pretty cool to see your own heart in such a quality!  Edit: when I have the report i'm willing to share it.   Thanks! Do you know by any coincident where you can send your mri images online and somebody makes a report from it for a reasonable price like 50 dollars? Or is it a lot of work?       Wauw gefeliciteerd!    Niet te veel Pornhub kijken scheelt al een hoop  	38

       yup there's a list! http://www.nycrgb.org/html/resources/zip.html   Hi All, looking for some advice on the following situation:  Landlord never informed me that my building is rent stabilized. No preferential or legal rent was mentioned on the lease. No rider was attached.  I've been paying 1450 for just under the last 2 years. After a year the lease expired and went month-to-month. It was never renewed as is legally required.   Landlord now wants to raise rent $50. If this is still preferential obviously I don't want to cause trouble. If it isn't it could be too much of an increase, but I don't know the legal rent. I told him I need a new lease, but at the moment he still doesn't know that I know that the apt is rent stabilized.   What's the best course of action for me? Should I sign a lease for the additional $50 and then once I get the rent history from the state confront him if it is too much. Or should I wait until I get the history and then have him rewrite the lease if the increase is illegal?    Would you rather clean up the poop of 100 duck sized horses or one horse sized duck?   yo mama.    you should know Turkish! Seriously... Way too many expats leading isolated lives in Turkey. You can't "learn how to bargain" unless you speak Turkish. If you start in English you've lost the game already.    Dinosaur is nothing compared to Hometown.   Goto Hometown BBQ. Best in NYC as far as I'm concerned. Actually wait, don't go. More Brisket for me...  http://www.hometownbarbque.com/   Up. Wind.   I have them and like them. Obviously the bass response isn't as rich as a larger speaker...  when I went to the showroom to listen it was between these and the Adams.    explain for the uninitiated... does this address venom somehow?    It's hard to explain... something in the middle. I was hypnotised as a teenager during a very large stage show. I didn't forget the experience. I wouldn't say I was being mind-controlled like a puppet. If I was asked to do something I was truly not ok with I don't think I would have done it. It's more that I was hyper relaxed / meditative  and there was a kind of unspoken agreement to do what the guy suggested.          you can also disable whatever you'd never use... for instance if you're not working in surround, or don't need 20 Mid-Side plugins etc..      that's very not true seor wombat.  With more speakers the chances of alignment issues significantly increase, causing phase cancellation and ultimately unintelligible dialog + muddy music.    The ONLY good software for drafting signal flows is "Omnigraffle" as far as I'm concerned. All serious theatrical sound system designers are using it these days.          agreed!   Def sounds like Spat to me! http://www.fluxhome.com/products/plug_ins/ircam_spat-v3   Who are the creepy figures above your left and right shoulders?   	24
                         The data is from Bryan Perry, Household incomes in New Zealand: Trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2013. Ministry of Social Development (July 2014), Tables F.6 and F.7..  In Excel, I calculated the before and after housing costs, child poverty rates in New Zealand since 1982 to see which was the more meaningful measure or were they only meaningful when read together.               The data was downloaded from the heritage foundation's Index of Economic freedom.  In Excel, I plotted the labour market rankings of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Venezuela.                                                      Isn't the story that these indexes are rather poor at picking up change in any direction?      The data was downloaded from the Heritage foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.  In Excel, I plotted the labour market freedom rankings for the UK, USA, Germany and France.                                       The data was downloaded from the Index of Economic Freedom.

The data was downloaded from the CD economic Outlook June 2015.  In Excel, I plotted the equilibrium unemployment rates as estimated in the 2015 OECD economic outlook for Canada, USA and UK from 1962 as and when data became available      The data was downloaded from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand website.  In Excel, I first plotted consumer price index inflation. I then deducted 1.5% from those inflation rates as per a common estimate of the bias in the consumer price index for  new goods, product upgrades, and so forth.

    So the CIA and the NSA can work together to help the CIA torture people...but NOT to share pre-9/11 intelligence.  FULL wikileaks report:  https://wikileaks.org/nsa-germany/                        the first moon landing, Apollo 11, was certainly broadcast far and wide. But NASA only allowed the TV stations to film from their screen (instead of allowing the "news" stations to have a direct feed)--which made the film very grainy.   as for your "rockstar" quote--Joe Rogan made a good point about the moon landing being a Technological God, something that no one is allowed to question. Others question the God Box--the TV--even Bill Clinton had a quote in his book in which Clinton himself questioned the moon landing by Apollo 11.   The "press conference" the Apollo 11 astronauts held a few weeks after they came back is quite odd. In the Q   A portion a member of the audience asks the Apollo 11 team if they could comment on the long-term impact of their moon landing. Neil Armstrong (who spoke the famous "One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind") acts as if he doesn't want to answer the question and ends up going last.  Armstrong earlier had claimed he thought up those Historic Words during the trip--but in the Q   A Armstrong is tongue-tied and acts as if he is sitting at the defendant's table of a criminal court proceeding. Armstrong also retired from NASA after the "moon landing" and only gave a few interviews.      I'd put money on a huge fucking bonfire in the middle courtyard.   Shame that Neil can't even win an argument about the FAKE moon landing against...JOE ROGAN   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNGM_1rWVtw oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMNGM_1rWVtw has_verified=1         Guess that's why Stanley Kubrick released *2001: A Space Odyssey* in 1968...  Oh wait...that's 1 year before those LIARS didn't fucking go to the moon.   Why do all those hero astronauts run like gazelles when simply asked to place their hand upon a bible and swear that they went to the moon?   Fucking Hilarious.    You would think that just 1 appearance by Neil Armstrong (before he passed in 2012) could have raised $500,000...but Armstrong QUIT Nasa after Apollo 11 and rarely gave any interviews...Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins QUIT, too...WHY?   Look at how excited and giddy with JOY the Apollo 11 crew is at the press conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKl_oXxsQiA  WHY doesn't Neil Armstrong smile and shout out loud "We went to the moon!!!"  Instead he avoids using those words and calls the the moon landing an "adventure"  Either these 3 got the shit scared out of them by aliens--or they didn't go to the moon and don't want to continue LYING TO THE PUBLIC.      more on Zelikow:  http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=michael_hurley_1  http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=philip_zelikow      minds.com   FAKE moon landings?  9/11 was a GLADIO B operation?

How hard could it have been for them to spy on the 9/11 Commission?  -----------------  from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):  The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.

A: It depends on who the user is. Law enforcement and private investigators will use the information to try to:  1. Identify individuals based on behavioral analysis of comments, etc.  2. De-anonymize individuals and leverage this information on other platforms, i.e. checking identical/similar usernames and using the behavioral analysis to predict other (online or offline) hangouts and activities in order to build a more complete picture.  Sociologists and psychologists will use it to build behavioral models for individuals acting as individuals and for ad-hoc groups of individuals without any external organization, goal, etc.  Members of the public and historians will use it to look at and for public figures and to better understand them. More importantly, the public should use this database as a wake-up call that the driving force behind Big Data isn't Big Brother - it's the masses. Between this and the Dark Net Market archives and some other releases in the last few weeks, it's becoming more apparent that the "right to be forgotten" may be recognized by some governments but private individuals and researchers, not just megacorps, remain major obstacles to it.  This is, simply put, the biggest example of open source SIGINT to date. The fact that it was done legally and openly, and not as the result of a hack or data leak, may make it seem less newsworthy - but if anything, it makes even more alarming to privacy advocates. It's not a one-off either, it's just one of the biggest signposts we've seen so far.  -------------      ALL the larger subs are fucking MANIPULATED.

(full article minus headline, photos)  -------------  WhoWhatWhy has discovered that scores of young people have been denied their freedomand their Constitutional right to a speedy and public trialwhile being held in Chicago jails, some of them for years.  A Freedom of Information Act request revealed that dozens of detainees who were under the age of 18 when they were booked have been incarcerated for more than two yearssimply because they couldnt post bail while awaiting trial. Thirty one juveniles have been held for at least two years and another 33 have been awaiting their trial in jail for more than a year. Twelve have been in detention for three years or more.  The findings are part of a WhoWhatWhy investigation into the treatment of teenagers who are sitting in the nations jails because they cannot afford bail. The probe was triggered by the suicide of Kalief Browder.  The story of Kalief Browdera 16 year-old who was imprisoned for three years after being unable to come up with thousands of dollars in bail after allegedly stealing a $40 backpackcast a harsh light on New Yorks grievously flawed bail system.  While New York City announced this month that it would no longer require bail for suspects accused of low-level or non-violent crimes, this revamp doesnt go in effect until next year, likely leaving many minors to languish in prison while awaiting trial.  Worse, other cities continue to operate similarly flawed justice systems whose excesses have gone largely unscrutinized, until now.  Chicago is one of those cities, as revealed by a WhoWhatWhy Freedom of Information request. While Chicagos Cook County Sheriffs Office does not collect data on specifically why such detainees remain in jail, a follow-up with a Sheriffs Office official confirmed that it is fair to assume that individuals in the jail who remain in custody despite being given a cash bond are unable to afford to post the required amount.  The data from Chicago suggest that Kalief Browders case is not a tragic anomaly but an indicator of a larger, perhaps nationwide pattern. While we do not have information on the alleged crimes of the Cook County Jail detainees, we do know that they all received a set bail, and that bail is only set for individuals who are not considered a significant danger to the community.  We are continuing to investigate how Chicagos juvenile justice system compares to New Yorks. WhoWhatWhy has submitted a Freedom of Information request and is still awaiting a response from Laura Mello, the Freedom of Information Law Officer for the Department of Corrections, City of New York.  --------------   but the USG/corps never have to show PROOF--we are supposed to just believe it happened because they said so.               Cyber Threats seem to be the perfect way for corporations and U.S. agencies to expand their funding--because they can always hide under the "National Security" banner. Maybe the corporations were losing profits because of the wind down in Afghanistan and Iraq--easy fix, just invent another Boogey Man...problem solved, profits back up.  Last check, the U.S. had 3.2 million security clearances--not sure how many of those are in the private corporations which the Three Letter Agencies contract out to...   welcome...any thoughts on Stanley Kubrick or the Apollo moon landings?   Sibel Edmonds only worked at the FBI for less than 6 fucking months--that's how fucking crooked the whole entire system is.                  I remember him from the *News Radio* comedy series on nbc, then the UFC...I was also first against the MMA when it first came out, but grew to like it and have watched it up until about 3 or 4 years ago.   As for Rogan being a propaganda agent--I'd think it is far more likely he has been approached and commanded not to say too much regarding certain subjects. By agreeing (or being forced to agree) that would make him a propaganda agent.   Alex Jones has made his Topic #1 OKC and 9/11 from Day 1, while Rogan is more of a conversationalist with jokes, drugs, and a truth chaser. Jones now presents everything as News and Editorial--attacking the NWO. I wouldn't doubt if Jones is seriously fucked with by the USG and pressured not to report on certain subjects. For example, infowars was all over the Boston Bombing from Day 1--then during the trial they were completely silent and only published an article from whowhatwhy.com until after the trial. Jones has also added a lot of main stream media links to his webpage--most likely to keep from getting fucked by google searches and the threat of losing his press pass...(Never really looked too close at Jones--I find him a bit abrasive).   I think it may have been a missile that hit the Pentagon on 9/11...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).  I just have a feeling Deep in my gut that the U.S. was scared shitless by Victor Bout--the whole extradition seemed to be much more than some Russian arms dealer selling weaponry around the globe.  ------------------  (from wikipedia, link below)  Viktor Anatolyevich Bout (Russian:   ) was born 13 January 1967, near Dushanbe, Tajik SSR, Soviet Union.  A citizen of Russia, he was arrested in Thailand in 2008 before being extradited in 2010 to the United States to stand trial on terrorism charges after having been accused of intending to smuggle arms to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to use against U.S. forces.[1][2][3] On 2 November 2011, he was convicted by a jury in a Manhattan federal court of conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens and officials, delivery of anti-aircraft missiles, and providing aid to a terrorist organization.[4][5]  A former Soviet military translator,[6] Bout had reportedly made a significant amount of money through his multiple air transport companies,[7] which shipped cargo mostly in Africa and the Middle East during the 1990s and early 2000s.[8] As willing to work for Charles Taylor in Liberia as he was for the United Nations in Sudan and the United States in Iraq,[7][9] Bout may have facilitated huge arms shipments into various civil wars in Africa with his private air cargo fleets during the 1990s.[10]  Bout says he has done little more than provide logistics, but former British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain called Bout a "sanctions buster"[7] and described him as "the principal conduit for planes and supply routes that take arms from east Europe, principally Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine, to Liberia and Angola".[11]  In cooperation with American authorities,[9] Royal Thai Police arrested Bout in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008.[12] The United States ambassador requested his extradition under the Extradition Act between the Kingdom of Thailand and the United States, which was eventually mandated by the Thai High Court in August 2010.[3] Before his extradition to the United States in November 2010, he expressed confidence that this U.S. trial would eventually lead to his acquittal but this did not occur.[13][14][15] From January 2011 to June 2012 Bout was incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York City.[citation needed] Following his conviction, he was sentenced on 5 April 2012 to 25 years imprisonment by a U.S. judge. In June 2012 he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois.[16][17][18][19]  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Bout  + [Audio interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XirNkEMTxHE ) with Victor Bout on Russia Today  + Photos of [Victor Bout] (https://duckduckgo.com/?q=victor+bout+extradition ia=images iai=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2010%2F10%2F5%2F1286276659024%2FViktor-Bout-arrives-at-Th-006.jpg)     Wow--never saw that Pat Tillman death info...Michael Ruppert said Tillman was shot in the forehead--but then seemed to indicate Tillman was a Hot Shot looking to win a medal (so his own crew took him out). Ruppert has stood by that version--its on Truth tv and on his Joe Rogan interview...  Odd that Joe Rogan has rolled back and no longer openly states "NASA didn't go to the moon"...In Rogan's interview with Neil de Grasse Tyson, Rogan definitely backtracks from his previous position. He argues just as a counter-argument (stating he doesn't believe it anymore) and still leaves Neil De Grasse Tyson looking like a fool quite a few times.  I could see that young cop being a PsyOp--and I could see Rogan having to make deals with the Pentagon (who sponsored lots of  MMA). I wouldn't doubt if about 1/3 of Rogan's audience are military.   Why are the Chinese using the backwards copy of the debunked "Missile hit the Pentagon" video?   To be clear: I think it may have been a missile...it's possible Israel (with the OK from the CIA-Wall Street) bought the missile from Victor Bout with the intention being to set up the Russians as having sold Al Qaeda a missile...maybe Victor Bout recorded his deal with the Israelis--so they had to get Bout outside of Russia to set him up and take him out of circulation...(maybe the video of Bout selling the Israelis the missile is the only thing keeping him alive).  I just have a feeling Deep in my gut that the U.S. was scared shitless by Victor Bout--the whole extradition seemed to be much more than some Russian arms dealer selling weaponry around the globe.

And they all refuse to place their left hand on a bible and swear they went to the moon...  Not sure: but did the U.S. actually try to make it "illegal" for other countries to visit/photograph where the U.S. has supposedly landed?    CIA gets the poppy fields...the defense contractors get to plunder the U.S. taxpayers...  Dick Cheney's original idea was to have pipelines go through Afghanistan (note the former Unocal executive who the U.S. placed in charge: Hamid Karzai)...pretty sure Henry Kissinger represents one of the -stans (either Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan?) in terms of oil/gas--his law firm would have made a nice percentage...(Kissinger was originally supposed to head the 9/11 Commission).  further reading: http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/oil.html   there are about 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan=$10 billion  add cost of equipment, weapons, training, WASTE, GRAFT, etc...         it's easy to lose perspective between the poppy fields and the cargo planes full of cash...

Allen Dulles at the CIA actually handled quite a bit of it by networking with the publishers and editors (*NYT*, Time, CBS, etc...)...By the 1970's, the CIA also Bought plenty of journalists as well (see Carl Bernstein's 1976 *Rolling Stone* article "The CIA and the Media")...  J. Edgar Hoover (FBI) was also networked--mostly with smaller newspapers...but both the CIA and FBI eventually made Hollywood sing their tune as well...Today, the Pentagon helps fund and often OKs the scripts of films--Top Gun, Pearl Harbor, Transformers, Black Hawk Down, etc...The FBI began their Hollywood propaganda way back in the 1930's...  The media have turned into conglomerates--so no one wants to publish stories which will end up hurting their subsidiaries...Going back to WWII, NBC was owned by RCA (which owned companies that made radio equipment for the military)...  Today, no one wants to investigate the missing $9 TRILLION at the Pentagon because: 1) it is expensive to conduct investigations; 2) the reporter could be killed like Michael Hastings; 3) the corporate board likely all invest in defense/intelligence corporations.   Apparently, the CIA was heavily involved in the making of ENEMY OF THE STATE--for much, much more check out [Hollywood and the CIA: Episode 6, THE CIA and ENEMY OF THE STATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gOHaCU3vCY)...(audio only)    Apparently, the CIA was heavily involved in the making of ENEMY OF THE STATE--for much, much more check out [Hollywood and the CIA: Episode 6, THE CIA and ENEMY OF THE STATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gOHaCU3vCY)...(audio only)             Recently watched *Kubrick's Odyssey* and *Room 237*...sounds like Alice (Bill's wife) may have had some relevant scenes cut out (possibly involving the man she dances with...possibly there was a dream sequence where she was also at the illuminati/orgy party)...also: the very end does show their daughter possibly being taken by 2 men (who appeared earlier in the background of the film) while they are at the toy store...  A couple things I noticed: while many people have mentioned the use of light bulbs in the background of "The Shining"--SK uses the light bulbs in almost every second of EWS. The light bulbs are supposed to represent the Scotch/Front Screen process which SK used in filming 2001 (and possibly to film the Fake Moon Landing). The lights, obviously have other allusions--but to use light bulbs in almost every second of EWS, and in such an over-the-top manner, seems to be screaming "LOOK--have you ever seen so many X-mas lights in a film?"  The other thing which stands out is that it is X-mas, yet there is NO SNOW...even though it is late December you cannot see anyone's breath or see car exhaust--not even a frosted window...the landscape looks more like fall than december...interesting that the college kids who push Bill around while he is walking--at least one of them has on a Yale sweatshirt (cough cough).  --------------  edit: re-watched EWS--all six of the drunken idiots who yell/push Bill have some type of Yale swag on them--one has a Yale varsity-style jacket, the rest of them have Yale sweatshirts (some underneath coats) and few of them have Y baseball hats on. (guess who played first base for Yale in the late 40's--GHWB)   I definitely feel your frustration, but The Cabal rules the media--they can sell any lie (or just force the media not to cover a story). Once in a while the media breaks a story--but ultimately there is no meaningful follow-up. Case in point: June 28th (a saturday) the Wash Post broke a story accusing the CIA of withholding 14,000 photos from evidence--no major network has followed up...  Even if there is an official congressional investigation--it ends up as controlled opposition (a Farce).    Surely we have telescopes that can see the moon surface...  Can you find a recent photo of the American flag which Apollo 11 left on the moon? How about a recent photo of the moon buggy?     We either need mass trials or mass leaks of information to expose the rampant criminality of the corporate criminals, the traitorous politicians and the war criminals...  ...but considering that we can't even get any member of congress to go on the floor and read part of the Torture Report--I think things are just going to continue to get worse and worse until an event occurs which makes people get out into the streets and protest.                           Whew--glad they didn't ask her to take a stance on the 14,000 photos which the CIA is withholding from the defense attorneys in Guantanamo...Guess it is only fair though--they haven't asked POTUS or anyone else about it either since the report came out Jume 28th in the Wash Post.

HA^HA^HA                  Actually, there is quite a bit of evidence that the Cold War was mostly **THREAT INFLATION**.  -----------  **Q: Its 1961, the height of the Cold War, the U.S. has 40 nuclear-capable Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles--how many ICBMs did the Soviets have?**  According to Daniel Ellsbergs *SECRETS: A Memoir of Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers* (2002):  However, in the fall of 1961 a highly secret, dramatically revised national intelligence estimate turned the strategic world that had preoccupied me for three years upside down. The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera.   ...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)   ------------------------  The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf  ------------------------------  Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.  Why?  The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.  Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.  This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.  Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.  Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.  ---------------------  Full book [*The Pentagon Labyrinth*](http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/full-labyrinth-text-w-covers.pdf) was edited by Winslow T.

The FBI also threatened Kubrick with prosecution for showing the inside of a B-52 (?) bomber (they proved they had gotten the interior design from a photo in a book which had been published).  All of these actions put Kubrick on the CIA-Pentagon radar--if there is any validity to Kubrick filming the moon landing it was because of what happened, both during and after, the filming of DR.

Obama allowed the CIA to Splice and Dice the SSCI Torture Report from 6,400 pages down to 400 pages...  The SSCI was very upset at the CIA's final edit.               "OOPS!!!

Pretty F'ed up world when even the heads of Iraq and Afghanistan haven't mentioned prosecuting the Bush-Cheney (et al.) War Criminals--but that's what happens when you install puppet rulers after the overthrow.         WAR, INC. is a TRILLION dollar a year business--I have no doubt they would stoop to that level...ask Michael Hastings what he thinks!!!   You should also remember the Pentagon IS built on land once referred to as HELL'S BOTTOM.      went to the article you linked--which had a youtube video that translated the actual words UBL spoke...  http://www.globalresearch.ca/pakistan-tv-report-contradicts-us-claim-of-bin-laden-s-death/25915  ...of course the youtube video had been disabled.   most likely Dick Cheney (et al.) set him up because Ritter was standing up against the rampant NeoCon militarism.   it's actually easier to read that way...  As for the post...I started watching this doc from 1992 a few days ago [**THE PANAMA DECEPTION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo6yVNWcGCo) which starts out by pointing out how slanted the US media was towards the US invasion of Panama...really shocking to see how brainwashed we are to have believed the US media for so long--"a free press"...i've come to realize maybe the media in Russia is less dangerous than the US media--at least the Russians question everything their spin machine churns out...while here in the US, most Americans just see a report on TV and accept the "official US version" of events (even when the lie is exposed a day or two later).  I assembled a few other facts--mostly about Pakistan, that I found interesting:   ---------  **STRANGE** that the CIA spent untold amounts on operations as well as untold amounts of cash bribing everyone they could in Afghanistan and Pakistan to find out where UBL was...then they finally get lucky--after spending BILLIONS--and have an informer  WALK-IN who worked for the Pakistani ISI come in and cough up UBL's location.   **STRANGE** that the U.S. gave [Military Aid to Pakistan](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/pakaid.pdf)--over $30 Billion since 9/11.   **STRANGE** that [Porter Goss and Bob Graham](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2014/03/17/the-911-joint-congressional-inquiry-and-28-missing-pages/) were with the head of the Pakistan's ISI on 9/11 in Washington DC  **STRANGE** that the head of Pakistan's ISI quit about a week after 9/11 because a newspaper from India published an [article outing him as having sent the 9/11 hijackers money](http://www.propagandamatrix.com/india_helped_fbi_trace_isi_terrorist_links.htm)  ...but most folks don't remember all that.  ----------------            Afghanistan: Opium, the CIA and the Karzai Administration  http://www.voltairenet.org/article167754.html                 	194
    Original Study: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/15/1504467112      One interesting possibility is that trans teens will be less depressed if they know it's not a case of being in the "wrong body". From the conclusion: Transgender youth are aware of the incongruence between their internal gender identity and their assigned sex at early ages.             the animals...they're trying to tell us something                  nope.   The study is mansplaining combat, and it's wrong.

False.  http://m.snopes.com/man-arrested-for-alligator-sex/   that is an incredibly interesting insight into a blessing that always bothered me a bit. Nice.   Incidentally, all of those Talmudic cases also have very practical, law-based applications. For instance, the section on breast size is trying to determine at what age a woman is considered an adult for the purpose of court prosecution, especially in capital cases.   In the US, once you're 18 you are an adultregardless of your personal development. Even though we know some 15 year olds can consent to sex and make their own decisions, we call them children. And even though we know some 20 year olds can barely consent and are easily swayed by peer-pressure, we consider them adults.   The Talmud tries to avoid these pitfalls by defining adulthood for the purposes of consent and prosecution by physical development...the onset of puberty...at which point, the Talmud needs to define puberty.  Fascinating...not ridiculous.      If you've ever met someone with colorectal cancer or Crohn's Disease, this actually makes a lot of sense. I think it's sort of awesome that they thank god for something that actually matters...the physiological processes that make our bodies work. Sure beats those hymns thanking god for mountains and forgiveness and stuff.         nah, that was me. sorry.     	27

My husband's uncle lives next door.  He just got out of an old folks home. They found a tumor in his brain and  thankfully were able to remove it and  he is OK now but having symptoms of dementia/Alzheimer's.     So one day I was sleeping. My husband was at work. Suddenly I wake up. There's someone at the window trying to open it. I freak out, looking for my phone to call the cops.  One of our cats moves the curtains and I can see an old man with a walker and hunched back. OK. It's uncle Andy. I run to the bathroom (got the pee almost scared out of me) and call my husband.     Apparently his uncle wanted to talk to him. He doesn't have a watch or phone or sense of time so he just keeps randomly showing up in our window.  The second time I had just gotten out of the bath and was completely naked. I yelled for my husband, grabbed a nightgown and again, ran to the bathroom, this time to get dressed.    My husband finally went over to visit him and I guess he keeps saying the same thing and asking the same questions over and over again. He thinks his caretaker and nurse are out to get him.  Apparently he's been deliberately peeing and pooping on the bed to scare the nurse away?  In his old man brain somehow it makes sense.    Anyway, other than the window visits which scare me every damned time, he's started throwing notes on our porch.  The notes are getting progressively weirder.    I'll try my best to decipher them.      1)  Christopher please remember " I'm a lost dog please help me to get home don't hit or beat me." Like Thanks  A.V.

                I didn't caveat it correctly, thats a 5th of all the pensioners wholly reliant on the state for support.   Not true at all. India has an extensive and growing public health care system, and a welfare system which accounts for over 12% of GDP.   Given that all the growth we are seeing is from low wage jobs and stalled wage growth that's a fair assumption.      Looking at the 5 year sustained Real GDP growth data that isn't what is happening. But my point is that the claim is extremely thin when you examine the wider global picture - we can't even claim to have the best growth in the G20.   If it makes you feel more comfortable to think that then go right ahead, but that isn't [what is happening](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=desc). The best five year sustained Real GDP growth belongs to Turkmenistan.  Go look for yourself, that's the world you've been living in all this time.   Nope. Average age group is 1829 years of age   Only if you've supped the Tory Koolaid - the claim relies on parsing the IMFs economic language carefully.  - China grew faster than the UK in 2014 but it remains classified as a 'developing' economy despite being four times larger than the UK economy. 7.4% growth.  - India also grew faster than the UK but, despite being a top 10 global economy, is not classified by the IMF as a 'major' economy. 5.4% growth.  - Productivity remains lower than 2007, unprecedented since the war.  - The growth we're seeing is mainly down to cheap labour driven by migration and stalled wage growth.   - Unemployment is falling overall but the new jobs are at the very bottom end of the pay-scale.   - US growth is forecast at 3.1% this year, and will certainly overtake the UK, just as it has in the past.  - Our [Real GDP growth](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=desc) rate is 3.20 or 97th in the world. India and China are at 7.4, and we're being outpaced by Ecuador and Malaysia.   - We are not even in the top [20 fastest growing economies](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-25/the-20-fastest-growing-economies-this-year) worldwide. We're being beaten by Poland!  - And we're not even the fastest growing G20 nation, but we are the fastest growing G7 nation for 2014 alone.  - Our [global competitiveness](http://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015) ranking is woeful, we don't even make the innovation list.  So the claim relies on ignoring many countries that most would think of as developed and leaning on percentage growth rather than real GDP growth.  Why are 20 year old kids in the US becoming billionaires and financing startups, but not British kids?     Why are the only discussions on the topic spend, spend, spend vs cut, cut, cut?  Why must every policy debate only take place at the extremes of the topic under discussion?      So Osborne would like to think but the evidence suggests otherwise.      Props on doing a community focussed job + thank you for your service.   I live in London, and although my issue was an emergency, I was offered an appointment six weeks hence (which would have rendered any advice useless) and told this is typical in major cities due to lack of trained staff.   I have heard similar stories from other people and had a very similar experience 20 odd years back.  I was eventually able to obtain advice through the Martin Lewis site which led me to a fourth sector charity which was able to advise me over the phone.   Qin Shi Huang, the King of the Qin State (pronounced chin), founder of the Qin dynasty, and China's first Emperor (who some believe China was named for). Did practically the same thing as Khan - fought with the other 6 states, and ultimately united the country by war in 221 BC.   Study posted yesterday for those who want the source: https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/3dtk2t/hydraulic_fracturing_linked_to_increases_in/   Absolutely, but those in charge are usually shareholders themselves and seek to drive the share price in the short term so they will reap greater compensation. To my mind its all part of the same vicious circle.   I doubt it.   Osborne's policy, and the wider global Conservative movement's thinking, is to say that economic productivity is low because welfare-to-work programs and benefits are too generous.   Essentially that workers are not properly motivated to work harder and get better paying jobs because they can get, in Conservative thinker's view, 'easy' money via welfare. To their minds this is why the recovery hasn't taken hold, treasury receipts are down and almost all new jobs being created are at the bottom end of the pay-scale - ergo this is why they were unable to meet their deficit reduction targets under the coalition.  The solution, in their view, is the removal of welfare-to-work policies and capping of benefits. This, they believe, will result in a more productive and motivated workforce. The result on the business end will be workers demanding and thereby receiving better paying jobs - which won't happen. Obviously they intend to remove the safety net without ensuring that business meets their pay objectives.  This same view is being expressed by Republicans in the US, Conservatives in Germany, and the UK - Osborne is blazing the trail.  Its all crap of course and will only drive the sick, and the poorest amongst us further into the ground. But of course the sick and indigent are not anyone's customer.   Yep. Government should step into the middle and ensure workers receive a fair deal, if for no other reason than to avoid the need for policies like tax credits. But political parties main customers are businesses and the wealthy (also because ordinary people are not prepared to donate to them in large enough numbers for it to be meaningful) thus policy is again skewed in favor of big business not the worker.   Its about who the customer is, not the end user or worker. For example Train Operating Companies offer poor customer service to the end user because the main customer of the TOCs is the Government, not the traveller. They agree what service improvements will be made 10 years ahead and won't change that plan no matter how the traveller's needs alter over that decade because it's fixed in the franchise agreement, as are the costs.  Similarly with companies the 'customer' of most companies is their shareholders. In capitalist thinking this is fine because the shareholders should be the public which should provide them with the proper ethical and social motivations, but in the modern globalised economy most voting shareholders are institutional investors and other organisations whose single motive is return on investment and nothing else. There is no motivation to invest in the social fabric of the business or the social fabric of the country in which that business is based.  So we have a widening disconnect between shareholder value and social value. Companies will not pay people more because staff are basically disposable and the shareholders will not countenance any policy which reduces their ROI even if it results in better productivity and innovation in the long term.  Equally the customer of political parties is, again, businesses and wealthy people, and that again skews policy.   Agreed - the Portcullis House Logo or parliment.uk email address do tend to focus minds very quickly!   I can say from experience that CAB are underfunded and under resourced. They literally don't have enough trained advisors to cope with demand and, no matter the urgency of the situation, that means getting from contact to information takes up to six weeks even for high priority cases.  Its equally true that the advice they are offering is no different than that offered by other, more accessible, fourth sector organisations. Hence my advice to this chap that he explores other organisations that are better resourced while waiting for the CAB.   That is precisely the question that should be being asked by those in the UK, nonetheless, given the scale by which UK POWs were affected it is relevant to the UK.   The CAB can take up to 6 weeks to get you an appointment.   I've had cause to speak to the [StepChange](http://www.stepchange.org/) debt charity recently (they might be able to offer you some help too). They reccomended [www.turn2us.org.uk](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/) which lists a preposterous variety of organisations that [offer grants](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Find-Benefits-Grants) and help of all kinds to people including those in your situation - they also seem to offer advice about benefits and may be more accessible than the CAB.  There doesn't appear to be anyone who offers Crohn's specific grants but there are many that do offer help for people on low incomes even if many have extraordinarily specific missions (such as helping only people with the surname Forsyth), there are many more like the [Talisman Trust](http://www.talismancharity.org/) and [Newby Trust](http://www.newby-trust.org.uk/) who do help people in poverty, illness, or low income circumsanaces.  PM me if you don't have food.  Edit: If Chron's is anything like the illness I suffer from then the appropriate fourth sector organisation may be able to intervene or provide help to you with benifits so try calling [Chron's and Colitis UK](http://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/about-us/contact-us).   The National Union of Students also has funds and help for those in your situation.   The article has its focus on that, but only 1000 of the 2000 POWs in the Mitsubishi camp were American - the remainder were Allied POWs.   Read up about the [Burma Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Railway) as an example of what was going on.  [During](https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/prisoners-of-war-of-the-japanese-1939-1945) the World War 2, the Japanese Armed Forces captured nearly 140,000 Allied military personnel (Australia, Canada, Great Britain, India, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United States) in the Southeast Asia and Pacific areas. They were forced to engage in the hard labour of constructing railways, roads, airfields, etc. to be used by the Japanese Armed Forces in the occupied areas. About 36,000 were transported to the Japanese Mainland to supplement the shortage of the work force, and compelled to work at the coal mines, mines, shipyards, munitions factories, etc. By the time the war was over, a total of more than 30,000 POWs had died from starvation, diseases, and mistreatment within and outside of the Japanese Mainland.  Which is not to say the UK is innocent, we also used 400,000 German POW's as [slave labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labor_of_Germans_after_World_War_II#United_Kingdom) during and after the war. We didn't, however, starve them to death or beat them - not that this would justify the practice in any way.   The point is that none of the companies I mention are actually 'cheating', thats a moralistic imperative implied by people who think that there is a fixed tax rate for everything that 'should' be paid, these companies are exploiting a loophole generated by a tax system designed for a less globalised world, and one that could easily be closed.   The companies I mention are not cherry picked for impact, as you suggest, they are companies that either have the entirety of their tax base in the UK or have a trading entity with a tax base in the UK and retail products directly to the public rather than manufacturing goods.  Nintendo is not a direct-to-the-public-retailer, its a wholesaler, and save for its UK online store does not have its tax base in the UK, nor does it have an entity which does.  Reducing Corporation tax is the least helpful mechanism of supporting UK trading businesses as exists, as demonstrated by the government - when they want to provide subsidy to an industry they almost always do it through VAT - for example the print media receives 1.2 billion a year in zero rated VAT, similarly oil exploration to the tune of 400 million a year.  Even the 8% reduction in corporation tax made very little impact on my business or the size of its bill, but the flat rate VAT Businesses in my sector pay has a huge impact.  As I said, this move was PR.   They do - but you're not going to convince me that Starbucks, IKEA, the Daily Mail Group, Sky, Virgin, British Petroleum, Costa Coffee and Nero all have sufficiently low profit margins that they deserve to pay nothing or, proportionately, very little Corporation Tax compared to my business - in this way what Osborne has to say about CT is largely irrelevant to anyone with 1 million plus turnover (meaning they can afford good accountants).  How do you think small business owners feel when we struggle to pay the Corporation Tax bill whilst discovering that Starbucks paid nothing in CT because it structured its worldwide cost base to take a loss in the UK?  Merrill Lynch, for example, structured its cost base to take its entire global loss during the recession through its London office and will pay no tax here for decades as a result.  Essentially what you're engaging in here is pedantry. My complaint is perfectly understandable and valid.   Corporation tax is a tax on profit, therefore it has a direct relationship to turnover, although the two won't be the same for every business.   TBH the reduction in corporation tax is meaningful only to small businesses and even then experience suggests it won't do that much, but it sounds good when announced at the budget.   HMRC often alter the soft rules around what CT applies to as a means of compensating for the headline rate reduction. For example they altered the rules for Directors Loans so they attract a higher rate of CT to compensate for the 8% reduction during the last parliament which resulted in my business paying 1,500 in retroactive taxation.    Large businesses really only pay some corporation tax to look good, not because they have to. IKEA also has form on [this](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/21/multinational-firms-tax-ebay-ikea)  My little business with its 10k corporation tax bill often pays more than companies with massive turnovers.  Edit: CT is a tax on profitability and therefore there is a direct relationship to turnover, its also true that the higher your turnover the better accountancy advice you can afford. Whichever way you look at it structuring your global business to take costs in the UK that were incurred outside the UK in order to pay no, or very little tax here, is just wrong and an affront to business owners who do have to pay the full ride.  A 1% reduction in 2017 and a further 1% in 2020 is basically nothing but PR.   Thats a very broad assumption - both that piracy is a crime under criminal law (its actually civil) and that every teenager engages in it.   Uk soldiers were also used for slave Labour.   That was posted 43 minutes ago, mine was posted 37 minutes ago - 6 minutes between the two. I always check but not all recently posted articles show up immediately for every user, this is why the up/down votes on articles vary as you reload.  The bitching in this sub is deeply tiring. That's why I bother with it less and less.   I think you need to read the article again, you seem to have made up a set of facts to fit your assumptions. The article also comes from AP and PA, reliable sources.   First paragraph  Nine Britons deported from China for watching videos advocating terrorism **have said** they were watching a documentary about Genghis Khan.  In other words the people themselves explained what they were watching.                     She and Ed Balls had a poor expenses history, she was Brown's Chief Secretary to the Treasury so she'll be labelled with 'The Note' and the policy, and then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions - so IDS will have a field day with her.  Burnham will also be labelled with PfI.   In fairness it is an American study.            Yvette and Andy are too damaged by their former ministerial portfolios to get traction with the wider electorate - the attacks are so easy - it really concerns me that Yevette might win by default on second preference votes.  Kendall just comes across a poisonous.         The real problem is nobody is listening to a word any other candidate has to say - basically because they have nothing interesting to say.  As one headline suggested this week the tragedy is Corbyn is by far the best leader of those on offer.  If the election showed anything its that the parliamentary party isn't reaching Labour members let alone the wider electorate - Harman's benefits statement and Chuka's response to Corbyn show that.  I'm actually wondering if a party split might be on the cards. Even if it is I'll still support Corbyn.   Deleting your cookies also resets the article limit.      You've found one example of a difficult bill and are claiming that single example of a contentious vote would have made 5 years of government difficult - you have very thin evidence.  Secondly you're attempting to cast a moral case over a bill in the National Parliament by comparing it to a Scottish Parliament Issue - where is it written that Scottish MPs should agree with MSPs on all issues. Personally the issue is moot MP's are MP's.  Were the result run under List PR for example the result (Lab/Con/Lib) would have been 239/207/140 and all further permutations result in a wide enough majority for the bill to have passed because there would be a proportionate reduction in the votes against.   We're discussing the election result, not intra party politics. Labour had a majority of 355 and this bill passed with 316 votes, 39 Labour MP's rebelling.  Firstly I really don't see how it's important that the bill passed with 'Scottish MP's' as there is no such thing as a 'Scottish MP' only an MP. Secondly how have you calculated that the bill passed with only Scottish votes, and what does that matter?  Had the election result been different the bill would have been approached differently, perhaps the whips would have made more effort to get people on board.    Oh, I see that you're right. I was looking at the 'last election' figure at the top of the article.   They got 40.7% of the seats.   It cuts both ways the Tory vote increased by 0.7% but that translated to 33 seats - far more than justified by the increase in voting.  But yes - under PR Labour would still have a workable majority.   They would still have had a majority of 40+ in each case - it wouldn't have hurt their ability to move legislation.   My father spent most of the 1950s and all of the 1960s - almost all of his RAF career - on detachment to an American unit. He would be left out of any mission which the UK government would not have sanctioned, this is the tradition in cooperating armed forces and has been for a very long time.   The point actually is that Cameron could easily have asked that these pilots not be involved in certain missions, the fact that they were and he knew about it shows a complete disregard of the will of Parliament and is a very serious matter. He is not President of the UK, he's its prime-minister.   Actually it didn't - no system of PR would have altered any of Labour's recent election victories other than leaving the party with a reduced, but still significant, majority.  Nor would PR have altered the 2010 result other than to have increased the number of Lib Dem MPs. This election, however, would have significantly changed had we had a PR system.   There is no doubt that the 2005 election was disproportionate, but the [measures of proportionality](http://constitution-unit.com/2015/06/29/was-the-2015-election-the-most-disproportional-ever-it-depends-how-you-measure-it/) show the previous two elections to have been worse, and the two since worse still.  A system of PR wouldn't actually have changed the 2005 result, such was Labour's lead among voters, and that's really the point. This election run under PR would have resulted in a coalition.   If just 900 additional Labour supporters had turned out in 7 constituencies we'd have a minority Tory government, if 1300 Labour voters had turned up in 8 constituencies there would be another coalition, and if 10,000 votes in a further 12 constituencies turned up or changed we'd have a Labour government.   11,000 people decided the election.  By any measure this is the least representative election result the country has seen. Every system of PR shows a coalition or minority government.  So it really begs the question is the current electoral system working for voters?   Ok. Try reading this very slowly and outloud - perhaps then it will penetrate.  Not a single fucking point you've made is correct.  Both gas consumption and gas production are falling whilst renewable consumption and production are rising. This is a decadal trend, UK gas production has been falling since 2000. This shows you are wrong.  Your new claim *'My original point, that wind companies, which generate electricity, are not competing with the part of the oil industry which generates gas is accurate.'* is **obviously bollocks** - of course they are fucking competing you moron, they both sell their product to the god damned generation industry - it's the gas producer's main business for the love of god, thats why the production/consumption trends reflect each other. Jesus!  The first paragraph of the report I linked to says this:-  UK Government has implemented massive subsidies to promote exploration and development of risky and unconventional oil and gas in recent years, including deep-water offshore resources and shale gas.   Who the fuck does oil exploration - fucking Santa? - Oil companies.  I've been replying because I've actually been trying to educate you on how this works - you've provided no evidence to back up a single thing you've said whilst vomiting a bunch of semantic crap to pretend you have point.                  Exactly what is it you're trying to prove by differentiating Primary Energy production from energy consumption? No matter which set of figures you look at they both show that fossil fuel production is decreasing while renewables are increasing - neither supports your original point - in fact both sets of figures disprove it.  Oil and Gas industry receives *direct* subsidy for exploration totaling 400 million a year out of 1.2 billion. Whatever the hell you've made up above is just nonsense.  Really all of what you have to say has been crazed blustering to cover the fact that your original point was completely wrong in every respect.   Sorry, but the graph I linked to is the official DECC estimate for Primary Energy Consumption and shows the same trends as production. Once again you're wrong.  Frankly what you've written is so ridiculous I couldn't be bothered to go point by point. However, since you invite it.  You've claimed.  Wind turbines are not competing with massive gas extraction.  Well, they are, as I outlined above on the generation output side they comprise 15% of current generation and that output has risen 13TwH in just three years and renewables will overhaul gas generation output by 2018, gas output has been on the wane since 2000.  The British Geological Survey reports that we've got shale gas reserves in the UK which would put us somewhere between number 3 and number 1 in the world for gas reserves.  Again as I've shown the report claimed no such thing because as little as 10% of that is accessible and they lack confidence in their assessment of the upper number.  That would give us a roughly equal amount of recoverable gas to Iraq's proven reserves  Nowhere near, I mean not even close to that. We have the 24th largest proven reserves in the world Iraq has the 12th.   You're conflating electricity generation and primary energy production  No I'm not.  firstly, we don't subsidise the oil industry in this country  Yes. [We do](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/74519000/jpg/_74519696_74519695.jpg). Around [1.2 billion a year in fact](http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9245.pdf) and that number is expanding. Actually its the same size as the subsidy received by the print media.  Primary energy production is not the same as electricity production.  Funny that it shows the same trends then.  I don't know why you think primary energy production backs up your case at all, what it actually [shows](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/437455/Energy_Trends_June_2015.pdf) is a continuing downward trend in the production of gas since 2000 and a continuing increase in renewables as I suggested.     I've quoted you the primary energy production estimates and grid generation outputs. Neither support the case you are making.   Really having read your two comments its clear that you know NOTHING of the topic at hand. Every point you've made is wrong.  the fact that you're conflating the two suggests to me that either you don't really have a firm grasp of what's being talked about, or that you want to intentionally mislead or misdirect people reading your posts in order to further an agenda  This wasn't intentionally insulting? Really? Fuck you again.   I'm really tired of people being complete dicks about this when discussing it online. Frankly fuck you - there is no need to be insulting.  The comment you've made above is simply garbage. Look at the estimated [primary energy production](http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/71060000/jpg/_71060672_71060671.jpg), over the next few decades where is Gas? Declining to nothing. What is the major future source? Renewables.  As for these *potential* sources being anything close to middle eastern oil reserves you are simply crazy to think that or you didn't actually read the report you're quoting. The extraction costs are barely supported now let alone in the future given the unstable global market prices.  The BGS survey said:  "Estimates of the amount of recoverable gas and the gas resources are variable. It is possible that the shale gas resources in UK are very large. However, despite the size of the resource, the proportion that can be recovered is the critical factor."  Furthermore BGS's OWN estimate was 10% or 130 TCF which is fuck all and basically means it's barely worth the infrastructure spending and subsidy. The paragraph above also suggests they don't have high confidence in their estimate of total reserve which was 822 TCF.  The figure I quoted was Cuadrilla's own estimate which was higher (for PR reasons) than BGS's much more detailed study.   Thankfully Police have [made an arrest](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-33571051).      If the former is true, how has the death penalty been excluded? [serious question]   I wasn't aware of it myself until the sentencing phase of the Rolf Harris trial.   Renewables are competing, they're actually producing more electricity than most people realise, 28.1 TWh or 15% of total generation in 2014 - that's an increase of 13 TWh in just three years, if its allowed to carry on renewables will overtake gas generation output before 2020.  To set that in context Nuclear produces 20% of energy output, Gas 27% and Coal 36%.  Output from fracking is basically zero right now and Cuadrilla estimates it can only access 10-20% of the resource available in some of the fields.   But that would require the Tory base to accept Climate Change, get over the idea that wind turbines are ugly, and in general be different people with open minds.   Theoretically yes. Historic offences are sentenced under the laws in place at the time - that's why sentences for historic child abuse always seem so light - so uniquely he should actually face the death penalty.  I'm sure we wouldn't do that in this case, and given his age and health Canada are unlikely to extradite him in any case - they certainly wouldn't if the death penalty is on the table.         You said:  Yup. I have a source inside Williams it isn't just a new nose shape but an entire new front wing assembly. Let's hope it helps them!  And there definitely isn't a new nose. Which is a pity.   FOM, and by extension the teams, has 5 sources of revenue. The race fees and the TV money represent 50% each of 1.4 billion of a total of 1.8 billion pre-tax revenue.  So, if you want online streaming you're not going to get it from FOM, you're going to get it from your national broadcaster because providing that would require the renegotiation of every TV rights contract in existence.   A centralised streaming solution from FOM would also massively devalue the TV rights, meaning there would be little incentive to provide good programming around the races or pay for expert commentators. Furthermore such a devaluation of the TV rights would result in the teams earning less money each year because the streaming revenue would never match the kind of money broadcasters are willing to pay to repackage the product.   Ooops. Turns out it was a dummy nose for pitstop practice https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/3di1qa/radical_williams_nose_turns_out_to_be_a_dummy/   Perhaps, but this picture turned out to be viral marketing gold. Even you repeated their brand name online - it's all free advertising.   Fans repeatedly say they want cost controls and better safety systems - when the FIA provides that fans criticise the FIA for doing so.  F1 fans are never happy.    [This](http://www.auto123.com/ArtImages/167963/f1-sauber-motorhome-inline.jpg) is Sauber's motorhome, this is [Force India's](http://www.speed-magazin.de/Image/Formel1/Saison2009/Spa/Motorhome_Force-India.jpg). These are not teams struggling with poor facilities and scratching around for two brass farthings to pay the fuel bill.  The lowest paid team on the 2014 grid (Caterham) received just under $60 million, the highest received just over $200 million (Ferrari), the mid point being the $80 million paid to Force India. And before everyone jumps up and down about cost inflation this [2004 economist article](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546), when its numbers are ajusted for [inflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/38iptr/alex_yoong_with_a_2002_minardi_would_be_p4_on/crvfv3x), shows the front of the grid team's budget's have halved and the back of the grid outfit's budget's have remained the same over 11 years.  FOM's prize money distribution amounts to 1.3 billion or 64% of FOM's operating profit before tax and liabilities are accounted for. The bonus payments amounted to $195 million distributed among the top 5 teams making for only 10% of the operating profit.          No. They offered an 'extra' 8bn over inflation spread across 5 years on top of the 2 billion announced last year, which amounts to an additional 2 billion per year. That makes projected *government* spending in 2020 122 billion, problem is we already have planned *NHS* spending for 2020 at 146.4 billion, and the existing deficit is running around 700 million per year so Osborne actually announced an extra 1.3 billion a year in funding.  The overall funding gap (planned spending vs funding) is 30 billion (6 billion per year) between now and 2020 and the NHS is expected to find 22 billion in 'savings' (i.e. cuts) to close that gap over the same period whilst moving to a 7 day a week staffing model and executing the Stevens Report modernisation programme.  Only way to do this is cut wages at all levels while increasing hours.  What Osborne announced was actually less than a third of the money the NHS needs to operate at current service levels whilst Hunt announced a massive increase in mandated staffing hours. Basically it will translate into a real terms cut because even the chancellor admits finding 22 billion in savings is 'challenging' at best.             To be fair its those Barristers that defend the less fortunate. They work damned hard for their money, 14 hour days are the norm, frequently longer.   Many of the lawyers and QCs I've met are certainly elitist swine and offer little respect to those outside their tier of the legal profession, but I'd never say that they didn't deserve what they earn. They work their backsides off in a political environment where everyone really is out to get you, clients included, and achieve very little work/life balance.         ALL of the Terrestrial TV channels have received state funding during their histories doubly so for the local version of the TV broadcasts and Welsh language broadcasts.  Channel 4 content, for example, isn't licence fee funded but its digital switchover costs were, and it has been bailed out by the licence fee payers on two occasions.   There is no need to have a TV licence if you don't watch terrestrial TV. Simples.   Thanks mate, it was 2 years hard work but totally worth it. Its so lovely to see so many new trees on the streets.   Good on you for fighting them!   Thats a very disappointing attitude from Southwark!         She stuck with the plane for a day before realising help was not on the way.   Pictures are amazing so far - and 99% of the data remains on new horizons. Imagine what it might be able to tell us.      I managed to raise 270,000 through a local program to plant 600 new trees in my part of London (450 per tree which includes three years of watering/maintenance). People really do look after them - I've encountered so many people that repair the tree's supporting posts after cars have hit them, water and feed them or tend the soil around them. It makes me very proud of Londoners - so often seen as uncaring.    Thus far they've been unable to find the plane.   'Apex Fallacy' is basically an example of trying to shift the argument and sow doubt, following in the well trodden footsteps of creationism, and as an argument is just about as ignorant as the idea that the Earth is 6000 years old.  MRASJWs would like to *assume* that the feminist concept of patriarchy relies on the idea that all men have the same power as those at the top of a given power structure. It doesn't. In feminist thinking a definition of patriarchy is this:-  Patriarchy is an unjust social system that enforces gender roles and is oppressive to both men and women. It includes any social mechanism that evokes male dominance over women.   Feminism isn't claiming that the men at the top of any given power structure have the same power as all men in that power structure - hence the fundamental idea behind the Apex Fallacy is complete bollocks.  Essentially what you're trying to claim by the use of the term is that feminism's concept of male privilege doesn't acknowledge the suffering of the poor downtrodden men at the bottom of a pyramid of power - who, as they see it, have no power or privilege, therefore there can be no such thing as male privilege or the patriarchy.  The fundamental argument as expressed by Dr. Helen Smith herself in an interview on the topic is this:-  The error in their thinking arises from a collective refusal to acknowledge that the vast majority of male workers toil in the nether regions of our economy. These hordes of men-who make possible feminist lives of leisure-are totally invisible to the harridans who compare women, on aggregate, to the rich and famous alone. Indeed, when judging female progress, juxtaposition is only made with those males at the apex of our status hierarchy. It seems that feminists can discern none but the elite.  Her error in thinking is as obvious as her bias - she is arguing against what *she* sees as the feminist core argument, and her problem is that she doesn't understand that core argument in the slightest. She believes that feminists are elitists and consider only socially powerful men in their thinking and has constructed a nonsense argument against a concept of feminism that she has herself created.  Again this is not the fallacy of composition at all - you would like it to be because that would lend credibility to both your term and argument but it one simply has nothing to do with the other.   Any word on how she's doing?   The Apex fallacy was coined by a Conservative/Libertarian psychologist in order to refute what she sees as feminism's central argument - lack of equality of representation is lack of power.  Its popular among the men's rights idiots because it was coined by a woman who agrees with their twisted perspective on the world hence it being shipped by MRASJW's all over the place.  It is *not* analogous to the fallacy of composition no matter how hard to try to wish it is so.    apex fallacy  More crappy pseudo science from self deluding misogynist fuckwits.    It takes a depraved mind to see this and think, "Now that's an uplifting story!"  Speaking as the owner of that mind (I'm OP)... I thought it uplifting because, after seeing her grandparents die in front of her, a 16 year old had enough self possession to realise help was not on its way and find a way to save herself. It must have been an extraordinarily difficult two days for her.  She's one tough person and that deserves recognition - we should all aspire to such strength of mind when the chips are down.  As an imgurian recently [posted](http://imgur.com/gallery/CnIRq), just be the person Jackie Chan wants you to be.   It surprised me that Steve Fossett was flying with a crash beacon that was known to be unreliable - if an adventurer of his calibre was caught out I do wonder how many more pilots will continue to fly with outdated/unreliable tech.   Considering personal rescue beacons can be bought for [under $300](http://www.flyingmag.com/avionics-gear/pilot-supplies/buyers-guide-personal-locator-beacons?page=0,1), i'd have to agree   I've just submitted my question for the London party leadership hustings:-  Like many members of the party I feel let down by the IndyRef, European, and General Election campaigns. As a party we do not appear to have answers to the big questions facing the country and cannot put up a fight. How will you refocus the party and move us forward?  Because this is how I feel about our policy positions and thus far I'm unconvinced by any of the leadership candidates. Their campaign's seem to be more focussed on party factionalism than any uniting vision for the party much less the country.  What is your question and why?   Easily - they were able to track the last mobile phone signal from the plane but that wasn't enough to pinpoint its location. Without an emergency beacon there would be nothing anyone could do to locate them more precisely. Many planes have one that activates on impact, but either that didn't work or this plane didn't have one.  People have some very fanciful ideas about what phone networks and mobile GPS can achieve in reality.   Pretty impressive feat trekking for so long without proper equipment or food.   Quietly.   She was with her grandparents. Her father didn't know she was travelling with them but that's not particularly unusual. Other relatives were aware of their journey as they [reported them missing](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/crews-search-plane-vanished-family-board-n390921)   Note that things [reported through the 101 service](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/crash-girl-found-with-dead-boyfriend-in-crashed-car-after-police-blunder-loses-fight-.1436692241) become 'lost' all the time - I chair a neighbourhood ward panel and complaints being ignored or lost is the top complaint from our community and every other ward in the borough.   I can easily believe this happened - in fact I've witnessed a similar incident - she's also reported this to the Police which would be a dumb move if its bullshit. The store will also have the whole thing on video.               [Outraging public decency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outraging_public_decency)    I would say that's a fair assessment.   But the point I was making is that, outside of professional degrees, BAs and BSc's are about level of study - training that improves the way you think, interact and communicate.   Economically, for the state and the individual, 90% degrees result in higher lifetime earnings absent the relationship of your degree to profession.   Yep, turns out the main 'Bum' involved was able to [turn his life around](http://www.unilad.co.uk/articles/anybody-remember-rufus-the-stunt-bum-he-looks-a-bit-different-now/), so at least something positive came out of that horror show.   I take your point, but it doesn't matter if its a specifically graduate job or not or if it's aligned to your degree or not. 95% of all degree graduates get a job, the average graduate salary is 31,041 compared to 17,899 for non-graduates even if they are working in non-graduate jobs.  Salaries for every kind of education below degree, including the vocational courses and apprenticeships are much lower. [source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-333261).    Media studies is the single most employable academic subject to study - a 93% employment rate, second only to medicine, thats a better employment rate than that of Engineering or Architecture graduates.   Several things:-  This happened in Liverpool City Centre at 2am, there can't have been a great deal going on because the officers had time to be concerned with what they suspected might be a *minor* drugs offence - a 'crime' that most City Centre Police would ignore because they're there to deal with public order.   The general policy is to avoid all but the most egregious offences in order to keep bodies on the street and keep the custody suite manageable in most *busy* town centres.  An arrest would put both officers back at the station for 4 hours while they dealt with the paperwork and if they were at the end of their shift they would get overtime - this was potentially their goal.  Don't disagree that both the officer and guy in question were being dicks, but the officers interest in such interest in such a common transaction and minor offence makes me very suspicious of their motives. There appears to have been no need to handcuff the chap to ask questions either - although we don't know what physical confrontation went on prior to the removal of the suspects phone.   I don't think the officer had reasonable suspicion to begin with, the officers were just bored and looking for something to do.  Its not unusual for people to give the homeless money and it's a very big stretch for the officers concerned to believe that they were exchanging drugs.   Agreed, but I'm still not certain it won't amount to a real terms cut to an important sector of the economy that could be growing faster.   I'm hoping the new Mayor will do a better job of getting a grip on planning - Boris has allowed a free for all which I don't think is going to be a good thing in the long term.    2% guarantee to defense is good. Our new carriers and procurement programs need more funding not less.  2% is actually a [reduction from the current level](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS) - 2.4% in 2010 down to 2.1% last year.       Have a look at [James Allen's Strategy Report](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/07/analysis-did-strategy-cost-williams-the-chance-of-victory-in-british-gp/)  Merc would still have won the race, but with some better calls Williams should have been on the podium.   Apparently they were told there was a fire at first hence the rush.   Still, I'd wait for the panicked to stampede each other before trying to leave. The safety systems underground are pretty good.      Apparently 1,000 - its been widely reported in other media so I don't believe that this is a case of exaggeration.   Perhaps. They've come a very long way this season on a third of Ferrari's budget - the momentum is clearly with their engineering and aero teams.  Nothing made me happier than seeing the two Williams leapfrog Merc at the British Grand Prix.         Conservatives.         What basis do you have for that belief? (genuinely curious).   Lovely attitude towards the many Type 1, 1.5, and Type 2 Diabetics who have inherited the disease through their genes - doing nothing to deserve this horrible curse.  Many diabetics of all types will tell you that their Diabetes was preceded by a serious viral infection - and there is a weight of scientific research that supports that view.  I wonder if your wholly ignorant attitude will change when Altzheimers Disease turns out to be [Type 3 Diabetes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769828/)?  The overwhelming majority of Diabetics are not, and never have been, overweight. Many Diabetics struggle with their weight after diagnosis because the two main drugs that treat T2, and insulin for T1/1.5's cause weight gain as a side effect..   While there is a correlation between [abdominal central obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_obesity) and Diabetes, it isn't a causative link, and no other types of obesity are linked to the illness. We still don't fully understand the nature of the link just as we don't fully understand Diabetes or [Metabolic Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_syndrome).   There are plenty of fat people who are not diabetic, even in old age, and plenty of thin people who become Diabetic so your hypothesis that Diabetes is the fault of the person, inferring that it is a disease of overeating, is simply false.      If China or Russia were going to intervene, you can bet they've been asked by Greece already, they would have done so by now.    This section of the article refers to the 'fashionable' solution i.e. Williams, RBR, Torro Rosso, McLaren etc all have similar nose designs with a common concept - *most* of the teams are going that way.  The fashionable solution has been the short nose concept, first raced by Williams but subsequently copied by Red Bull and McLaren.  The Lotus/Mercedes solution, much admired, isn't a 'fashionable' or common solution to the current rules across the grid, hence their omission from this particular list.   IMO talk of Manor not racing next year is just overblown cynicism and misunderstands the facts.   The team's losses are down to 4.7 million from over 57 million the previous year while revenue is up to 60 million. The 2014 prize money they are due to receive does not equate to a sensible reason for Stephen Fitzpatrick to fund the team and he has committed to at least 12 months further funding (until June next year). In short they've survived the crisis and can now try and rebuild the team.  They're gaining sponsors, surprisingly Mehri isn't a pay driver, and they had a legitimate shot a points at Silverstone - its going to take at least two years but they're getting there.   Imgur OP is not the same as reddit OP.   Thats awful - I've been bald since I was 21 so I know how it feels.  We were given these black bars of soap for her to wash her head with, and the patches (which were only 9 months old, I don't know if time is a factor), slowly vanished over three months.  If you haven't tried it we would recommend giving it a go - it was a shot in the dark but in the scheme of things it was relatively inexpensive.   The Mercedes short nose appears to be the 'best' solution, followed by the Williams short nose which was copied by RBR and others, the 'nostril' design seems to be a happy medium between the two allowing easy (as in cheap) crash tests and decent aero. Props to FI for coming up with something good looking and inventive!  Bet you'll see Manor/Sauber etc copy the design.                                          The source of the stress had long since vanished, but the alopecia remained. We were told (by western doctors) that once you have it, it's hard to get rid of no matter if the cause has resolved.   I don't wholly disagree - its that the city planners have aggressively pursued landmark buildings that don't disturb the protected views. I don't have a huge problem with the buildings individually - just collectively I'm not sure they add up to 'good'.   Actually a bar of soap (several in fact). Interesting stuff and it worked very quickly too. We were both very skeptical but since everything else had been tried we figured why not.   My only issue is that it ruins the view upriver from the east side of tower bridge - all you can see framed in the bridge is the walkie talkie.   I'm getting concerned that we've gone too far in the pursuit of a distinctive skyline. Between the Gherkin, Cheese Grater, Fan Tower, Shard, Walkie Talkie and the rest I'm beginning to wonder if we can design a simple aesthetically pleasing building anymore. All the new buildings are boring bordering on ugly or completely mad!   The hair treatment (stress related alopecia) my partner got cost 100 + the consultation fee. These places do pretty well and there is a large asian community in Streatham.  The treatment worked, and it was the only treatment that did.   It was part of Mosley's $40 million cost cap - I think engine component was 10$ million or so.  Cue discussion on cost caps: They don't work because any team can form and fund an outside company to develop tech and then sell it to the team for a peppercorn amount - the FIA cannot oversee the teams to the required extent that would prove this is happening or to prevent it happening. See salary caps in any sport.   In fairness to the FIA the problem they're adjusting for is that one set of rules lasts only so long before the teams have extracted the maximum from them and the cars have become so fast that its unsafe.               There isn't anything wrong with radio communications and it's very hard to know whats going on with a modern car without information on whats happening with the tyres. Doing something like this will have three immediate effects:-  - The team *really* will make the cars easier to drive because there is only so much one person can do behind the wheel and you can't make the car work without knowing the tyre temps. - The teams will change the tyre specs to make life easier for the drivers. - The teams will just furnish the information now delivered over the radio in the cockpit displays.  Basically all of this is down to the fact that fans, at last, can hear some of whats happening on the radio (and has been happening since radios went in to F1) and in frustration are using that increased knowledge to draw spurious conclusions.  For the millionth time fans in this sub say the golden eras of F1 are the 80s and 00's and those are periods where the sport was a dictatorship and there were no limits on radio messages. This kind of information being delivered to the drivers isn't new or any kind of problem.   Nothing until Friday morning - expect severe disruption Friday - all the trains will be in the wrong places.   No problem - I hope you make your flight in plenty of time.   Uswitch is little more than fancy classified ads - their top recommendations are paid for promotional spots.   MSE used to be good but the banks and energy companies are manipulating the results using their referral schemes (which is how MSE makes money). Basically they only allow the sites to advertise certain things which limits the possible recommendations.  You rely on the energy company for the data that makes these sites work, but they use estimated billing to inflate the figures which limits the recommended tariffs further.  Look into the business model that underlies this system. It's basically predatory.   My local firm are pretty reliable - they're called Courier Cars 020 8771 3939 - first rule of London cabs applies - always ask the price when booking and never pay the driver more than that unless its a tip.  Battersea cars are closer to you so worth checking the price with them too 020 7978 3300    They usually are - but i will say from where I live in Zone 3 it's 40 for a cab to Heathrow so for safety's sake it might be better booking with a local firm.   Get the 137 Bus to Marble Arch, then the 23 to Paddington and take the Heathrow Express.   The express is a bit pricey so you might find a uber cheaper/less hassle.   You mean robbing from the fee paying public to give to the formerly fee paying public?       The ASLEF, RMT, Unite and TSSA unions are currently planning strike action, affecting Tube services. If this goes ahead, we expect the following:   Wednesday 8 July Tube services will stop running at around 18:00, so please complete any Tube journeys by that time. Services are expected to be exceptionally busy between 16:00 and 18:00. Please travel earlier if you can and allow more time for your journey.   Thursday 9 July There will be no Tube service all day. Extra bus and river services will run. Other public transport and roads will be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours. Please travel outside the peak times if you can.   Friday 10 July There may be some disruption during the morning as services resume.   Staff on the bus network, the DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles are not on strike. There is separate strike action by the RMT on First Great Western services from Thursday 9 July for 48-hours. As always, we advise you to check with your train operator or national rail enquiries. All of these services are expected to be much busier than usual.    Sure, if your direct debit is too high vs your usage that's a different kettle of fish.   Most people, however, will be significantly in credit through the spring and summer to compensate for the autumn and winter quarters when their usage is higher - thats how the present system is designed to work.    They won't give it back because it's actually their money. Basically the price you're paying is on a calendar year estimate and while they charge monthly they bill quarterly - so while you might be in credit for 11 out of 12 months when they bill the last quarter you'll find the credit disappears.   I have done so, the last switch took four months to complete and I'm still being billed by both companies. As a result of the mess I'm also trapped with one supplier.   This is simply nonsense.   Really no - the supposed theory behind utility privatisation was that the companies through being more efficient would yield savings and these would be passed on to the consumer. They would also be pressured by free market competition into providing stable and competitive pricing rather than price gouging - but of course the economies of scale to allow this to happen didn't exist in the market as it was privitised.  In fact what happened is that the privatised companies were conglomerated by large european utility companies into near monopolies and, as there was virtually no real money in the consumer energy market, all became vertically integrated (owning generation as well as supply). They were successful in their efforts to craft legislation that benefited them because as both the supplier and generator the government was utterly beholden to them for a functioning energy market, so there is essentially no competition.  Ultimately privatisation made the government accounts look good for a brief period and the public was instead bilked for more money from its own pocket book rather than the government's. The Tory governments bathed themselves in their smug free market glow - but as usual the public paid nasally - the government still pays for the distribution infrastructure via our taxes, the public pays more than it should for energy.   If only I could do that - considering you're supposed to be able to do this for your phone, TV, energy, water, and all the rest all I'd ever do is negotiate pricing.    I'm an Ovo customer - they offer just the same service as everyone else and just the same poor behaviour.   70% of all consumers, regardless of switching, paid more than they should have - basically the market is dysfunctional and operates to the benefit of the businesses, not the consumers.  In order to obtain the 'best' (whatever that actually means) deal you *have* to move every 12 months and you are entirely reliant on third party meta business for information on what is or isn't the best deal. Those third party businesses don't operate to the benefit of the consumer because their income stream is dependent on referral or product placement fees from the businesses they recommend.  At no stage in any of this is the consumer actually the customer, so the market responds to the needs of government and businesses, not the consumer.  Same problem in the rail industry - government is the customer not the end user.         Very true. On a level though I'm pleased that some kind of effort is underway, for now I'm going to cross my fingers and hope it works.      Beginning in September, about 40 community meetings will be held across Australia, possibly culminating in a national convention. The aim is to reach consensus on precisely how the constitution should be changed, and to agree a question to be put to the electorate in 2017. Even Aboriginal leaders, though, are divided on issues such as whether a clause outlawing racial discrimination should be written into the document.  It would seem so, or at least there is a process in place that will hopefully lead to a referendum securing the double majority needed to change the constitution.  	206
 I could handle ebooks. I prefer a solid book over them, but I didn't get a kindle for nothing. Sometimes it slips me as a medium!    The only reason this is such a huge deal is that my parents are out of state for two weeks. My hands are tied. I wish they could look at the records from the last time I got a card (along with my moms signature on my old card!) and give me a new one, but I guess not.    I have a huge TBR list and a very thin wallet, so the library is my buddy. I haven't gone in a while since I've been in a bit of a slump, but I went to the library and the whole system was different.   I needed a pin to use the computers. I asked what that was about. The librarian scanned my card and looked me up and apparently I wasn't in the system. Okay, maybe it's not scanning correctly? She sends me down to the first floor for a new card. This librarian tells me they don't use those cards anymore and I need a new one. I got that card 10 years ago and my aunt has taken me to another city's library and used her 20 year old card!   Has this happened to anyone else? This is a minor inconvenience to most, but apparently you have to be 18 to get a library card. I'm 17. I can drive a car and hunt animals but I can't be trusted to get a library card to replace my existing one.   I know this is a bit more of a rant than book discussion, but I want to share my feelings with some book lovers that would understand the pain of not having a library card.     I definitely finished the book with very negative feelings. I also feel that I read the book at the wrong time in my life, which took away from me fully enjoying the book and being able to look at Holden from an objective viewpoint.   I also read it for school. Although I disliked it while I read it during the summer, when September came around, along with the teachers analysis, that book got butchered and I ended up liking it less. Maybe I'll give it a second go in a few years.    It's good you got out of that. A minimum wage job is not worth that sort of treatment. Even if the job put you at a temporary loss from the uniform cost, the next job you get will hopefully be a much better environment that pays better as well.    **The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien**  I'm hoping to finally finish this book after starting it over a year ago. I just can't get into it as much as I hoped. I keep setting it down but I'm on the last 30 pages so I'm trying to persevere and move on. I've read other books in between though!    RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers   My store has 3 people on during rushes because we tend to hit 65-70 subs an hour during these rushes. Between rushes we have 2 people working to get the prepping done for the next rush.   There's 3 subways in my town, and the other two have a different owner. Our store has sales, so we're the more popular store.    What did your uniform consist of? $40 is quite a big cost for the uniform. Typically the first apron and hat is free and the first shirt is $10. You could always just work enough hours to get the money for the uniform back.    Honestly, when people say "surprise me!" I go through and confirm every ingredient anyways. You don't know if these people have any food allergies or if they're looking to call and complain about the sub later for free food.   I'd rather play 20 questions than get in trouble for killing a customer.    People are standing in aisles now. It's ridiculous, but it's great! Wisconsin for Bernie!    http://imgur.com/WSRETYB Quick pano of crowd 10 minutes before Bernie   "Hi, my name is ______ and I put in an application ______ ago, and I'm calling to make sure it was received by the manager or store owner."  That's the easiest way to make that call go. You know the store technically 'received' your app, but you don't know if anyone looked at it. This ensures that a manager will know there's an app waiting and if they're hiring, they'll look. If they're not hiring, they'll let you know.    Definitely not. I don't think I would even see a McDonald's employee with a backwards hat. A couple people at my store have tried it, and I correct them because it's horribly unprofessional.    The other night a lady asked for habaneros. So I go for the jalapeos, thinking she mixed them up. No. She wanted banana peppers. Alright. You have fun with those tangy habaneros.    I would do Barcelona and Toledo. I toured ~12 cities in Spain, and Madrid was my least favorite. For shopping it's nice, but it's such a bustling metropolitan area it doesn't make a great vacation.   Barcelona and Toledo are both gorgeous cities.   Toledo has history and sites and little shops on side streets that are fun to go into and restaurants that you're less likely to find in an urban area. While in Toledo, I also got a gorgeous handmade sword. I don't recommend a sword because customs was an absolute pain, but there's also jewelry and smaller blades that are easier to transport. The views in and of Toledo are breathtaking and great photo spots.   Barcelona gives the best of both worlds  with metro shopping areas in the same city as amazing sites to see such as the Sagrada Familia (pictures don't do the inside of it justice! Definitely go on a sunny day) and the Parque Gell. The architecture throughout the city is also just amazing.   I don't entirely hate Madrid. The museums there are amazing, but I would only make Madrid a day trip. The museums don't take too long to tour and there's only so much time you can spend in Parque Retiro.   Honestly, if you're going to be in Spain for a while, don't limit yourself to a couple cities. Get around for some day trips! The aqueducts in Segovia, the university in Salamanca, and the bull fighting museum in Seville were some of my absolute favorite spots outside of Barcelona and Toledo.   Sorry for the lengthy post and any spelling errors, but Spain is such and old and amazing country.    Leave the sandwich on the counter next to the register. Whoever is on register will bag it, or you can do it when you get there. It's possible to bag with gloves, but it's a waste of time if you have other subs to worry about.    When you get the call depends on the store. But if you do get the call for the interview, take it seriously. I've seen many people sit down with my manager in jeans and a tshirt that looked like it hadn't been washed in a week and I never saw them come back. Grey slacks and a white button down was my interview outfit. Professional, but not flashy. Come off friendly, not militant. Subway is all about employees being happy around customers, so show in your interview that you can handle your job without losing your cool. You can google plenty of other interview prep tips that aren't subway specific but you'll still need.   If you land the job, do the online training ASAP! Your coworkers don't want to deal with someone who is asking how to season bread after 3 months of working there. Ask questions here. This subreddit it saturated with experienced employees.    I would consider them okay. Many companies make brass weights. I don't know if brass is safe for long term use, but as long as you got the jewelry from somewhere you can trust, you should be okay.    Company wide change. Scoring was only aesthetic but under trained employees scored improperly and made the bread non functional. There was a thread on this a couple weeks ago.    8 to 6 was definitely my most exciting too! I was stuck at 8 FOREVER! I moved up to 6 on my birthday with no problems. Overall it was a pretty okay day. That stretch was a great start to my day.    I'm hoping to get a watercolor tattoo for my first tattoo, and I want it done right. I'm willing to travel, but not too far.   Anyone know any good artists in the Midwest for watercolor pieces?    I put my visor below my bangs and then pull it up to regular height so it lifts my bangs. I only do this on hotter days since it looks a bit stupid. Ultimately, it gets the job done.    You could make a quiz on quizlet.com with all the formulas, but honestly I found it easier to just jump on meats when we didn't have a rush and ask coworkers questions. They're there to train you. It's their job, let them help you. It'll get easier the more you do it.    Honestly, the enchilada sub is what the customer makes it. It's our messiest sub so I always give out extra napkins and in some cases offer a fork. The sauce always drips, especially if you get flatbread. Adding lettuce into that mix will make it hell. Like many others have said, subs are made right in front of you. If your subs are always a mess, maybe you need to reevaluate the obscene amount of veggies/sauce you get.    Yeah. If the store sells soup, ask for it in a soup cup. People have asked. I know they're not putting all of that sauce on their sub (some do though when they eat in) so i assume they're stashing sauces they can't buy.    Well, the first one is easier to answer. Subway salads are mad with 6 inch portions of meat and footlong portions of veggies. They're actually pretty huge since I usually put enough lettuce to fill the bowl in the cases that people thing olives and lettuce is a salad.   Other than subway, there's gotta be a variant of southwest at just a regular grocery store. Never scoped it out. But we can't sell packages of it to customers. A week ago a guy came in and asked if he could buy 30 pounds of enchilada. Nope :/    Lots of people definitely walk out. Some are okay and want to try something new. Some get mad and start yelling.   My town also has 4 subways within 5-10 minutes of each other so I just refer them elsewhere, even though they're all under a different owner.    Probably a hellish rush combined with the previous shift not doing their job. I've been in the situation where all we have is flatbread.   People like you who understand that sometimes things just go wrong are the best :)    Honestly, I've had people like this. You have to remember that your boss will ultimately value them and their returning wallet more than you and your feelings. These customers will be your problem for 5 minutes maximum. Put on your customer service face for those few minutes and remember that the sooner you just deal with them, the sooner they're gone.   And petty revenge is always a blast. Oh, you wanted mayo? Here's 40 lines right in the hinge. Cut the sub unevenly. Only 6 olives on a footlong. Give them only 1 napkin. Then when they're gone, go in the cooler or freezer and just rant like there's no tomorrow. They're not completely sound proof, but it's better than yelling at customers!    Kaos used to sell 1/4" earskins, but they discontinued them. BAF has some left. I grabbed up a bunch of pairs when I found out.    Maybe have flair be how long the user has been with subway? It would be a bit of an honor system (I've been at subway 200 years!), but it would give posters and lurkers an easier time differentiating the more credible comments an advice.    Yup! But we can only do it with bread that was in the retarder too long. This means it's really hard to work with and looks terrible when it comes out. Very inflated.    With acrylic being a lower quality material, the sizes may not be as regulated as with other materials. I'd recommend digging out a caliper (or gauge card if you're a bodyartforms customer) and measuring them to know which is correct. 8g should be 3mm in diameter.    We don't necessarily do all of the prepping. Most of the prepping is supposed to be done by openers and mid shift. But sometimes those people don't quite do their jobs so closers are stuck prepping, or we have a big rush and run out of lettuce, or ham, or something else. Lately the openers have been slacking and leaving about 4 things prepped for the rush :/   I'd recommend going onto bodyartforms and ordering a few silicone orings and trying those. Some people are allergic to the black nitrile ones. My ears always get a bit irritated from them, so I try to stick to the silicone ones.    The employees won't make too big of a deal about it. Probably ask a manager what to do and you will either get charged the actual price, or get a nice deal.    They even ask when there are people eating in the lobby! Those customers aren't for decoration!    Glass if definitely the best option! Silicon is porous. It'll absorb all of the gunk from hiking and be a pain to clean.   Glass is very easy to clean and hypoallergenic. All it needs is a little water and a soft cloth to clean it off. Hell, I use my tshirt in times of need. Glass is the best material to wear for long term use.    Same thing happened to me just now. I have a feeling the text was edited out or something. I'm on mobile so maybe I'm missing a formatting thing?   Some openers set the dishes up on the baine differently than others. Putting the knives in different spots, they don't like the meatball spoon with holes, etc. Nitpicking you would only expect from a fast food employee.    Luckily I was only in my first week when a lady came in and ordered 100 gift cards! Our general manager was there so she let me know not to try to ring them all in.    I've tried putting the baine back together entirely (no food of course) for the opener in the morning. I've tried leaving it all in back to dry. Gotten told off for it both times. It just depends on your opener. I just leave it in back now since I do those dishes last so they need to dry.    It's definitely hard to get people motivated! They always want to leave early, but sit on their phones their whole shift and leave all their jobs until the last minute! The faster you finish, the faster you're out!    Get as many of your duties done ASAP! As a closer, this is super important.   I think my favorite hack is something that you would need to ask an opener to do. I hate cleaning the metal cambros that catch all the food from the baine. We figured out that the t shirt bags fit nicely in these. When they're nice and clean in the morning, put some of the bags in them. Leave them in all day or change them if needed. Nice and clean.   Prepping is usually the first thing I get out of the way. When that's done, I know I'll be ready for customers and not have to run in back to prep during the rush.   After that I take care of helping my precloser.   The second bread is panned for the next day and frozens are pulled, I start my closing count. It's okay to count everything in back early since nothing is baked after 6 or so.   Another thing I do is condense and clean the baine an hour before close. I get all of the veggies and important meats onto one side of the baine. I clean the baine and forget about it. It's my least favorite job so I would rather get it out of the way ahead of time.   Another one of my favorite little hacks is getting other people to do their job completely. It's the Preclosers job to take out garbage. I make sure they take out all the garbage. It's a bit riskier for a closer to leave the store to take out the garbage late at night. At my store we also have a rule about dishes. You need to clear the sinks before your shift ends. I make sure others do that or I get stuck with a huge pile of dishes.  There's probably much more, I love finding ways to make my job easier, but that's all I can think of for now.    Thank you! It's good to find out that I didn't destroy it! It really worried me because it never did this any other time I washed it.    I tried it on all my brushes and nothing but makeup ran out! This was a bit of relief. It would have been terrible if all of my brushes were ruined.    I picked up the Ulta brush and sponge cleanser and tonight I tried it out. The first think I cleaned was my beauty blender. I've been washing it before with just some foaming Dial soap. So I get it soaked and spritz some of the cleanser on. I start lathering it in and pink starts splashing on the sink! I panic and rinse my beauty blender and the water started running pink!   My beauty blender seems okay now, just a couple pale spots. I don't know how this effects the integrity of the sponge. The cleanser says it works by dissolving makeup so I worried my sponge was dissolving.   Has anybody else had this problem? It doesn't seem like something that's supposed to happen!    If it's a dollar or two that they actively tip me, I definitely say thank you. If it's their 13 change, I ignore it. They threw it in the tip jar because they didn't want it, not because they thought I should have it.    I love when they end up just putting everything back and asking for water. Makes me wonder if they can read or need glasses.    Always. Especially after the new menu boards came out. People come in and order 4 footlongs and ask me why their total is $35! Sorry, I gave you your receipt and the prices are right in front of you. I figure if anyone really wants to fight me on the prices, I can direct them to the 800 number that's likely somewhere on the receipt.    This works for any store that doesn't carry pizzas. We carry pizzas and therefore pizza boxes, so we're still stuck with flatizzas.    Thanks!   I ordered online from Ulta to get the free gift bag. Everything was in great condition!...except the brush cleaner. As I was opening the bag, I noticed that the brush cleaner had leaked! I don't want to go through the hassle of returning the package and waiting for it to be shipped out again if it's not necessary.   Can I take the product into an Ulta store with the receipt and have it exchanged? It's pretty cold here in wisconsin, so the bottle or cap probably cracked during shipping.    I was in that spot last night. No customers either! There's a point in the night where you could leave and it wouldn't matter.    Me too! It's my favorite scent but I can't find it anywhere, so I've been carefully rationing it for special events.    I found a pair on plugclub.com that I was planning on going with, since I don't know how well the goo would go with the acrylic.   I didn't even think of a tree stash! Mine will only be in 2g, so it wouldn't hold near enough to have any fun. I'm sure the larger lobed members here would have a good shot at it though :)   It's definitely one of the most important things I've learned at subway.   And when all else fails, go scream in the cooler. Shits almost soundproof.    Yup!!   I've been looking into getting a pair of steel stash plugs. I was wondering if I could keep some spare holey buttr in them. Anybody done this? It would be nice to have some on me without carrying the tin.    You probably won't lose it or have to take it out, but you may find that you don't like the look of it once you're at your goal size. I watch a YouTuber who is at 2 inches and took out other love piercings simply because she found her ears a bit cluttered.    I have never thought about this and honestly, it's a bit terrifying. Maybe because I just thought of wearing my bunny as a slipper! This is truly a horrifying aspect of transfiguration that I would like to see a comforting fact/headcanon for. I'm not vegan or anything, but this makes me want to ban transfiguration with animals!    First, NONSLIP SHOES! I don't know if your store will require them or not, but they will save your life so much. Subway is a slippery store.   Try to actually learn something in the online training. Some people just run through it then don't know what they're doing.   Make sure you're great at biting your tongue. That customer doesn't want that tomato? Fine. Just give them another slice. Some of the people that come in to subway are super picky, especially since the food is made right in front of them. These people will only be in your life for a couple minutes.   If you work in a busy store, be ready to be moving all the time! Don't rest until everything is done. I'm a closer and I bust ass to make sure I have everything prepped, cleaned, and done at least an hour before close so I have time for any emergencies and to sit on my phone.   Don't be afraid to ask other employees for help. We've all been there. Hell, for my first three weeks I was making flatbread subs inside out! If someone corrects you on something and you know they know what they're doing, correct it. I have a couple people at my store who regardless of correction will continue doing everything wrong.   That's all I can think of right now. I love helping and training new employees. They're fun.    I just bought this online! I hope the blush and shadows work well. Those are the main reason spent $20 on stuff I kinda needed but could have gotten from another brand.    This is somewhat encouraging! I have some pretty non-stretchy ears, so my goal size is only 2g. However, my ideal goal size is 5/8". Unfortunately, my ears aren't stretchy, they're pretty thin, and I was pierced crooked with a gun.   Since I'm currently stretching my seconds (problems with firsts), I might eventually consider getting my firsts re pierced with the intent to stretch and I might just get up to my true goal!    They're a store option, so you either have a store that has taken them off the menu or a store with employees that can't be bothered. I'm know I'm guilty of simply telling a customer were out of crusts if it's almost close and I have better things to do than make a flatizza, but the crust is literally baked flatbread. Any store can make it as long as they also carry meatballs (this means marinara sauce) and flatbread. Not all stores will have the register button though.    UW Madison is definitely a great school. Its competitive to get in, although not as competitive as Harvard.   As for the campus, it's big and it's beautiful. I don't attend and haven't gone on an official tour, but I've been to the campus and it's great.   The user above me has some great links you should definitely check out. Also check out the school's website! It will have everything you'll want to know about program quality and campus life.    Definitely MSU. I'm not a fan of the partying down in Arizona (cousin is a student there and it's all he does), and I'm a Midwest kid so Id miss my snow.    My coach starts you with your target on the second arrow. Where you stand is a pretty individual thing and something you can play around with. Some stand at 15, some stand at 20.   Second arrow is the most common target I've seen, but you might find that it doesn't work for you. I found that I just couldn't use a target that far down the lane without wanting to loft the ball, so I use the third dot.     On the PSAT, you're penalized 1/4 of a point for a wrong answer and 1 point for a blank answer. I assume the SAT has similar scoring.    Pick up ACT for dummies! I'm taking a prep course at my high school in a couple weeks, and the book was one of the materials given for the class. We were also given a practice math packet. I think the book is around $20, but IIRC, it has some practice sections and it's thorough on explanations.   For math, there are probably lots of practice questions laying around the Internet with explanations on how to solve. My precalc teacher gives out practice ACT questions every week, with difficulties ranging from scoring at 12 to scoring at 34.    Easiest way to tell if your thumb is swollen is how it fits your thumb. Your thumb should fit the hole well and be snug, but it shouldn't take any effort to put your thumb in and out of the ball. Make sure you do this test with a straight thumb. Try pushing your thumb nail against the ball when you're in the ball if you're not sure if it's straight.   If you're struggling a bit to get out of the ball, your thumb might be swollen. There are a couple solutions I've found to work best.   First solution is low effort and sketchy effectiveness. My thumb and fingers swell a lot after a couple games, so I keep my hand above my heart to lower the blood flow. I'm short so I can do this by resting my elbow on the score screen at the table and keeping my hand up. Tape is also your best friend. Vise hada patches in blue are my favorite.   The second solution is a bit more pricey, but will be a bit easier in the long run. You could get interchangeable thumb slugs. Get one measured for when your thumb is fitting in your ball just fine and when it's swollen. I haven't seen these around too much where I bowl, but it's a pretty conventional place there.    You get what you pay for with balls. I've seen pyramid balls go as low as $30. IIRC, some have a plastic coverstock, which is the same as a house ball. Unless you want to research like hell and buy online (which won't save you much money because you'll be charged for drilling anyways unless you're on a league), talk to your proshop guy. They should set you up with something that's beginner level reactive and a good fit to your bowling style. Once you have a solid main ball, you can pick up a cheap plastic one as a spare ball. If anything, your proshop might have some used Storm laying around that you could get at a super low price since.   I bought the cheapest shoes that had purple flames on them, so I'll let someone else advise you on show choices. The brand is Etonic. They're sold in my proshop, but they're not the best. Very entry level.   Proshop guy is god around here when it comes to ball selection, and there's a reason for that.     Local B M has some jolly rancher flavored juice, but it's a more strawberry/watermelon flavor.   Anybody know of a good recipe for cherry jolly rancher? Or at least some flavors that might work to make it?    Those are the only real chicken nuggets. Eating the whole bag in a day is the way to go.    Thanks. I expected it right from the first game and forward. We were also missing a varsity player and kept swapping out JV players to cover.  We've gone to state before, so next year will hopefully be another trip!    My team completely flopped out of going to state.   Sectionals were at 8 am on an unfamiliar lane pattern. I blame that entirely. It was a long pattern with virtually no backend, so my ball was hooking as well as a house ball.    How exactly did you do the subway university classes before you were hired? You need your owner to register you as an employee and give you your login to complete it.   As for the W2 thing, there has to be some type of legal thing against them withholding it. That's absolutely ridiculous.    No options for those of us that don't vape!   My parents and friends vape and the devices are actually really interesting, so I stick around, but I don't even own my own setup.    In all honesty, everyone here freaks out way too much about acrylic.   I agree COMPLETELY with acrylic being a huge nono is a fresh piercing/stretch. Wearing it for prolonged periods is also bad.   If you wear acrylic plugs in a completely healthy and healed stretch for a few hours, your ears will not fall off. If you find that you have a reaction, then it's best to avoid it.   No, acrylic is not the best jewelry and isn't safe to wear for a long time, but if your ears are completely healed and you pop some in for a few hours, you will likely be fine.   Stretching is one of those hobbies you should only take up if you're willing to go for quality. Keep glass/stone/titanium/etc as your main jewelry. Glass is just as cheap as acrylic if you get it online, so price is hardly a factor when it comes to quality products.   Paying an extra dollar or two for glass is surely easier than dealing with a reaction from extended acrylic wear.    I have a certain mechanical pencil that I only use on assessments. It's been with me for 4 years and is beaten to shit, but it's never let me down on functionality and i never worry about filling in the wrong bubble on accident. I can't even fathom filling a scantron sheet with a different pencil.   It's probably more of a consistency thing than a good luck charm. My most effective good luck charm is doing homework to the fullest and occasionally glancing at the textbook. But all that's boring. So the pencil works.    Carmen lip conditioner. It's super light (almost like lip lotion) and absorbs right away! Great moisturizing ability without making your lips feel gooey/waxy. It also has a light mint/sugar taste.    Nope. Our owner doesn't want more than one closer.    I make $7.50 as a closer in Wisconsin. I'm 17, but I've been working at subway about a year now.    The stores in my area don't train on putting the code in or anything. We are just told to give the cookie and put the receipt in the receipt envelope. And in all honesty, I won't fight with a customer over a cookie.    Before doing something extreme, like a sarge Easter, there are little things you can do during your release that might help. I had some ring finger problems too, since I was relying on my ring finger to pull the hook. I ended up having a pretty constantly sore finger and tore open a blister on that finger. I worked on adjusting my release to using my middle finger as the main force in my hook and letting my ring finger just pop out. I already have a callous on my middle finger from writing, so it doesn't hurt at all. The joint pain also stopped since my middle finger is a bit stronger.   Another solution would be to talk to your pro shop guy and have the pitch, span, and grips checked for a good fit. Your ring joint is likely a little shorter(?) than your middle joint, so one will be drilled closer to the thumb hole than the other. If your ring finger was drilled the same distance from your thumb as your middle finger, you might be straining your joint through the whole release.   I hope I helped somewhat, albeit I did ramble a bit. I do feel your pain with ring finger problems. I was tempted to pick up a cheap ball off craigslist and have it sarge Easter drilled to see if that would fix all of my problems!    Some stores (mine included) have yet to actually start using points, or even training employees on them. They're not necessarily adding new rules, they just didn't know the full list to begin with.   Also, the lowest point prize is 10 points gets you a cookie and you earn 1 point on every dollar spent. That's a $10 cookie. Doing the survey on your receipt (or even faking the code) costs a lot less.    You've been accepted into the itty bitty lobe committee! We have the most irritatingly small wearables and it makes jewelry purchasing a pain in the ass.   If BAF is out, you're likely out of luck. You might be able to find something on eBay. I think silicone can be autoclaved, but I'm not a professional. You could also go on a piercing shop hunt and try to track someone down who still has kaos stock in that size.   As for the tunnels, anatometal custom orders are pretty easy, albeit a bit pricey and lengthy depending on what you order. BAF has a great filter which includes wearable area IIRC so definitely put that to work!   When I found out that kaos stopped the 1/4" wearable and BAF bought the stock, I blew $80 so that I would have earskins that fit. They actually pop out in my sleep if they're too long! They're not fashionable either.    I second this. A color code system with post it flags and an old fashioned piece of paper for elaboration. If you're going to do this, I find the actual plastic post it flags much easier to use than the paper post its. The paper ones stick to the pages a lot more and sometimes curl them.    Head to YouTube and look up ACDC Econ. Amazing videos on macro, micro, and regular Econ concepts. Definitely got me through my final!    At this point, it's what you want to take, then. Stats will still be there in college. It's okay to put it off to take a class you want to take. If you want to take international relations and think you'll enjoy it more than AP stats, go for it. If you would rather take stats now, look at the course catalogs for the college you're thinking of. Do they offer an international relations course?    Definitely screws on. The flares are just a bit too big to be double flare, and usually that style of plug screws on.   The size? Looks like about 2g, give or take a size.   	92
 Looks like /u/filmfanatic5 won the race to get this one!   Are Aston Martin actually releasing any version of the DB10 or is it purely for this film?   I believe it is an original plot based on a lot of Fleming's storylines. Spectre (the organisation) is certainly a Fleming creation, nothing about the plot looks familiar thus far though   Perfect trailer, giving away barely anything about plot, I can only guess what it's going to be about, but still getting me excited as fuck to see it! So far I'm thinking this has enough going for it to be the crown in Craig's career   So a discussion arose between me and a friend about what great movies have been made with next to no budget. Would be interested to know your views reddit!   That's no squid...it's a space station   With all this detail of how the flash and shock wave were witnessed tens or hundreds of miles away I can't help thinking: how insane would this test have looked from space!   I've been looking particularly at foreign language films that have not been remade, particularly french horror, would love to know what this communities thoughts were!   Greetings fellow Wellingtinians, how's it going? I've recently taken possession of rather lovely 4x4 and was wondering if any of you fine people knew of any halfway decent off-road driving around the Wellington end of the island? Any tips would be gratefully received! Cheers!   The obvious reading material for you would be 'Covering Islam' by Edward Said, very informative and comprehensive guide to Islams core beliefs and place in the political world. I think you would find it interesting         "Vote for me and I will make things better for the working classes"   This is what I hope will be the case, as it currently has standard road tires but I want to put larger off-road tires, ideally without changing the rims   Greetings fellow Wrangloids. So I have recently become the proud owner of an awesome new bad-ass mobile, it is in desperate need of new tyres though as they are as bald as a....well you see where I'm going with this!  My question is this: how can i find out what dimension of tyres I can get. I want to get some nice big dirty off-road muddies on there, I am unsure if they will fit the wheels though. My model is a 1997 Wrangler TJ Sport 4.0 with standard wheels but can't find anywhere any information on what tyres will fit them. Is it necessary to fit new rims also? I realise obviously this depends what tyres I want to put on there, I need to know the size of the wheels before I start shopping though. Any advice would be gratefully received!   Edit: Forgot to mention, the Mobile Command Unit has a 2" suspension lift, so it will be able to fit larger tyres no problem   I hear you only invented chocolate to get at the kids?   Piggybacking this questions to ask my own: is it possible to drive Red Rocks or would I just get in the way of people walking? I recently acquired a very fetching 4x4, want to stretch it's legs with a little off-roading. If not Red Rocks, does anyone know of any other off-road tracks open to the public?   One fact that I have been unable to ascertain is where exactly was Courtney Love at the time of Cobain's death? I am assuming she wasn't anywhere close by as it took days for Cobain's body to be discovered and she hired a private detective to find him, otherwise no one seems to be very clear on this point   I really did think that last bit of thunder was an explosion! I'm in Petone and it must have been right overhead, never heard thunder like that before! It set off every car alarm on my street and I'm surprised my windows didn't shatter!   I'm watching in Thailand. It's free here   In 'Interstellar' when they leave Earth it take the full mite of a Saturn V rocket to get them out of the gravity well and into LEO. However, when they reach Miller's planet, which has much stronger gravity and therefore a much deeper gravity well, they blast off into space using nothing more than a landing craft with relative ease! Also, seeing how a year on Miller's planet is approximately 61,000 Earth years, how did they logically think going there was a good idea?  They took such care to be scientifically accurate and forgot common sense. Otherwise great film!   You may be interested in the film 'Mirrors', it deals with a similar premise. Altho I should add a disclaimer that if you plan on sleeping ever again for the love of God don't watch that film!!   I just bought a Bestop Trektop NX for my '97 TJ. I would highly recommend it, it was quite difficult to get on but is a vast improvement on my old hard top. What is unusual about it is, though it is a soft top, I noticed no distinct increase in road noise (most soft tops become deafening at speed). I can drive down at top speed and still easily hold a conversation or listen to my music. The fit is great and, most important, it looks badass as hell!   Was the study conducted by Buddhists?   Can anyone give any background to the logo on the ring? It seems familiar but I'm no Bond expect, is it a reference to an early Bond movie?   New to the Wellington 'scene', always loved the open mic nights where I'm from though. Doesn't have to be music either, some of the best open mic's I ever saw were comedy or poetry evenings! As I'm a newby a guide would be probably be most welcome as well!   I'm also from New Zealand, Wellington to be exact! How do I find out if it's coming anywhere near me, and how do I go about booking my 15 minutes?      I've just had an amazing idea for a prank, brb!   [Another view](http://i.imgur.com/Abhs9Hq.jpeg)      "*Pretend to be sober, pretend to be sober, you've got this, pretend to be sober.....*"   All good advice, cheers! :)   Been practicing parallel parking! Bound to come up!   I will be taking the test in my Jeep, which is about as likely to skid as it is to turn into Optimus Prime. If I did a cheeky role would that impress the instructor though? Man I wish my car could turn into Optimus Prime...   Right little ray of sunshine aren't you! I look good in sunglasses to, so I also have a back-up plan incase I'm blinded in a crash! It's all about the silver linings people!   So I'm taking my restricted driving test in Kilbernie on Tuesday. Does anyone have any tips or general advice? Anything would be much appreciated! Many thanks in advance   Sorry boys and girls, but this is a video of a man named Bob Heironimus in an ape suit. Look at it's feet! It's clearly wearing some kind of padded slippers!   Ali (2001) only has a rating on IMDb of 6.7, however I find it to be one of the best biopics made in years and easily on par with modern blockbusters and even superior to some in terms of storytelling an drama. An all-time favourite.   There are more domestic Tigers in Texas right now than there are left in the wild. Your crazy idea is already part of the world we occupy. They aren't super friendly tho, you can take the tiger out of the wild, but not the wild out of the tiger   Another one?!!   Yeah, you're friend is so fired!      [Here is the best I could find](http://musescore.com/user/888676/scores/428831), I haven't tried it yet so let me know how it sounds!   Certainly. The Saturn V rocket was, at the time, the most complex and expensive object ever created or even dreamed of by man. NASA built 15 of them (in various forms), costing billions upon billions. Even had a Saturn V never flown, the rocket is undoubtably able to take off from Earth with a specific payload and land on the moon, it was its entire purpose. Would NASA (and ergo the U.S. Government) spend billions in developing and building these most complex machines ever devised, simply to not use it in an elaborate hoax? I think not. A total of 9 Saturn V rockets, carrying three astronauts each took off from Earth and travelled to the moon, this much is indisputable, millions watched each launch, and if the command modules didn't leave Low Earth Orbit then where do they go? Hide behind a cloud? Remember, the soviets were monitoring Americas moon mission and were aware the Americans were leaving LEO.  Next evidence is what the astronauts left on the moon. Using extremely powerful telescopes and satellites the Apollo landing sites are visible, each has been photographed, some being so clear as to show the astronauts footprints and even the trails from the lunar rover. I'm using a mobile device so can't link, but a Google search will find the pictures. Also Apollo 11 left two key instruments on the moon, the first being a seismic meter used to measure activity on the moon (which was used to register key impacts on the moon from artificial objects and meteors). The other were large mirrors which, when a lazar is directed at, measures extremely accurately the distance from the earth to the moon. With the right equipment anyone can perform this experiment thanks to the equipment left on the lunar surface.  Don't forget also that each successful moon landing didn't leave empty-handed. A great deal of samples were returned to Earth, greatly increasing our knowledge and understanding of the moons origins.  Also, space travel was and is an exceptionally dangerous endeavour. Right at the outset 3 Americans, the crew or Apollo 1, lost their lives in a launchpad fire. The crew of Apollo 13 came a hairs breadth from total calamity, 2 space shuttle crews have been lost since the Apollo era. Would men risk and lose their lives for a hoax to achieve a vague "up yours" to the soviets?  Finally, a rough estimate tells us that approximately half a million people were involved in some level in landing men on the moon. If the landings were faked, that is a lot of people to swear to silence...  These are just samples of evidence for the moon landings, arguments proving we went can fill books, and have!    The 'we never landed on the moon' conspiracies baffle me, because it is just so painfully obvious we did! What is more, the moon landings are probably one of the greatest achievements humanity has ever accomplished, they should be celebrated not derided.    An entirely valid opinion, but we are talking about far too many files, it's in the thousands. Would take waaaay to long to convert the lot of them. Just installed MPlayerX and its working a charm, still having the 'one interface open at a time' problem however!   I didn't like the most recent OSX offerings so have been using Snow Leopard since 2009, which I still say is the best OS Apple ever released. I felt I needed to join the rest of you in this decade however and recently upgraded to Yosemite.   Thanks for the tip! Downloading now... I'll report back   The problem isn't the number of windows, its that Quicktime won't play any of my video files anymore, as most of them are AVI files   Greetings fellow Mac users! So here's my story, I recently installed Yosemite, and now Quicktime is refusing to play any AVI files, which is most of my video library. I googled, installed Flip4Mac which is a plugin for Quicktime I was informed would make it work, still no joy! As an interim measure I'm playing all my videos through VLC player but, as VLC can only keep open one window at a time, this doesn't solve my problem. Fellow Machiavellians, help me!!!    Mammals, not whales. Humans and Orcas are the only species of mammals that experience menopause. Technically they're not whales.   Hold on. Just grit your teeth, close your eyes if you have to, shed a tear if you need to, but hold on, and don't stop.    Claiming anything is the best of the year on January 10th is a bold statement!   Bucking against censorship is taking a stand for free speech. By all means allow good, practicing and peaceful Muslims to abstain from depicting their profit, or any human depiction, but by no means should they or we expect or accept followers of other faiths or non-believers to be bound by their rules. The fight against censorship, be it at a huge scale level such as censorship of the press, or a macro level such as an anonymous redditor, is something that affects us all.  So yes, this is a good thing. Yes, it is important to stand against censorship, and to declare yourself apposed to intimidation.   Some people don't know of the Blues Brothers??   Fun fact: those black marks aren't floating debris in the mist or marks on the camera lens, they are in fact colossal Sunspots, tens of thousands of miles across. If you look at any other picture of the Sun taken recently you will see the same dark spots   "Lord of the Fucking Rings" sounds like an entirely different and probably lower budget movie   Good feedback, thank you   I have reconfigured my server use so I am now using the EU server as my primary and the general and US servers as my backups. I am testing it now, hopefully this will decrease my failed download incidents. Thank you for your advice!   Thank you very much for your advice, I intend to take you up on it, along with the advice from others in this thread.    Greetings fellow Usenet subscribers. For the last few years or so I have been using Astraweb (via SABnzbd+) and have always been happy with it. Lately however it seems almost all my downloads are failing to repair, far more than what might be considered usual. Is anyone else suffering from similar issues with Astraweb or SAB? Any helpful tips or pointers for this situation?  Many thanks in advance   **Filth**, watched it this week. Would absolutely recommend it to any fans of dark humour indie films, or anyone who loves a more cerebral approach to a cop flick.   It has that lovely dark-comic feel about it that can only be found (at least by me) in Scottish or Irish independant films (examples springing to mind being '*In Bruges*, *The Guard*, *Calvary* and so on) that I myself love.    I'm not sure how to go about doing that, is their a how-to guide for uploading to dropbox?   This is Ptichka   In fairness, *this* Shuttle in the picture was never flown or completed, and essentially was only ever a shell. The Buran was obviously an extremely advanced orbiter, being the only Shuttle ever to launch and return to Earth successfully in an unmanned mission. The Shuttle in the picture however is Ptichka, which was only externally completed, never receiving the complex cockpit electronics as the program was cancelled before it could be completed of flown.   Pedantic point of detail: This is not abandoned in Russia. It's abandoned in Kazakhstan    It is worth pointing out that this is not "THE" Soviet Shuttle Buran. This is the second shuttle, known as 'Ptichka' that was never complete or flown. Only one Soviet Shuttle was ever fully completed and launch, the Buran which was the first and only Shuttle ever to be flown into space and land successfully in an unmanned mission. The Ptichka was never completed, being only ever approximately 95% complete   Thank you so much, I love it! :)   Thank you! You seemed to have got a lot of the detail back in this, great! :)   Fantastic, the colour is great in this! Thank you so much!   Er, is the top post on Reddit really of a man playing a Gameboy and a woman reading a book? This is the most interesting thing on the Internet today? Guess I'll go outside!      I have a pair (use them for work, I'm a Sound Tech) and can confirm they are worth every cent   As far as I am aware it is for sanitary reasons, the logic being that to cremate a person with an extremely infectious disease such as Leprosy runs the risk of the disease becoming airborn and a hazard to those working in the Burning Ghats. Of course the logic is flawed as to weigh the body and sink it becomes a hazard just as much for bathers and those further down the river.   Interestingly, he was one of the very few to be saved from the water. He survived by losing on a floating door, which gave James Cameron some inspiration. When he was rescued by Lowe (the only officer to attempt to rescue anyone from the water) Lowe was scathing, saying there were people more worth saving than a Jap.   Source: Rough Guide to Titanic p.124 (highly recommended)   The Ganges is one of, if not the, most polluted rivers in the world. Anyone who has been to Varinasi and seen the Burning Ghats can testify to that. Bodies, thousands every day, are burned by the river with tons of human remains going into the water. Varinasi is considered a holy place to die in Hinduism, meaning hospices along the river are full to bursting with sufferers of disease or fatal injury. Leprosy is particularly prevalent. To their credit the Hindus will not cremate those who have died from infectious disease, instead the are weighed down, along with children who have died below a certain age and therefor cannot be cremated and holy animals like cows or Cobras, and sunk into the Ganges. All this happens within feet of bathers.  The Ganges is horrifically polluted and to come within contact with it in Varinasi is to take a very serious risk. Thousands do it, and thousands become seriously ill. When I was there I learned of a hotel that had been washing it's plates in tap water from the Ganges, resulting in several guests becoming extremely ill and requiring repatriation. A lot is made of its unusual qualities and so on, this however is a collage of myth and legend. Besides which, with water as polluted and rife with human and animal remains as well as industrial and chemical pollution as this, you would expect it show something unusual when examined.   TL:DR - don't buy into the hype. You wouldn't want to touch a drop of the Ganges with your worst enemies finger.   Ah man, the trailer gave away the big plot twist!   Just PM me your bank account details, just to prove I can trust you, then I will send you a copy.    Being intellectually disabled or having a low IQ is the very definition of stupidity.    Scarborough Castle, being situated in the North, was not affected by the Blitz at all. No German Bomb fell on Scarborough through WWII, it was to Northern and trivial to be targeted. You may be confusing the Blitz, which was in WWII, with Scarborough being shelled by German Warships in WWI, when the castle was damaged by the raid.      Stephen King said this, not the Joker   I'm pretty sure the trailer gave away all the spoilers anyway   First half of the trailer - Excellent trailer work, plenty to capture the audiences interest, masterfully executed.  Second half of the trailer - Never mind actually going to see it, here's the plot in full.   This comment thread is going to be a karma orgy   And people from Hamburg should be Hamburgers!    No, because "Fuck the English" is an unstable premise on which to build a government   The shortcut through the Corn field  tempts you as you're walking home,  the clouds above keep the moon concealed  as you enter the swaying corn, alone.   -  The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,  the path you chose is muddy,  it grows in rows without scope or end  and in the dark, you hurry.   -  You don't see the standing forms  as you pass them on your way,  they stand still amongst the swaying corn  which hides their pallor, and decay.   -  Hundreds gather in this field tonight  though you see none at all,  yet still you look around in fright  but the corn grows too thick, too tall.   -  You tell yourself as you continue through  "It's merely the rustling of the leaves,"  but they see you, and they hear you,  And they might not let you leave.   Don't be a cunt   "Because it's there."      Why do people keep becoming US Citizens?! Watch the freaking news!!   Hi fellow Wellingtonites, I thought I would be a good plan to open up a Wellington On A Plate/Burger Wellington discussion thread to recommend and give feedback! Bon Appetit!   This is the most environmental friendly possible way to dispose of bodies, and is seen as spiritually wholesome by many. Not /WTF at all, once you stop to consider it   [Whale Shark.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark)            99% of Tom Cruise films   The more attention this comment gets, it becomes statistically more and more likely that it will be read by both yourself and a person you will one day fall in love with, but you haven't met yet. You might not meet for years, long after you both happened to read this comment. So smile, you are sharing a moment with someone special to you :)   For varieties sake, here is a less sentimental poem that I still love:   -  The shortcut through the Corn field  tempts you as you're walking home  the clouds above keep the moon concealed  As you enter the swaying corn, alone.   -  The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,  the path you chose is muddy  it grows in rows without scope or end  and in the dark, you hurry   -  You don't see the standing forms  As you pass them on your way  they stand still amongst the swaying corn  which hides their pallor, and decay   -  hundreds gather in this field tonight  though you see none at all  yet still you look around in fright  but the corn grows too thick, too tall   -  You tell yourself as you continue through  "Its merely the rustling of the leaves,"  But they see you, and they hear you,  And they might not let you leave.   -   It's not a competition. There is no moral high ground.   I hate you for making me laugh at that   Won't be able to make it Sunday, will be there next time though!      4 camera lenses and no clothes, because logic.   Pokhara!!    Silly person      A little background: Bart Sibrel (the atomic fart-stain stupid enough to think we never landed on the moon) lured Buzz Aldrin to the Beverly Hills Hotel under the false pretence that Buzz was going to give an interview for a Japanese kids show about Space. No charges were filed against either party as it was clear to all that Buzz had been extremely provoked.   Recommend any particular essays of his?   A movie that I think deserves more acclaim than it received is the biopic film 'Ali'. In particular the closing scene, depicting 'The Rumble in The Jungle' boxing match between Ali and Foreman, in particular the seminal 8th round. The direction is superb, each cut to a new angle progressing the narrative: from Ali seeming to cower behind his gloves to the sudden fury that sent Foreman to the canvas, all the while subtly hinting to early scenes and Ali's early presence in the ring. As a whole the film is fairly good and Smith did a fantastic job of depicting Ali, but the last scene really does stand out in my mind of one of the most complete closing acts to any film I have seen.   We never went to the moon. Everyone else seems to have bought into the lie nah just kidding, can you imagine! Guys, if you don't believe we went to the moon you are almost impressively silly!   ITT: A feminist's nightmare. Lots of women worrying about their weight/clothes/boyfriends. Somewhere Jodie Foster is weeping.   The idea of something being too large to photograph is utterly absurd. [It is simply a matter of perspective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot)   I know there is an archery scene/club in Plimmerton as I often see them shooting and there are a few permanent targets there. Sorry I don't know more about it, I just know it's there!   I still can't get my head around it, this is Mars! *Mars*! This is literally an entirely different planet, separate and distinct from all of humanity and indeed anything any living thing on Earth has ever known!   Knowing what it would look like to stand on another planet was entirely and completely out of the question for every generation of humanity until this one. Truly this is a colossal achievement, and an easy contender for the greatest of all miserly humanity has ever accomplished.   How much for the banana skin?   Greetings fellow Wellingtonians! I find myself in urgent need of a Kapiti based hairdressers, could anyone recommend somewhere good?   Credit to Bernard Manning for this joke   "*Play it fucking loud!*" - Dylan, after being heckled as 'Judas' when plugging in his electric guitar    Jellyfish Lake - Palau ('Ongeim'l Tketau' in local language.)   This is a powerful commemoration. Also moving to see Russian names included in the list, including Yuri Gagarin himself, along with the American names. I think I am right in saying most of these names are those of test pilots, as well as the crew of Apollo 1.   The curse of humanity: Those who shouldn't be having kids have the most, those who should have the least.      "*Ho Ho Ho*"   "*What knot did you tie Bordon?*"   Where exactly does one sell a gallon of crab blood?   They date back to 1983 when *they* first came to Wellington. At first we Wellingtonites accepted them and there was peace, gradually however our armistice broke down and there was conflict on the streets. We eventually won, but there had been so much conflict and bloodshed it was decided that all those who had fort against *them* in the great battle for Wellington should have there memory erased and that the city would be rebuilt to how it looked when *they* first arrived in 1983, and so it was that normality returned to our sleepy capitol. These markings on the ground were part of *their* escape plan, every time one of *them* was taken up the resulting radiation left these strange markings on the ground forevermore. Also, this gap in time is why Wellington seems so behind the times compared to other fast-paced, busy capital cities, and why the mullet is still alive and well only in our, again peaceful, corner of the world.   I love the part where it was a gif with cats in it!   'well here's another fine mess you've gotten me into!"   According to the investigation the force of the Crew Cabin's impact with the sea masked much of the evidence of what actually happened inside the cockpit after the shuttle broke up, however they were able to ascertain that *at least* 3 of the 7 crew members were breathing for the entire descent and Pilot Mike Smith was almost certainly conscious after the shuttle break up as many switches and dials on the control panel were out of position from where they should have been, lending to the hypothesis that the cabin remained pressurised and Pilot Smith was attempting to restore power as the Crew Cabin fell. It is impossible to ever know for sure what happened, but there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the title is accurate.   It most certainly could have been prevented. The break-up was caused by a faulty O-ring on one of Challenger's SRBs, which malfunctioned due to unusually low temperature on the morning of the takeoff. Many of the scientists that were part of the team responsible for building the SRBs were aware that the low temperature may cause the O-ring to fault and attempted to prevent the launch because of it. They were overruled, and proven right. The entire incident was predicted hours before it happened.  	134
       Middle school is crappy almost everywhere you go, outside the city or in. Thank goodness we can homeschool those three years, because that's exactly what we're doing.   Reddit is actually the center of a good portion of the white supremacist traffic on the internet.  https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+white+supremacist ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8         Yes, but my guess is the court is going to agree with what I just said, should it ever be challenged.                                                                                             Garlic powder is better if you plan to roast or bake something, because it doesn't burn. For that reason, it can also be better for the inexperienced cook.   So maybe you picked it up from your dad, then. I live in NYC, but *my* father was from Texas, and I picked up the pin-pen merger from him. My mother and older sister don't have it.  (The pen-pin merger just means that when I say a word that has a "short e" before a nasal - that is, n or m - I turn it into a "short i", so that the word pen and the word pin sound exactly alike to me. This isn't universal in American English, and is more common Down South and among African-Americans, iirc.)   Yes, I know what you are saying, and I've seen that happen in kittens myself. However, two kittens that are outwardly identical may not be genetically identical, and two kittens that are genetically identical frequently don't look the same at all.   Rising, but they're still a minority.   To whatever country? Like... Afghanistan? Or Korea?   Fascinating. I was commenting on the speech pattern, which is actually centered around Pittsburgh and doesn't seem to have a large presence in Texas. But then, that survey wasn't all that scientific :)  http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/needs-washed   Edit: For the record, I generally take a descriptivist approach to language, and would not call any widespread usage "wrong" just because it may be nonstandard, though I reserve the right to say that some language choices are better avoided in certain situations.   Rarely are they not sterile.   Ethnic food stores also tend to have a good bulk spice section.   I suppose it depends on what sort of food you like to cook.   If you mostly like Italian style cooking, I'd go with fennel, oregano, "italian seasoning", garlic powder (if for some reason you don't want to do fresh garlic) or rosemary, paprika.  If you mostly like "American, non-regional" style cooking, I'd go with nutmeg, cinnamon, paprika, cumin (or thyme, I forgot thyme is a thing), and bay leaves (or oregano).  If you mostly like Indian style cooking, then I'd go with coriander, cardamon, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cumin.  If you mostly like Tex-mex, then I'd go with cumin, paprika, smoked paprika (because smoked paprika is delicious), oregano, and something else.  You see the problem here? My top five varies depending on what sort of foods I plan to cook.   True. Often, different populations will define the same word differently. However, that doesn't mean that either population is *wrong*. It just means that they are different, and perhaps that there will be some confusion between those two populations.  When you know what another person means, and they are using a widely accepted definition of a word, it is thus incorrect to tell them they are wrong.  Merriam-Webster, for the record, lists both definitions:  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid  The "untrue fact" definition comes first, however, that doesn't mean that it is used by more people. Merriam-Webster traditionally puts the older definitions first, whether or not they are the most common. I believe they are in the process of changing this, but they haven't gotten to every entry yet.   Given that very few elective abortions are performed after 20 weeks, and this bill already allows for abortions due to medical needs, my guess is it's not an undue burden.   How are you wrong? Let me count the ways.  1. Christians didn't "adapt" anything... and there are a heck of a lot of Christians who *do* take the Bible very literally. (Except when they don't. I know people who believe that the miracle at Cana was turning water into grape juice.)  2. Muslim society in the 11th century was far in advance of Christian society.  3. Muslims today are not generally "stuck in the 11th century".  4. Like Christians, Muslims hold a wide range of opinions and views. Just like we don't assume all Christians are like Fred Phelps, we shouldn't assume all Muslims are like bin Ladin.  5. Syrians do not universally hate the West, and it is doubtful they hate Uruguay specifically.  6. It is worth mentioning, again, that a good number of Syrian refugees *are not Muslim*.  7. It is not impossible to learn a new language.  8. You know darn well that if YOU were in THEIR shoes, you'd run to any country willing to take you and be grateful. Well, maybe you wouldn't be grateful, but I'm pretty sure they will be. Helping the poor is what we're supposed to do as a civilized society.  This list is incomplete. I ran out of energy, but you didn't run out of errors. Your comment is, indeed, fractally wrong.   Putting aside the fact that a good number of Syrian refugees *aren't Muslim* (seriously, how you've missed hearing about the Yazidis and the Druze, I don't know), not all Muslims take the Quran equally literally. You might as well say that Uruguay should expel its Christians because "Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise" is in the Bible.   Anti-abortion groups have been targeting Roe v Wade protections ever since, trying to find the argument that can bring it down.  Nothing is ever "settled". Look at Plessy v Ferguson. That was "settled" law for decades, but dedicated work brought it down smashingly in the middle of the last century.  (Now, I'm against Plessy but for Roe. I don't want you to think, by my citing both, that I look favorably on the work of those who campaign against abortion, nor that I think the civil rights movement was bad. I simply couldn't think of another example.)   Amoral usually means "without any sense of morals" while immoral is the usual term for "against morals, bad, evil". Did you mean the latter?   Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge  Withinne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho  That hadden prys, now wonder nyce and straunge  Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so,  And spedde as wel in love as men now do;  Eek for to winne love in sondry ages,  In sondry londes, sondry ben usages.  Or, as Chaucer would've put it if he'd been speaking off the cuff - language *does* change, so you'd better get used to it.   That is an incomplete definition. Nowadays, most people use "factoid" to mean "a small, isolated bit of true information".  Since language is based upon consensus, that means that the definition has changed.   Sure, it happens all the time. It's less common than triplets where all three are fraternal (different eggs), but more common than triplets where all three are identical.   That doesn't make them genetically identical. Cat coloration is not entirely determined by genetics, and genetically identical cats can look very different from each other.    Does it need policed and audited? yes  You from PA originally, or thereabouts?    So they should burden Yonkers instead? Whom does this benefit?                  Anti-abortion activists have been steadily whittling down abortion protections for decades.                                                Well, Salt Lake City spends about half the cost (IIRC. It's a heck of a lot less, anyway) on housing them than they were doing on ER visits and whatnot beforehand. Do you need me to cite that?  New edit: Of course I'll cite it.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/08/daily-show-homelessness_n_6437644.html  Now, Salt Lake City has a population just under 200,000. And they have just about 2,000 homeless people (which counts those who are now housed by this initiative, as near as I can tell). Which means that about 1% of the population is homeless. Somebody ran the numbers upthread, and in NYC we have slightly less homelessness per capita, at .7% of the population.   Do youths who run away really stay that close to home? I'm thinking that if *I* were kicked out (or otherwise decided to leave) because I was LGBT, the *last* thing I'd do is stay where I was unwelcome. I'd head towards a bright future someplace gay-friendly.      Sure, some are terrorists... but in the US, most terrorists are white Christian (or nominally Christian) men.   Pew exclusively posts YouTube videos nowadays?  Look, I don't do videos. And judging from the downvotes, neither does anybody else. I'm sure you can find the original study if you try.   That wasn't the Muslims, that was Obama :P                                                   Have you considered crossposting to /r/infographics?            Oh, you should, you should. There's six of them now.  But really, her Dalemark Quartet was better.   Yay! An imaginary internet point for me! I win!   Wow. Six. Tell me, is Dylan Roof a Muslim? James Holmes? Adam Lanza? Jared Loughner? Aaron Alexis?   Can we PLEASE all go after the white supremacists?   Islam originated in a warm climate. You don't really want dead bodies stinking up the joint for a week while you prepare for a burial. The faster you can get them dealt with, the better.  As far as facing Mecca goes, the body has to face in some direction. It's not that tricky to turn it this way instead of that way.   I know I get *all* my information from YouTube. Doesn't everybody?   Damn straight.   In America? June, 2012.  http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/homepage/html/warrant100.html                                                         That's what gives it the je ne sais quoi.   I'm glad you understand.                           When you leave it on the counter, they just throw it away, so you haven't saved anything.   But then he wouldn't have a chance to be a self-righteous jerk.    "Oh, no thanks, I don't need a bag!"  Learn it, live it, love it, and stop whining if you forget to say it and they go ahead and give you a bag.   You're assuming a few things here.  First, that they only have the one vault. It's not impossible for Molly to have another one.  Second, that they keep all their savings in the bank.  Third (and this is most likely), that they are saving a reasonable portion of their income, rather than simply spending it.     The people working at these factories choose to work there.  With little alternative, of course they do. You might as well say that the victims of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire *chose* to work under *those* conditions, for *that* pay.  Forcing our views upon the people of Myanmar risks the livelihood of all of the lower paid workers there.  Not if we require all business that operate in our countries to pay a universal minimum wage wherever they set up shop.                  This is going to sound stupid, but when he realized it was a tight fit under the cloak with all three of them in there. I know it's a more physical sign than everybody else is giving, but I think subconsciously he was realizing he wasn't a little kid anymore and it wasn't *just* because he had gotten taller.   You can't make your sister understand. Better to just drop the issue around her. If she brings it up, just say "I don't feel like discussing this with you anymore" and change the subject.   First, up until CoS, they always had at least one child home. And as she was homeschooled, they were doing it on one income - I don't think Molly would accept it if Bill and Charlie sent money home, do you?  Second, Arthur isn't paid very well.  Third, my guess is they're simply *bad with money*. Arthur spends it on old Muggle junk. Molly buys Lockhart books like they're going out of style.  (And fourth, I personally think Molly is a big ol' narcissist. I am NOT a fan of the Weasley parents. Some people thrive on playing "oh, poor me", and enforced poverty seems right up Molly's alley. So they could actually be doing quite well, and she could be exaggerating their poverty because that makes her feel better. It's sick, but some people do stuff like that.)                  Starbright and the Dream Eater?  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarbrightAndTheDreamEater   The Chrestomanci books don't involve weaving, but they do mention him once silencing an area to have a private conversation with his mother, the spell was so strong that everybody within went temporarily deaf. And he does travel to different worlds by going into a cavernous "place between", each world is visualized as a canyon within.

 IT"S ON THE HUMBLE BUNDLE THANK YOU FOR WHATEVER YOU DID TO DO THAT   Eek, that took me too long to write. Feedback is welcome. I didn't go over it to check for errors so if you see one tell me.   "Tell me again, what it is you do?"  "I bring people back from the dead. Simple as that." said the strange man in a matter-of-fact way. He was about 1.6 metres (5' 10"), dressed in fancy business wear, albino, with Bentley Platinum Sunglasses covering his eyes. "Now continue on about your son, madame."  "He was last seen about one month ago with a crowd of, degenerates, in a bar one kilometre outside the city limits. I'm sure he is dead! Call it paranoia, but I trust my motherly intuition."  "I'm sure you do," he scoffed, "All mothers have an internal mechanism for knowing everything and anything about their child. They were built for that very role. Now, how badly do you wish to see him again?"  "More than anything." she pleaded.  "Would you pay?" the man inquired.  "Any sum! I'll take out as many loans as possible"  "Money is a fleeting medium of exchange. The universe requires only one form of payment: Life"  "What do you mean?" the woman said, feeling worried she may be over her head.   "I can guarantee your son is dead; He died the other day at precisely at 10:00 PM. What I am saying is this: It was his time to go. Bringing him back would create an imbalance even I cannot fix. This is where you come in, but before I go on, I must know you will pay."   "May I have some time to think about this?" she begged.  The man gazed upward for a second, as if he was waiting for a signal. "Yes, 24 hours to decided. I will be back at this same time tomorrow in the same place. Again, come alone and be on time."  The woman thanked him and hurried back to her car. She was soaking wet from the torrential rain. Odd, she thought, it was sunny just a minute ago. She got in her car and drove back to her house. When she opened the door, she felt as if her son, 10 years younger, came and jumped into her arms and gave her a big kiss. She imagined him running off again to scrape his knee or get himself into mischief. She sigh, and dropped her purse and keys off on the credenza. She made her way to her bedroom to contemplate this decision. As she passed his room, she thought she saw teenage him, sitting on his bed playing some headache inducing Heavy Metal racket. She almost stopped to shout at him to turn it down, but when she looked back, his room was empty. She ran to her room and flopped onto the single bed. She cried for what seemed like ages before finally drifting off to sleep.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "Hello? Denise! Are you okay? You sound like you've been crying!"  "Oh, hi Lisa." she sputtered out disappointingly while wiping her makeup off her face. "What time is it?"  "It's 10:00 AM. Are you just waking up?"  "Yes, I must have dozed off. What's up?"  "I'm calling again to see if you want to join my support group. I know they haven't found Jeff yet and your brain must be exploding with emotion. It will be good to talk about your feelings for once instead of bottling them up. I did the same when Jack... left" she said, and for a blessed moment paused before continuing her rant, "I keep saying left but I know darn well he offed himself overseas and....." she continued to babble on about Jack, then her day, then her tv series before Denise finally drifted off. Her thoughts were still on her son and the offer. What did he mean by "Would you pay?" and "Life" and "Imbalance." She thought for a while, and she finally decided that  "Are you still there?" interrupted the river of tangents, "I asked you a question!"  "Huh? Oh, sorry, I was listening." she lied.  "Then tonight sounds good to you? We meet at St. Lazarus at 10 and there will be coffee and donuts and all the support you'll need"  She thought about it. Maybe it was time to accept the fact her son was never coming back. She could use the help and support, and all the worrying was stressing her out. Maybe.... Then she realized: her 24 hours to decide ended at 10PM. "I'll get back to you on it." She said, as she rudely hung up the phone. What should I do?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rest of the day went by without mention. She tried to put off her decision as best as she could. This was no flip-of-the coin decision; this was her and her son's fate. She did her best to stay busy around the small house. Some days, it looked like there were 5 or 10 people living there instead of just 2. Today, however, the cleanliness of the house only made her feel lonelier. She didn't have meals to prepare, beds to clean, rooms to pick up, her son to.....   She stopped before she got to that thought. She promised herself she would not think about him all day to affect her decision. It has only been about one month since he went missing. She could still smell his cheap cologne as she passed his room.   "It's Saturday night", she thought, "he would be getting ready to go out on his weekly dates with some girl he never tells me about. I always teased him that one day he would meet some psycho girl who would murder him in his sleep and that I could have prevented it with some motherly screening."  She gasped. Could that have been the reason he went missing? Oh, she could never forgive herself if that was the reason! She panicked, then stopped breathing for a moment. Ever so slowly, she started to chuckle, building up to a full on laugh.   "Look at myself!" she laughed, "I'm getting worked up over a theory!" As she was laughing to herself, she didn't hear her phone ringing in the other room. When she quieted down, she skipped over to her phone and answered it.  "Hello!" she greeted.  "Denise? Hi! It's me again!"   Her mood suddenly switched to one of disgust. Why was she calling now? "Hi Lisa. The meeting is not until another 3 hours, what's up?"  "3 hours? It's in 10 minutes! Where are you?"  She looked at the wall. The clock read 9:50 PM. She gasped. She had to decided quickly. She could feel her heart beating faster and faster as her anxiety ran rampant. "I'll be right over." she said, as she hung up. What do I do?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  She arrived at the location at 9:59. She quickly entered the building and sat down. She waited, as the church bell tolled the hour.  *bong* One *bong* Two  *bong* Three *bong* Four *bong* Five *bong* Six *bong* Seven *bong* Eight *bong* Nine *bong* Ten   10PM, the meeting time. A door from the far side of the room opened, and the man walked up to his desk and sat down.   "Have you decided yet?" he smirked.   "I have. Tell me your conditions." she fretted.  "Wonderful! Let's get down to the details." He chortled, smiling to himself. "As I said before," he started, turning serious," I can bring your son back at a price. You see, the universe does not care who dies, it is how they die. It has a set sequence of deaths that need to be made before it is finished. The next death was up for the line, and your son, volunteered, to meet the demand. If I were to bring him back, there would be an imbalance in the deaths. Are you getting all this?"  "Yes" she replied, hoping this wasn't going where she thought it was going.  "I am a very busy man and do not want to deal with an imbalance. So here is my solution: You kill one person in the same way your son died, and I will bring your son back."  She froze. She had never killed anyone before and never thought about doing it. Was it really worth it to get her son back?   "I know how you must feel about this. Would you kill someone to have one more day with your son? How about the rest of your life? You've already made your decision you want him back, why not take the next step? A parent would do anything to get their child back"  She thought, and in a moment of sheer will she said "I agree."  "Then it is settled. You will take one life in exchange for your son's. Who ever dies must die at 10:00 PM any day by a bullet to the head." he informed as he produced a revolver from his coat. "The person may be male or female of any age, ethnicity, et cetera. The universe does not care who dies, just how they die."  She picked up the gun while trying to stop her hands from shaking. Am I really doing this? Yes, a parent would do anything for their child. "What else?" he demanded.  "That is all. Just point, shoot, and kill at 10PM and your son will be back. Now excuse me, I am a very busy man." He got up out of his chair and exited from the far door. He closed the door with an eerie thud and the room fell into silence.   "Who should I kill?" she whispered to herself. "What life is worth less than my son's?" She sat in the chair and thought for a while, then a name flashed in her head. The world would be better off with my son, and not Lisa.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "Howdy Ho! You reached Lisa, I normally don't check my voicemail but you can leave one or hang up a text or *beep*"  She talked so much she didn't even bother to check if it recorded the full message. Probably another hour's worth of her voice.   "Hi Lisa, it's Denise. Call me back when you get a chance. It's important." She put her phone back into her purse. She had it all figured out. She would lure Lisa to the abandoned warehouse by the docks, shoot her, and dump her body in the East Mediterranean. No one will be out there at 10PM, so it would be perfect. She thought long and hard about it. Lisa had no family left and worked at a grocery store. She would not be missed. Her phone rang.  "Hey Denise! I got your call. Didn't read your voicemail but who does now adays am I right? The meeting was great last night, didn't see you there. Was gonna call you again but I thought maybe you were tired and..."  "Lisa, yes, I would love to talk, but I want to see you tonight" she interrupted.   "Oh sure dear. I'll be free after 7PM, that's what time I get off of work but you probably already knew that, and after that I have to go home and cook dinner for myself, as usual, and then around 8PM my show comes on...."  "Lisa, are you free at around 9:45 tonight?" she interrupted, again.  "Well I don't know, usually my show ends around 9 but then they might have a special on afterwards and oh that reminds me I need to check to see who will be competing tonight I always root for the.."  "Alright! Meet me tonight at 9:45 at the old warehouse. There's something I want to tell you." Her nerves were killing her.   "The old warehouse? Oh that's where Jack used to work before he went off to war. I'm kinda maybe glad he's dead so he doesn't have to deal with the financial crisis nearby. I hope that doesn't affect us in any way if they leave the..."  "9:45, old warehouse. Sorry I have to leave. Thank you!" she clarified as she hung up.   She felt strangely excited that day. She dusted and cleaned her son's room, fixed a dinner for two, and planned a fun night of old games they used to play. She could hardly contain herself! The day whirled by in a such a flurry of excitement and anticipation that she almost forgot what she had to do that night. One death, for one life, Lisa for Jeff. Perfect balance. She checked the time: 9:00PM. She grabbed the revolver and stuffed it in her purse, grabbed her keys off the credenza, and headed out the door.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- She arrived shortly at the warehouse and checked her phone: 9:10. She checked the area over and over again, marking critical points.  "Meet Lisa over here, walk over to there, pull out the gun, bang, dump the body there, get back in the car, and meet my boy." she repeated to herself. It was almost time. Her hands shook from the anxiety and fear. She didn't consider what would happen if she was caught. "No, I won't get caught" she said to herself. she checked her phone: 9:46.  "She's late, as usual. But I planned that too" she told herself.   9:50, she saw headlights approaching and recognized the car. Lisa, here at last. She walked over to the spot where she wanted to meet Lisa, but she drove to a spot farther than she anticipated. She got out of her car and called over, "Hey, I see you over there. Come on over!"  "I'd rather stay over here" she shouted.  "Oh, but my legs are acting up again, and I just parked my car. Can we talk over here? What's this about?"   She was getting on her nerves. She walked across the parking lot and stepped right up to her. The time read 9:54. "Can we walk over to here, I want to show you something dear to me." she asked.   "Oh sure honey just tell me what you need to tell me and I promise I will listen to every word you say without interrupting no matter what..."  "Lisa, thanks, just walk over here"  They walked together while Lisa kept babbling on about her day. They arrived at the end of the dock. 9:57. She check to see if the rope and rock were still by the location. 9:58.  "Denise what is this all about? You know this night air isn't good for you and it's so dark out here what is it that you want?" she nagged.    "Just, give me a second to think." 9:59. She went for the gun but dropped it on the dock. Lisa looked down and her face lit up as she let out a shriek. The church bell tolled  *bong* She scrambled for the gun *bong* Lisa started running down the dock. *bong* She took careful aim *bong* *bang* she missed the first shot *bong* Lisa let out an even louder scream *bong* She took aim again *bong* Lisa tripped over her high heels *bong* She approached her as Lisa struggled to get up *bong* She pointed it at her head *bong* Lisa took her last breath.   *bang* 10 PM. A Death, for a Life.  Suddenly, her knees went weak as she collapsed to the ground next to the fresh dead body. She wept at what she had done. Fear overtook her, and she quickly moved the body back to the dock. She tied it up and attached the weight, and pushed it into the sea. It floated out some ways before finally sinking into the dark blue waves. Finally, she could see her son again!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  She drove back to her house with a sadistic grin on her face. As she opened the door, she noticed something wrong. Her boy was not home yet. "Did I do something wrong?" she thought, "No, it must be taking him some time. I'll just wait here." She waited. Nothing. No knocks, no phone calls, nothing. She got worried.  "What if he lied to me? Oh what have I done??? Why did I ever believe him? Why am I so stupid!?" she cried. She ran to her room and wept. "The cops will be by shortly to arrest me. I know I must have messed up somewhere." She looked at her phone: 10:35. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.  She jumped up and ran to the door. She peered through the peep hole to see a man dressed in blue wearing a "Polis" shirt. She  panicked. She could feel her son was still dead. Mother's Intuition. She knew the man had lied to her. Her son probably wasn't even shot for all she knew. She walked slowly to her room as the knocking persisted. She moved as if in a trance. She opened up her purse, and grabbed the gun.  "Death, for a death" she chanted to herself as she pulled the trigger.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  "What? Where am I? What am I doing here?" He opened his eyes and got up off the ground. There was blood, everywhere. He blinked. "What is going on?" he wondered. Then he remembered. He didn't like it any longer. He felt as if nothing mattered. He remembered why he came down here. He must have missed the first shot somehow, but the second shot won't. He found the gun lying on the floor, and resumed his intentions.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  He sat as his desk when a phone call came through. "Yes?"  "The imbalance has been corrected" the voice said.  "Anything for you. A parent will do anything for his child"      Then they said I was a "Lucky Winner!" How cool was that? They knew my name!   I've been meaning to try that game. Heard it was really good   I'm still looking for an easy way to unsubscribe   	6

    Throw a flashbang, and look at the other team.  The players with white reflections on their faces are guarding whatever site.  I think it happened with c9 in the esl a few weeks back.   Discrepancies between server and client.  They changed the way it worked to cut down on aimbots.   You quoted half the sentence.  The explanation was in the half you left out   dota merch comes with codes for cases (whatever dota calls cases) that pay for themselves (roughly) on the steam market place.  CSGO merch costs an arm and a leg, and has no codes (apparently).     Not that the in-game items matter all that much to me, its just crazy how differently valve treats their 2 most popular franchises.  CSGO has been paying the bills as of late, and we get expensive shirts back.  That being said.... in for one coffee mug....   Next time ask Pharrell if you can wear his hat and take a picture.   Seriously, people are a little nuts.  Sure there are technical issues, but experience will fix that.  Sure the betting lines arent great, but who cares.  the teams and players need tournaments to survive, and the only way esports will grow is by spreading as much as possible.   I think the group stages should have either been online, or more spread out over a couple days.  It was a ton of matches all overlapping.  If they spread it out they could have focused more on individual matches, afforded reasonable computers, and brought the quality way up.  12 odd hours of bo1's is ridiculous.  Now on day 2 its like they can return 75% of the rented computers.   I'm sure if they could/if there was an easy way they would.  Sure they could take skins out of the game, or make every item account bound.  But that would be really bad.   Plus the speculation on him throwing a51 games for profit.  They had a couple really fishy losses right when csgolounge became a thing.   I remember that case opening when him and his brother opened a knife, he/they were so damned happy.  Now he just burns knives 10 at a time.  Hopefully twitch stays viable for him.  Hopefully he plays cs one day.   Yah Its pretty bad.  Id like to think it was the 50% off summer sale mixed with the last esl lan.  Smurfs tend to buy alts during sales and an influx of new players that tend to not care.   Last night my team was up something stupid like 13-2 going into ct side mirage.  Our bottom fragger was well above their top.  The rest of the game we bought mollys and mollied up our entire spawn, then we'd all start yelling stuff like "Rush through mollies , Push push push, gotta guard sites!"  We lost a few rounds because of it, but definitely worth it for a good laugh.  We also had one dude shoutcasting but telling us wrong spots for everyone, kept us on our toes when we all rush market while the terrorists are pushing out apps.   I'd try to watch a couple pro games, just so you have some amount of map awareness.  Also play some casual, and a lot of deathmatch to work on learning maps and aim.  Don't stress if you die a lot in casual,  in comp mm they sort you by similar skill level and in casual I don't think they do.  Lots of hackers also hang out in casual.    The thing that helped me the most was learning how to set my mouse dpi and sensitivity correctly, then learning how to move efficiently with a much lower dpi.  There plenty of youtube videos on that.    If your team makes calls in a mm game don't be afraid to ask them if you don't know a nickname (Cat, Tetris, Jungle, etc etc).  You might get flamed a bit, but its just internet people.  You will learn and possibly never see them again.     I would be a great location.  Right between Philly and Canada.  Or maybe I just want it to be close by..   and all this time I thought you were JW   haha oh god, yea i meant sem. Long day.   Yea same here.  I got 4 wins in a row as a LEM and then put on a team with a 4 queue.  All their names were "Sorry Im new".  They ran to mid every round and dropped weapons.  Then they kicked me. Then I go on CEVO and people flame me for not putting in the time getting better on mm.  Sorry I cant get better playing people of the same skill level, certainly not good enough to carry a team of goof balls.  Edit: SEM   Yea, I see it being somewhat similar to making a call out loud and doing something completely different. If given an opportunity then why not.  If the organizers don't like it then they should be responsible for fixing it.   Intel   I played 120odd hours, I had fun most of them.  I did vog the week it was released.  At the end nothing dropped for anyone. Thought it was broken.  Went to find loot tables for raid rewards.  "Oh I guess there are none".  Haven't turned the game on since.  I was a wow raider, thought Destiny would scratch that itch.  Like an mmo-lite.  I don't care if I don't get a reward for doing the hardest content in the game.  In an mmo raids have loot tables, you certainly dont get something every time.  But someone in your party will.  An item worth coming back for every week to get.  An item that doesn't have the same low chance to drop off any mob in the whole game.   Without raid specific gear whats the point of getting to end game.  Without pvp specific gear what's the point of pvping.  Sorry for my rant, incredibly off topic.  What im getting at is I got my moneys worth, I liked the game.  But dont see any point in going back.  Plus I dont own the dlc's.  $70 for the dlc+tk is too much overhead for me to come back. Shit I payed 60 for the game.  Essentially this is a really long "I agree".   One 980 should be fine if you're running 1440p.  2 980s would be better than 1 ti for 4k   Get a 980 and an ssd, unless you are getting a crazy panel.   I think it's more a human reassurance type thing, even if they do read the rules.  Remember how scary your first build was.  If I had the internet during my first build I'm sure I would have been the same way.   Wow I feel old, almost said they were fake.  Never knew they released highs. Been out if the game for too long.   200+ fps doesn't matter on a 144hz screen.  Just play a few dms and you'll be fine.   I thought the nacho cheese fountain was a good idea.   I mean I have that headset and fine talking game.  No-one ever complained it.  I definitely would use a headset mic for twitch broadcasting though.  Have tried updating your audio drivers?  Or go into Windows sound settings and raise the levels.  Just be careful, if you raise them too high it will get super pitchey.   What are trying do with the mic?  Are you just playing games and communicating, skype calling , or are you twitch streaming?   Ah the last panel was that sketchy shenmue 3 kickstarter video that literally no one must have watched. Who would pay money for a 5 second clip where they re-used audio assets and had the worst voice actors of all time.  "Promise of a game coming out one day..."   You also have to buy the $120.00 definitive edition.   Cool thanks a lot, make sure you post future projects!   Came out great!  What kind of machine do you use? I've been thinking about grabbing a cheap/mid priced machine but I'd like to dabble in denim.  Dont feel like ruining a cheap machine or wasting money.   Bet it all on a longshot.   Bungie and blizzard are both owned by activision.  Im shocked that activision didnt pay a couple blizz people to go over as contract workers.  Not that blizz has done everything right.  Bu at least they have experience with mmo content  additions and expansions.   They have over 20 years experience developing pc games.  Their games also take over 5 years to develop.  Smart phones are still relatively new, They change dramatically even year to year.   "Fuck android" isnt a good keynote for a press conference.  They arent a small indie studio, they can't be open about stuff.  They have a board of directors, and marketing people carefully selecting What any dev can say.   I think it's more the closed system thing.  On ios they are developing for 4 phones and x amount of ipads.  They know the exact details on every piece of hardware the game is running on.  It is much easier to optimize for less systems.  If a huge publisher like Bethesda puts out an android game and it hypothetically doesnt run on htc phones for some reason then they would get bad press and have their validity as a games developer questioned.    Im pretty sure they just want to release a game that works  Hopefully it comes sooner rather than later.   Afro samurai for the 360.  The worst ive played that I can recall   Exactly. It seems crazy, I'm not gonna be the one guy that doesn't vote to kick the afk guy, or the music mic guy, or the guy that throws the bomb out of the map.   Pretty dont solo queue anymore. Guess it is what it is.   I voted to kick one person each in 3 comp mm in a row.  Got a 3 hour.  Got back next game voted to kick and got a 24 hour. I didnt initiate any of them.   No   For a bit more you could get something high quality, like a ducky or a das keyboard.  For a bit less you could get something of equal quality. Like a corsair or a Razer non-rainbow.  You are paying premium for a keyboard with a Razer logo that has pretty lights.      It's on sale for $60... That seems like regular price.  I don't need fake currency..   I love my bitfenix case, they might be a little over budget.  They are worth it though.  Sick of mid towers that look to be designed by teenagers with crayons.  http://www.bitfenix.com/global/en/products/chassis/prodigy  http://www.bitfenix.com/global/en/products/chassis/phenom-micro-atx  http://www.bitfenix.com/global/en/products/chassis/pandora   Lian-li are also a solid choice.  I'm just not as familiar with their lineup.  Edit: absolutely check out the Pandora link.  Tiger direct for under 100 in brushed aluminum.  I'm considering a new case now haha    The rank you are looking at is a temporary thing for the latest event.  You get an actual rank at 10 comp wins.  I consider myself new to the game.  I have ~300 hours played, and 60 odd comp wins.  You need to realize this is a game people have been playing in some form for 15 years or so, even the low rank people are going to be much better than you when you first start.    Yes people hack and smurf, but generally people who play cs are good at cs.  Plus if people have a high degree of map awareness they are going to beat you even if you are possibly better at fps games than they are.  Stick with it though, it's a great game.  There's nowhere to go but up.   The giveaways and sale are both great. A new free character vs free stash tab, happy either way.  A new pet and team up are great, I think those are coming?  But no event does kind of stink.  I'd even be happy if they just left mid-town madness running.   Gonna be cute   Really solid build,  I'm not sure how processing heavy ableton is, but you could probably save a few if you got an i5 and 16gb of memory.   Personally I'd wait.  The oculus doesn't come out until 2016, and the steam vr is unproven as of yet.  By the time they hit the market newer hardware will be out, and a vr ready pc will be cheaper to build   It will work, it will be better than what you have.  The motherboard will be a bottleneck though.  That's a pcie 3.0 card, and you only have a 2.0 slot.  I don't remember the bandwidth difference off the top of my head.  There is no reason not to, that's a good price for the card.  Then you can plan a new build around it eventually.   You should be fine paying most modern games on high settings no problem.  streaming should be fine.  why a microatx motherboard in a full sized case? maybe check out the full sized d3h.  also you could consider an ssd, or a bigger psu if you were even thinking about running sli one day.  seems a very solid build though.  edit: streaming on high settings might be a little iffy in an i5,  but it should be workable.   You're fine, you will probably need a new psu if you do upgrade your video card.   You can get a grounding bracelet for less than $5.  If you can't come up with less than $5 then... Save up...  If you really don't want a grounding bracelet make sure you keep a hand on the case chassis, and don't stand on the carpet.  Also remember processors are zif(zero insertion force) if you are pushing down you did something wrong. Unless you got a p3 slot processor or older, then push real hard.   Is it a fresh windows install?  Sometimes if you do a new build using an old hard-drive driver stuff gets really wonky.  Did you try going back and using integrated graphics just to make sure it isn't crashing on you. Check and make sure the ram is installed in slots 0 1, it will probably be the far right slot, and second from the left. (it probably isn't a memory issue if it wasn't crashing before the video card)  Are you using both 24pin and 8pin motherboard connectors? Is the power going to your gpu seated properly? I think its 8 and 6 pin pcie power, but i don't quite remember.  If you have access to a known good power supply you could try that, it would suck rma'ing another part that's good.   Haha yahh once I had a hair fall in the dimm slot.. The slot melted, but the motherboard still worked, save that slot.   My asus p4ps8x was doa. But the 9700pro I saved up for was baller at the time.  All in all it went better than some builds, worse than others.   Cleaning the heatsink and new thermal paste couldn't hurt, and it's a whole lot cheaper than new parts.  Good luck   An r9 270x and an ssd would be a pretty good upgrade.  Or if you stretch a little over you could do a 970ti and ssd.  8gb of ram should be adequate for a while.  I guess long term you would be looking at a new cpu/mobo combo.   The feature set and reviews are looking real good on the extreme 6.  I'll have to give it a closer look tonight.  Are you using that board?  Maybe I'm just old, but I always think of them as the early 2000s asrock which sold ghetto sketchy cheap boards.  Even though I know they improved across the board a whole lot.   Sub 200 would be great. Closer to 150 would be better.     So I have my build all put together, just staggered as normal when choosing the mobo.  Currently I have the GIGABYTE GA-Z97X-Gaming 5 in my cart. I only need 2 usb 3.0 headers. I'm only planning on running a single gpu (at least for the next few years.)  Probably never going to use more than 4 sata ports. I like the idea of having the m.2/sata express just in case.  They aren't essential, but a little more expandability never hurts.  Especially out of a budget board. I love the Gigabyte dual bios switch, it saved me multiple times with my current ud5h/ivy-bridge combo. (apt to say dual bios chips are essential to me, but i guess if something great comes along I'd settle.)  Are there any better options in the price range?  Future things I'm not thinking about?  edit: ATX from factor.  I also generally don't overclock, at least not until it gets late enough in the life cycle where I need to start pushing my hardware's limits.   The same week grand turismo 7 drops I bet.   Just noticed logitechs high end model is on sale for 50% off today.  I don't have any experience with it, but I figured it might be useful if your still looking in the $50 range.  http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Webcam-Widescreen-Calling-Recording/dp/B006JH8T3S/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8 pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70 qid=1431446366 ref_=mp_s_a_1_1 sr=1-1   I use a logitech c310 it's pretty adequate, good under good lighting, not great under poor lighting.  If you have a digital camera you could see if there is any way to plug it in and use it as a webcam.   I'm assuming you can speak well enough that people can understand you.  I don't see any issues,  if anything it could be a big self confidence boost.

                Another reason why government backdoors are downright dangerous and make us all *less safe*.  I'd rather the possibility for hackers (or competent spy agencies) to hack into my car and kill me *didn't exist* over the odd chance that the police would have it *easier* to end a car chase.   Seems like the benefits are *minor* over a potential catastrophe (getting killed through hacking).  I think I can live without my radio automatically becoming louder at high-speed. *Live* being the operative word here.         Costly move either way.   Nope:   Microsoft sold 8.4 million Lumia phones in Q4 (compared to 5.8 million last year), but revenue dropped 38 percent to $748 million.   The net loss in Q4 amounted to $3.2 billion, which Bloomberg reports is its biggest loss ever.   The writedown was most likely done now to *hide* that there were other losses as well, especially when people like you keep hand-waving and saying "oh, it's just the Nokia writedown, nothing to see here".  My guess is that's exactly the reaction Microsoft counted on, to hide their *other* $1 billion losses this quarter.   Just to be clear **only the $2.1 billion were from the writedown**, not the rest to 3.2 billion.   Did you even read the article?   but revenue dropped 38 percent to $748 million.   The net loss in Q4 amounted to $3.2 billion, which Bloomberg reports is its biggest loss ever.   So no, this is not "all due to the Nokia write off".    Well no. If Microsoft had a $8 billion write off then the stock price *should* become lower and account for that failure, just like when Microsoft bought Nokia the stock price likely increased due to the optimism that Microsoft might start to do well in mobile. That didn't happen, so the price needs to come down now.   Turned it around how?   I'll believe it when I see it.         It's not that much unlike Android.  There's Samsung's "Android", HTC's "Android", and so on. Then there is Android TV, Android Wear, Android Auto...etc.  So it's not just "one OS" with a single interface. Linux is a "core" on top of which many "OS's" are built.         It's only going to get worse with self-driving cars or normal cars with self-driving features.      It's going to be even worse for self-driving cars. Once they are hacked...your life is in the hands of the hacker.                  Yeah, by "accident". Keep telling yourself that.   Which is probably what the "final" version of Windows 10 should've been. Every clue so far pointed to the fact that Microsoft is *rushing* Windows 10 to "meet the deadline" or whatever.          but you don't have a net reduction of jobs.  What if it's eating mostly physical-work type jobs and those jobs are being replaced by more white-collar type work?                     Current spec, which will probably change:  https://password-hashing.net/submissions/specs/Argon-v2.pdf  From page 4:   Our solutions. We offer two new hashing scheme called Argon and Argon2. Argon is our original submission to PHC. It is a multipurpose hash function, that is optimized for highest resilience against tradeoff attacks, so that any, even small memory reduction would lead to significant time and computational penalties. Argon can be used for password hashing, key derivation, or any other memory-hard computation (e.g., for **cryptocurrencies**).   Argon2 summarizes the state of the art in the design of memory-hard functions. It is a streamlined and simple design. It aims at the highest memory filling rate and effective use of multiple computing units, while still providing defense against tradeoff attacks. Argon2 is optimized for the x86 architecture and exploits the cache and memory organization of the recent Intel and AMD processors. Argon2 has two variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d is faster and uses data-depending memory access, which makes it suitable for cryptocurrencies and applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and passwordbased key derivation. Argon2i is slower as it makes more passes over the memory to protect from tradeoff attacks.   We recommend Argon for the applications that aim for the highest tradeoff resilience and want to guarantee prohibitive time and computational penalties on any memory-reducing implementation. According to our cryptanalytic algorithms, an attempt to use half of the requested memory (for instance, 64 MB instead of 128 MB) results in the speed penalty factor of 140 and in the penalty 218. The penalty grows exponentially as the available memory decreases, which effectively prohibits the adversary to use any smaller amount of memory. Such high computational penalties are a unique feature of Argon. We recommend Argon2 for the applications that aim for high performance. Both versions of Argon2 allow to fill 1 GB of RAM in a fraction of second, and smaller amounts even faster. It scales easily to the arbitrary number of parallel computing units. Its design is also optimized for clarity to ease analysis and implementation.  EDIT: Another interesting tidbit:   Argon2 is heavily optimized for the x86 architecture, so that implementing it on dedicated cracking hardware should be neither cheaper nor faster. Even specialized ASICs would require significant area and would not allow reduction in the time-area product.  It's also resistant to GPUs.               Well the EU did just gave them 7 billion euro.   It's part of the *Keep The Fear Alive* plan. It's why the FBI keeps manufacturing terror plots in the US to say they caught new terrorists once or twice year.                        That's because Facebook is spyware.   I can't believe even the Note 5 won't get USB Type-C, and I was already disappointed that the S6 didn't have it.  This makes it a deal-breaker for me.   Because clearly online pirates are more dangerous than rapists and need to be locked away from the society.   ...for the government. How else could we spy on everything everyone does all the time (including tracking their phone GPS through the Internet?)   By the time governments will be convinced to build thorium reactors, we'll have fusion reactors. They just don't see it as a *major* improvement over the current fission reactors, and the current fission reactors are a "known", and most people tend to go with what they know - *unless* the alternative offers a radical improvement, such as fusion reactors would, and be even safer than thorium fission reactors.  Plus, energy from solar and wind is already *half* the price of *new* nuclear reactors. So there isn't much interest to build new fission nuclear reactors right now anyway (nor should it be - at least 80% of the world's electricity should be provided by wind/solar/batteries).   Indeed it's a very backwards thinking argument. The point of fines is *primarily* to *punish* those that break the law and make the traffic situation more dangerous to others. It's not to just be another tax.  If self-driving cars *completely remove* that danger from traffic, then of course the purpose of fines is gone and shouldn't exist anymore.   OEMs definitely need to move to a default of 64GB of storage ASAP for flagships. It probably costs them like $0.3 per GB to buy it by now. That would be $20 for it, so it shouldn't cost them more than $50 from the retail price. That also means if a phone comes with 64GB default, they shouldn't charge you $100 more for 128GB, but only $50.         Which makes it interesting that the Republicans aren't the ones calling for its abolition.    So all of those Sony hacks from before (which Lulzsec bragged about)...were FBI's work?  The hacks against the Arizona police department and other such hacks from the, also FBI?  It actually wouldn't surprise me too much if they created digital false flag attacks in order to pass new surveillance laws, considering they're already [manufacturing terror plots](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/terror-factory-fbi-trevor-aaronson-book).   False flag cyber attacks kind of seem like a step down from that, if they're going to risk giving people with mental issues access to bombs so they can say they caught another terrorist later.   You don't think malware is being sent in email to intelligence or law enforcement workers?   Something about 50% of all the *new* cars being bought will be EVs, with 20-30% of the *existing* cars in traffic being EVs.         Interestingly enough, after Google already tried to block it over "malware":  https://torrentfreak.com/chrome-blocks-major-torrent-sites-over-harmful-programs-150710/            This seems to have happened after Google recently blocked it for malware (and then unblocked after backlash).  https://torrentfreak.com/chrome-blocks-major-torrent-sites-over-harmful-programs-150710/                  Work taxes should be cut first before VAT anyway. The VAT was already cut by a whopping 15% for food and 2 months later the average price drop for food items is around 6%, and only about a third of the food items had a price drop at all. Most companies preferred to book the difference.  People would've felt the reduction in tax cuts much better if they dropped 10% from work taxes than 15% from food VAT (and the promised 6% cut for the general VAT).      Bullshit. Faster at what? Benchmarks have shown the difference to be negligible.   The only *possible* thing it's faster at is boot time - but even that is mostly misleading, because Microsoft is counting boot time to the lockscreen (or whatever that is called), but it takes another 2 minutes or so to load the actual Windows files after that.   So the NSA-embedded updates can't be stopped then. Is that supposed to make me feel better?   That's basically what Microsoft said with Windows Phone and Windows 8, too. The more they adopt such a strategy the more they seem to fail, though.                                          Only terrorists use encryption, not the good guys.   It's sad that a small company can't compete anymore without being threatened with patent lawsuits, despite the same companies infringing on other companies' patents, too. I remember an older article from Bloomberg saying there are around 250,000 patents affecting smartphone manufacturing.    because they put them off  Not surprising considering that even for an IE update you have to restart your PC. Microsoft still requires a lot of dumb Windows reboots for trivial upgrades.  If Microsoft is going to force the upgrades on users, while the upgrades still require reboots every few days (while you're working on something), people are just going to rate using Windows as a poor experience, and stop buying Windows machines.   These things happen for developing countries gradually anyway. Of course they will kill the SIM there, too, just not in the first 5 years or so after this alternative launches.   Well that sucks. Hasn't Google been paying attention?!   The statement is still true. It *is* less secure than Apple Pay, and "only" as secure as a regular card.                  No, not that. Because if they do that most people will get their own solar panels and batteries for backup.   I think "pretty great" is quite a stretch. I've seen many complain about the only email they got along with "18 months of identity protection"...after their identity was already stolen - for life.   It won't be because the U.S. has likely done the same to the Windows XP-running Chinese government.  That's why the U.S. gov isn't trying to make a big deal out of this, too, like they did with say the Sony hack, because they knew they could just bully North Korea all they wanted and the public would eat it up.   Actually Tesla has the cheapest batteries (from Panasonic).   They are not bad. The biggest thing I'd worry about is backdoors, but at least the software will be built by Google and the hardware heavily scrutinized during the development process. So I'd trust *this* Huawei device, but others not as much (also applies to Xiaomi, and even more so to random Chinese device makers).  Whether it's $450 or $600, I really hope Google will put an S6/G4-level camera in there (or better). That's really the main compromise with Nexus devices and it's quite a frustrating one.   Precisely why Sony, who is rather weak in the US, should've built a Nexus by now.         Please do. Just make sure the alternative is a secure one.                  Yes, but by a much smaller margin (11%), which wouldn't be that surprising because it's a brand new clean browser. It would be surprising if such a browser came out and *wasn't* 10% faster than Chrome or Firefox. In 6 months the Chrome guys might do their best to beat Edge by 10%, too, so again it's not that big of a deal.  That's why the 112% Sunspider benchmark is so misleading. Chrome has given up benchmarking for it because it's a useless benchmark since 2012. Is Microsoft really going to pile on Sunspider until the year 2020?   This is like the mainstream media calling the Ferguson protesters "thugs".  Yeah, maybe some of them were thugs, and maybe some of the angry Reddit users were trolls, but that doesn't mean you should completely dismiss the protest as something real that you should pay attention to.   No, but that Model 3 can be, with a similar range.  Remember there are still other costs to a car, not just the battery, costs which are much more static.   Meet Microsoft, law enforcement's happy ~~lap dog~~ assistant.             On WebKit Sunspider, Edge is 112% faster than Chrome   On Google Octane, Edge is 11% faster than Chrome  Ugh. Are we still using Sunspider to determine how fast a browser is?                         Aka censorship. Thanks, Microsoft.   I'd buy that for a dollar.         Super duper disruptive.            Not to mention it's so much easier for businesses to make money in the US because of the huge market. There's no such thing as the "EU market" right now.   This "error" has been done before in other countries on local "Amazon-like" sites. It usually gets quite a bit of media attention, which makes people want to buy more from that site hoping they would *also* get their products for only $0.01 (you only find out about this "error" after you purchase the products, somehow).                              Probably:  http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2015/jul/nuclear-outpace.cfm   10 years ago Tesla, and the EV revolution it started (all car makers now building or considering building EVs), didn't exist.                  I'm hoping it's around $500, as long as it doesn't compromise on the camera (again).   No shit, Sherlock. I still remember Ballmer laughing about the iPhone.         SD820 is coming this year.   I'm hoping it also has Qualcomm's ultrasonic Sense ID sensor.   Told you this was a Snapdragon CPU, not Intel (and this is supposed to be the higher end version, so even if the cheaper LG one has Intel, this is supposed to be the faster one).   I wonder if the IMF is biased (cough dollar cough).   I'll probably get downvoted or have the post deleted for even asking this now, but I think it's an important question to ask.  "Bitcoin" is relatively easy to memorize and talk about for most people. But I feel that "Ethereum" is too strange of a word to use "in the future" in daily conversations (assuming Ethereum will ever be that successful that everyone will use it in one way or another).  Forget Americans for a moment. What about foreigners? How easy or "normal" do they find talking about Ethereum?  I just fear that the word itself will be a sort of "invisible break" on the adoption of Ethereum in the future. It could make the adoption significantly slower and perhaps even put a hard cap on it.   Do you really see the word "Ethereum" become as popular and used as the word "Internet" in 20 years? Maybe it will be, but it doesn't feel like it could ever reach that level, because it seems like a much harder and "weird" word to say and write. With Bitcoin or say Zerocash or Bitshares I could see happen, but not with Ethereum.            Indeed. [Coreboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreboot) is a much lighter-weight alternative and it's also open source (Free software, actually). Let's try and force OEMs to adopt that instead (although I'm sure Microsoft will fight it tooth and nail).     There is a Moore's Law for batteries - about 8% improvement per year, which means prices drop in half/density doubles every 10 years. But lately that pace has been accelerating a bit thanks to the rise of electric cars, which have accelerated the economies of scale, and therefore prices have dropped more aggresively. Tesla says batteries prices will drop by 40% in 5 years, thanks to their Gigafactory.  I fully expect price per KWh to drop from the current $300 or so to $100 within 10 years, at which point a good portion of the population (especially in richer countries) will find electric cars (with reasonable ranges) appealing. If we can drop it to under $50/KWh (probably not with Li-Ion batteries though) in 10 years after that, that's when electric cars should start appealing to just about everyone. I thin *most* people will want an electric car with a 100-150 KWh battery. But *many* people (as much as 30% of the drivers) will probably be content with 50-100 KWh batteries, too (200-400 mile ranges for in-city driving).  There IS a Moore's Law for solar, too. Haven't you been paying attention? Solar panel prices have dropped about 50% every 5 years, if I'm not mistaken, in the past period.  You're thinking about it wrong. Like you're expecting the solar-to-electricity efficiency to double every 5 years or something. Kind of like you would've expected the CPUs to double in GHz every 2 years about 2 decades ago. But that wasn't the relevant point, but that the number of transistors would double for the same price, or the price of the same number of transistors would cost half as much.  The same thing is happening in solar. Manufacturing *efficiency* is what makes the prices halven every 5 years or whatever. So yeah, there absolutely is a Moore's Law for solar, too. What matters is not necessarily that solar efficiency goes to 80%, but that prices for solar panels drop from $1/Wh (or whatever it is now) to $0.1/Wh, or even lower than that. *That* is what will cause an explosion in adoption.                  ...we're just going to ask for backdoors instead!                  To what? Exchanging energy credits?   Meh. I'd be more interested in "holodeck-like" experiences, but VR should be good enough for now.               At least that's the official reason.   Just Think Of The Kids.   Daca trece TTIP probabil va fi ilegal pentru guvernul Romaniei sa "discrimineze" impotriva companiilor straine in felul acesta.   Even if they'd stopped, we'd never know since they merged the PC and Mobile groups together.  My guess is they *haven't* stopped, because now they are selling $107-$161 Atom chips as "Celerons" and "Pentiums" in the PC market, which allows them to even give away the *mobile* targeted chips for free if they want.  In my opinion that's quite anti-competitive because for instance they could push Snapdragon 820-competitors into $100 phones, where other ARM makers would have no chance to compete and push them out of the market until they are dead, and then raise prices.  They did that already with the Zenfone 2 where they pushed a 810-level chip (or close to it) into a mid-range $300 device which would normally get something like a Snapdragon 615, and people were "impressed" by what powerful Atom chips can be in a mid-range device - when in fact this was *only* possible because of Intel's heavy (and unfair) subsidies.  You may say, but what's wrong with that as long as I benefit? Well you don't, or at least you won't, because Intel will eventually cut the subsidies, and then because people "want Intel" (like it happened with the heavily subsidized Haswell Celeron Chromebooks) Intel will spike the price and OEMs will have no choice but to continue using those chips.  It's also what they did in Chromebooks. Now people would rather pay $100 for an Atom "Celeron" chip inside a Chromebook than get a $30 Tegra X1 Chromebook, even though there would be no difference architecture support-wise (it's a web browser OS after all) and the performance of the X1 is likely to be much higher, too. - but the "we want Intel" mob mentality.   Considering the new Nexus devices are rumored to have fingerprint readers as well, yeah my guess is it's the 820 with the ultrasonic Sense ID.  We don't know much about the 820 performance yet, but we do know that the 14nm 820 is supposed to be a level about the "mid-range" Cortex-A72-based Snapdragon 620.   I for one am not looking forward for the terrible battery life that Intel Atom gives on mobile and that the Zenfone 2 has as well. And Nexus phones tend to come with small batteries, too (at least the cheaper ones).   You shouldn't. People taking these benchmarks seriously (especially "generalist" benchmarks like Antutu) is the reason why chips like Snapdragon 810 or Intel Atoms exist - "high performance" enough to win the 2 minute benchmark, but terrible for battery life.  	200
 I know this came out 24 years ago but I think it still applies, 1991's Career Opportunities. A nice little comedy i just saw on tv the other day starring Jennifer Connelly and Frank whaley, and written by John Hughes. Reception seems mixed to the film, but being someone who grew up watching John Hughes on vhs and dvd I'm surprised I never heard of this one because to me it's a good film. Not as good as something like Ferris Bueller but I'd still recommend a watch.   The only way I can agree with that headline is if "hungry for more" is followed by "new games".  I just don't see how an improved framerate and resolution warrants excitement for a game that came out almost six years ago.    More like a rant than a review, and that's surprising since moviebob loves to complain about the videos of people like Razorfist yet he's doing the samething here abet with forced amounts of swear words.      I think he's talking about the courtyard Smith fight scene In Reloaded, not the ending to Revolution.   Terrible reviews? It seems to have gotten critical acclaim... if that means anything.   I feel you, man. I just watched the new Terminator the other week with my dad.    How did that movie have such a big budget? I'll let the guys at [RedLetterMedia offer a reasonable theory.](https://youtu.be/fTOL-Ph5SQM?t=101)   You have a good point, Columbus knows what's he's doing. I think it's just my bias against Sandler speaking. But who knows, maybe the film  will meet the production value of its budget. We'll just have to wait and see.    I doubt a majority of that 110 million is actually going towards the movie. I say that because Jack and Jill had a **$80M** budget, and that film looks nowhere close to that figure.     They exist in the same franchise don't they? If not sequel then a successor I guess.    What's your favorite movie?   A part of me thinks they're talking about Sega just having the licensing rights to Alien video games, but I don't know legal jargon so I'm not sure.   For me it's the Greasers theme. If I ever make a movie I'm gonna have a barroom brawl scene with that music. I love it   That's because Ubisoft delivered an inferior game than what they promoted. Bugs, downgrades, a story that's so meaningless that one of the "story" missions serves no purpose other than to introduce the multiplayer features of the game.   I know they've said this times before, but it's been almost ten years since Bully came out. I want another one. I know everyone wants another Red Dead. But Bully came first, and I think they should work on that. Ten years, man. I first played it in elementary school, and now I'm in college. I mean I know it's been five since Red Dead came out, but the gap between Revolver and Redemption was only like six years. I think the world can wait a little longer for some western action.   Are there really no challenge maps? And you can't play as the side/dlc characters outside their short missions? If so then wow.   Well there was a Batman vs Spawn comic, that's the closest he's got to fighting the Devil/or a demon   Hi everybody, I'm looking for some people to play games with. My choices aren't limited to the games listed above, I just put down those four because they're the ones I'm most interested in. Here's a [link to my profile](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016939364). I hope to hear from you guys.   Why is this being downvoted?   Prince of Darkness isn't on par with in The Mouth of Madness, but still give it a watch. You should also check out Christine, John Carpenter did an awesome job with that.   I know it's the first time, it's just that this time it felt awkward. Well atleast for me it felt awkward.   We didn't need to see that scene because the story was about Furiosa and the wive's escape.  Ah okay, I see what you mean.   Alright, I seen the movie twice now and I'm still digging it. The only thing that stood out to me was after Max kills the blind warlord. After Max kills him and the rest of the party continue through the area it cuts to black. I'm bringing this up because it felt unnatural, like they cut out a scene. Did anyone else notice this? To be more precise it's exactly after you see those guys dressed like crows walking around on pogo sticks.   For Lynch I would say Blue Velvet?   Rear Window?   Hm... I'm conflicted, but I say T2? My second choice would be Aliens   Alright, Ima' say 300?    Big Trouble In little China?   Batman?   Barry Lyndon?   Watchmen    Stanley Kubrick, 18   As a big fan of the Breakfast Club I could actually see this working. Nice choices   * Akira  * Who Framed Roger Rabbit * Big Trouble in Little China * Raiders of the Lost Ark * Aliens   no problem, man. lol   ... I didn't ask you a second time, some other guy did.    Shakira  A Colombian singer gains psychic powers, destroys part of a city, and turns into a giant baby-fetus before causing her own Big Bang.   2008's Alone in the Dark. The gameplay is kinda clunky, the voice acting and characters are not that great, and the story is cliche. But I love it because the game itself is fun to play. The inventory system is unique because you can combine all sorts of different items your guy is carrying with you and the game's set pieces are exciting. It's like a B movie if it was given the budget of a major blockbuster.   What do you feel was over explained in Memento? I'm just curious that's all.  	40
    Thanks! Don't worry though - I'm totally with everyone on the annoying mouth sounds.    There's certainly a logic to that, and it sounds like JJ's actual reasoning too (I quote him from the Star Trek director's commentary on this in the video).   The danger that comes with filming it like this, is that you're going against a century of 'action' filmmaking - a cinema language that's developed with and for the audiences ability to read the onscreen action. Going off that path could be more likely to frustrate the audience by making it harder to watch then the more traditional approach.  As for gritty action films - MI3 is about as gritty as he's gotten and he did seem to do well with the action in that.   Yeah I actually have a bone disorder that has altered the bones in my skull, making them encroach on my nasal passage and vision. There's not that much I can do about the nasalness or the pitch, and little I can do about the mumbling. It's complicated is what Im saying.  	4
 Beauty. Beauty is firm, white flesh. Like Mother's. It's everywhere, and tries to stay just out of reach. Is it not a man's right to pursue that which is beautiful in this life? Life is so short, a man must consume that which is beautiful while he breathes?   I found one today, something which is beautiful. I was in line, she was in front of me. I could see her beautiful skin. Her neck, the skin taught over her spine right there. She wore sandals. Her skin there drawing faintly over her meta tarsals.   Her first name was Laura. They wrote it on the Styrofoam coffee cup. Laura. When she left, she got into a silver '04 civic, license plate XTZ 14A2.  Address, Laura Knolls, 1800 Crestwood Road, Apt 202.   I'm looking at it now. Something beautiful is in there, something which is beautiful, and I am so hungry.   Hey, I just graduated six months ago, here's my advice looking back.   Best advice I ever got was, find something you like, something that you can make money and a career out of. Don't waste your time and money on a major that's not going to do anything for you (I'm looking at you psych and history!)   Go to class, do your homework. Honestly, take it easy your first year, let the party animals do there thing, they'll flunk out in a semester or two. By next year, you'll have a good GPA base and be with people who can party and do school. Which is pretty much how must of life is, party when you party, but get your shit done first.   Make some mistakes. Nows the time to. And don't feel some huge pressure to get married when everyone starts getting engaged senior year. Life goes on, you need to figure out who you are before you'll ever be a good SO.   Good luck!   Haha same. Just wondering, what if we could leverage technology to have a better understanding of people's opinions on issues and letting gvmt officials have access to that information. If elected officials constantly vote against majority opinion, maybe time to change?   If you could design a better government with everything we know today and the technology we have available, how would it work? In this scenario, assume you have the land you need to establish your government, you do not need to fight in order to obtain it.         Do you have Uber or Lyft in your area? This is a great way to make cash during off peak work hours. In a busy city, you can easily make 400-500 dollars on a weekend minus your fuel costs. Your son's should be able to care for themselves at nights on the weekends. Survive on what you have and slam this money on your credit card debt, and you will be a lot close to 0 in a year. Good luck, my heart goes out to you.  	7
 I've been on the sea my entire life you see. But worry not,the story of mine starts with no thunderstorms and ten foot waves splashing the deck of my fathers old catamaran. In fact, we made it through one of those last night just fine! Sure, there were moments when i thought the wind will send me flying over the borders and into a salty death, hell I even almost got my head knocked straight of by a rampaging crate that had gotten loose, only to be saved in the nick of time by my reflexes. My ass I'm too old to be on the ship, bet that must have showed them I can still walk that hard walk and talk that smooth talk, but sure they've been awfully quiet all day today, even going as far as complaining about it being cols every time I strolled around. But enough about that, what's been in the past should be left there, even if it was yesterday.   We got off on a tiny Italian harbor, looking just like the one I grew up in. Well I'll be damned, I said as soon as i got off, those church bells look just like the ones we used to throw rocks at to hear them ring, old Augustino and I! Been a long time since I saw him too, something along the lines of cancer or other bullshit they tell you these days when you go to the doc. None of the boys seemed to care for either what I was rambling about nor all the Innkeepers coming to see how our trip had gone, they just pushed through,shoulders wide and still soaken sailor hats in their hands.   I felt not the rush they did. I was just fine with walking around and taking a look at the masses that had gathered around our ship, as if something on it was different than all the rest that docked here every other day. Why on earth do you people take such a liking in the old lady,sure,she aint no pretty gal, but she knows how to keep her head high in a storm!    All these years and you still havent learned when to shut up?   I turned around towards the ship just in time to see two familiar faces, Augustino and Francesco, both my childhood friends.Sheesh, time sure didnt take a toll on either on them, they both looked as young as I remember them, even Francesko who I heard from some fellow sailors was battling some disease he caught going naughty in places he shouldn't have. Must have also kicked the shit out of it while at that, or at least proved those labcoats were just bullshitting again, judging by his looks.   The fuck are you two doing here?Is this some kind of a reunion I came late to?    Well you certainly are the last one to come Vinnie, but fuck it, you sure did choose a more fun way to go than either of have! Augostino said that through a grin that almost made him choke on his own words.   What do y-   As I have said that, a coffin was dropped from the Ship in front of me, making me realize my reflexes are nowhere near what they used to be.         Riiiiight in the pussy   Oh fuck me,mine was away for 7 and only came back with a few Pijamas and Lever Actions,whats the luck level on him?   My guy just did,seems they use it around 30% HP,so you should be safe   I sent one of my dwellers to go gather resources with 10 stimpaks and 10 radaways,hes been there for 4 hours now and has only used 1 of each and is around 50%hp now.At what point does he heal?Is there a way to force it?      This actually sounds rather interesting. I will definitely put FTL on pc into deeper consideration due ti mods now. Thanks!   Hey,I really enjoyed playing FTL on my ipad. Which game would you reccomend based off of that?   That one was severely nerfed quite a while ago   wow, i never noticed that. Thanks for pointing it out!   That would make more sense, even though when it comes to terramorphous (the thing in the picture) you're basically dead if you're alone at that point   I think you should invest in cloaking and an anti personnel drone, ive never had trouble with the power surge but more with the breach drone jumping in and causing my focus to drift off   Whats up with you and everyone else spamming these trollabot requests? Dont you get thats the fastest way to get it banned from a sub?   Oh I had a similar thought, i knew there were 3 phases but i thought the first was the hardest. Boy was i wrong...   Are you sure? Im convinced that every fight i had with him at that level ended with him knocking me up in the air me dying by the time i hit the floor.   Now that makes me want to play a DECENT* god game    *im lookin at you molyneux   I believe they never ended up fixing that exploit, it should still be out there   Definitely came back after finish new game+ with a full squad, that finally managed to bring him down ;)   You have no idea what my reaction was to getting one shotted for the first time in the game, especially after not having much trouble with the end boss    I see Mladic in there!      I ain't got no type.      I seriously have no idea, but I think the /r/ftlgame is the best place to ask         GW2 is now on sale for dirt cheap,id be willing to buy any game or item on steam for its worth.Message me so we can work this out   Is anyone able to buy me a heroic copy?

 This was published ten years ago. Is there any updated info?   I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I thought the writing here was pretty remarkable. There were a dozen points where I stopped to comprehend the sentence or passage that I had just read. I thought the plot was above average, but maybe not 2 million dollars above average. The end, especially, left a lot to be desired.   Anyway, I guess I'm asking what everyone else thought.    Unless I'm mistaken, /r/writingprompts is mainly fiction. I'll have a look though.    Hey All - I was a college writing major and now I work in publishing. I help authors come up with ideas for op-eds all the time, but when it comes to my own writing I'm kind of at a loss. In the last few years I've written about gaming dynamics, the changing language of the technology age, fan fiction, and, ironically, Reddit. All of these pieces were for major publications and some were even paid. I also have some random fiction in the works.   My question is what would you all like to read about? Specifically at the intersection of writing, publishing and technology. It's been the better part of a year since I've written anything worth reading and I could really use some of that famous Reddit juice.    "RemindMe! 2 days Donation for /r/millionairemakers"      I believe that men who don't wear belts are psychopaths.    Episode 8 of Band of Brothers is the most realistic Holocaust scene I've ever come across, and you already love all the soldiers by this point. Breaks me every time.   Tom, do you have any plans for the next book in the series?   I help run the Product Hunt Book Club at www.producthuntbookclub.com and we cover 4 or 5 nonfiction titles a month. If anyone is looking to expand their nonfiction reading that's as good a place to start as any. DM me for details.    I dare you to tell me it didn't inspire you to put the book down and run around outside. Very odd result, and an author I can't help but think would be proud to hear you'd rather be running around then reading his book.    I just finished Born to Run. What do you think of the idea that human's were designed not to need footwear?   Publishing and media   link me up fam   Yeah he's awesome. That post came out the day I finished the book, so as much as I hate to admit it I couldn't read much more about Musk, especially since the post is loosely based on the book.    I don't typically read biographies, and this one won't be published until May 16th, but I got my hands on a copy and holy hell was it awesome. There were some pieces that left you wanting (very little on Solar City) and a few more typos than I would have liked in a finished book, but man it was great. If you're a fan of Elon Musk you need this book. Beyond that, I found that it was incredibly inspiring, on the level I haven't seen very often. I guess this is a bit of a rambling explanation, but I'm wondering if anyone else has been wanting to read this or if I'm the odd man out? Sales seems to be pretty steady on Amazon.    I loved all four of them, but nothing will ever compare to the first.    It's funny because it's true      Joe Dirt   Was writing the book a lot different than filming the show?      Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's not good. You're judging without reading, which reminds me of an old saying...   How do you know that having not read it?   Has anyone read Loving Learning?      Listen- this is great that you finally read a book and I hope you keep reading and take down a million more. That being said, I'm shocked to see so many people who go so long without reading. Books are the easiest way for us to share our ideas and thoughts and it's a shame that so many people don't take advantage of them.      Netscape friendly layouts. I think you just won my heart.   	29
 Let me introduce you to exaggeration: "a statement that represents something as better or worse than it really is."  Did that help?   Real estate prices are far off from income levels.  Cold as shit.  Not so much to do unless you want to hike or eat grass feed, organic, free range, virgin beef with a local IPA at a cost if $85 a plate.  Just a few big employers.     Yeah, that's exactly what it looks like! At first I thought it was my TV.  Really appreciate it!   Hmmm very possibly. I've seen it on a few videos, but it is possible they were all BBC.  I'll check again tonight. Appreciate your response.   I just finished Ring, Spiral, and Loop and loved them all.  For those unfamiliar, the first book, "Ring", is what the movie "The Ring" is based on. It's horror, and fantastic.  The follow-ups, however, Spiral and Loop, are actually sci-fi novels. I wasn't expecting that transition, but really enjoyed them as they were thought-provoking -- great stories in their own right.  After finishing Loop I learned that Suzuki wrote a follow-up called "S" but that this has not been translated to English. I emailed the publisher of the previous novels to see if there are plans for a translation, but have not heard back.  Do any of you have any idea if this will happen and when?  If you have not read this series, I highly recommend it.   Thanks people. I'm going to do a short term membership and see how it goes.   When I cast from YouTube to my TV the picture in the center is bright, but very dark around it. The bright area is maybe 8 inches across.  It does not do this when casting from Netflix.   Any ideas what might be going on here?  Thanks!   Hi people.  I'm looking to join a health club, and the woolen mill is very close to me, so I'm thinking about that one.  Some questions for anyone who might be a member: - What times are the busiest? Are there any times after work (5) that are not so busy? - What are the people like? - What do you think of the facility? - How crowded is the pool?  Thanks redditors.   I've posted on here before about how lucky I am that Excedrin works for me.  One of the components is caffeine.  When I've been in season I have drank coke or coffee as a preventative. It does help some people, so I'm not surprised.  I get a warning as well, which tells me to do something, mine is pain and tightness in a lump at the back of my neck, which I've heard isn't uncommon to have in sufferers.   39 years old. Only been playing a few months.   It's amazing what some people find that can help.  Glad it's working for you!   I'm very lucky. Once I feel the initial signs, caffeine more-often-than-not prevents it from escalating.   Create an account on snapnames and place an order. They may be able to grab it at expiration.  If someone else orders then it goes to auction.   You're just as in the clear for clusters as for being hit by lightning.  Life is short, go live it.   How are their oxford shirts? I hate ironing...   You don't need advice from us, you need to address your anxiety.  I hope you have someone you can talk to.   Meh. I politely disagree. I think he is surrounded by an incredible team.  Not saying he's bad, but not elite.   Wilson is elite?  Did I not get the memo?   Cold helps me subdue it a bit after it has started (ice or cold showers).   Lund   Try those resistance bands, easier to carry than the kettle bell.   The Mill on the Floss. Nothing happens...   Sounds very frustrating, I hate that shit.  I don't have an answer, but try totally uninstalling and reinstalling.   Typical for the AI of that game.   I find single player Expert unplayable due to the AI. They seem to like to watch me die.   Awesome, easy to focus on that.  But....how long until I notice a difference? I work out virtually daily.    Thanks for replying. Appreciated.   Hi r/keto,  I'm new to the keto-way and have a question that I hope someone can answer.  Short background: I'm not looking to lose weight, just my gut. I work out, but my gut is stubborn and doesn't seem to want to shrink. I thought lowering my carbs might help.  So, do you think I need to hit 20g to see the benefits? Can I just reduce my carbs, but maybe go for 40g?  I read this "Another method is to choose a carb goal between 15-50g/day (20g is a good starting point)" in the Gdoc, which got me wondering how important that 20g is as a milestone.  Any help is appreciated.   That site would be more effective if it treated the subject without words like "waddle."  By being respectful and debunking her, the writer might save more people from her lies and manipulation.   Have to admit I'm a little concerned because if Wallace also goes that's a significantly different corps for Tannehill to get used to.   No, it's more like how when you eat Taco Bell it comes out as Taco Bell.   Because at one point he was doing something related to cars on it.   This brought me to tears.  It's familiar, but only in a way.  I do know how tough it is. It's like a death, a death that keeps dying every day.  I hope you find happiness.   Vermonter checking in.   My mind is blown.   The key term might be "operations".  As an operations manager I can see how he wouldn't impact players or coaches.   Sucks about your stomach. When I've talked to doctors about other issues they've always pushed ibuprofen, and never flinched at taking even 9 at a time, which I thought was a lot. I had one doctor even tell me I could take a "fist full".   My god, you are strong. I don't think I ever got more than 1 a day.   Sorry to hear about your health struggles. I hope things are looking up for you.   When "in season" (that's what I would call when I was having the stretch of time when I was getting them since they were seasonal) or during the chronic phase I was always tired. After an attack especially. If I had one during the day, which wasn't uncommon, I was a zombie for the remainder.  I wouldn't drink when I was in season, since alcohol is a trigger. Having a drink at lunch was a sure way to hell. Having a consistent sleep pattern was important, and even felt like if I exercised too much, or did anything that might through the pattern off (like a nap), the attacks were somehow worse.  Through some of this time I was married (divorced now), and my wife was very helpful. She would get ice for my head, massage my neck, whatever I needed. There were times when we had company and an attack came, and I would go hide for a while. I would emerge and say I wasn't feeling well, and probably seemed very off.  I've been very private about the headaches, very few people know about them (not even my parents or brother do), as I don't like bothering people with it. There's pros and cons to that. The attacks are ugly, it's not something I want anyone to see or worry about. But then, in season, I would go about life with what felt like a shadow following me, waiting to strike, and obviously no one would know what I was going through.  Not sure what else you might be looking for. Happy to help in any way I can, especially since I've wanted to get into film myself :)    I got my first migraine in the middle of my green belt testing in Tae Kwon Do (at about 25), and had no idea what was going on with my head and had no experience with these kinds of headaches. I managed to get through it by running to the bathroom and drenching my head in cold water.  After that I got a number more that week, and so went to the doctor's. After a number of tests was diagnosed with migraines.  But they very quickly changed.  One night I woke up and the headache was markedly different. It crept up from the back of my neck, the left side, up through the top and side, then to my eye. That knife in the eye and side feeling. The pain was unbelievable. I couldn't do anything but clutch my head, squeeze it, and cry out.  Those continued nightly and so I kept a journal to try and figure out what was going on. The pattern became obvious, they were seasonal. I generally got them 3 months on and 3 months off. After researching, I discovered clusters and it was a match.  I went through a chronic stage for a couple of years, the headaches daily. However, I'm EXTREMELY lucky in that Excedrin actually works for me, if I take it early enough. I typically get a sign that one is coming by a unique pain in the back of my neck, where I have a very noticeable lump, which I hear isn't uncommon for clusterheads.  After the chronic stage it was back to seasonal. Then went a number of years without any at all. For the past few months, though, I've been getting them seemingly randomly.  Good luck with your film, and keep us updated on it. I'd love to see it.   It's more convenient to say it was the North Koreans.   will that make it so that when she hits the accelerator the hood won't move?   Yea, wasn't my intent but I knew how it would come across.  Point was more that everything matters, even when you have the best QB ever. And, Shula wasn't his only coach.   Ah, facetious it was then.   As you were.   I like Tannehill but I think it's dangerous to say it doesn't matter who will coach him.  I can think of a few elite quaterbacks who never won a Super Bowl. One of whom is very close to our hearts.   er...or he has a winning record because we will play weaker divisions, so Philbin gets an extension, and then 3 years after that he's fired.   I found it funny. Don't like that it happened, but it was hilarious. Maybe that's just what he wanted, some humor.   Very happy that we don't have to face a Rex Ryan led Jets team anymore.   That sounds right.   I also remember a play where a receiver was tackled out of bounds by a few players, everyone was hustling around, and Wallace was just walking away like "whatever".   Wish I could find the play. To me it just sounds like he didn't have his heart in the game.  Let's suppose it was a coach's decision...wouldn't you expect your supposed best receiver to be up that coach's ass during the game to get back in? Either way this doesn't look good for Wallace.   You ever work with a guy who nods his head in meetings?  That's what Philbin does.   Ironically, Dan the Man is more tan than Tanmarino.   Your response doesn't offer anything productive, you offer nothing to actually discuss.    I can't really disagree with you. It must be very difficult working on footwork with a 350 pound guy on you.   Ah, didn't know that's the origination of it.   Nothing wrong with changing your mind, in fact it's a sign of an open mind. Nothing irks me more than someone with an opinion whose mind can't be changed with evidence.   As the submitter of this post I felt the need to circle back:  http://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/2h3aa1/guys_we_need_to_talk_about_tannehill/  As someone who was skeptical of Tannehill, I have to say that the past couple of months have changed my mind, and I believe it is because he has actually improved.  His accuracy does seem better, even on the long ball. I've seen just as many long passes just dropped as I've seen possibly bad throws.  We've talked a lot about how bad our o-line is, but every game that goes by I'm thankful that it's Tannehill at the QB position. Other quarterbacks would turn to jelly. Remember Carr? He became shell-shocked from being sacked so much in his early career. We are very lucky that Tannehill, somehow, manages to improve while having literally 2 seconds to make a decision before being clobbered.  Yesterday's perfect passer rating by Geno Smith (jesus that was hard to write) makes it clear we have a lot to work on on defense, but priority 1 still has to be the offensive line. Tannehill needs the time to throw. Not only is he still towards the top in terms of sacks, but even when he isn't he is throwing the ball in what looks like a frenzied black friday at Wal-Mart scene. It looks less and less to me like Tannehill is holding on too long, and more like he is constantly pressured. Yes, moving around the pocket can help, but the line needs to improve too.  Anyway, I'm pumped in what I've seen from Tannehill the past couple of months and am looking forward to having him as our QB. I'm on the fence about Philbin, I don't see him as a winner, but that is what it is.  Lastly, and no offense, but "the Passmaster" just doesn't do it for me. I think another nickname is needed.   That's a bold statement. Looks to me like it's really just Wallace, who is a deva. No one else does this, so why paint the entire team that way?   Holding my breath only because I don't want Tannehill hurt   Could've hit both though.   Can't tell on TV. So it'll stand   She nailed Landry?   Naw, he deserved it.   Or last year...GMs pick the players, coaches put them on the field.   They tried. Applebee's said they were not interested in a manager that would send the janitor out on the floor to take orders.   I'm sure i'll get downvoted but this doesn't bother me at all. If you're the leader, and you're so good, you can still win. I don't see it as impacting the fun at all.   Does it happen to you?      Anyone want to play Counter Strike?   Another year under this oline and he'll move like Marino   You're an asshole.   It won't let me read the article :(   Why reward him?   Clap your hands everybody And everybody clap your hands For Lambda Lambda Lambda and Omega Mu.  ...it goes on but I don't want to type it all.   I can definitely see why he can't be that person. The team has routinely lost the games when the playoffs were on the line.  As for injuries...Ngata was out, Rice suspended, they had excuses too. It's not like Tannehill and Wake were gone.   It's not crazy to want to find the guy who can coach us for 10 years and not 4.   Please not Jim Harbaugh! I know the appeal because he goes in and wins for a couple of seasons, but the trend with him is he starts to really get under the skin of those around him. Long term it isn't worth it. I've other people give excuses about media hype, but where there's smoke there's fire.  I would be really disappointed to see him come to the Dolphins.   That's right. Until WE DO IT, we are not there.    That was heart wrenching. My best to your husband, your son, and you.   At least someone hates us.      How dumb do you have to be to not communicate with neighbors about it?  I'm sure Jesus would have hidden like that.   Where the fuck was the pressure on Manning? You're telling me we couldn't get creative to help Wake and Vernon get to the old man?  That was the difference in the game IMHO.   So he's King of the Hill?  As in Hank Hill, or the game you play as kids?   Ybba.com  Studied there for years. There are some issues with some of the leaders, but the head instructor is good.   I prefer NameCheap.com. A little cheaper than GoDaddy and I like the domain management system better.  	85

 The limit I think is like every 5 minutes, so if you just wait in between postings.  Could be wrong though.  But if I were you follow the advice of where to post, but post in order from largest to smallest subreddit.   I guess this question was spurred on because I have adhd and was looking for an app that could help me stay organized, focused and motivated.  There isn't any one app that does that, but there are several different apps that combined can do those things.  So while spending 1 to 5 dollars isn't a huge deal if you are buying several different apps and not sure if you will use them it starts to add up.  But my question was more why did it end up this way?   Let me rephrase I don't want to pay for an app before I know I would use it.  So say I find a 5 dollar app.  I don't want to spend the money if I decide I don't like it, which is why a trial period would be nice, or if I'm trying to determine between two similar apps.   Since this question encompasses both android and iOS, tablets and smartphones phones I thought it made sense to post here.  In the 90's and really before smartphones hit the market, the model for new software seemed to be offer a free one month trial and then you could buy it if you liked it.  Why is the mobile market so different?  Why instead of using ad revenue or a just buy it model isn't there more options to trial an app?  There are a lot of apps I'm interested in trying but don't want to pay for them to find out I don't like them.  Or if I'm trying to decide between two similar apps letting me try them so I can decide which one I like better.   This also doesn't seem really fair to developers who are either forced to offer it for free or make it have in app purchases so that people will actually download it.  Just curious if anyone has any insight here.   Plus iniesta is probably better than anything Real have for working in those tight spaces and setting up the attacks for msn.   I also do Airbnb so I do have other income streams but it gets much slower in November to April.   I am trying to do a startup and have freelance SEO be my income while working on the startup so i think i will be good about the other aspects of the job.  The one concern that you bring up repeatedly is getting paid.  Do you use some system for recurring payments?   You mind elaborating on how you charge them?  By the hour?  Monthly fee for ongoing SEO?  Or do you just do quoted projects for them?  Edit:  Also how do you get paid?  Do they mail you a check every month?  Or do you have some sort of automatic billing setup?   I am in the US.  But freelancing sites can offer income a lot sooner than building reputation around the area I live.  I don't disagree with what you are saying but I don't think I can afford to just try to build locally.   What up guys, I have been doing SEO for 4 fours and never really dived into the freelance world.  I am a bit burned out by my job and would like to work freelance.  I know of sites like Elance, but there seems to be a lot of competition on there from places like India.  How hard is it to get started freelancing and any suggestions on the best way to go about it?  And what kind of money can you make?   Don't make this about you   Well who can argue with such an unbiased source as the Orkin man.  It isn't as if they stand to profit in any way at all from misinformation.  I bet you believe pop tarts are part of a balanced breakfast based on their website too.  Do you think vitamin water is healthy too?   Ahahaha you sound like a real piece of work    Nope I'm not, I just don't freak out about small things like op is talking about.   Three cockroaches isn't bullshit conditions its three cockroaches.  You need to roll with the punches on Airbnb. You get what you pay for and that's a much cheaper alternative to hotels that won't be to the same professional standards.  I live in a house built in 1899 I sometimes have mice, I clean it and take care of it but shit happens.   Your holier than thou attitude in this whole thread is extremely off putting, you sound like a real peach.   Eh fuck off.  I stayed in a hotel in Mexico that had lizards in the room.  Did I freak out?  No it's fucking Mexico.   	17
 I really liked it. The reception's been pretty mixed on Rotten Tomatoes so far, and most of it has been because of how predictable it can be at times.   Honestly, I didn't really care if the movie didn't break any new ground for the boxing/redemption genre. It was engaging, shot beautifully, and the actors were phenomenal (cue Eminem) in their roles. Oona Laurence did exceptionally well as the daughter.   Bottom line - great film to check out if you're into fight films. And arguably even better if you're not too familiar with the genre just because of how accessible this one felt.   I'll be here to answer any questions you guys have on the movie!  Synopsis: As the boxing industry begins seeing a decline in ratings after the fight between Pacquiao and Mayweather, executives begin engineering a genetically modified hybrid boxer to attract viewers. But when things make a turn for the worse after the new experiment goes on a rampage, it's up to pro boxer Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his raptor hype crew to rescue the industry from certain extinction.    We get the force we deserve   **MY WIFE DIED HERE**   **THEN YOU ARE LOST**   Depends...   Funnily enough, that's exactly what I had it renamed as on my Facebook page.   'Kings   Queens' was a favorite of mine by 30 Seconds to Mars back in the day.    Sakura Micron Pens. Hands down. They're what I used. Get the 8 pen pack off of Amazon!   Absolutely. If you guys want them!   It's going to take a bit of time - I'm still touching these up and finishing more as part of a set.   I'm working on Blue right now!   So the "Kings" was in reference to them being the two rexes ("rex" meaning "king" in Latin) on the island.. and I was an idiot for not realizing how that'd conflict with the queen thing before I hit submit with that title.   I'm probably pulling a Kanye and changing the title when I think of something new because now it's bothering me too. Thank you, by the way!   I am - I put my name and website up on the side of the artwork (hopefully it's not too obnoxiously placed).  Thank you, by the way!      Haha I was going off the "rex" (king) in both their names! Believe me, I still had a hard time choosing between that and "Queens".  EDIT: Okay, I'm starting to regret the title. I'm going to pull a Kanye here and change it.   ..Whenever I think of a good one.        I don't know this.    This clears up Trent Reznor's win for me. I was beyond excited when *The Social Network*'s score got the Oscar, but at the same time surprised considering Trent utilized two tracks from his Ghosts I-IV recordings for Nine Inch Nails.      The "official" reason for the I-Rex is to introduce something new and unparalleled so park attendance would rise, yeah. But if you go back and listen more closely to the things Dr. Wu and Hoskins say, there's a different story.  Remember how Wu couldn't disclose the information to the guy that literally *owns* the park? The cuttlefish DNA for camouflage was one of the things he didn't tell. It was part of the modifications he made to the I-Rex for InGen's military agenda. The I-Rex wasn't built like a damn tank to "up the 'wow' factor" at a theme park at all; it was built to win a war.    Jurassic Five   Jurassic Park 6  Park 7   I remember getting the same exact chills when the original theme by him [played at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEKA6rmVfW8)  I don't know how Williams does it.   My parents literally went to their first  ever midnight premiere for it, and I haven't seen them enjoy a movie so much since we bought the first on VHS.   It wasn't an Oscar contender by any means, but it was still the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time. And that relieved the hell out of me because I don't know how pissed I'd have been thinking about how I spent from elementary school to the end of my college career  searching up "Jurassic Park 4" had this thing pulled a Chinese Democracy      You just went and banned a subreddit? Probably not a good idea.      The park's been open for years by the time this movie takes place. And within years, people tend to forget a lot. Hearing about a tiger mauling a man or a chimpanzee ripping off a woman's face doesn't stop us from going to the zoo.    Someone please GIF that.   *DISTANT ROAR*   **SHE'LL KILL ANYTHING THAT MOVES**   I'm seriously regretting listening to 'Our Rex Is Bigger Than Yours' right now because it sounds like the backdrop to a complete spectacle.     *You've got to mean it, Harry...*   Rian Johnson confirmed.   You just went and made a new alien? Probably not a good idea.   To me, we've been breathing it for centuries.   MY NAME IS ALAN GRANT, AND I AM THE SMARTEST PALEONTOLOGIST ALIVE   Well, how bout it, Hank? Should I let you go?   The [opening scene for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1](http://youtu.be/uffmqrjaSh4). It establishes the movie's departure from the others in tone perfectly.   I love how the music transitions as Hermione walks away from her home. Right when the title pulls up, it immediately shifts to a feel of "now shit's about to down."   YOOOOOOO that's my poster on number 6 WE MADE IT FAM   For you   Whoa. I liked The Lost World, but it always felt a HELL of a lot longer than the first movie.    I just had a mental vision of a velociraptor going 'papoy'...   uuuu   Thank you. Haha that's pure Indominus madness - the thing's jaw is literally supposed to open up to a 90 degree angle [[SPOILERS]](http://i.imgur.com/NotXoH6.jpg). I think they're really trying to push for its unnaturalness.      I went off leaked images and screenshots from the trailer. The two dinosaurs I mentioned are the ones supposedly used to create the Indominus Rex in the movie, and I wanted to try my own take on what that could have resulted in.   Yeah, it doesn't exist - that's where I saw a fun challenge to take on.    Thanks!  Typically on movie posters they put the director's name above the film title in really fine print. It's part of all the credits that get written on the poster. Colin is still pretty new, but his name doesn't go up there to help market the film too much - that's why it's always done in really really fine print.  But if I did want to market it with someone's name, then I'd definitely highlight it more. Like you said, though - Colin's still relatively new to the game so he normally wouldn't be treated like a household name just yet.   The problem with saying "Steven Spielberg Presents" is that he's only an executive producer for the film, and the authorship is usually credited to the director. If I wanted to market Spielberg on this then I'd say something in bolder letters like "From the producers of *Jurassic Park* and *Transformers*".  TL;DR marketing is weird.   Damn, thank you! They don't even need it; the recognition would be awesome.   They are. The arms were a lot bigger in my original drawing (and more correctly placed in terms of anatomy), but had to be adjusted to fit in the circle. The [original movie's logo](http://i.imgur.com/uPNp7UO.jpg) did the same thing with the arms of the [skeleton on the book's cover](http://i.imgur.com/UKs7lN6.jpg).   Oh absolutely. It parallels the first film by making the logo of the theme park the logo of the film itself. I'd have been a bit frustrated if they went with anything else.   Thanks, by the way!      I'm guessing the placement for the "Damaged" tattoo was done to make a twisted pun. Brain Damage.    ***TYRANNO SEASON APPROACHING***   Are they moving?   Keep in mind that the title of the movie (in America, at least) is Batman v. Superman, and not Batman vs Superman. I think this movie will be more a battle between ideals than pure strength. The "v." would make sense, considering that'd make it more of a civil dispute than a cage match.   WHERE MY THUGGERS AND MY CRIPPERS AND MY BLOODERS AND MY BROTHERS   Much Five   Here's to you, Phil.   Lol the dude's name is PhoneFanatic1   ..The... the video..?   Hell, even then, Kanye's still diverse with his portfolio. His records get influenced by everything from Nina Simone to films like Ghost in the Shell.  He understands his niche, but he's a lot less likely to be afraid of stepping out of it every now and then.   Did they sample the tripod's horn from Spielberg's War of the Worlds?  	58
 Pain never goes away, you just get used to the emotions so much so that people don't usually see how affected you are, except for sometimes when you crack a little. I always found it funny that people think we have to be crying or something to show we are in pain...   Yes, this only the beginning of my story, I needed to lay the groundwork to be able to tell the rest so that you would all understand the "why" of how things have turned out.  	2
 You can't read, and comprehend a bill in half an hour. This still means that the senator received the bill around 3:10, how the fuck can you comprehend and read a bill in that amount of time? A 1000 page highway bill. Oh wait, you can't.    He certainly doesn't pretend he's a libertarian, he's came out and said he's not. Nor is he a social conservative, I pay very close attention to Dr. Paul's campaign and he is far from a social conservative. And believing that the government shouldn't be involved in marriage at all doesn't make one a social conservative.  Cutting government waste is different then "cutting social programs on the backs of the poor" We don't need to be paying social security benefits to millions of people over the age of 112, simply because there aren't many people above that age; we don't need to be paying dead people. That being said, we shouldn't be eager to just waste money on programs that fail or are ineffective.   This is what happens when the state decides what to teach kids.      You have to realize these senators have NO time to read these bills. 1000 pages long and in the case of one senator, it wasn't done printing 500 pages at 3:30 when voting was at 4. If I were in office, I'd immediately vote no on anything I don't have enough time to read and comprehend. Bad and destructive bills get passed by glossing over important facts.   Let's not forget that his proposed bill raises corporate taxes and lowers taxes for middle and low income households.    Yeah, but he still has. Increasing defence budgets and military spending directly creates more veterans. Something he supports.   This is true. He is the definition of a war hawk   Yeah, you could put on another 20lbs of muscle and look great   Cut hard   Height? Body looks fine but I'd say cut to get more definition, but if you want more mass than bulk   I peggle ur mum      Lol so I'm supposed to let my shit and money get stolen because I value some fuckers life who doesn't give a shit about mine? I have a right to defend my life and property   It's not killing for no good reason if someone poses a threat to you, your family, or property.    Crime rates aren't that high because of the wealth disparity. That we really don't have, actually neither of those, crime rate is dropping.   Go audition. But then they won't want you getting bigger    Damn. What happened?   Someone going power mad, insane, or "flipping" out.   Arms looking dope though.    I bet you swim in female genitalia.   Damn that healed amazingly. How did you manage the gainz with that thing?   So you're a Calvin model?   Sick fuck!   Chest and hair definitely improved   No joke. Someone in the community needs to make this a machinima.    Because that always works lol  Edit: /s   Senators are right. But the lack of competition is simply due to over regulation of the industry.    A good little lore question to ask would have been about the hellspartan program. Always intrigued me.   I found it really cool that they have a plan for her.   Okay. This are your tent partners, it's against BSA rules to not have a tent partner    He might be an ass. But if water was privatised in some form, I guarantee we wouldn't have water shortages.    I love bioshock   This makes me more mad than it should.   True halo patriot, doing Marty's work   I want a second forge world. And that's what it looked like it was. :(   Whose your candidate for President?   Not going to lie, you look gay.   It has like 400 unexpected upmartys. I don't think it needs help anyways.    Do it. Bet you won't.    Fuckin brutal.    TL;DR: Don't vote for Jeb or Hillary.   You are the child of my Makers. Inheritor of all they left behind. You are Forerunner! But this ring... is mine!   Wait, where can I access the 360 views of the rooms? Or did you do that   She's bought out by wall street.   It was a short add-on campaign. I loved the gameplay, art, and atmosphere, I was disappointed because I was expecting something more.    ODST was amazing for what it was. It was disappointing only because I expected a normal halo game, but paid 60 bucks for an add on   Or OP is full of shit   This isn't a good thing. How is undermining the Democratic process a good thing?    Well, technically, it's the french flag at the moment.   Isn't it a dildo fetish?   He kept telling us to read the sidebar. Like, who does that?   Shitpost   That would be cool. Like a "great article of the week" sticky post   You a Gull apologist boy!?    Freedom. Freedom is winning. The Eagle looks like it doesn't even give a fuck.       So people really do that? Send you dick pics out of the blue? Lmao   Lose the hair. It really looks bad. Get better hair then come back   I really like Let's joker...   In short, he's living in a dream world full of free everything and unicorns.   He thinks raising the minimum wage significantly is actually going to help people other than corporations, and he demonized deodorant choices to make the argument for starving children. He doesn't realize a lot of things.   And they are all racists who hate gays, the poor, and black people. - Salon   What about xbox users?   This is precisely the reason they don't have ramps and platforms; so people don't "ground pound"            Yeah, that just happened to me. I get a gaggy/vomity feeling on occasion. It's a mental thing; just relax and drink water or milk.   Bulk. You and me are very similar, slow bulk and fill in   See kids, this is why capitalism fucking wins.   How was it a time of crisis for Reddit? What was the issue? I keep seeing this but I'm not sure what it means.   He's stated this multiple times even before the supreme Court decision. He needs to appeal to a conservative base while maintaining (relatively) libertarian principles. Which this is a belief libertarians have held for a long time.  When asked he could have said "I support marriage equality, but not in the way liberals support it or conservatives denounce it. I'd get the government out of marriage all together." But he needs to appeal to conservatives if he wants to have a chance, unlike his father. So he said "I want to get government out of marriage all together"   It's politics. If he said it like that, some news pundit would sensationalize the title to opposite side, losing him vital votes. That article was deliberately worded to make him look bad, just as his answer was deliberately worded to appeal to conservatives.    Would you believe she's over 400 years old? Looks great!   The best thing for the poor is to keep the government small.    Didn't this already happen with Zola?   And get the fuck out   /u/chooter    Dead atmosphere  That's disappointing. I hope it changes   That is ridiculous.   So how is Bowen House? What should I expect?   No I haven't.    So female admin? That's cool   Damn. I'm on mobile   What's your instagram   So what does the triangle mean?    FRANK:This series is artistically going to share a lot with Sequences previous style, so youll see some continuity for sure, but the scale and fidelity of the animation for this is more ambitious than Sequences already gorgeous, dreamlike tradition  and this is fully animated and mostly 3D. Its just a lot more work, and not just in animating, but in shading and texturing the painterly style. Its hard work.  Thank god   He's like this with many issues. Conservative on surface, but it's really libertarian.   Maybe some social issues. That's it, there so far apart on everything, like poler opposite. Tl   I wouldn't say that. Most states were either legalized or going to.    Then bomb them   He's so meta I can't even take it   But here's the thing, he's polling extremely well within the GOP. Actually leading it.   He supports the government not being involved in marriage at all, almost the same as his father.    This is ridiculous, Sanders is so far away from anything libertarian its laughable. Sanders is a big government statist.   Bulk   I'm not sure about eight years, i think it should be significantly longer than that.    Not a btb map, but all of New Mombasa streets from ODST. It would be so fun fighting through that city.   Why not? I literally said basically the exact same thing and you think I'm wrong. Maybe you should re-read. I never said "it's totally ok to burn innocent people's shit". I said I know why it happens, and it serves the societal purpose of bringing attention to the unheard, as it has always done. People getting mad and starting shit brings change.   Then why would you quote him? You quoted him to disprove my point about riots not being a good thing from his perspective and it didn't work. And you didn't say what I said, all you said was " interesting"  Rephrasing what I said doesn't change it: People getting mad and flipping tables changed shit for the better.  Protesting changes things for the better. Rioting does not, it causes more problems than it solves. Like millions in damage and people's lives.  One of the above is either not true or you contradict yourself.  You cherry picked what I said, I was referring to rioting. Obviously destruction of property is justified when protecting ones self, other lives, or more valuable property.  I don't get where you thought I value property over lives, like I said before, this is about senseless riot destruction not using a precious vase to disable an attacker.  At any rate, you're already deep into illogical land anyway, as you've decided no amount of damage to people is an acceptable reason to damage *property*. So hopefully you'll be letting all your loved one's know you'd never shoot an intruder who only wanted to rape and kill them, because shooting him would damage your property with blood spatter, and you've established "stuff" is worth more than "people".  Again, that wasn't ever my point. People have a right to protect themselves and their property, rioting doesn't count as such. That intruder I'm shooting could very well be a rioter taking advantage of the lawlessness so rioting and destruction is even further unjustified.   My point was and has always been, that it is unjustified to destroy someone else's property to further an agenda to bring "change" because in reality you end up hurting your case and innocent lives in the long run. How would you feel if rioters destroyed all of your shit? "Oh no it's okay, it'll bring change and a national discussion on the issue" even though most rioters couldn't give a fuck and just want to steal your things. Either way, it's my property and my decision whether to get blood spatter on it and I'm not intentionally looting and destroying someone else's things, I'm defending my life or someone else's.   I don't get where you thought I valued stuff over people? I can be against senseless destruction of property that actually hurts people's lives while valuing life itself. You grossly misunderstand and exaggerate the point I'm trying to make. Furthermore, I don't quite get how justifying the destruction of property in riots is valuing people, it's just selfish because it's an idea that your cause is worth more than someones property and in some cases livelihood. Someone being shot by the police doesn't justify a *person's* small business being smashed to shit and the destruction of a community.    So you like MLK? He knew better than you too:  "It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.  Yeah. That *is* interesting coming from someone that advocated no violence whatsoever during his **entire movement**. Don't mistake his understanding of why people do what they do, for acceptance of it. Because that's not what he's doing. Do you even understand what he's saying? He says that it's bad and he feels empathy for those that riot, but he clearly didn't approve of rioting. I mean c'mon, he's legitimately known for nonviolent protesting.   And exactly what it has taken to enact change, over and over again. Boston Tea Party, Kent State, Stonewall Riots.   The Boston tea party didn't put forward much change directly if you didn't know. It just pissed off the Brits, and they enacted the Coersion Acts that was meant to punish the colonists. THAT is what pushed real change; reactionary government legislation that led to the creation of the Continental Congress. Like I said, Ben Franklin directly disapproved of the BTP.   Once again, rioting at Kent State didn't cause any change. The government *shooting* brought national outrage. There was no private property involved unless you count that statue.   The civil war is the immediate example that springs to mind. According to your quote above, abolishing slavery was to the detriment of life and freedom. Most of my black neighbors would disagree.  What? They weren't a car or a piece of land, it was a controversy since it started because they are sentient people, and slavery wasn't abolished by uncoordinated rioting and property destruction (it was a side affect, but done by the Union Army). It was abolished through a movement, military war, then a proclamation in that order. Are you trying to advocate that it would be okay to kill and maim slaves (if this were 1850) in a riot to try and affect change for the "greater good"? Because what I'm trying to say is that it isn't okay. And the points you make are contradictory.  You can't use the slave - property argument to justify the destruction of property in a riot. But I digress, private property is essential to freedom for obvious reasons. Slavery wasn't right and they were ALWAYS an issue in regard to being property. Semantics. The destruction of private property is never justified.    This is exactly what I want. A darker, grittier, more dramatic Who. With true evil and the darker side of the universe. But o know it won't happen because it's still a kids show.    Let the market take it's course.    I want stats too. I'm hoping it and forum support come with halo 5's release. In the mean time, Reclaimer Stats is a really good third party app that has everything from 360 to MCC.    When you get it going, post your IG and I'll follow you. Look into competing in bikini.   No. You misunderstand the point. It doesn't make logical sense to go destroy someones property to further a pumped up political agenda that can be solved, debated, or protested peacefully. Often times it ruins lives, makes the agenda look bad, and costs millions of dollars for *rarely* any change, but rather increased force and backlash. What does destroying that family bakery down the street solve? What about that old man's Buick? You think he can afford a new one on SS checks? Or the SUV that the young couple with a kid just took out a loan for and gave a down payment; hmmm now their new 2015 Honda is burnt to shit because some dick was "protesting" the system.   The mentality you put forward is selfish at best, delusional at worst. If you need force to push your political ideology, you have a shit ideology. Personal freedom and life relies on the idea of private property and respect for others, something MLK and Ghandi recognized when they protested. If anything, it's a detriment to life and freedom when some self righteous asshole thinks he helping the greater good by destroying someones livelyhood, investment, or property.   So no. Salon isn't right, and they're full of fucking shit. Of course I get downvoted for presenting ideas opposite of the /r/politics hivemind.   That wasn't my point; don't put words in my mouth, nor do I like Jeb. I didn't read the article but this wouldn't surprise me. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that salon is so ridiculously biased liberally. So it's not out of question that this would be too. Do you really think that news outlets with an agenda (like salon) doesn't twist the words of political opponents? They do. It's naive to think they don't.  Edit: Just read through the article. It's so filled with liberal bias it's not even funny.   No. I don't, it was a destruction of property non the less. Even Benjamin Franklin thought it was ridiculous and that the East India Company deserved compensation. Destruction of someone's property is never acceptable regardless of how justified you think your political agenda is. It really reflects on how liberally biased this sub is.  	107

  You seemed to assume that there is a 'real' "100 Greatest Films" list out there in the ether  I don't, so we can drop that. But I do think that art has value, and I think that criticism has value in as much as it preserves and promotes the value of art. This is my starting point. If you'd like to argue for artistic and critical nihilism, then I think that's a perfectly valid closed system, but it's not engaging with my view.   I think this is a very good case for what might make the film *interesting*, particularly to a Hitchcock devotee, but I don't know that any of that amounts to "greatness," you know? Tommy Wiseau's [*The Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCj8sPCWfUw) is unquestionably the work of a singular voice, it does everything wrong according to Hollywood standards, it ends in tragedy, the protagonist is kind of nuts, there are several scenes that defy logic--and if I were a critic looking for kicks, I might even call it a deconstruction.  But art can move minds and hearts, if can fuck up your week, it can make you reorganize your life; that's something film is capable of, and that's what I need a great film to do. And I just don't see how the idiosyncrasies of Vertigo approach anything resembling greatness--that's the view to change, I'm afraid.   I understand what you're saying, but I disagree. The process of good criticism is finding sense, meaning and truth in the dreamlike ephemera of art. Essentially, I'll consider my view changed if someone can make me *want* to see this movie again--and they'll need to draw on substantive evidence if that's going to happen.   For what it's worth, I'll bet you could read the entirety of my post before Kim Novak leaves the museum.   Here's the thing: I used to like the movie as much as you did, but then I saw it for the 135th time, and I hated it--as B. Kite later clarified, "Once you've watched *Vertigo* 135 times, the flaws become pretty tough to ignore."   Just kidding, of course--but perhaps you appreciate what an unconvincing argument that amounts to. If you once held my view and then saw the error of your ways, then let's talk about *that* process, my friend--that's what we're here for, right?  To clarify my point, my issue with Vertigo's canonization isn't that the polls were counted improperly: I simply don't understand what any of these individuals were thinking when they selected it, and I  disagree with the collective result on those grounds.  Finally, to argue against the existence of greatness is to argue against the whole process of creating a film canon, which doesn't intrinsically disagree with my premise: if nothing deserves canonical recognition, then Vertigo doesn't either--but that strikes me as a bit of a departure from the topic at hand either way.   I've seen the film a total of four times over the years, for whatever that's worth. I disagree that film criticism isn't rational; I think that the case for or against a film's value can and should be based on evidence within the film and through relevant inter-textual comparison. Lastly, my problem is not that this film is experimental--I love a great many experimental films--it's that its idiosyncrasies don't amount to much in the way of art.       This CMV is inspired by the fact that I coincidentally rewatched *Vertigo* the other day, then saw yesterday that it was [number 3 on the BBC's top 100 American films of all time.](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films) It also replaced *Citizen Kane* as Sight   Sound's [top film of all time](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/sight-and-sound-2012-vertigo-citizen-kane_n_1729685.html) in 2012. I argue that it has no business in either or indeed any canonical place of honor, and that it is not a great film.  First, this movie is unjustifiably boring. I don't object to a film adopting a deliberately slow pace, but there needs to be some substance within it that merits focus and reflection: the languid sequences of Jimmy Stewart following Kim Novak all over the place, their witless, surface-level courtship scenes--it's a whole lot of poorly paced nothing.  On a related note, I see precious little truth in this movie. Stewart's obsessive "love," while commendably acted, is ridiculous in its premise, particularly when it's undermined entirely by the finale: in discovering that he's had the woman he "loved" beside him all along, he doesn't love her any more? I suppose a generous reading might have something to do with romantic projections and the feelings of betrayal they can inspire, but it comes at the expense of Kim Novak's character in a huge way, and it indisputably chucks any investment in their romance out the window. There's very little in the end to give any sense of who she *really* was underneath it all, rendering her love of him and his love of her a shallow, ridiculous bit of dramatic puffery that wasn't worth the hour it had demanded.  Thirdly, this flick is a mess in terms of tone. Remember that scene where the Midge character tried to give Jimmy Stewart a self-portrait? It's either a strange and ultimately unresolved dramatic beat, or a particularly cruel comedic one, and I don't like it either way. There are mysterious elements, but they don't make for much in the way of dread; there are romantic elements, but it amounts to nothing more than the myopia of any given teen crush. By the time one arrives at the end of this film, one is seriously wondering what it was all these disparate elements were supposed to add up to.  Fourth, I don't think this film is all that special visually. I'm more than willing to give it credit for the retrozoom, but I don't think that that one flashy move has had nearly the impact of, say, Orson Welles's deep focus photography or Eisenstein's montage or Godard's jump cuts or Keaton's multiple exposures or Disney's animation or basically any other visual innovation you can think of--in an art defined by its optics, that one neat trick is decidedly on the gimmicky end of things. Beyond that, I'd say it's a good-looking film, but not particularly extraordinary in the context of  its predecessors, its contemporaries, or its successors.  And finally, narrative film is capable of a great deal more than anything *Vertigo* aspires to. Even if this film were a visual masterpiece (it's not), there's no reason why screenwriting as a medium should be held to a lower standard than any great play--try watching *Death of a Salesman* (1949) and then this; try comparing it to *Waiting for Godot* (1953) or *A Streetcar Named Desire* (1947), and tell me which of those works is addressing the human condition. If this turgid romance is the best that film has to offer, then that's embarrassing.  To put all my cards on the table, I should also acknowledge that I perhaps unfairly associate *Vertigo* with a particularly tedious neo-Freudian school of film theory. Somewhere along the line, film theorists became obsessed with Sigmund Freud and his disciples, and subsequently never made any effort to advance their understanding of the human mind in keeping with contemporary science (David Bordwell's cognitive approach to film studies being one notable exception). *Vertigo* was once a selection in an Art Film class I had, and the professor went off on some rant about how this film's dream sequence incontrovertibly symbolized castration--yeah ok buddy.   And I have to say, I think that has a lot to do with why this movie has found favor with contemporary critics: its trite engagement with fetishization and sublimation allows certain critics a canvas on which to project their niche fascinations, and makes them feel important for knowing the "code." It's an artificial barrier between the academic and the laymen that has far more to do with subculture than capacity for intelligence or insight, and critics devalue their vocation when they allow themselves to get caught up in that stuff.  *All that said*, I enjoy liking things, and if there's a way for me to like this movie, I'd very much like to find it. In its favor, I think Jimmy Stewart is a very good actor. And the colors are quite nice in places. And that retrozoom, bravo. But measuring *Verigo's* faults against what the medium at its best ought to strive for, this cannot be considered a great film.  _____   *^edited ^for ^typos.* _____   *Hello, users of CMV!

As a single 26 year old, there isn't too much fanfare about it.   That has to be some kind of milestone, haha.   Oh I agree that a difference of opinion doesn't make one nuts--thus my acknowledgement that there is an intellectual debate to be had on the issue. Framing it as an issue of totalitarian enslavement, however, *is* nuts and I'm pretty comfortable calling it as much.   I hear what you're saying, but my issue is with the means of *enforcing* rights. I don't take it as granted that a state mandate to provide a service allows the use of force on its subjects. Imagaine a world in which we have exactly two rights: the right to an education, and the right *not* to be conscripted into teaching. I don't see that as a contradiction, I see that as an obligation for the state to non-violently incentivise teachers until the right to an education is met.  Of course, it's easy to imagine a world in which the right to an education isn't met, just as it's easy to imagine a world in which I'm murdered in spite of my right to life. All the same, our inability to provide a 100% success rate has no bearing on whether or not there's a moral good to striving for that right.  Another point of diversion might be that I don't really see rights as immutable or intrinsic. I'd go so far as to say I've never encountered a coherent secular defense of intrinsic rights, though I'm absolutely open to hearing one--it would make my ethics a lot cleaner, to be sure. For Rand and for the framers of the constitution, I suppose it comes down to the Creator; for me, I wouldn't presuppose a Creator's existence let alone Its intentions--that would seem to tie rights up in a whole mess of apologetics that I've yet to encounter any ironclad answer to either.  That leaves the idea of rights in a somewhat arbitrary place, but that doesn't mean they don't have value so long as we believe in and abide by them. If there are two people on an island, I would think that their rights are as simple as what they can agree to provide for each other. For me, I would think it imperative to provide medical assistance to the best of one's ability if at all possible. But maybe I'm on an island with Rand Paul and he doesn't think we have that right; fair enough, in that case we don't.  Basically, rights are so difficult to pin down philosophically that I can't help but think about them practically.   I guess I'm just not seeing why violent conscription should factor into philosophical rights at all. In a world in which all teachers and doctors are unwilling to provide service to the poor, I would think that that would be an example of the state failing to follow through on a right that it had promised--we would need to rethink how to incentivise public work certainly, but it wouldn't even occur to me that we should violently chuck the service provider's liberty out the window.   I see it as a right very much on par with education: teachers aren't conscripted at gunpoint to serve in low-income public schools, they do it because they have values that transcend a market-centric approach to existence.   Look, whatever a man wants to personally endorse in the privacy of his own home is fine with me, but that don't mean I gotta *like* him for jibber-jabberin' through a bunch of dehumanizin' semantics on the TV.   Well, he's kind of nuts, isn't he? [Here he is side by side with alternative Reddit favorite son Bernie Sanders in a back and forth on health care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXwDMqjC-A)--there's a substantive intellectual debate to be had about whether we have the means and/or obligation to guarantee basic health care as a fundamental right, and then there's whatever the fuck fantasy scenario he's going on about there.   "You are the universe in drag." A simple sentence that somehow unifies the cosmic, the sociological and the personal; it really did affect my personal engagement gender and identity. Fantastic interview.   Racists aren't big on nuance.   You subscribe to an "Intelligent Deign" theory of capitalist  socio-economic oppression, I see. I'm inclined to think that it's self-replicating unconsciously, myself--just the same gold old-fashioned self-perpetuating evolution that runs everything, continually selecting for single-minded commitment to continued growth every quarter forever, narrowing the pool down to a smaller, specialized more efficient elite year by year; silly bastards probably have no real concept of poor people, why should they?   His work has especially resonated in the humanities, no question. I think a lot of the beef with him as an ostensibly scientific figure is that so much of his work was wildly unfalsifiable. That's broadly considered to make for pretty bad science--truth be told, I don't love it as a dominant mode of thought in the humanities either.   The OP is emphasizing multiplayer, which absolutely does make a difference. Setting industry stuff aside, a century from now a person will be able to dig up Game of Thrones and engage with it in full as a piece of art/entertainment--not so with Team Fortress or Journey. That doesn't apply to all games, but the collective experience is something that games *can* do in a way that film and literature can't, it's been around for as long as the medium has existed, and it is in turn pretty central to its identity--games just can't sustain ongoing, organic multiplayer forever. It's kind of like theater in that regard: you can read Shakespeare, but you can't go see his theater troop at the Globe.  By thew same token, I think the answer is to "mount a revival" every once in awhile. If a group of like-minded gamers want to explore multiplayer gaming history, they'll have to organize it themselves, either online or off. It just requires some extra effort and coordination.   Sure, and I respect where you're coming from--I think that in the end we might just each be concerned with different issues at the moment, but that that we probably have a lot of common values nonetheless. Cheers.   I don't know if or to what extent you have a personal history with gangs or drug abuse. If so, then I suspect we share a deep sympathy for those most deeply affected by the illegal drug trade, and for the social and chemical pressures they're up against. At the same time--and I apologize if it sounds callous to say so--one's experience doesn't give one any more licence to make up statistics than anyone else. I understand where your number is coming from and the philosophy behind it, but you're claim that drug dealers are directly morally accountable for the deaths of drug users is an opinion, not a fact, and mixing that in with objective claims is deliberately misleading.  To your other claims, though, gang members definitely don't "jump at the chance" to kill cops, it's not even remotely in their self-interest. That's always been reason enough to doubt this sensational claim, and now that somebody's actually bothered to ask those accused and they refute it, that's the side that reason leads me to.  And to your main point--which I missed because you never got around to making it, my friend--American law enforcement, throughout history and right up to the present day, has not systemically earned the trust that you're giving them, flat out.   Call it what we will, I think we both understand that it's a made up number, right? Over or under, you guessed it and stated it as fact without clear terms or citations. I appreciate where you're coming from factoring drug and alcohol related deaths, but that is certainly not a "direct" killing in the sense that murder is.   And it has jack squat to do with this highly publicized threat of a gang conspiracy to murder police officers; that's what the department is currently stoking fear of, and what my comment was about. Drug dealers, terrorists, and falling pianos all kill people, fine. That doesn't make any excuse for racial fear-mongering in our heavily armed police force.   I have to ask, why bother fabricating the number 600? The actual number of homicides, 445 in [2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results) and [2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=all race=all cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results)  combined according to the Baltimore Sun, is plenty. The percentage of those deaths that are black men--[198 of 235 in 2013](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2013 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), and [173 of 211 in 2014](http://data.baltimoresun.com/bing-maps/homicides/index.php?range=2014 district=all zipcode=all age=all gender=male race=black cause=all article=all show_results=Show+results), for a total of 83% of all homicides--is certainly a staggaring number, but it's definitely not 600 directly drug-related. Why reduce your own argument to a 60% exaggeration?  And why are police doing the same thing? With an *actual* murder problem to contend with, why spin a bunch of idiot kids fucking up the protest downtown into a crips and bloods gang conspiracy?  These exaggerations are created by fear, which they then in turn perpetuate. And that fear puts fingers on triggers, which in turn creates only more death and mistrust. That's not the only problem in America, but it is the one I'm talking about right now.   Here we go again: a well-armed, government-backed police force scares itself silly over angry young black men based on rumor, assumption and self-pity. This is characteristic of the same fear that killed Trayvon Martin for wearing a hoodie, convinced that cop in Ferguson that Michael Brown was a "demon," shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice for playing with a toy gun.  Now every beat cop in Baltimore is convinced that there's a young black gang conspiracy gunning for them. Racial paranoia combined with deadly force--we've seen it before, we see it now, we'll see it again. And next time it goes to trial, once again we'll hear how the officer "feared for their life." And we won't take a second look at where that fear came from.   Well, your other option would be to obey the law--you know, "play by the rules" and "be part of society," all that other moralistic horseshit with which you folks so casually justify the suffering of the poor. Then again, that sort of thing has never sat too well with "you people," has it.      OP: c'mon it's not that seeious.   All due respect, that's nonsense. People should be allowed to talk about sex with whatever level of frankness they want. What wound up being unintentionally hurtful here was that she was saying one thing to her friend and another thing to Fiver here, a little more loving frank talk with him might have enabled them to build a more honest and fulfilling sex life from the start.  To OP: your dick is fine, it's not broken, it's not deformed, but it's also not magic and that's okay, it's just a dick like everybody else's. Somebody loves you, don't fuck that up stressing about your dumb dick.   Bearing in mind that you're free to process life how you choose and that we'll all live and die confused anyway, I say fuck magical thinking.  Explore and understand who you are and what you wish to be. Feel the pain and the pleasure of making choices, of working hard, of creating meaning for yourself. Don't settle for easy answers; stare down the beautiful and the horrible, the things you can control and the things you can't.  And, when you're ready, imagine a world in which there was never any magic--*not one bit*. Somewhere in the vastness of infinity, there was an inevitable, beautiful little fuckup of a chemical reaction that sought out patterns in the randomness, and that's what all the fuss has been about ever since.  And you breathe it in and breathe it out. And it might feel wonderful and it might feel awful, but neither feeling is forever. And your lungs take in the oxygen and release the carbon dioxide, and plants grow out of the ground and rain falls out of the sky.  And what comes next is completely up to you.   Maybe it wasn't *quite* as bad as everyone said, but it sure wasn't good. Rather than pay off all the choices you'd personally made along the way, it just plopped the same big arbitrary, enigmatic choice in front of everybody. And then, *bafflingly*, the option to destroy all synthetics allowed your Shepard to live--never mind that organic/synthetic peacemaking had been a cornerstone of my story. It removed all stakes from your prior choices, then utterly failed to explore or even *explain* the stakes of this new, unrelated choice, the most meaningful demonstrable consequence of which was a shift in color scheme over a fairly artless closing cinematic--for a game that had up to that point been all about making meaningful decisions, that was a big old fuckbotch.     Hmm. Well, either your kids' curiosity gets the better of them when you're not around, or you wound up with a scummy sub. Either way I'm sorry you went through that, and you can at least take solace in the fact that most subs won't need to be told this stuff.   I think most adults would be capable of putting that together. Kids, on the other hand, might be eager to unwrap presents without as much thought toward proper ownership. I think it's quite possible that that's what went down here.      ...  that might be *the* most cringe-worthy edit i've ever seen. Yikes.   Well, yes, that is *literally* Filmmaking 101, and CK, who's been some kind of filmmaker for however many decades now, has his own style.   *Louie's* drawn out sequences nearly always emphasize performances, with the result being that even minor characters in his unsteady world are given weight and reality--I'm thinking of the surrogate in the hallway from the Season 5 opener, and the incredible dynamism that the actress is allowed to display within just a few minutes.  Those sorts of scenes may seem simple, but they require a lot of discipline, a lot of vision, and a lot of talented collaborators; I think it makes for incredibly compelling comedy.   This is an intriguing approach to personality in that when extrapolated, it sort of extends the same treatment we give philosophers to every Tom, Dick and Harry on XBox Live. I mean, how many times have you read about a thinker or artist whose personal life seems totally incongruous with the philosophy of their work? Yet in the end, any big name in thought invariably refers to a philosophy rather than a biography.  While it's obviously a stretch to consider the Navy Seal tough guy internet persona a philosophy, there is a sense in which it occupies that same nebulous space in which Rousseau abandoned his children and wrote "On Education," John Lennon espoused love and was by all accounts terrible to his loved ones, communist thought is so often a pastime of the idle rich, etc. There is the person making dumb animal choices in some unavoidable social context moment to moment, but there is also the collection of ideas that they *choose* to be when free of that context--it is so entirely and deliberately who they are that they fabricate the identity completely.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that one or the other is the "true" version of any given person, but I can certainly appreciate that line being blurred--and why *shouldn't* the matter be just as complicated in everyone as it is in the academic/popular/historical upper echelon?   Mm hmm. I think that attitude speaks volumes: if it doesn't reinforce your worldview, it isn't real. My grandpa's illness and my grandmother's sacrifice are so negligible to you as to be hilarious, while "speaking generally" about how women want "money, gifts and jobs" is some big fucking truth that the world can't handle. Get your shit together, man, that's no kind of person to be.  I'm getting the sense that, bottom line, I grew up around and seek out intelligent, self-sufficient women; you seem to live in a different world. And you're right, the "real world" you've sunk yourself into doesn't make much sense to me--personally, I think you ought to "red pill" the fuck on out of it.   What the fuck are you laughing at.   That's a funny word, "sacrifice." When I think about it, the first thing that comes to mind is how when my grandfather got Alzheimer's, my grandmother gave him in-home care through a heartbreaking deterioration across several years until it finally took his life. So when I read the claim that men bear all of life's sacrifices for ungrateful women, I have a hard time thinking anything other than "go live a life you dumb fuck."   Listen my friend, I don't know who you are, and I don't know who you think I am, but you're saying a lot of very grand things that don't have much baring on what I'm trying to express.  I'm speaking in support of an approach to men's mental health that addresses uniquely masculine issues without ceding the valuable progress toward gender equality that women have made. You're... I don't know. You're a fan of competition and of "REALITY," I gather.   But you're not really talking *to* me, at least certainly not about the things I'm talking about. So if you want to talk, let's talk. I'll listen if you will.   Disposable isn't actually the key word: it's a bit semantic, but there's a significant difference between calling men **a** disposable population and **the** disposable population--one is about an issue a group faces, the other situates that issue in opposition to the outsiders' issues. And something as small as that can make the difference between inviting and excluding your potential allies, you know? It can mean the difference between engaging with others and festering in one's own anger. **Words matter.** And  the more one accentuates exclusionary language, the more alienation one takes in and puts out.   I'm sorry, I just have no idea where you're coming from with that. [Men complete suicide at a rate three to four times that of women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_differences_in_suicide#Rates), and to neatly tie *all* of that suffering in with the misplaced anger of the "men's rights" thing is just careless in every sense of the word.  I can forgive the temptation to homogenize it all though, simply because the angry people are loud and the more benign sufferers don't feel they have a voice--and of course there is some significant crossover, how could there not be. But my point is that one need not (and obviously *should* not) be a misogynist in order to support better health care for a vulnerable population. I think we should find a way for advocates and sufferers to talk about uniquely male problems without crucifying women, and I think that that's a conversation that a lot of men out there are waiting for.   Yeah, I was trying to have a conversation about compassion, and you came in with some spiel about how competition is the essence of life. Unrelated, misanthropic.   I think that what your talking about is a very real phenomenon: a Great Male Anger that can barely keep track of what it's angry about, because that might mean confronting the injustice of its entitlements; it instead rails against some fictive hyper-powerful feminism, and is now parading through this thread in full force.  I *don't* think, however, that that adequately accounts for the astronomical male suicide rate. There is also a Great Male Sadness that affects men like the father described in this article; it doesn't seek special privileges so much as identity and understanding. And I'm frustrated to see the ignorant anger drowning out the gentler sadness in conversation, here and elsewhere.   My friend, there's no other sense in which your interjections jive with the conversation:  Some guy:  It IS harder to be a man in today's society.  Me:   my point is that it's not a competition.  You chime in:  This statement flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that nature , life, evolution, etc is nothing but competition. [...] Pretending this isn't a fact is the basest form of ignorance.  I'd counter that the basest form of ignorance might involve cherry-picking context free sentence fragments from a conversation about suicide as a platform to launch into your unrelated platform of general misanthropy, but you do you.   Life is a competition between men and women as to who is more victimized by modern society, and pretending otherwise is the basest form of ignorance. Cool. Got it.   Well, if that's all you're saying, then you've said it, I've heard it, have a good one.   Well, it's clearly a statement of opinion. *But anyway.*  I don't know that I'm following your point. How does the privileged status of women, as you perceive it, affect society's ability to provide better support for men in any meaningful way?   I'm sure many people agree with you, and many people disagree with you; my point is that it's not a competition.   I think there's a lot of poignancy to your last paragraph, about how young men are being prepared by their fathers for a world that doesn't need them. I also think that that poignancy stands on its own, and that contrasting that issue with feminist concerns or lamenting the support available to women wouldn't add anything to your well-made point but a superimposed binary conflict. The funny thing is--and I say this with my tongue at least partway in my cheek--I literally can't think of a better example of a group being let down by patriarchy than what you describe. But elsewhere in this thread, I see men leading with that sort of male/female conflict, dwelling on it, even reveling in it a bit.  So that's a subtle distinction, perhaps, but it is an important one: there's no reason for male advocacy to be advanced in opposition to the gains made by women. When men start this conversation by saying that it it's an inevitably binary issue, or that men are "the disposable sex" and women by extension have it better, it seems to be picking a weird fight with the wrong people--particularly given the issues that women all over the world have faced throughout history and continue to face today. We should celebrate the emotional freedom and support afforded to women, and seek it for ourselves without resentment.   I really appreciate your articulation of the problem here, I don't know that I've ever considered it with such clarity--I've often just opted out of the subject because I couldn't imagine identifying with all that rhetorical toxicity. It certainly is sad to see such bitter, aggressive, tribalistic ugliness dominating a conversation that ought to revolve around compassion.   MediaMonkey looks promising, hopefully that works out. Thanks a ton!   It seems that podcasting is getting bigger all the time every day and all that, and yet there still doesn't seem to be a decent PC podcast player. iTunes has that non-optional "feature" where it continually stops updating feeds that you only listen to occasionally, and it autoplays all your old podcasts  in reverse chronological order unless you build a playlist or put it on shuffle--it's just an inexcusably idiotic setup for a major corporate software release, and I'd like to delete that shit once and for all.  Problem is, there seems to be at least one or two equally boneheaded shortcomings in every alternative I try. This is all I need a podcast grabber to do:  * **Download episodes automatically for offline listening** * **Play episodes from within the program** * **Stop playing when an episode concludes** * **Clean up old episodes once a certain amount of time has passed and/or a certain number of new episodes have been released** * **Arrange individual feeds alphabetically, and the episodes in all feeds according to most recent release**  That's it. Thing is, *nothing* on PC seems capable of delivering on all five of those requirements. BeyondPod works great on Android, but I do a ton of listening on my laptop while working--each unhelpful iTunes update just drives me nuts all over again.  **So, what halfway decent programs are out there right now? Surely there must be something.**   quick response, thanks!    I'm reading what your saying and blasting holes in it  **Oh please.**  Listen, the fact that we're still arguing about this stupid stupid movie means that we're both crazy. We're two lunatics talking past each other into the void, a cruel parody of any attempt to find meaning in art in the metamodern world. Fine. I accept that, and I hereby embrace it.  I only ever wanted to say that there are plenty of valid reasons to dislike the movie, and to remind *Chappie* fans that their beloved robot friend exists in a world of dominant critical standards and personal subjectivity that allows plenty of space for a negative reaction. The critics aren't crazy, they needn't have their heads up their asses, nor did they see a different movie as so many have suggested. That's all. I never wanted to ruin it for anyone.  But fine! Let's ruin it! Let's "blast holes" in any and every excuse you want to make for it. *Chappie* fucking sucks, and you shouldn't enjoy it; enjoying it is incorrect. You want a nutso crazy person internet argument about a shitty movie? *Let's get nutso.*  **I stand by my central point: your reaction to the character of Chappie will make all the difference in how you respond to this film.**   That whole journey from a baby to a teen to an independent adult thing? **Bull Good Goddamn Shit.** That idea of expedited growing up isn't bad in itself--that's why it's such a well-worn premise--but the execution here is just ridiculous. Chappie maintains the same preposterous mix of intelligence and idiocy through the entire fucking movie, advancing and regressing at random in whatever contrived direction the plot needs him to go.   **What teen or adult talks like that? Seriously.** [If Chappie is any sort of adult, he is an adult baby weirdo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbqV20PwNP0#t=1m18s)* When the story needs him to be smart, he's capable of transcribing consciousness. When the story needs him to be dumb, **he's all kinds of precious about auto theft and knife crime.** Rather than provide Chappie with an *actual* arc toward maturity, the film continually falls back on the **low-effort pathos of shallow cuteness**, because the game as up as soon you see past it.  And hey, remember those two minutes where Chappie was going to become a painter or something? Neil Blomcamp sure doesn't **"Chappie, you must always be creative!" What a fucking joke.** The big payoff of his journey into adulthood is to solve everything with guns and brutality. That's a dropped plot line, a lazy resolution and a really shit moral all rolled into one right there.  Which reminds me: ***is* this movie supposed to be for kids? I had no idea.** It was rated R in my country, which means it's intended for adults and that children can't be admitted without a guardian--I sure as hell wouldn't want my kid internalizing all this grisly, glorified, consequence-free violence. **We're either selling paramilitary gun worship to children, or we're selling Mommy Daddy Doodoo Baby bullshit to adults. Fuck all that.**  So, that is the context in which we arrive at all the plot holes. **CONSCIOUSNESS. DAT:** I think I've said my piece on that, and only wish to add that **that development is not trivial, it is not the tiniest of things, it is the climactic resolution of the entire goddman movie.** I mean... just... fuck. There's making your peace with the little things, sure, but then then there's consciousness dot fucking dat.  **Your explanation of that walking out with the key thing:** Here's what I'm imagining: if I had a star employee who made my company billions and who I really respected, he'd get an office instead of a cubicle. I wouldn't laugh in his face during his proposals. I might go out of my way to ensure that no other employees threaten him with a fucking gun on company property during work hours, and might facilitate swift disciplinary action if an episode like that ever transpired. **Nothing that happens in the film indicates anything like the relationship of respect you're describing.** But even if it did, you still ought to take that one and only robot army key pretty goddamn seriously. Some kind of contingency plan for if it goes missing, some kind of GPS tracking or something. I mean, it's a security company. Just... just... fuck! You know? That's not a small thing!  **Anyway, I'm tired of thinking about fucking *Chappie*.** If you want to keep doing this, then I guess you can "blast holes" in another one in five of my arguments, and I can write another essay tomorrow night because I'm crazy. **Or** maybe we can do the friendly internet handshake, and I can go back to thinking that even if I don't like the movie, it's fine if others do. Maybe you'll agree that disliking *Chappie* is perhaps a not entirely unreasonable position, that even if you liked it, it's fine if others don't. That's all I really want, man. Can we do that?   nbsp;  ^* ^all ^due ^respect ^to ^the ^adult ^babies ^out ^there, ^we're ^all ^weirdos.   Mmm-hmm. So, you're trying to push me toward an extreme position here, and I'll not have it, thank you. I didn't say transcribing consciousness into one big file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT was tautologically *impossible*, I said it was a groaner, and given that it's facilitated by a being who can't get a handle on impersonal pronouns or how murder works, I think "groaner" it putting it quite mildly.  And that isn't *one* detail that I'm "blowing out of proportion," I've only ever characterized it as one laughably implausible plot turn among many. The movie's dumb, okay? I'll go that far. It's a dumb movie, and dumb movies only work if you're having a good time. I didn't, because none of the characters resonated with me, and Chappie actively annoyed the shit out of me.  And please, look at the substance of my argument rather than nitpicking it: if you had a good enough time with this movie to overlook its flaws, then good for you. But its critics are not a bunch of fun-hating obsessive compulsives who took against it because we're full of hate or something. A lot of sensible, joyful, movie-loving people think this movie sucks, and *Chappie*-lovers ought to make their peace with that.   The issue isn't whether a bunch of consoles could provide a quick and dirty mainframe; it's whether they can unlock human consciousness in a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT--sorry, that's a groaner for me. But as I said, you'll either be charitable or uncharitable toward that kind of thing depending on whether you're charmed by the Stabby Baby Mommy Daddy Gangsta stuff, and I just wasn't at all.   ...  What are you talking about? Is anyone paying for your opinion?   Not at all, I love movies.   Not at all, just making a case for my reaction to the movie.   Well, that does explain why so many people never realized that this movie sucks*[OHHHHHHHHHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/r73VJe3.gifv)*   If that's your bar for "compelling as fuck," then again, god bless. Just appreciate that it isn't everyone's.   Quick remider to the *Chappie* street team on here:   *If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.*    *Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.*    -- [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)  So. Listen *Chappie* fans, I'm glad you liked the movie. Life is hard and you have to take your enjoyments where you can get em--I don't want to deprive you of any happiness.  *BUT* I don't think it's any great mystery why a movie about an **idiot baby-talking gangster** didn't land with a lot of people. If you saw a compelling character there then that's cool; I saw **Jar Jar Fucking Binks with a knife and a gold chain**.  How you respond to the character probably goes a long way toward how you then feel as the dingbat sci-fi elements pile up, and sweet jesus do they ever. 98% artificial intelligence... just a few red bulls to go! A bunch of PS4s unlock a transhumanist paradigm shift that fits neatly into a file called CONSCIOUSNESS.DAT. **"You know that one and only key to our entire paramilitary robot army? Just bring it back when you can, please."**  Chappie has the entire internet in his brain, but can't put together what's going on when he robs and stabs people--and boy howdy, this ostensibly heroic robot sure does perpetrate a lot of dumbass violence, doesn't he? **Yes, I get that he's only hurting/killing people because he's a fucking moron. No, that doesn't endear him to me.**  I won't say you're wrong for liking this whatever-the-fuck-it-was, but you are, my friends, very *very* wrong if you think this movie is unassailable.   Is that meant to be DVI? If so, I'm interested!    Hey Nashville, anybody have a PC monitor that they'd be willing to part with at a low low price? I'm setting up a new PC on the cheap, and the only thing I really need in a monitor is an HDMI or DVI hookup. Thanks!   Well, let's look at it:  There is a specific reason that this war was the setting of the novel: not because of who America was, not because of who Germany was, but because Vonnegut was there: "That was I. That was me." He didn't write about some greater or lesser massacre than Dresdon, he wrote about the massacre he attended. To the extent that he situates the Dreson bombing geopolitically, it had no particular strategic value and was enacted as the revenge of one agreed-upon conception of a nation against another, perpetrated by soldiers on civilians.  In the face of that massacre (for Vonnegut at least), all geopolitics simply disappeared. And you and I can comfortably think, "well, the Nazi government was doing horrible things, and when you look at these killings against these other killings..." and there's truth there. But this book was about a different truth: a massacre is a massacre is a massacre.  So, it's preposterous to me that this book should have some historical responsibility to *be about* something else, particularly as far as that involves contextualizing military campaigns for christ's sake. "[T]here's nothing intelligent to say about a massacre."  What does the imagined critic want, a chapter on how bad Hitler was? We already know, that's not the point, and those justifications only distance you from the reality of what it actually looks like when you burn tens of thousands of conscious human men, women and children.  You might respond to that with tears, you might rejoice in righteous sadism. You might become unstuck in time, never quite able to make sense of what causes anything again.   Yeah, I'd say any criticism of *Slaughterhouse Five* that so clearly misses the point need not be extrapolated in any sense.   lest they walk away not realizing that [...] we should not cry for them that one of their cities was bombed into oblivion  And I wonder if you missed the point too, my friend.   Lot's of energy and little focus? Oh no! WHY ISN'T MY DOG ACHIEVING!?   While not an expert, I'm a big fan of the 60s and 70s [New Hollywood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood) era in American film. That said, I rewatched *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* the other day for the first time in a few years, and was struck by two things: 1) the film is an extraordinarily rich and sensitive portrait of a very diverse group of white men, and 2) not so much anyone else--Chief has his moments of course, but that's about it. And if someone told me that the movie, for all its sensitivity, was pretty racist and sexist in terms of how it portrayed the much vilified hospital staff, I wouldn't argue with them.  I don't necessarily mean that as a knock against the film, because of course it's allowed to operate within its own scope, and in that sense it's a beautiful movie, maybe even a great one. But it got me thinking about New Hollywood protagonists in general, and how the heroes of that era were so often disillusioned counter-cultural white men, generally straight. When you look at the era's dominant themes of systemic oppression and broken American promises, it seems strange that we've almost exclusively canonized white men as mouthpieces of the movement.  **So I guess I'm basically looking for movie recommendations outside of the hip white male myopia.** What are some films, either of that era or in that ethos, that embody the **themes**, the **poetry**, the **cool** and the **humor** of the 70s New Hollywood outside the white male antihero paradigm? Looking for something different both in terms of the stories told and the people behind the camera, while retaining that subversive, thoughtful and entertaining spirit.   ***Being John Malkovich***, besides being a trip in itself, could easily be read as a commentary on the general practice of altering one's mind; I think you'll find it quite relevant to your interests. You'll also find an engaging mix of profundity and batshittery in ***Repo Man***, ***Eraserhead***, ***My Winnepeg*** and ***Brazil***, while a more demandingly arty, introspective journey might wind through ***Solaris***, ***The Seventh Seal*** and/or ***Contempt***. Approach ***Antichrist*** at your own risk.   Ah, gotcha. Well, it's not my sense that Fry himself is presenting this view as anything groundbreaking; it's simply the side of the argument--ancient as it is--that resonates with him.  To your point though, I can very much agree that if people are calling this "devastating" in the sense that the argument is new to them, they are in fact themselves new to a very old argument.   Seems like we're talking past each other a bit here. To clarify, I'm not making an argument for "relative truth" or some such, I'm only arguing for philosophical charity, and perhaps a friendly touch of humility.  I invoked the Christian plurality here simply to demonstrate that this is a subject that has not thusfar been conclusively "solved" by pure rationality (as in mathematical truths) nor can it really be supported empirically (as in proper psychological theories). There are ways of approaching truth in other studies that don't seem to help us much here--that's not to say that there is no truth, just that we can't know it in the same sense that 1+1=2 or that the Earth orbits the sun and all that.  Because there are still arguments going on within and without classical apologetics, I wouldn't automatically assume that anyone arrived at their position through hypocrisy and negligence, that's all.   Well, I'll bite. Why is a general presumption of intelligence and good faith when engaging with varied beliefs incompatible with the study of psychology?   I don't think that that's fair. Whatever your personal answer to the "problem of evil" is, other people of faith have very different answers to it--it then stands to reason that someone might studiously engage with the question from another angle and arrive at the conclusion that there is no satisfactory answer.  If there were *one* tautological Christian answer then that'd be one thing, but the plurality of Christian responses means that one could in good faith arrive at a non-Christian answer as well.   I'd really like to ask any given stranger what their conception of god is, ask what last moved them to tears, find some secret hope we both share for ourselves and mankind and promise to kindle it in each other forever, and then tell them I love them and really mean it.  It kind of breaks my heart that I can't.   Weekenders! Good show.    Given time the good comments will rise to the top.  That's wishful thinking. A large portion of the internet will always vote for that which most validates their worldview while requiring the least amount of effort to engage with. That will hardly ever be an ideal editorial system, and when the topic is philosophy it's practically toxic to good conversation. A balanced moderation policy is crucial to maintaining any quality aggregate.   Yeah. This is pretty fucking embarrassing.   It's an old expression. As a society, we've really been hot-fucking in the proverbial ass.   While I appreciate the concession, your point clearly does *not* stand--your initial post claimed that they wanted to be "**the** subreddit about gender," whereas their stated goal is literally the opposite of that: to be just one platform, addressing a specific point of view.  It's rude to barge into other peoples' conversations, particularly if you only want to talk about how an issue affects you. You did that to a bunch of feminists and the issue was **rape**--I really don't know what the hell you expected. They owe you nothing.   Funny, it's my understanding that they want to be "**a** subreddit for thoughtful content - serious or silly - related to gender, and intended for women's perspectives."  When you find yourself summing up other people in simplistic terms, a good rule of thumb is fuck off.   I recently busted my cheap android tablet, and the screen has lost most of its touch functionality. I do have a little USB keyboard though, and I've found that I can use that to get through my lockscreen, launch apps, do very very basic stuff like that.  What I'd like to do though, is find a customizable app that will let me use the keyboard to virtually touch different places on the screen. For example, I press "F1" and the device recognizes a touch in the upper right corner, "F2" and it's halfway down the middle, hold "Alt" and it simulates dragging, that kind of thing.  If this app exists, I can't for the life of me figure out which search terms will get me to it. Does anyone know if such a theoretical Broken Screen Helper app is out there? I'd happily give a few bucks to keep this device functional while I search for a replacement.   No idea what any one of those things has to do with the other, but you seem to be on the right track there, champ.   That Jason Mraz song "I'm Yours," the lyric "it's our God-forsaken right to be loved." That's either a hard fucking turn through existential antitheism, or he's a dipshit who was trying to make getting his dick sucked sound important.   I should clarify where I'm coming from here: I wouldn't describe myself as confused about homosexuality (though some here would disagree, most likely); I'm wholeheartedly on the side of LGBT acceptance and equality.  My interest in this thread was more rooted in trying to understand traditions different from my own, and in challenging myself to approach such differences with an eye toward shared humanity rather than ideological conflict--it's why I subscribe to this sub and many other subs outside my day-to-day experience.  I'm hesitant to express my negativity here, because I recognize that I'm an outsider and have no right to expect this community to cater to my worldview, but this thread has been a very disheartening read for me. These are all the same arguments that I hear from American neoconservatives, slippery sloping through all the same generalizations and falling into all the same logical fallacies.  The answers that draw on Sharia and the Quran are the most edifying, but I have little sympathy for what they espouse: apparently arbitrary law, violently enforced--these verses would be right at home on placards carried by the Westboro Baptist Church.  And for what it's worth, none of these arguments hold water if you're not predisposed to oppose homosexuality. /u/socketeer102, the answer I'd give to each of your examples would be to ask what is the good and what is the harm. I don't know any zoophiles or necrophiles. I do have LGBT people in my life though, and I've seen suffering where there was intolerance and joy where there is love, over and over again.  I confess that this has been a step toward understanding, but away from friendship. All the same, I'll continue to look for both.   I'd just like to say that as a non-Muslim, I'm watching this thread with interest. I would love to see some thoughtful, in-depth responses on this subject.   I haven't seen the 2002 version of *Solaris*, but the Tarkovsky film is truly great, and rivals *2001* in my opinion. There's a clear connection to *Interstellar* too in the way that both films address the limits of human knowledge, both scientifically and as subjective emotional beings.   [I googled was disappointed and was disappointed.](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS470US470 ion=1 espv=2 ie=UTF-8#safe=off q=was%20disappointed)   Yup, their whimsical penguin companions can never find love. Real problem in the UK.   [I'm partial to the "fuckin' hell" on Hey Jude, and frequently sing it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzBaI50Oc8)   We sat together at one summer's end,  That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,  And you and I, and talked of poetry.  I said, 'A line will take us hours maybe;  Yet if it does not seem a moment's thought,  Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.  Better go down upon your marrow-bones  And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones  Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;  For to articulate sweet sounds together  Is to work harder than all these, and yet  Be thought an idler by the noisy set  Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen  The martyrs call the world.'  . . . . . . . . . And thereupon  That beautiful mild woman for whose sake  There's many a one shall find out all heartache  On finding that her voice is sweet and low  Replied, 'To be born woman is to know-  Although they do not talk of it at school-  That we must labour to be beautiful.'  I said, 'It's certain there is no fine thing  Since Adam's fall but needs much labouring.  There have been lovers who thought love should be  So much compounded of high courtesy  That they would sigh and quote with learned looks  Precedents out of beautiful old books;  Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.'   We sat grown quiet at the name of love;  We saw the last embers of daylight die,  And in the trembling blue-green of the sky  A moon, worn as if it had been a shell  Washed by time's waters as they rose and fell  About the stars and broke in days and years.   I had a thought for no one's but your ears:  That you were beautiful, and that I strove  To love you in the old high way of love;  That it had all seemed happy, and yet we'd grown  As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.   [Link got busted, here it is](https://terribleisalright.bandcamp.com/track/horror-business-misfits-4)   [Link got messed up, here it is.](https://terribleisalright.bandcamp.com/track/thriller-michael-jackson-3)   [Link got messed up, here it is.](https://terribleisalright.bandcamp.com/track/murder-in-the-red-barn-tom-waits-3)   Well, yeah. See the literal millions of charismatic villains and anti-heroes in every narrative medium across human history.  You're probably more interested in *how* to make repellent characters likable though, which is a tougher question. For me, I think that the most liked "evil" characters have similar desires and motivations to us, but they lack those inhibitors that keep us moral. They're the devil on your shoulder, the id freed from the nuance of the ego.  In that sense, most compelling villains are ironically enough grounded in a relatable sense of righteousness. **Walter White (Breaking Bad)**: we all get sick of taking shit from people, he just pushes it to murder. **The Joker (Dark Knight)**: we all feel like there's something fucked in the regular social order, he just pushes it to anarchy. **Satan (Paradise Lost)**: we all want our freedom, he just pushes it to an unholy war against God Almighty. Villains have a good point, badly made.  The important balance, then, is in making sure the audience has more of a connection to the villain than his/her victims. I think there are two main ways to achieve this, without much middle ground: 1) you give him/her a story so sympathetic that the audience overlooks his/her faults, or 2) you make them so fucked up that their humanity catches the audience off guard and pulls their full focus--either way, the audience should feel that the villain reflects something in themselves. When you know **Professor Snape's (Harry Potter)** backstory, you'll forgive him any classroom tyrany; when **Jaime (Game of Thrones)** puts his life on the line for Brienne, it's such a shift that it upstages the child murder stuff.  **Tl;dr:** To whatever end you make them human, make it count.  	102

 To read what happened before now, go here.  Entry one: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3cw6dx/i_think_someone_is_stalking_me_please_help/  Entrytwo:https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3czvnm/i_think_someone_is_stalking_me_please_help_part/  Im sorry its taken me a little while to continue my entries. I spent the last couple of days at the police station. Ill explain why in a moment.    After getting that cryptic email, I found it difficult to leave my dorm. I spent the rest of Saturday night (and early Sunday morning) terrified, trying to distract myself with weird YouTube videos and upbeat music. I started feeling detached sometime around 3 AM It was one of those things I cant really explain. It was like I was losing my sense of self, bleeding into some foreign form. I tried to calm my anxiety by thumbing through some old scrapbooks and looking at photos of my happy family before the tragedy struck. I loved my Dad so much. Just seeing the pictures gave me a sense of longing and yearning for his voice    For a couple of days afterwards, everything actually seemed okay. I went to class and avoided contact with anyone and everyone that I could. As soon as my last class would get out, Id rush back to my dorm and lock the doors. I repeated this cycle for days. It was much easier than facing the reality that my roommates and teachers thought I was crazy. I got weird looks everywhere I went. Some people still called me Sunny, but I chose to ignore it. After the messages from Ez, I blocked his number. I havent heard from him since.    Around Thursday of last week, some strange rumours began circling around campus. I heard my roommates talking about it when I was eating breakfast in our kitchen one morning. Apparently, a girl on campus named Heather had been missing for a number of days and no one knew where she was. One of the girls in my room, lets call her Sophie, apparently knew Heather really well. She was devastated and had no idea where Heather couldve gone. As soon as I heard this, my mind jumped back to that cryptic email. I was so worried that whomever was stalking me had had something to do with Heathers disappearance.    By Friday, the news had circulated to the entirety of the campus and the police got involved. Heather was nowhere to be found. Apparently, her roommates said that they hadnt seen her since this huge frat party on July 9th. I was at the party, although I didnt remember anything strange happening.    By Saturday, the police began questioning the students, looking for anyone who had any information about her. They took it dorm by dorm. My group was questioned around seven o clock that night. The questioning took place in a room Im fairly certain used to serve as a broom closet. It stunk heavily of chemicals and sweat. You have to know that by the time I got in the room, alone, with the officer, I began to feel uncomfortable. Even though I knew that I had nothing to do with Heathers disappearance, the email had frightened me. Whoever had sent it had clearly meant to intimidate me, and it worked. The questions were all fairly straightforward- Did I know Heather, did I know anyone who would want to hurt her, did I know where she had been at the party that night. I told them that I had been at the party, but had never met Heather. The officer pulled out a glossy headshot of a pretty blonde with large blue eyes.    As soon as I saw the image, something clicked in my mind. I had known Heather as a child. We went to the same elementary school in Florida. I hadnt seen her since 5th grade, though, and had no idea that we went to the same college. I told the officer all of this. Our fathers had been very close and operated a small marketing business together, my dad the President and hers the Vice.  Before he passed away, I remember seeing Heather often at barbeques and company dinners. Her father even spoke at my dads funeral.  I couldnt believe I knew her.    After I told him this, the officer got more and more suspicious. He asked me deeper questions, getting into details about our childhood and the relationship between our families. By the time I was dismissed, it was a huge relief. Later that night, the officers showed up at my dorm. They asked that I leave with them to stay at the station. I was confused and incredibly scared. I had no clue what they wanted with me.    Once we got to the station, they took me into a room with an older and heavier officer. He was very kind and gave me coffee. Apparently, some other students who preferred to be kept anonymous had told them that I may have been connected to Heathers disappearance. Additionally, a couple of teachers had told them that I had been acting strange and was potentially mentally unstable. He told me that my mother had been notified and was instructed to call back later to discuss further plans. I was so scared. Angry that I had been accused, but more than anything, scared. He told me he believed that I didnt have anything to do with it, especially based on my spotless mental health and school records, but they would need proof. Someone that had been with me that night to testify that I wasnt involved. To my demise, I found it difficult to remember what exactly had happened. I remembered going to the party and dancing, but after that, everything was sort of a blur. All I could see in my minds eye was entering the party, bright lights, and waking up the next morning back in my dorm room. Of course, I didnt tell him this. I knew how crazy it sounded, even to me, and figured that if I told him any of it, it would only turn out to be more incriminating. Part of me wanted to tell him about the whole Sunny situation, but as my mental health was already in question, I figured it best not to. I fell asleep on a metal cot later that night.    My mom called the station early the next morning. Of course, she wanted to know everything. I heard the officer talking to her for a while, profusely explaining the situation and apologizing for all the trouble it was causing me and her. Afterwards, he handed the phone over to me. I heard my mom crying on the other end. Sweetie, are you okay? Please, God, tell me youre okay! As soon as I heard her voice, I started bawling. I told her everything, the stalking, the email, the accusations, all of it. By the time I was done, she started to get anxious as well. Summer, I think its time you come home. Somethings going on down there, and I know you have nothing to do with it, but I dont think its safe for you to be there anymore. Ill try and find a way to fly out there as soon as I possibly can, and after I talk to the police, you can come right back home with me. Does that sound alright? Of course it did! I was so ridiculously relieved, and it felt as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.    After speaking with my mom and the school superintendent, I was released to go back to my dorm room. Unsurprisingly enough, my roommates acted really uncomfortable around me. I figure they were probably the ones that had told the cops I was unstable. I locked myself in my room and started packing everything back up. The more I put into boxes, the better I felt. It was wonderful. All of that was gone the minute I picked up my scrapbooks.    My beautiful, kitschy scrapbooks, the ones I had pored over nights ago, were ruined. Torn to shreds. The minute I pulled the box out of my closet and saw the torn covers, a feeling of deep anxiety filled my stomach. With shaking hands, I opened one up. That specific scrapbook was meant to commemorate the year I was 8, right before my dad passed away. On the first page, there was a large photo of Heather and I in third grade. Someone had written EVIL BITCH in bright red sharpie right next to her face. Barely able to move, I turned the page gingerly. More photos of Heather and I, along with some other friends. In every photo Heather was a part of, some sort of sharpie caption followed.  DADDYS LITTLE PSYCHO, MURDEROUS TWIT, and CRAZY BACKSTABBER dotted nearly every page. I was scared to death. I closed the scrapbooks and put them back in the closet. I havent even opened my closet since then. I laid in bed all day yesterday. Scared to move. Scared to speak. I dont even think I slept.    This morning, I got a text from my mom. The earliest flight she could get in is for Wednesday afternoon. I should be gone by Wednesday night. It was some relief, but after the scrapbooks, Im so scared. Someone has been sneaking in. Someone. I dont know who, or how, or why, but someone wants the police to think that I hurt Heather. Im so terrified. A few hours ago, I drove down to the lake and threw all of the scrapbooks in. Even the ones without writing. Just the thought of someone tampering with them makes me not want them anymore. On the way back to my car, I a glint of silver on the ground near the dock. On closer inspection, it was a bracelet, and a familiar one at that. It was mine. My charm bracelet. It had been a gift from my Dad before he passed. It was mucky and disgusting, and looked like it had been there a while. I have no idea how it was out there. I didnt even remember losing it. I didnt wear it when I took the scrapbooks, and I havent worn it for a few days, at least. I started thinking that maybe whos been sneaking into my room took my bracelet and wore it out there. I ripped off every individual charm and tossed it in the water. I threw the chain itself as far out into the lake as I could.    Im back in my dorm now. I plan to stay here until Wednesday. I have everything I need here, and no one can hurt me. No one can sneak in and mess with my mind. No one can make me feel delusional or crazy, and no one can accuse me of anything. I will wait for my mother to come, and then I will leave just as quickly and painlessly as I came. Ill be gone so soon. So soon. I just have to stay sane until then.      	1
 I do not think all service members are qualified to handle pistols in every situation, so they would need to require additional certification. Our primary weapon is an M16 so most soldiers, unless they specifically are qualified on it, are not trained to use them.  So I should clarify that I would support this if the soldiers who chose to carry received the proper training/qualification.        Right around the time most Redditors will be in their 80s and 90s, bionic organs will likely be coming out.... if you have the money to blow, you could probably fight old age for quite some time, and live a decent quality of life while doing so.  We will most definitely reach a point where if society does not collapse, wealth will literally buy you a 50% longer lifespan.   If you can somehow eek out 120 years of life by using wealth later in life to prolong your existence, you might survive long enough to when you will be able to transfer your consciousness and memory to a computer  or new cloned body and be effectively immortal for as long as the technology to keep you alive/store you exists.   http://www.futuretimeline.net/index.htm     Reserves here. All the money for college appealed to me. The extra money per month bridges the gap between a Ford and Mercedes payment, letting me drive a nicer car than what my day job allows.  No regrets. Also just got $10,000 for re-enlisting.     Army Reservist here....most of my unit, myself included, has dad bods, at least 20% of us are probably obese. Maybe 10% of us have six packs and none of those individuals are over 30.   I'm not talking about arming the militia, I'm talking about arming US soldiers with LEOSA (google it, or click the link in my post above).  It would not in any way make us law enforcement or have any police powers, but it would give us the same firearm carrying rights as law enforcement have off duty when in other states and pistol free zones.   I haven't seen one yet because I haven't been to my car, it is literally sitting idle for two weeks. I'm wondering what the odds of one wandering in are when many of the buildings in this complex have them. I am in the midwest though so it's not like Florida where they're flying everywhere and shit, but this place has the really big ones...i.e. same breed as Florida/the south.   So I am staying at this filthy as fuck compound for 2 weeks for Army duty. There are cockroaches in all the buildings, there are also tunnels and steam vents and sewers all over. There is a bunch of junk out here as well. I imagine this is why the area has roaches. It is the midwest though so it isn't like the south, however the roaches I have seen are extremely large and I believe they are American Roaches... which are the same type of Roach the South calls "Palmetto Bugs"  If the car is parked and locked, and none of them hitchhike on me or my stuff, what are the odds one would find it's way inside while the car is parked on a lot surrounded by these infested buildings?  I would say the car is probably 40 feet from the nearest building (that is newer so probably not that infested) and a few hundred feet from the more deeply infested buildings, however pretty much every building on the compound has them so I would imagine they must roam outside at night.   I am in the midwest right now and pretty much every building on this compound has big (2 - 3 inch long) American roaches in them. I have found probably half a dozen dead ones without really looking and people have seen a few live ones. There are tunnels and steam vents all over this compound as well.  Unfortunately my car is parked here for two weeks. Assuming I do not transport one into the car via luggage or my clothing, how likely is it for one to find it's way inside my car in a 2 weeks span by crawling into it while it is parked and locked? If it matters, the car is brand new so I would think all the weather stripping is still good. I have not seen any outside but I was told that a few were entering one of the buildings from a door that had a pile of rotting leaves outside of it, and there are many exposed tunnels and sewers around, so I would not be surprised if they venture outdoors. There is also a salvage yard nearby, so there is plenty of outdoor junk for them to infest.  My car is on a gravel lot bordering grass, approximately 40 feet from a building (which is newer so may not have as many, if any at all) and a few hundred feet from the more heavily infested buildings (which form a ring around the lots/grass) and maybe 100 to 150 feet from the nearest steam vent exhaust that sticks out of the ground.  Also, it is very hot here lately and the car has been reaching temperatures of over 120 degrees daily, and settling at about 80 at night on the inside (I have a thermometer in the car that keeps track of highs and lows while it is off). It is a black car with tinted windows. If one did manage to wander inside, would it (or it's eggs) likely be killed by that heat?  I am super paranoid about taking one home with me.  Thanks!   Someone called the guy in the main picture the "Muffintop Militia". That's kind of funny and all, and I'd expect that comment on Reddit, but as a service member myself I appreciate what they are doing and think it's pretty shitty people are making fun of them.  They aren't really providing protection but they are sending an important message, that we are sitting ducks and should be allowed to carry side arms in uniform wherever we go.  Arming us stateside does NOT make us law enforcement and does NOT violate possee comitatus. It would strictly be a self defense measure and we would carry concealed as many of us already do in and out of uniform in areas where concealed pistols are allowed.  I would like to see some type of exemption for soldiers [similar to police officers](http://le.nra.org/leosa.aspx), where they are exempt from pistol free zones. We have been proven to be a target both on and off duty, and should have the right to defend ourselves anywhere we travel on uniform.      US Army here. We drove a bunch of Humvees Through Detroit in a convoy to avoid freeway traffic and the sidewalks started cheering. Not sure if they thought we were the national guard finally called in to take their 6 day old unanswered B E report or if they just liked the military.   Either way we were just passing through.   This was my strategy playing the AI on the hardest setting and (wirh the liberty of reversing a few turns) I got us down to just kings and 1 pawn on his side. Thats as far as I've ever gotten on the hardest difficulty even with turn reversing.   I guess I'm assuming he blunders by offering a trade thinking you won't go for it (because maybe you end up losing a pawn and your queen to take out his queen, etc) or maybe he just screws up.  So assuming he did not intend to trade, you should still let him have his queen? I assume he will eventual relieve me of mine and it's better to take out his while I have the chance.   It seems like it's always wise to do this when your opponent is more skilled as they can always do more harm with a complex piece than you can.  For example a computer could predict dozens of turns out using the queen but you may only be able to predict out a few. Therefore the queen is more valuable to them than it is you and a mutual sacrifice gives you a competitive advantage.   Am I right?   Not even so much that their accustomed to it, just that a chess AI program that can see 30 turns out can take far more advantage of a versatile piece like the queen than you can, where as The simpler pieces like a pawn are so basic that your ability to predict the cause and effect of them is probably on par with the computers.  When it comes to a game against a human opponent, it's more to do with fucking up any unseen combos they might have planned. This works in magic the gathering, chess, civ, etc.  Thr smartest man realizes they know nothing at all and plans accordingly.    It's also good advice when playing against a human opponent you know is more intelligent. If you are less skilled at a game of strategy than your opponent, reduce the playing field to as simple pieces as possible if you can do so symmetrically.  For example in Chess it's always worth it to lose your rook, queen etc if you can take the same piece on a smarter opponents side. If the board becomes just pawns and kings a lot of their strategy becomes useless.         Armed =/= law enforcement.  Arming the military on US soil does not make them law enforcement and does not break possee comitatus.   Yes I'm a hardcore determinist   Intelligence is just intelligence.   How long would it take to reach them?   So this is where forever alone came from   	26
 anytime they talk about "game design"  Especially a few Sonic 06 episodes where they immediately stop being funny and entertaining to casually discuss Bioshock and then some other games and their design flaws   Oh yeah. I'd just love to hear Dan be funny and interesting and entertaining with Mark nearby saying stuff sometimes   They re-used this joke like 3 or 4 times in Sonic Boom alone!   it's above average. It has a good deal of flaws, but Heroes and Generations are the only good 3D Sonic games      what the fuck is a sonic?   That would be terrible. Go to your room   That happens with EVERY youtube channel   nooone else had a lucrative business with him     So something happened  like moving across the country?   The CHARACTER is meant to go fast, within the context of the plot. The game is different. There are only a few moments where just running is useful   That is AWESOME! Here, have an upvote   Except that his opposing opinions are clearly just contrarian. Like a hipster   If it were me, I wouldn't spend money so frivolously like he does. Game Grumps isn't something that will last and when it ends, it has the potential to take Starbomb down with it (which is where a huge chunk of their money REAALLY comes from) seeing as it's basically "Game Grumps: The Musical"   lol, yeah, that's what I was thinking. If the guy who hates OoT, but loves Speed Racer, and refuses to watch LOTR didn't think a movie was great, then it's probably one of the best movies of all time   That doesn't even make sense. So, you're allowed to hate story in games, unless you hate story in games.  Okay, good talk. Later   If you're a person that hates story in video-games, then your opinion on video-games is immediately irrelevant.    It's a business   damn, this is a cool subreddit!   Yeah, I was mainly looking for people's interpretations, but if Dan had ever said what they were about, I'd be interesting in hearing that too   have you seen the comments?   the people that will do this will not listen to you.  It also doesn't make sense   Anyone have any theories (or cold hard facts) on what each of the songs meanings are?   why are we analyzing something a fan made?   http://cdn.meme.am/instances/54101863.jpg   not to mention there's still quality AND quantity.    no, it's weird.   Just as long as they're none of [THESE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22F7uqUmteA) then they'll do fine ;)   I don't understand the criticism of ANY of the movies. They all have the exact same strengths and flaws   What would you say has most propelled you into a successful career?   that was actually quite awesome. Keep making reviews :)   fuck it   I GOT COINS COMING OUT DA PUUUUUUSSYYYYYY!!!   It'd be easier to make a list of things they're NOT putting in Kevin   Do you think you're the first person to have this thought?   thanks for the chuckle :)   Fear? I can't fucking wait for **both** of the games they're playing now to end   Depends on who the people are. But I wouldn't pay for it   Yeah. Sling probably payed them to put the content on there for the exposure, since it seems to be a rather new service.    Their recording sessions vary. It can be anywhere from a few days before it airs to several weeks   If someone tries to rape you, YOU RAPE THEM RIGHT BACK!  It's the only way to stop them!   Check some recent conspiracy grumps posts. I saw it on there. It's titled like "Jon crashes Holly's stream" or something   Well, at this point you can just download the intro and outro sounds from other GG animations   what?   Someone that JUST did a bukkake scene minutes before and didn't have time to clean up   It's just not the same because it's funnier now   looks more like Ben Stiller   oh! neat!   It is to remain out of sight and silent   It's cum. Don't let them sugarcoat it. It's cum   I don't think Ninja Brian moved to L.A. He travels there a lot for NSP stuff, but I'm pretty sure he still lives in England.   Game Grumps would be able to sue him or he could sue them if one side broke the agreement.  Basically the same repercussions as breaking any other contract   This is old news   Non-disparagement clauses aren't commonplace in the traditional entertainment industry (they might be when you're affiliated with networks, but this is different than an NDA entirely) The Non-Disclosure Agreement would've been signed between Arin and Jon the moment they co-founded this business together. It's just common practice, especially in the entertainment industry.  And Polaris doesn't control any of their partners. Multichannel networks function more like agents/managers. They find better deals (such as brand deals, direct advertising, which means higher CPM rates) for a VERY small percentage of the profits. The only one with power in the relationship between content creator and MCN is the content creator   Polaris is just a multichannel network, they don't control either of them. NDA's don't usually expire and speaking ill of another person is not breaking a non-disclosure agreement (unless it is specifically written into the agreement)    Ross is one ripped dude who scrub lords should come on  fixed that for ya   That "you guys are good" was likely sarcasm. Also the NDA wouldn't prevent them from talking about Jon, it would prevent either party from discussing behind-the-scenes issues (which likely isn't something that would expire)   I'd watch the first few episodes, but I'd soon stop watching altogether. Jon never made me laugh on GG (despite his show being one of the best things on youtube)  Nevertheless, it'd be super interesting to see some new Jon episodes, or a new series where they play games with Jon via the internet (they did a good job of editing separate camera angles in GTA 5 and Guns of Icarus, so why they couldn't do this, IDK)   And **then** they KISS!   Well, they have to provide funny/entertaining conversation the entire time. That's a lot harder than you think and it's a lot different than being funny around your friends (hence why there are no other funny let's players out there)   Ew    it makes him harder to take seriously.  Why would you take a comedian seriously?   Just so people get the joke   Well, they aren't similar stylistically to NSP at all. FOTC is like a "folk band"  Danny said they inspired him because, like Tenacious D, this was one of the few comedy bands where the songs sounded great with or without the comedy.       Music is really hard to make and comedy music is exponentially harder. It's also not about dicks, though how I can see how people might think that, seeing as how there were like 4 or 5 dick jokes in the first album (totally reasonable!)   No.   Most people are also curious to see the two Not-So-Grumps play a game together (with or without Arin)   Or he could've changed his mind in general. A man can't be held accountable for everything he's said in the past. He's also said things like "Expect a Fireworks cover in February 2015" and "Weekly Updates on Jontron Content"   Yeah, definitely. Primarily because it wouldn't exist anymore   too scared of millions upon millions of views for a single video? (multiplied by the number of videos in the playthrough)      I'm starting to get the feeling that it's an art book from the little fairy. All drawn in crayon. Very cute.   :) neat    Yeah, probably   I'm with you there, man   They should do online co-op/multiplayer games with Jon   "I don't want to watch a Let's Play... fine! lol... these guys are pretty fucking funny"   It's a hell of a lot better than when Jon was on it   oh, do you have any tips for someone wanting to get big making comedy for youtube?   Is there a different energy/method of thinking when you're recording grump sessions? Kind of like how performing onstage changes people   Polaris has no control whatsoever with their clients. That's like saying "what if their accountant removed Jon?"   Barry didn't know how to edit until jon gave him a crash course. He had just graduated college at the time and needed a job   I think you're woefully underestimating what running a business is like. You also seem to think it's somehow easier if it's based around a youtube channel, video-games or both.  The amount of work that goes into simply managing taxes, income distribution, etc. is daunting alone. Sure we all want to be playing video-games for a living, but the truth is that's simply not what they do. They release a product to an audience (that involves them playing video-games) and they capitalize off of ad revenue and merchandise. (And it's been an intellectual property since day one. They both understood the importance of building a brand and selling yourself, they talked about it often)   There's a lot more to the job than just recording the episodes. Running a business is a full time job   Jon definitely wanted to monetize. Who would run a successful channel and work full-time hours in doing so without being paid?   youtube has been having issues lately. especially on mobile   They played Endless Ocean 1!?   ...BRB   Endless Ocean 2. It perfectly captures what Game Grumps is all about   Or it could just be a picture   Kingdom Hearts   Ladies and Gentlemen... we now present your commander in chief... Eminem's brother, "Emeniem!"  *applause*   Is it easy?   A monthly one would be awesome. It doesn't even have to be as long or the same people. Or even animation, it could be sped up editing footage or sped up anything   Anything with a plot (god-forbid a game have **that**)   Goddamn this fanbase is creepy   Like everyone said.  Arin got back into it for a while, till some creepy fucks went after Suzy with the Etsy "scandal"  	97
 Movies and books love to use the idea that ultra rare almost mythical text exist and are sought after by some super rich illuminate type collectors. Are there any actual cases of this? Books that pop up from time to time and biders go crazy over or we'll know text that are thought to be lost but rumored to still exist?   I always ment to make a playlist like this and this song sometime around midnight.( http://open.spotify.com/track/7Hn0bZgca6QFz6OyKkvAi6 )would be at the top of the list.    Living in a college town. After about 25 you reliZe all the people your age either move out of town or get married and settle down. On the plus side if you don't mind dating 18+ there is always a new batch every September.       I totally thought I was gonna open a r/justiceporn link. The fact that he's a bandit makes this so much easier to wach,   Got a circumcision at age 32.    In the movie Eter the Void and in ASAP rocky a video for LSD there is a super crazy looking lounge.

Super good worth the watch.   Fit couple  http://imgur.com/a/39nsK  Credit to U/lobo2ffs    When I get mad or irritated I roll my tongue under itself and bite down. Done it ever since I was a kid.     Working at a co-op grocery store or whole foods type store tend to draw the more hippy/hipster folk. Often, deep compassionate, sometimes misguided and naive but happy and a pleasure to be around for the most part.    Bucket list for sure.            I'd  like more than a 10 song collection. I always thought that there should be records or tapes hidden through the world that you could collect, turn in, and they would be added to the playlist.   "Arcade shit" I'm gonna start using that.   This is so metal   Thank you, made my night.   Im waiting for one of the two kids to pipe up "dude that's me on the left in the photo, check it out here's the pick from my perspective."

As a you young boy I saw The Cure, brad renfro and the young boy from Jurassic park, about two youths trying to find a cure to one of the boys HIV. I was not emotionally ready for that.

 Bruiser Shyv. Generally 2 offensive items.   Hey Reddit, I've been on a bit of a Stephen king binge recently, and a book that looks interesting is The Stand. However, a little while ago I have been spoiled part of what the end is. I know that [Randall Flagg caused someone to set off a nuke.](/spoiler) I already know that the ending is seen as the weak part of the book, and I likely only know a small part of it anyhow. Would knowing what I know cheapen the experience, and make the Goliath of a book not worth reading? Or is the journey still worth it   At no point did I say that. There are some books where the ending is such a big part of the story that knowing it beforehand might cheapen the experience (Enders Game), while on the other hand knowing the very end of Breaking Bad beforehand won't make a huge impact on the series.    Hey Reddit, I've been on a bit of a Stephen king binge recently, and a book that looks interesting is The Stand. However, a little while ago I have been spoiled part of what the end is.

There is three ways to get to worlds. First seed is by winning the split, second seed is by having the most championship points  (you get points for the higher you place in playoffs), third seed is by running what's called the gauntlet. The gauntlet is a "tournament" between the four unqualified teams with the most championship points. Since c9 got 70 last split for finishing second, they're near guaranteed a spot in this (assuming they avoid relegations, where they forfeit the points). The format is the fourth places team plays a b05 against the third, the winner plays the second, the winner of that plays the first. Whoever wins that series takes the worlds spot. For c9 to make it they'll likely have to win several b05s in a row.   I had the same sort of problem when I first read the gunslinger. I found it dry and struggled through it. The problem with book one is its almost like a giant prologue. The story itself doesn't really begin until book 2. My advice is just to push through book one (it does pick up later on), and go on to book 2. If you don't like book 2 the series is probably not for you. Personally it hooked me hard. Despite some small flaws, the dark tower is one of the best series I've ever read. Book four is in the top 3 of my favourite books I've ever read.   She's actually gone through all the hormone therapy and all of that. It's not like some tumblr special snowflake who thinks their a wolf.   C9s just as big of a brand now as TSM is. The fanbase is slightly smaller but the organizations are fairly similar in size.   The only real 'downside' I've seen of him is he is a little immature with all the butthole jokes and all that. But then again he's mostly pandering to his stream audience who loves that stuff anyhow.    The thing is, the Csgo team has freakazoid, and several other players are fairly in shape. The only person who's really in shape on the Lol team is Balls   They can still make worlds    C9 was Thoorins favorite western team in the past   Putting him on a playmaking champion will do that.   And so is TSM. Likely Neither are going to be finalists this split   We league of legends now   It's a "poke you from 2 screens away" meta now actually   Everyone built him damage. Triforce, BOTRK, etc. Darien was one of the first to just build pure tank, or Brut/hex into tank. Plus Gnars Q was really Buggy on release, which lowered his win rate by a lot.   Group D ended up going 3-2 against Najin, Which is pretty damn even. SSW was unstoppable, and Cloud 9 put up a fairly good fight against SSB (a 3 man bubble away from a game 5). Yes, Korea was definitely stronger  then the west, but it's not like they got absolutely destroyed   I meant more of the "the west is going to get blown out" sort of thing   People said that last year, and the west didn't do too bad as a whole.    Kaas hooks were on point this game   Absolutely. He gets completely shit on by any assassin. He has no mobility, no way to deal with enemy mobility, no level 6 powerspike (in terms of laning), subpar trading (especially when the enemy can force them) prone to ganks, etc. There's a reason why he's rarely blind picked, and that's because he's so easy to counterpick. However, while weak in his own lane he makes up for it by scaling very well, and being able to snowball other lanes.   Everyone is overthinking it. They're just covering their bases. I sincerely doubt they're making any drastic changes in the very near future, since they're finally starting to look half decent.    It's probably setting up for a worst case scenario with c9 getting relegated. It would make sense to combine both into a super team. I think everyone's overreacting and that nothing will actually end up happening.   Kats still a stronger laner then Akali, AP kog'maw,  Twisted Fate, etc.   I've never heard that. Pretty much every c9 fan agreed that lemon was underrated, yet still a weaker point. The best he's ever been IMO was third best, and he looks worse this split.   Brand is really strong after the itemization changes. He was arguably the best Rylais + Liandries user in the game, and they buffed both of them.   Maxing Q second is the standard and IMO better option. In most situations your E is just too short ranged. It's generally used as an oh shit button to blaze someone for the stun, or as a cleanup spell. It doesn't bring anything but riskier damage to max. Q is much longer ranged (you can poke with it), scales better damage wise, and becomes a 2 second stun on a 4 second cooldown when maxed. Without maxing Q second you miss out on a lot of teamfight utility.   Kass has long cooldowns. Literally the only tear stacking spell he can spam is his Q, which is on a 9 second CD and requires a target. When you factor in the fact that he already takes incredibly long to scale up you find its not optimal. However, if you do follow through with it you get a massive powerspike.   I believe. After all this shit this season a C9 TSM final would be hilarious. The salt would be off the charts   I believe   Akali is a terrible laner pre6 against ranged champs. All you can really do is farm under tower and get whatever other Cs with your Q . Occasionally you can throw your shroud down to grab some as well   Yeah. They have two ways. Both are difficult. The first is they need to finish 7th, and run the gauntlet. Essentially they play the 5th,4th, and 3rd place teams in BO5s, if they win them all, they get the final worlds spot. The second is they need to go 4/0 and have DIG go 0/4, then they would have to beat them in a tiebreaker to make playoffs. From there they can go on a playoff run and qualify by circuit points or get a good seeding in the aforementioned gauntlet.   Meteos was made the shot caller when Hai left. He was a mediocre shotcaller. We're not sure the exact details, but the general rumour is that after a terrible game of scrims he snapped and just left. Hai is doing surprisingly well, he is obviously rusty, but c9 looks much better with him then without him   Meteos stepped down, Hai came in as jungle. They've slowly improved from their godawful play before, and absolutely crushed DIG today in sub-25 minutes. Basically a classic c9 game of old   A poke Mage vs a control Mage, makes sense the damage is so close   Even if that doesn't happen, they just need to place seventh and make the gauntlet. They theoretically could make worlds from there.    C9 still has one of the biggest fanbases out there. Only TSM and CLG are bigger   Like last season and their press R and fuck the adc comps they ran. Or the non stop Ashe Zyra   The last 2 splits before this c9 had a late season surge. So late season c9late season dig   Literally s3 summer c9 again   I know he won season 3 playoffs mvp   Makes his Q proc Ludens Echo.   If Meteos rage quits on c9(  the team he's been on for his entire career) because they're doing bad; what makes you think he'd be willing to be a sub? He's shown to be much too prideful for that. It would be starter or nothing for him.   Hai is the one who played assassins 24/7. His most well known champions were his Zed and his Kha'zix.   Playing jungle is much easier on the wrists. Much less APM and it's the least mechanically challenging role (excluding Lee Sin)    Hai's an official sub though. That's the point of having subs, for emergencies. I doubt they'll lose bans.   Meteos and Hai were the two main people to butt heads. Lemons his best friend, Balls is quiet and non confrontive, and Sneaky is Sneaky.    Renegades Meteos confirmed. Will Chris ever stop his rampant poaching!?!   Plus Meteos has been nonexistent recently. The two things you can count on Hai for are aggression and good shot calling. Both are things c9 is missing.   Hai used to play Jungle WAYYYY back, and he's got the brain to do it. Honestly, if he wanted to, and you gave him time he'd be a great jungler. Plus meta junglers aren't as mechanically intense as most mid laners, so it would be easier on his wrist.   All of the Hai jungle ranked 5s games are coming to fruition!   If they didn't add the leash limit to jungle, she'd be absolutely broken after this patch with the new devourer.   Essentially we just went through a tank meta. They remade the tank jungle item and it was OP as fuck. For ahwile there it was common to have 3/4 tank comps, something like Maokai/ Top, Sejuani jungle, Urgot/Cho'hath mid, Naut support, and whoever ADC. People would take Smite instead of flash on certain top laners just to have the item. In the last couple of weeks we've shifted into a poke based meta. Due to assassins all being nerfed, the common mid lane picks are all scaling poke bots.   The FOTM picks in each role right now are   Top: Hecarim, Gnar, Rumble, Ryze  Mid: Azir, Varus, Jayce, AP kog, Viktor, Twisted Fate, Orianna  Jungle: Rek'sai, Gragas are Pick/Ban, Evelynn, Ekko (he sees play top/mid/jungle), are fairly common.  ADC: Sivir Kalista godtier, Corki, Vayne, Jinx after that.  Support. Naut, Alistar, Janna, Annie   Kassadin: Fuck Talon and Cho'gath  Shyvana: Fuck Gnar    Kassadin is my most played champ in s5, and Annie is my favourite lane. I've smashed every single Annie ive ever laned against as kassadin.   Exactly. As long as you keep an eye on your midlaner and don't let him snowball off roams, early game is easy for kassadin. Just as long as you're not facing a Talon/Jayce main, then it's rough .   A full build kassadin can still one-shot a squishy, as well as have a flash on a 1.5 second cooldown.   They remade him as a bursty high mobility adc with low range. But then they nerfed his mobility and his burst while keeping the low range.   And cloud 9 3-0d them easily in the finals?   NA was stronger S4 and early s5. Eu was stronger before that and now   "We joked about suicide". God, c9 was so awkward when they started out   It still adds huge chunkage to your R spam   People complained the casters never called out mistakes. Now they're complaining about them calling out mistakes. People will never be happy   Runeglaive turns his Q into magic damage plus procs Ludens. The damage from a Q with runeglaive is higher then with Lich Bane   It's all entirely slowish moving skillshots. I agree he's overtuned but it's not exactly 'little effort'   To be fair he was so shielded that nobody could kill him. Steelback wouldn't have died there either    Keith's a weak laner who's best ADC is jinx. He played hyper carries on 3/4 games with liquid. I doubt they picked him up for that reason   He works, he's just tough to play. You aren't necessarily *weak* in lane, just you can't do much but stall and farm pre-6. Generally you don't have much of an impact in the game until 2 items (usually ROA and Ludens). A well played Kassadin can easily carry games though, he just has a high skill floor to use correctly. Not mechanically, but it takes a lot of experience with him to know how to play him optimally.   Contrary to popular belief, Nasus is actually strongest 20-30 minutes into the game. At this time he should be at 400-500 stacks, sitting on a frozen heart,sheen + working on visage. He can easily 1v2 and even 1v3 at this point, so you should be actively looking for an opportunity to TP bot or to a dragon fight and cause chaos. Don't fall in the trap of "one more stack". Once Nasus gets to 40+ minutes he gets easier to deal with in 5v5 teamfights due to getting kited easier and Adcs finally have the damage to actually deal damage to you. Against a good team you'll never have the chance to stick on their adc to get the two or 3 Qs it takes to kill him.   Nah a bunch of champions can beat him post-6, he still has longish CD's on all of his abilities, hasn't put much gold into his expensive item spikes, and his passive hasn't ramped up yet. Level 11 is where he really becomes the unstoppable duelist.   I remember back when Irelia was considered bad and a 'worse jax'. How times change   And then late game Talon will one-shot their squishy out of stealth while Xin will just be Xin   Amumu is still a godlike solo queue champion. He has THE best teamfight ultimate in the game, surprisingly good damage for a tank, and is forgiving and easy to play. There's a reason he's always been consistently in the highest win rates in the game since basically forever.   And 90% of Canada as well   There is three usual problems with running a bruiser mid. Your team generally lacks the late game damage meta mids bring, you usually lack wave clear, and often get caught in a heavy AD comp. it's definitely viable though, so don't let it hold you back.   He pretty much was. Him and Sneaky were the two 'doubters'. Lemonnation and Hai are best friends, and Balls is very non confrontative.   She's a 'tanky assassin'. She has a little less upfront damage then a Leblanc or Zed, and instead has a fairly strong shield and some utility in her pull. She was only really seen at the very end of the assassin meta, as she was one of the only assassins that was spared from nerfs. Her main weakness is the fact she has no escape. The assassins that were 'meta',Leblanc , Kassadin and Zed have blinks, Fizz has his troll pole, Ahri has 3 dashes, etc. Diana has to fully commit to a fight, as once she's in she's not leaving. She snowballs incredibly hard though, once she has a lead there's not much you can do.   The early life steal and much easier build path helps with her weak laning phase. Plus the %health damage and high attack speed bonus synergizes with her W.    C9T with Yusui looks pretty strong   I still believe. I think c9 has it in them to make another late season surge and make a playoff run. They're heading on the right path at least.   To be fair Dig has improved massively as well   From relegations to worlds!   Wow, who would have though DIG would look like the best team in NA at the start of the split?   Nah c9 won. Meteos actually gabked for once, snowballed the map. Balls got stupidly fed on Fizz.   To be fair actual sports are much more physically demanding. At the highest level of training for a sport like hockey you'd put in 4-5 hours average a day, and be physically and mentally  exhausted afterwards. While 4 hours of playing league is something even casual gamers have no problem doing.   W passive, E passive, Devourer passive, BOTTK passive. Q applying it twice. Yeah it'll be scary...   Look at the new PBE update. Riot is changing devourer into being more like old Feral flare and at this state it looks quite strong   Why does Annie have an AOE stun when Katarina has no CC at all? Even nonmeta mids like Ap amumu have more CC then her!   To be fair, you're not looking at the whole picture for most of those examples. Jarvan was so strong at the start of s5 due to being one of the only early pressure junglers who could clear the jungle relatively healthy while still scaling fairly well.  Maokai was massively overbuffed, and the tons of nerfs put him into a healthy state. Even after these nerfs, he's still a little overturned. He's got tons of utility, sustain, and CC. He's everything you want in a tank.  Evelyn literally does more damage right now then she did in her prime in s4. They buffed her ratios when they first nerfed her bases, then gave her the E on hit buff, then buffed her bases back to a respectable level.   Lee and Elise are truly just comfort picks, they've been around for forever, every pro jungler knows how to play them, so it makes sense that they would stick with them as long as possible. due to The nature of the role always having 3 'power picks' junglers have a relatively small champion pool compared to other roles. Plus early pressure is the #1 importance in pro jungling, and those 2 always have been and still are the best at it.  Lucian's currently 0-13 in LCS with the lowest ADC winrate in the game, I wouldn't call that strong in any measure.   Kassadin is just kassadin. I still have no idea how riot finally managed to balance him to a reasonable state without making him absolutely useless.    Just play super passive. CS with your E and Q if you need to. You trade one of the weakest early games for arguably the strongest late game of all mid laners. You just don't want to get snowballed on your way to it.   Well he didn't have Ludens back then. He had higher DPS, but was less bursty, if that makes any sense.   And it starts like that at level 1   Plus poke champions inherently do more damage, due to the fact they're always putting out (small) damage, which adds up over time. Compare this to someone like Zed, who does a large burst of damage very rarely.   The thing is, there's nothing against the rules for it. Riot has zero control over scrims   Power spikes are essentially what it sounds like, where a champion 'spikes' in power. The common ones are level 6, completed items, and all that. Often, it just takes experience to learn the major ones. Like Lucian has a strong level 2 powerspike due to being able to dash in, auto Q auto and win most trades.  Or Irelia has a strong Triforce powerspike, due to her kit innately synergizing with it + she will either have a maxed stun or W.    He's permabanned here in silver 1   Abyssal definitely. The 50MR works so well with the free hp of your ult, and and the MPEN aura works well with the rest of your kit + it boosts your allies. Void is situational. It is still a pretty massive damage boost, but it depends on the game really. I value Morellos Zhonyas Abyssal Deathcap and frozen heart over it IMO   I like slooshi and Cali though   Honestly though, I would be so hyped if Keith joined Renegades   I second Volibear. He throws you around early game, plus you'll never be able to fight him due to his health stacking. I haven't played against a single Volibear as Irelia that I haven't either fed him, or got smashed in CS.   I've had an even larger buildup of wax before, and ended up having the doctor flush it out with water. It's actually quite painful. As someone who had shoulder problems and dislocated their shoulder quite frequently , I'd rather dislocate my shoulder then have to get my ears cleared that way again.   I've had this problem. It build up fairly slowly, but you definitely notice it after a bit. The problem is that it builds up deep enough in my ear that I can't really do anything about it, excluding trying hot oils (which didn't work) or hydrogen peroxide(which my mother refused to let me use at the time). It all culminated into me literally losing hearing in that ear for periods of time, so I ended up going to the doctors and getting it flushed out (which was quite painful). I literally had around the size of a pingpong balls worth of wax built up in that ear.   I have never not utterly destroyed an Annie I've laned against as Kassadin. Your Q is the same range as hers, so you'll always win a poke war. With your shield+passive+ROA you'll always be too tanky for her to burst. She's so incredibly squishy that whenever her stun isn't up post-6 you can R-E-Q-AA-W and take half her health. Plus most Annie's spam Q so your E is always up   Melee carries are still relatively strong duelists. In terms of 1v1 potential they fall just behind dedicated duelists (such as Jax, Trundle), and DPS tanks (Shyvana, Volibear). A late game Yi or Tryndamere can duel 90% of the champions in the game no sweat.   Plus I guarantee that Kha'zix will make a small resurgence at least some point before or during worlds   Jacks pretty damn good too   We have 4 steers on our ranch, and they're the sweetest things ever. It all depends on how used to human contact they are.   Incarnation played his heart out though. He played much like hai did, going balls deep to try to win fights. It's too bad the shot calling and rotations aren't there.  	110
    r/upvotedbecausevictoria   Probably doesn't need saying but...  THERE CAN BE ONLYYYY ONE!!!   O   Great article! I always wonder when I should put more weight on value or mana cost in arena, and it really sums it up quite well.   Never thought about drafting a more flat and value-based curve early in order to fit more curved-out yet quality cards. Thanks for the read.   Executing face is my favorite lethal as well.   Hmm... I did see him play 2 imp gang bosses and assorted 2-drops which led me to believe he was drafting a more zooish-aggro style deck, but I just consider the likelihood of both drafting and drawing voidcaller coupled with a considerable demon drop to be too low to play around. Just too much effort goes into letting the warlock keep a 3/4 to trade up or get value out of, but you do make a good point in reading your opponent, will consider it next time I approach a voidcaller.   Yeah, I feel with the entire randomness with arena what first drafting voidcaller and a big drop demon and having drawn both of them make these kinds of situations unlikely, but they do happen :/  Thanks for the input, probably will try to commit to board with no fear next time   So in context, I was maintaining pretty good board presence (water ele + haunted creeper) as mage until the warlock decides to drop a voidcaller turn 5. My typical midrange-controllish mage mindset tells me to clear it, and when I do, I get punished by the Dread Infernal that pops out.  How can I avoid these kinds of situations besides the obvious silence or poly/hex?  	9
 Great movie. However, when I watched it, I couldn't help feel that it could have been a lot *blacker*.  Peter Dinklage was great though. No issues there.      Nobody does it better by Carly Simon   And you have to lie in order to tell the truth.   https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3e1bh7/what_are_some_movies_you_loved_the_first_time/ctakprf  Oooohhhh yeeaaahhh!?!?!     " I do agree with you that the public has every right to disagree with it if they so choose. Just like it is the comedian's right to continue with his comedy, and If public opinion is strong enough and oppose him he/she will stop."  This is exactly the process that this article is a part of. Public opinion grows through discussion. Which is what this article is.    Free speech and Free markets censor things all of the time.     I took your last comment to a logical extreme, since you stated that you would not label minstrel shows as racist.   I think you are confused about my basic argument. Which is not in favor of authoritarian censorship.    My entire argument is that, someone should be free to put on any show that they wish, however they are not free from the public's opinion.  And the public should have the opinion that overt racism, sexism, etc is wrong and should thus choose to not support those things.  The original claim was that Amy shumers movie perpetuated certain negative stereotypes instead of using comedy to subvert or satirize them.   I think you underestimate the degree to which media influences our worldviews.  Edit: disregard the minstrel show stuff. I got my arguments confused. The Hitler statement was still a logical extreme of your previous statement.   So, if Hitler had a comedy routine you wouldn't say his ideas should be discouraged?    Have you ever not watched a comedian because you did not find them funny or disagreed with them in some way?   Do you like that pun?   I am not talking about "shutting down" comedy in any way other than what the free market dictates.   Society at large would not accept a 1920's minstrel show today, and as such it would not find investors and would not be written and performed. In effect, society shifted attitudes of race have "censored" the once popular minstrel show.       That's clearly different than a minstrel show. And is an example of the exact thing I am talking about.  Do you think minstrel shows, operating in the same manner they used to, should still exist?   Do you think they're should still be Minstrel shows?   Do you think there should still be Minstrel shows?   That is an example of societal censorship. It is using satire to show that the stereotypes do not hold weight and that their existence should be shunned.    	15
 We know.  Only Bernie is good enough.  Too bad the majority of democrats don't believe that.    It seems that she has learned from 2008 and embraced the fact that she is a woman.  Side note...Obama chief pollster Joel Benenson is on team Hillary and he is also a chief strategist.        My point is every election cycle you have candidates who are "those type" of candidates.  Ross Perot in 92, Pat Buchanan 92, Goldwater 64, Trump 2016 etc etc.  Presidential elections are won by "politicians" plain and simple.     You know who is garnering the same "level of enthusiastic support" like that?  Donald Trump.     "And I get paid a lot for what I do."  Compensate much?   You hit the nail on the head.  "All heartstrings and no substance"   *sarcasm   As a Hillary supporter, I respect that.           I know.  I'm just so confused on who is actually taking him seriously...               He has a 21% chance of getting the nomination.     Look at the scoreboard...   Yes, because Bernie Sanders hovering at 21% in the latest democratic poll is enough to win the presidency.  In order to win the democratic nomination, you have to win minority votes and people who make less than $100,000 a year.  In the latest NBC News poll, Sanders is garnering most of his support from people making $100,000 a year or more.  85% of African Americans and 80% of Latinos are supporting Hillary Clinton.  More Latinos are supporting Vice President Joe Biden for "President" than Bernie Sanders and he isn't even running.    Get a clue buddy.     Let me guess...Bernie Sanders is God to you?  He is a "politician" like all other politicians.  Any "smart" person can see that.     Let me guess...Bernie Sanders will get it done because he's not a "politician" blah blah blah      Whats worse is that he is a white person from Vermont.  95% of the population in Vermont is white.  95%.  I'm not saying that other candidates are better.  The difference is that candidates like Hillary Clinton are reaching out to minority voters (like African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, LGBT) in the democratic base.  The fact that Bernie Sanders took a long time to actually address minority issues is troubling to me.    If you want to be elected president, you have to appeal to minority voters.  Plain and Simple.      I agree      The other problem that Sanders has is he is getting no support from minorities (African Americans and Latinos).  As a Latino, I find it difficult that Sanders didnt say the word "Latino" until 4 weeks after he announced he was running.  I mean come on, if you are going to run for president as a "democrat" you should know who "democrats" actually are.     I agree.  Bernie Sanders is no Barack Obama.              I'm not for or against it but I'm Seattle or Vegas (where I am), $15 won't do any harm but I'm not sure about everywhere.     I'm a democrat but $15 a day in a small town in Nevada or Iowa or South Carolina.  I mean come on.  What small business can afford that?             Trump says that Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers and nobody bats an eye (except the woman).  Sad.     Say what you want but shes garnering 85% African American and 80% Latino support in the race for the democratic nomination (according to the latest NBC News poll).     Just joking.  Just Joking.     Translation...his supporters are annoying.             Keep telling yourself that.     Yes.  Bernie is our savior (sarcasm).  Too bad he's not doing well in non-white states.  He will do great in Iowa and New Hampshire (both with white majority in the electorate) even though he will lose both.  Once Nevada and South Carolina come along it won't matter.      Here we go.  Next you will mention the 9/11 conspiracies.      So why aren't more Latinos and African Americans supporting sanders????      Sanders is talking about one issue.  Just one.  Forget about immigration, forget about racial inequality, forget about gun control etc etc.  He does love talking about income inequality in the white community.  White issues are good (screw all the other colors in the USA).    He will do great in Iowa (predominately white) and New Hampshire (white).  Good luck in South Carolina and Nevada Bernie (both not so white).    True dat    Talk about another republican and they respond.  Talk about a group of millions of Latino Americans (Mexican rapist and drug dealers) and the republicans don't say shit.  Go figure.  And they wonder why they keep losing presidential elections.    My thoughts exactly.  Where is the outrage on the republican side????     I think it's "Bill and Her" but not sure.    Fortunately for the democrats she is on a ship.  Sanders, O'Malley and the other two are on boats.     I love them both but they would never win.     I agree with you on that.  I dont think he is a professional moderator though so it seemed like he didnt know what the hell to do either.     I have to agree with this      She hasnt said anything specifically but she has addressed the issue.  She is the only candidate to do so.  Not one other candidate has done this.  Switching gears...the same goes for immigration.  She is talking about immigration and has said that "dreamers" need full citizenship NOW.  Why has it taken Bernie Sanders and O'Malley so long to address the issue.  I understand that economic inequality is an important issue but it isn't the only issue in America.  And again, thats why Hillary is garnering 78% of the Latino vote in the democratic primary and 76% of Latino support in the general election (according to the latest NBC News poll).     So I guess she's a puppet for saying and doing the right thing.  She's gonna win the presidency you know.  The numbers are on her side.     Hillary has addressed the "Black Lives Matter" movement and she agrees with them.  She has addressed the incarceration rates of black men and women in the prison system and believes it needs to be addressed.  She has talked about the issue and has made speeches on the issue.  Sanders and O'Malley don't seem to care about it at all.  Attack Hillary all you want but she has the support of 80% of the African American vote (according to the latest NBC News poll).     thats the weirdest place for a tv   It just seems like on numerous occasions white lives clearly matter more than black lives.  That's the point.  I'm not black (Latino here) but I understand the point they are trying to make.           They do have a point though.     A fucking MEN.  well said.     I guess he's untouchable.  Hmm          he hardly touched his food...   Wow.  I'm shocked that this is basically a positive Hillary Clinton post on reddit.  Bravo reddit.  Bravo. B   Not one Hardee's in Vegas.  Wtf.    They shot this film issuing only natural light.  Looks amazing.    Nice try op.  You read buzzfeed and pawn this guys thought off as ur own. https://twitter.com/DaddyBlackery/status/579220055617114112?s=17         I'm a moderate democrat who is going to vote for Hillary but this worries me.           You do know that isn't the only definition for "mouthpiece" right?  Read a book Appalachia...    I don't think that nominating Sanders as her VP (and another point, it's premature to say she will win the nomination but she probably will) wouldn't help the ticket.  A senator who is older than her and from Vermont?  She needs someone like Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia or someone like Julian Castro (HUD secretary) as her running mate.  Even someone like Sen Cory Booker from NJ would be great.        This is the best comment I've ever read on reddit.     I'm sorry but Bernie Sanders is a one issue candidate.  I'm not saying that that issue is not important but come on...mention something other than breaking up big banks.       That is one huge reason I'm not backing Bernie.  It took him weeks before he actually said the word "Latino." That's why he's getting demolished with the African American and Latino vote.    A recent poll showed most of his supporters make over $100,000 a year and another demographic that is trendy towards him is the 18-29 demo.     I understand what you mean.  In Nevada, the huge union endorsed Obama over Hillary in this state but Hillary ended up winning the state and winning the Latino vote in this state by huge margins...70% of those union members are Latino...so i understand what you mean.     ok   Yet may be the key word...or it could never threaten her.  That is why politics is so fun.     i agree completely.  I think this debate is great for whoever the democratic nominee will be (even though i think it will be Hillary).     I agree.  She won't even mention Sanders by name until she has too and it doesn't seem like that'll be anytime soon.     That would be besides the point.   The state you live in isn't a swing state.  Whoever the democratic nominee is, a state like yours will vote for them.  Plain and simple.  In a state like mine (Nevada) Clinton is doing really well.  Latinos play a big part of that.  We are a diverse state and Hillary does well in diverse states.  Nevada is a swing state. Massachusetts is not.     The latest Economist/YouGov poll.    I live in Vegas and the organization that Hillary has on the ground here is mind blowing.  I've never seen anything like it before.  They have a huge paid staff and even more mind blowing is that they have a huge amount of volunteers here in Nevada.    The Latino vote will be key here in Nevada and in a lot of states and the fact that Donald trump is now the mouthpiece of the Republican Party is great news for Hillary.       This is the best thing that could happen to the democrats.    Say what you want but do u know where most of Bernies support comes from?  Do you actually know?   Every single poll that has come out shows that most of his support is from white men who make $100,000 or more a year.  He also has big support for people 18-29 years old.  I don't think I have to tell you that that group historically doesn't vote like other age groups.         One name...Howard Dean.        I won't disagree with that at all but her negatives are just as big as everyone else's on the republican side including Jeb.    I'm a Hillary supporter.  Get that out of the way.  Bernie Sanders has a good shot at Iowa and New Hampshire but as soon as he gets to Nevada and South Carolina, he might be done.  Iowa and New Hampshire are both predominately all white with little minorities in the electorate.       Leave Ellen Degeneres alone        I'm not sure what to make of this.       This is presidential politics.  This kind of stuff is gonna happen.  Ask Hillary.  Lol.    It's a great piece on Bernie.  If Bernie didn't want this out maybe he shouldn't have run for President.  This isn't that big of a deal anyway.       Amen.  Hillary supporter here.  I won't attack Bernie.     He may not be attacking Hillary but his supporters sure are.  I'm a Hillary supporter but I won't attack Bernie Sanders.  Some of his supporters should follow his lead.    Ok.  I get it.    Done!    Why would this be NSFW?    Tell ur gf to show us her tits.     Obviously Vince Foster is fucking Hillary    Amen.  And they couldn't find a better pic?     How do u think the girl ended up in the wheelchair?   Star Magazine???  Really?     I wish he would stick to campaigning in Iowa New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina.   Winning the democratic nomination is about winning delegates.  He needs to campaign in the first four states as much as he can if he is going to have any type of prayer against Hillary.     As a Latino, the fact that Bernie Sanders took a few weeks to even mention the word "Latino" in one of his speeches is a problem for me.  I get it.  I get that he wants to remove "money" from the political process but running on one issue can only get you so far.  I feel that Bernie Sanders is running on one issue.  Am I wrong about that?     Hillary Clinton came out and said from the launch of her campaign that she would do even more to stop deportations and would protect the rights of undocumented immigrants.  If you look at the two candidates, they are basically running on the same platform (obviously a few differences but not too much).     The truth of the matter is this.  Big money, at least for now, is here to stay in elections.  The Citizens United ruling by SCOTUS screwed up the political system even more. That being said, no matter who you are, a candidate has to raise an obscene amount of money to win an election.  Just ask Prez Obama about that. Hillary Clinton is doing exactly what she has to do to get elected whether anyone likes it or not (when it comes to raising money).   As a political science major (I'm no expert by any means), even I can see that the "email" story has actually helped Hillary Clinton in my opinion.  Most of these polls that are coming out (today w cnn or last weeks with the nbc poll) show that her "trustworthiness" has taken a hit.  I can even see that.  BUT, it has also showed that most people in the Democratic Party (and even in the general election matchup) shows that Hillary Clinton biggest asset is her being able to take a punch ie strong leader/fighter.  The email story shows a pile on effect with the media going after Hillary Clinton.  My mom, who doesn't follow politics as closely as I do, said it best "all these media people are obsessing over her emails.  It shows you once again Hillary Clinton can take a beating and keep on ticking"   The fact that Hillary Clinton has become extremely wealthy I'm the past few years means shit to me.  If her policies and ideas can help the middle class families that need it the most, I'm fine with her huge wealth.  But until Citizens United is overruled, every person running for president (even Bernie sanders if he wins the nom) will have to raise an obscene amount of money to win the presidency.     In all honesty, when I was 11 my mom and dad volunteered for the Clinton Campaign in 1991 in my home state of Texas.  My father and mother were hardcore Clinton fans and after he was elected, my family benefited from a booming economy just like everyone else.    I know Hillary isn't Bill.  You asked why Hillary over Barack?   The fact that she had more experience than he did in 2008 helped a lot.  If you remember, the only difference between Hillary and Barack we're was the vote and stance on Iraq.  I think the same goes for Bernie sanders.  If you look at what they stand for, it truly isn't that different.  I agree with everything Hillary stands for.  I don't consider myself a staunch liberal but more of a moderate.  I don't necessarily believe in everything Bernie stands for.  I think he is just liberal to get elected.    Now I do agree that having Bernie in the race will pull Hillary to the left a bit and I think that's ok but I just hope not too much.  It mays seem like I'm rambling but I have donated to the Hillary for America campaign and I have already volunteered too.  I live in Nevada.  A truly swing state that has voted for a democratic president the last two times and I will do everything in my power to help her win this state in 2016.     I'm voting for Hillary because I've been a supporter since 2007.  I voted for her over Obama.  I agree with what she believes in. As a Latino I love her immigration stance and as a Nevadan, I'm already a volunteer here.     Go Bernie!   Surge away.  I'm voting for Hillary but won't attack Bernie (a few Bernie supporters love attacking Hillary on here).        I just think that voting against the Brady Bill and voting against a bill to prohibit civil liability actions from being brought or continued against manufacturers which in essence prohibits individuals from filing a qualified civil liability action lawsuit (which takes the rights away from citizens going after gun companies in court) is "substance"  http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/bernie-sanders-awkward-history-with-guns-in-america-119185.html  	126
 I need a list of movies similar to Kingsman: The Secret Service. A little late to this party, I know, but I just watched it last night and thought it was awesome. I'm looking for movies shot in a similar way and with that same kind of over-the-top-but-completely-awesome feel to it. Thanks in advance!   Apocalypto. First time, couldn't care less. Second time? Got high as shit and let myself fully immerse into what living at that time would have been like. needless to say, I like it now   ya know, only people who smoke crack know what crack smells like. you've been discovered    Fight Club. fuck fight club   what's weird is, I think that's why I loved it. not in the same vein but kinda gave me an American psycho vibe and I found myself just laughing hysterically at the scenes I really shouldnt have been laughing hysterically at. idk man, I'm weird   MJ never lost?! THATS INCREDIBLE!! I didn't know he had 15 championships!! This guys gotta be the best ever then, gee wiz.    Yes, because basketball is the only players league. People love rooting for individuals way more than they love rooting for teams. People naturally are drawn towards a human being over a jersey. And the way the NFL is being completely overhauled because of health issues and baseball keeps declining because it's boring as hell, basketball will definitely take over. the worldwide fan base is growing astronomically and that will be a big factor as well.   these next summer Olympics will prove how big basketball is around the world   lol, 245? no way. too low   2011 Finals, game 4 in Dallas. Lebron laying the biggest of eggs with 9 points. I was there. 25 rows back. Watching my hero shit his pants on the biggest stage in sports.   much salt   nah. she was alive while she gave birth to the twins after she got choked out. she literally talked to obi wan. you're wrong bruh   she was alive after that boss   but... he didn't win... according to BET's tweets anyway...  Edit: Okay so I still don't know what's going because the tweets clearly say Steph won, but everywhere else it says Harden won so... I stand corrected I guess? whatever. I'm confused   I'm just glad we got a guy who can actually play 12-15 a game and not hurt us while giving Lebron rest throughout the season.    He's better than JJ and Mike Miller. I'm happy about this   booooooooo get a job   If you were given the ability to create the perfect superhero movie, what superheroes would you choose to put in it? What villains? And who would you pick to play those characters? What's the storyline?  In this experiment, there are no character rights rules. Any character is usable. DC/Marvel cross over? Go for it.   I want to know what the absolute best superhero movie could be from the story to the actors chosen to play the characters.    After 2 released songs, is Dame the best rapper in NBA history? no joke   '06 Heat is ultimate prime Lebron. oh me oh my   yall sleepin on Kyrie...   Estimated age, roughly 13   I'm sure Minions would be pretty great if I could smoke weed the whole time. fuck it, I'm in   hahahha oh my god. totally forgot about that. love that guy   Chicago or Miami opener, Warriors on Christmas. There's really no other choice for Christmas. rematches are generally always then   so do the little sleeves they put on the end of the skillet that they bring your fajitas out on at Mexican restaurants.   source: I stole one and it works   Kyrie joins the 60 point club, Westbrook breaks through 50 and also joins the 60 point club, Kevin Love breaks the 3s in a game record, Steph breaks single season 3s again, Spurs 27 straight seasons at 50+, Harden wins scoring champ with highest scoring avg since Kobe.   some of those aren't records, so I apologize   lol. not if he gets the ball first on the inbound   playing occasionally isn't a threat. it's the rigors of an NBA career and season that posed the real threat   that's embarrassingly wrong   someone posts this exact comment on nearly every single post in this sub.    in my top 5 Drake songs. amazes me how many people haven't heard it    False. I can beat Satnam Singh. I guarantee it   but just imagine all of the late transition spot up 3s he'll splash. on the defensive end he gets a huge fast break starting block, but the guards get stopped so as he's approaching the top of the key he gets that swing pass and just bangs an in rhythm 3 and the crowd goes ape shit.   that was very descriptive... I hope everyone is as excited for this exact play as I am    stop making shit up, you're not from Texas   yeah that makes sense   oh that's totally fair if they did play overseas. just asking because, in my mind, that gives the Spurs a pretty good advantage   Real question, did Manu and/or Tony play over seas before the NBA? and if they did, which rookie year are we talking? I have no clue if they did or not though   I take rookie Lebron over everyone else. rookie kyrie is a top 5 pg in this scenario so that's a plus. Love was solid and boarded like a mad man, Mike Miller was rookie of the year... yeah, Cavs got it   For everyone saying OKC, get over it. Ibaka is absurdly overrated, they have essentially no depth and if you think otherwise you're delusional, and this is the year Westbrook finally causes a rift between them where they can't mesh together. he's gone   ANIMANIAC THE ONLY THING THAT GAVE ME PEACE OF MIND   dang fam, the Mavs know how to party   geography was never my strong suit   4 weeks later... still no sauce... much disappoint.    Uh whatever city Diamond Head is in. Staying like a mile away from it   if you're ignorant enough to believe that Obama is a Christian, that's the problem. he said whatever he had to so that he could appeal to whatever crowd he was speaking to at the moment. AKA politics   Yeah... that's literally what is explained to the audience at the end of the movie. I don't understand how you can watch the movie and not get that from it   A Few Good Vaginas   GONNA BE IN MAUI IN TWO WEEKS. BLAZING ON THE BEACH DREAM? CONSIDER IT FULFILLED   I just find it funny that in this "ultra tolerant, anybody can do/be/believe however they want to" society we live in, the one thing no one tolerates is Christianity or its views. I mean, I'm not surprised, because it's always been that way, but it's just strange that EVERYTHING else is okay, except that.   didn't mean to start anything, just didn't understand why religious views and beliefs aren't on the same level as gender preference, sexual preference, etc.    Why do they have to be "nuts" just because they believe something? I don't understand   how are people so stupid? how are they still alive? how have they made it this far?   HELL YEA. FINALLY, SOMETHING FOR THOSE OF US WITH NO SOCIAL LIVES   If you didn't tear up in that one, you have no heart   Thank you!   Okay sweet. Any others I should see?   You're a good person. Many thanks   So I was looking at the post about Bryan Cranston maybe playing Jim Gordon in a future film and saw that he voiced that animated character for one of the animated films. I need help figuring out which animated movies to watch and in what order. For reference, the last animated batman I saw was the cartoon on TV like 10 years ago, so I know nothing. I would greatly appreciate the help!   I always get viruses and pop ups that never go away when I do that because I'm dumb and have no clue what I'm doing. so I asked for guidance. don't be a douche   because I'm an embarrassment to the reddit community   http://imgur.com/33e5gfR   Where can I watch all of these? Anytime Batman is brought up in any sub, these always come up as being better than the trilogy. I need to see the light. pls hlp   I read that in my head in a Russian accent for some reason    That's the ultimate commitment. Not even being in the film.    I like to think Leto is taking the picture like in the other suicide squad photo from a while ago. fully submerged in his character.      dolla sweet tea from McDonalds, I drink that   she got destroyed.    Favorite macadellic track   she's.... she's perfect. moving to Australia ASAP   It blows my mind that people still think that a baby isn't allowed to be deemed a human being until they come out of the womb. Like, really? That's just idiotic. For everyone saying "well they didn't take their decision lightly" well duh. If you were thinking about killing a baby that has been growing inside of you, you'd think about it a little too.   If you wouldn't kill the baby when it's born, as soon as it becomes a human in everyone's eyes and you can see its little face and hands and its crying in your arms, then why is it suddenly okay to do it a month earlier? 2, 3, 5 months earlier? It's not.    I drew this up for my 4th grade group last year.  They tricked themselves and scored on the wrong goal. I was sad   Kyries 57 against the Spurs and Tim Duncan's post game salute to the young chap.    practiced this move for weeks. I was mesmerized when I saw it the first time   your trustworthy opinion card has been revoked. sorry fella   Kyrie, surprise 6 spot    Yo I know KD was the MVP and all, but he'll never be the best player in the game. D Rose dominated, got MVP, chronically injured ever since. KD got MVP, foot injury.... I just don't think he'll ever be the best in the league now. Best scorer? yes absolutely still possible. but best overall? nah. Anthony Davis is coming quick, Steph can still improve, Harden can improve defensively and make a case, Kyrie is no joke... but my vote is AD within the next 5 years.    Kyrie Irving gets more MVP votes than Lebron. Yeah, I said it.    Lebron is just naturally funny. I'm excited to see this   Financial. Come on, bruh    I know. just playing off the title of the post   Good... good... drink up, you beautiful little weed... one day you will grow into a mighty plant, ripe for the picking. and I will light you on fire and inhale the wonderful aroma you emit. goooood...    Way more important. Want him to succeed so badly   I love Cavs Lebron, but god damn there was just something special about Heat Lebron. Man   My God. He has one of the purest strokes in the game   MIKE MILL MADE IT (Mike Will Made it voice) - Mike Miller   same. fuck   This was a genius idea. Round of applause for whoever was in the meeting and suggested this   Drake is love. Drake is life      Christmas isn't on the team yet. That's his summer league number   I meant to say I'm NOT disputing that in my last comment. whoops.   And he's back now trying to fulfill that promise. So I don't see your point.    I'm disputing that. All I'm saying is, as a human being and as a man, your word should be just as strong as a binding contract. And to say one thing and do another is immature and disappointing.    His old man game is gonna be ridiculous. He's gonna develop some "fuck you" post moves and just embarrass kids on the block   www.cbafaq.com  yes they have his bird rights even if he signs a series of 1 year deals. but these are projections, so he could potentially make more than that or less than that. either way, it'll be a lot.    Yes. if he waits until 2017-2018, he can get a 5 year max deal with full bird rights. 200+ million   nope. 2 year with opt out after 1   Incorrect. Year after next    until 2017-2018. Cap jumps to 108 mil, which means he can sign a 5 year extension with bird rights and all, making 32.5 mil and up per year.    Your word is your bond. At the end of the day, it's all you have. If you can't honor your word, you're a chump. Therefore, ethically worse.    don't believe anything. every tweet is a guy pushing a story line. 95% of stuff like this holds no water and is pushed by agents or teams to try to sway the opposing side. just wait until he signs and we'll be fine    how does Superman change if the Nic Cage movie had been made?   I'll take two Greeks please   I coulda sworn that said CJ Miles... apologies fam!   wouldn't have happened. he hated Kyrie when he played here.   source: his best friend was my high school coach   You need to leave... you need to leave now.   THATS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT CAME EARLY AMIRITE???   Jerry Gergich. Parks and Rec. He is Mario Chalmers.    Remember that scene in Interstellar at the school where the teacher says they changed textbooks to reflect the inaccuracy of the Apollo missions? Said they didn't land on the moon and what not? That's where this is heading. A complete inaccurate retelling of history through the eyes of political correctness.    If they get JJ, JR is gonzo   I don't see Andy being a part of the trade. Or, I don't see the trade happening if it requires giving up Andy. Him and Lebron are too close   Windy said we're looking at a Joe Johnson trade with Haywood's contract... what do you guys think?   Well damn. Wade hurt you bro? You don't have to laugh at the notion that he's a good TV personality because he actually is. Better than the rest of the dudes on right now  	110
             Does this strike anyone else as absurd self righteousness?   Bisping! The count be counting them stacks                  lol an all time classic   For me, it was when Koscheck was fighting GSP, losing horribly, and tried some hilarious spinning back kick with the worst form imaginable          Stephen Wonderboy Thompson vs. anybody         new fav fighter,               Lawler is like a Boss Dragon here            that seems suspect.. he made a pretty penny of his Tito trilogy fights            lol hilarious      I suppose its possible they went balls to the wall with McGregor Aldo content that had to be shelved and didn't want to invest more $      Conor showin off some of his soccer skillz                     frustrating as hell.. this shouldn't be a bug !   Anyone experienced this? I'll add 8 songs or so to an original playlist, but when I go to the playlist, 5 or 6 of them refuse to be added.. even after Apple Music gives me the "added" checkmark to indicate that it worked.   Two male students invited a female classmate over to party. They gave her shrooms and then had sex with her... and videotaped it...      Connor is a natural hype man         Same, Jones vs. DC was off the hook, especially with the genuine bad blood b/n the too and that classic ESPN hot take video.  I'm sure UFC will pump up the marketing starting next week.. they have more than enough source footage to work with to make some ridiculously good vids and promo material      nauseating.. lets see him rescue a team and lead them to a title first.                           fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck                        misleading title, not the case                              Agreed on Improvised Shakespeare.  Also Chaos Theory is an all-star cast, hard to go wrong with them      And yet people were so quick to say he's the best heavyweight of all time   Yet still as pertinent as ever. Lebron in crunch time is about as dangerous as J.R. Smith.  The Cavs waltzed to the finals in a historically weak Eastern Conference and all of a sudden Lebron is the best player ever, MVP of the finals, when he just has 2 rings? (one of which was thanks to Ray Allen)...           Ah.. I knew it sounded familiar.. Andre Nickatina used it as the beat for this song... great tune! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He0HJGj5l1E   Exactly, style wise he matches up great with Dos Santos and Silva.. Verdum was his toughest matchup yet, and his most challenging opponent to date..   Altitude is a real thing tho, wonder if if that played into it   He's been killing it lately... I think the "Cain is the best HW ever" hype train was overblown.. too much too quickly      They get a car or hummer that they don't drive usually      Pass of the year? What are you Cavs fans smoking?!      Gruber is better than Carson? umm, okay      This is a great new feature that developers will hopefully take advantage of. More than that, glad to see iOS 9 install will finally be manageable       What must make it hurt all the more is that Verdum isn't trying to stir up shit or hurt anyone's feelings.. he is just saying what he genuinely thinks..                           How is it that iTunes library has 37 million songs and Google Play just 30? Is it because of classical music, or perhaps because Apple has more foreign acts on its service? One would think that Google Play, Spotify, and iTunes would all have equal sized libraries at this point, no?         Lame hipocritical Rothwell trying to talk himself into something...                           much obliged chocotacoman!            Thankfully this douche is already out of business..            All of a sudden Bader is up for title consideration? And Gus is fighting for it after a loss? Wasn't too long ago the division was stacked... guess JBJ cleared it out but good   Where's the travel?

Two things come to mind..  1) What exhilarating footage 2) One would never guess from watching him enter the room that Joe L would destroy you in a fight.                             	156
             Yeah, you can see where to buy it [here](http://www.thewandcompany.com/sonic/).             Maybe you didn't ask nicely enough.   How about now?            Everyone say that 5 times in a row, quickly now!   HAH!   Good God. That gave me the creeps. On another note, you're right. A ninja turtle, though cliche, would be awesome. I doubt mine would let me do it, though. He's not into touching and cuddling much.      Most appropriate quote for me these days. It's similar to another quote I read somewhere - if you don't make a decision, someone else will make it for you.  Difficult!!         PC culture at its best (or worst).   Fresh or shanghai? ;)             if I ever see a drone hovering outside my bedroom window watching me I guarantee it is getting shot regardless of the laws  Since I don't own a gun, I'd try a slingshot. If it doesn't work, the alarm clock maybe. Seriously, though, a drone outside anyone's bedroom window - or any window in the house for that matter - is insane.      I see this issue getting bigger and bigger in the near future with drones becoming more accessible to private individuals.   This is history and should be recognized.  I concur. Looking at it from a different point of view, it's a way of documenting that horrible part of history AND being reminded so it doesn't happen again. As long as it doesn't glorify that period.                  On a related note, I wish that throwing cigarette butts on the ground was not seen as normal acceptable behaviour; where I live, new forest fires are being started on a weekly basis because of carelessly discarded butts.  I smoke, and I totally agree with you. I live in the city, and it's so frustrating to see cigarette butts all over the pavement when there are trash bins a stone's throw away. Worse, there are butts around the bins!   Never get between a man/woman and his/her dog.   Got married despite my mom not agreeing. Totally justified then. Dammit, she was right.    percussive acoustic guitar  That's what Rodrigo y Gabriela does, right?          Bummer. Or maybe injury saver.   The [interview](http://socialnewsdaily.com/53537/meet-the-guy-who-wowed-the-internet-with-his-cover-of-beat-it-interview/)         Would "Man Killed by Lion After Escaping from Georgia Zoo..." be more correct?       the adults should be the ones held responsible, particularly in the case of the 12 and 13 year old.  Agree. Adults should know better. But then again, we know that's not always the case.      And she says "Up here. My Box of Shame is up here, guys."      Thanks for the explanation.         edit: you might want to eat these            Give me a box, no two, to give to the pricks I know.   Better than blue or violet. But that could just be me.   Go on. You know you want it.   It depends on how the fondant is made. Some of the best cakes I've had are covered in fondant.               Point taken.      Congratulations.   Who cares if he's not real?         I love this episode. It tugs at your heartstrings but it leaves me with a warm fuzzy feeling for some reason.   Oh God, yes there is that.   ...Angels Take Manhattan. When you're not exactly emotionally okay. Does anyone have any other episode to beat it?      Does this create a paradox?   Same question here.   All good points, but the 9th Doctor could very well be the best. But that's probably because I'm biased, although how can one really choose among the new Doctors?   John's photo was on the Spurs refrigerator as one of the leagues most hated players.  Teams do that?   Thread killed.      Yup.        	84
  That's a good source because they have no political lean in one direction or the other and are therefore completely unbiased  The same can be said for those on the climate change alarmism side.   You are missing the point. He's not condemning others for doing exactly what he's doing.           Changing our behaviors out of fear isn't a good thing  Except for Man-made Global Warming, right?  	5
 Some background, she was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety back in April but only started taking the medication near the end of it. This was during school and we lived on campus so to keep her in check with her dosages she had a campus counselor and we saw results with the exceptions of a couple of episodes that happened circumstantially   Now it's summer, I'm back in college for summer session while she's back at home with her parents. She quit the medication cold turkey after she was diagnosed with a viral infection and was afraid of mixing her antidepressants (Prozac i believe) and other stuff she was taking. After three weeks she went back on it after reading the consequences online but only a couple of days after that she would refuse to take it or even fib about having took it. I'm about 6 hours away so being there is out of the question. How should I go about this kind of situation?   Either I'm blind or no one posted this yet. But if you want a MOBA that's not click to move i wholeheartedly recommend Awesomenauts. Takes place in a 2d plane and plays like a platformer. Plugging in /r/Awesomenauts   I don't think I donated to their kickstarter when it came out, or at least not the early access tier.  But I'm still confused as to how I was able to get into the beta before   I have Starstorm bought and I also was able to get into previous betas but I can't seem to get into the new 2.11 beta.  Any fixes for this?   Preferably playable in mac and PC and f2p  games are also welcome. Was thinking about getting back into Ragnarok online private servers but I don't know how well that game holds up now.   It's been a while since I took 12B.  What are some good things to brush up on stuff before getting into CS 101?  Any resources I can use?   Pc   Updated but no change, what were the other anti virus software out there again? Or the one you'd recommend    I used to be able to connect to both with no problem but now my laptop won't connect to either one of them. I'm sure it's not a school issue since I'm connected on my phone. I'm capable of connecting to our apartment internet as well so I'm not sure what the problem is. Anyone else have this problem before?   That's it!! Thanks x]   So lets say you fail a class but within the enrollment period you sign up for a class in which the prerequisite was the class you failed.  Right now the portal shows the class to still be in my schedule, is that a glitch in the system? Would that class still be there when the next quarter rolls in?   I know there's a handful of videos that do comparisons but I can't seem to find this one in particular. Might have been /r/Unexpected as well   There's a mini flyer that I got for [crunchbutton.com](https://crunchbutton.com/food-delivery)   supposedly we have more options for delivery which include McDonalds, Taco Bell and some other stuff.  I'm sure very few people tried this service since all the stores only have one available delivery date which is monday 9-6 or something like that.  How long was this a thing?  And if you're the few that ordered before how was that experience?   Becoming Ambidextrous    But I had capital letters on mine :/   This is the end. I'm not a fan of Seth Rogen movies in general but man did that movie feel like the biggest circle jerk of stars culminating in one place and it didn't help that I didn't know most of them. It was the movie equivalent of an inside joke, if you're the crowd who doesn't get it you're gonna feel left out and that is not a good feeling to have  	16
    Does it even abide by any of the settings yet?  I tried simple things like turning off the bed temp, etc and it never changed the starting gcode.  Same for positioning items on the bed.  I could put them as far left/right as I wanted, and always got centered gcode.     low-skill factory job but those jobs simply don't exist anymore.  This is what most people don't realize.  Low skill jobs are routinely being replaced by robots.  There is coming a time where we need to seriously take into consideration that we have more people than we have jobs.   The fact of the matter is, the human brain was seemingly built to get around rules.  So what companies would start doing, was splitting off their own local "employment agencies", which then provided staff to said company.  The 999 employees, would then be "contractors" for said company, where said company had multiple different employment agencies providing the number of staff they needed in order to bypass the minimum wage law.  Seriously, no matter what we do - there's a lawyer out there who will find a hole in the law.   As a scientist, never trust anything.  Even the journals are all bullshit nowadays too, and other scientists bought and paid to produce results that the funder wants regardless of any real science.   I've actually found that ES File Explorer now also works as an SD card cleaner as well.  When I uninstall a program, it now goes and searches out the data and ends up asking me if I would like to delete the folder.  Since I already use ES File Explorer anyways as a file picker, and FTP server, etc -- it's been a welcome addition.   CHOO CHOO!!!   I dunno.  Soberlol #1 Korgath.   I found a pair of dental-pick like tools when this happened to me.  Spent a bit of time cleaning every little bit of broken rubber out from around the spark plug, (including a little hacked together straw/vacuum cleaner micro suction device)    Granted you don't have the absolute control over part dimensions and placement like you would in other programs, but you are perfectly capable of manually modeling parts.  ...you know, that's basically the key point of mechanical design...    Prejudice is prejudgment, or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case. The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of gender, political opinion, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race/ethnicity, language, nationality, or other personal characteristics.  Multiple different sources define the word slightly differently, most of them do not have the "not based on reason" portion included within.  In fact, prejudice people often do have reasoning behind their prejudice.  It's often the wrong reasoning, but...it's still reasoning.  Stereotyping is closer to racism than being prejudice is.  Stereotyping is generally of a whole group of people.  You can be prejudiced and not be racist.  If I'm walking down a dark alley and see some homeless dude, I'm going to pre-judge him to be a threat.  Same with a group of black men walking down the street.  But I don't hate or dislike black people because of their skin color.  Nor do I believe that black men walking down the street would by-default be a threat to anyone in their path.   Stereotyping is prejudice.  Take a look into the etymology of the word.  It means "Judgement in advance".   I wish people would start using the "prejudice" word more often.  A white woman walking across the street because she sees a group of black men heading her way? - Prejudice.  Not racism.   Then later you build a gigantic, cabbage empire!   I've got 2 daughters now so...plenty of that was going on as well.  She was a gamer before I met her (playing Diablo II, etc)   If your printer isn't tuned correctly, Simplify3D won't cure your problems.  It'll just make a properly tuned printer perform better.   Hell, the drinks cost $3.20 at some places any more...you can still get tap water for free though.   We were going for high-warlord on my warrior back when PvP titles meant "who could spend the most constant amount of time in battlegrounds".  If you could manage to stay on 24 hours a day for weeks at a time, you were practically guaranteed to get it.   Most of the time, me and my wife were sharing the same account - I'd play for 10+ hours while she was at work, and then she'd take over my account and play for another 4-6 hours after work.  Years of playtime isn't that uncommon.   Damn!  What's the aspect ratio of that screen?!   And here I am 3 days into signing up for an account and they still haven't activated it.....   If I had like 3 screens, I could totally get used to tiling window managers.  But when 90% of the websites I visit assume that you're viewing them on a full screen 1600+ wide monitor, tiling window managers become pretty worthless.  Fuck, even reddit doesn't scale well if you try to 50% your web browser to the left side of your screen.    just a design aspect  That's what a "metal umlaut" is... umlauts for design-only.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_umlaut  You're right!  It's a thing!   It is.  The ends are made out of a single-piece stamped metal shell.  None of that weird fold-around with dovetail joints and clasps.   Fuck off.  This "anti vote brigading" thing is bullshit.  It's on reddit, it came from another link on reddit, we're encouraged to cross post, so others who come here from other parts of reddit should be encouraged to upvote/downvote and comment as they freely please.  The admins of reddit also need to know that the whole np domain, etc is fucking stupid as well.  People should be downvoting this bot as well, so that he gets caught in the spam filter.   Nope, refrigerators in campers are "Absorption Refrigerators".  They use LP gas to heat an exchanger liquid (a combination of water, H2, and ammonia, which separates and recombines in a specific manner in order to basically use heat in order to cool.  LP gas can actually be mixed down to the equivalent of R-134, and be used as the working liquid as well in a typical compressor system.   You can use LP gas as a refrigerant, it just so happens to also have explosive tendencies.   What I want to know is how much actual food you get.  I can get a single chicken nugget for less than $0.20 but it doesn't mean that because it's under $10 that it's "cheap eats".  What is going to fill me up for $5?  Not... "This meal is $5!  But it looks like this http://i.imgur.com/uMmLuKS.jpg "   Try GFLOPS.  Phones surpassed the MFLOPS measurement a LONG time ago.  For example, I believe you have your iPhone 6 measurement wrong, because from what I'm seeing, it's closer to 300 GFLOPS.  The Adreno 300 (used in many Android Phones) pushes 130GFLOPS, which is well over the 1000x better mark that you're bitching about.   Honestly, I'm quite tired of the news already.  I'm glad that we're moving in the direction of equal rights for everyone, but fucking hell...give it a rest already.  We get it.  (Not you OP, just...in general)   Polycarb can also crack.  I have Polycarb V wheels on a printer of mine, and they have fracture marks (even though they still work fine)   I wonder how long it will take him to shake that knowledge...   I guess you don't understand sarcasm......   Just look at Ted Cruz for a fine example of Republican leadership at work.   It's _not_ going to be a real Q A session, Limor Fried has always sucked MakerBots dick, because she was/is good friends with Bre Pettis.  You'll notice it all on their forums and other public communities.  They rule with a heavy handed fist, and delete all negative commentary about MakerBot, etc.   The post on Hackaday specifically asked for their users to post questions.  Instead, there's nothing but jokes and argument about adafruit, or argument about MakerBot and nobody actually posting questions _FOR_ makerbot to answer.  There's like a total of 2 questions there; the rest are...statements, and obtuse stuff like arduino srl vs llc, etc...  things that have absolutely nothing to do with the article at hand.  It looks like it's being flooded with trolls, and nonsense so that the legitimate questions that are ultimately asked can be glossed over for their own pre-canned questions.   Holy shit the signal/noise ratio on this is absolutely astonishing...even in this thread there's a lot of derailing, and same thing on the hackaday thread.  Lots of derailing over there as well.   Man, I used to have a Z-grip Automag RT.  This was before the new valve system they had designed that wouldn't chop a ball.  Loved that thing.  Then they...didn't make a Z grip for anything else and I was bummed.  Closest thing I found was the 2008...ish Angels that had the vertical grip.    Sniper 2  Nah, The Sniper 2 would be if you left the cocking rod in, and took the pneumatics off...the reverse of what I was doing.  When you took the cocking rod out, it wouldn't cock the hammer required for the shot.  But you could still make the back-block "fire" back and forth by pulling on the trigger.  No balls would fire, but it was fun to play around with when you weren't playing a game.   Was always fun simply taking the cocking rod out of the back too, and playing with the pneumatics. :P   Cancer.   Daaaayyyyuuummmm, I used to trade markers on that site.  Traded all the way up to a 04 Vert Feed Cocker from a Spyder.   You should get Pao to ban their subreddit.  That's what we do now when we don't like things, right?   We should totally ban that subreddit for not being a safe space...   Yeah, I've seen the heads with the 3D milled cams that slide back and forth in order to adjust timing that way.  I figured, given that my interest was in a smaller engine, that there may be some options out there for electronic valves.  (Or....electronic air injection of sorts?  Kind of like a 300psi valve that could be opened for air intake)    DSM  ? -- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders? :P (DSM looks like the old Eclipse/Eagle Talon?)  Also, the electronic valve system interest was for being able to advance/retard timing on the fly.  Is there a better way to go about this?  I have a lot of interest in having as much of the engine controllable as I can get.   _LOTS_.  That's the power behind Linux, in fact.  The fact that it can scale down so far, and also up so far.  I still run Arch on an original EEE900A.  A machine with 8gb of storage space and 1gb of RAM.  Granted, I don't use firefox, I use surf -- but there are more of us than you think.   Little bit of an odd question for /r/MechanicAdvice, but I'm looking to understand a little more about _controlling_ an engine through the ECU, etc.  (Actually, to be honest, looking to build my own open source ECU.)  Are there any real, small, 4-stroke engines out there that can be had which have proper modern-ish electronic features?  Things like Electronic Fuel Injection, Electronic Ignition, (Electronic valves?), and a set of sensors suitable for experimentation (temp sensors, camshaft position sensor, MAF, etc)?  I've thought of trying to buy a small motorcycle engine, but I've never worked on a motorcycle and don't know what I should be looking for.  I have dropped, rebuilt, and reinstalled an 86 Fiero engine and done multiple head jobs though - so I'm not entirely foreign to engines.  Any suggestions?   There are tons of computers out there with 2gb of ram or less.  In fact, I'd say it's more rare to have over 4gb of memory in a machine.  A brand new machine...sure.  But there are far more _not brand new_ machines being used right now than those.  So no, there's no way in hell that's a "rare use case".  I know of an installation of 100+ kiosks that are using raspberry pis with firefox as their front end.   On things like the Raspberry Pi/2, you've only got 1gb of RAM to work with.  Reducing memory usage for low ram machines is a huge speedup because you're not having to write out to swap/cache.   Just a heads up, none of the video acceleration works for this build.  That means it's completely non-performant, and absolutely has no valid reason to use it with the exception of educating yourself on it.   jailbait was on the edge of legality.  That and lots of bad press somewhat forced their hand.  the fappening was the dissemination of illegally gained photographic material.  Both of those had little to do with free speech, and more to do with being either very close to illegal, or just plain outright illegal.   He's a law student.  He knows damn well what he's doing, and he's only doing it for the attention that he gets.  Good or bad.      Honestly, if GravityBox can bring back my ring-unlock, and the old KK menu, and proper power menu for rebooting into recovery, etc I'll be happy.  That's all I want.   Nexus 5 stock, Amplify is not working on the newest Xposed yet it seems.   I've not been able to find this using my Google-fu, but is there a way to transfer a complex mating geometry over to a 2D form which could, for example, be wrapped around a steel tube in order to cut it correctly for mating purposes?  Say I want to do something like this: https://ludemannengineering.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/p1090388.jpg  I'd really like to be able to print out a 2D to-scale piece of paper, wrap/glue it around the pipe, with some lines to measure against, and then be able to properly form the end of the pipe with a grinder or 4 axis laser cutter/mill.   You're exactly right.  The more modern package managers DO know this information.  More Modern != Have a GUI - oftentimes I am SSHed into a machine and need this information available to me on the terminal.   This is what's beautiful about pacman.  With ubuntu, I need to know the exact name of the package that I'm looking for.  With Arch, I do pacman -Q image editor and get all the results with image and editor in them.  I get told the package name, and then I install it.  No needing to hunt the web for things, I do it all right there in the command line and then the package manager gets out of my way so I can work again.   It's almost as if the economy is recovering!     Publix gives out free samples of their food, but no one goes home, changes clothes and comes back a few more times for seconds. You just pay for the food and leave.  So, just me then?   I sneak by there multiple times and then when I can't do that I send my children.    Can you do aptitude search "image editor" and end up with gimp?    Just did it, and it seems so much less robust than pacman's search.  I don't know if it's just simply not got the packages I'm looking for, or what.   If this is how it was since the beginning, I probably wouldn't have switched as quickly as I did.  I've got a deployment of Ubuntu in a VM, and I just did the apt-cache search bit...and it didn't seem nearly as thorough as pacman.    I was poor, not even a college student.  Joined a hackerspace and a guy that goes by chorca kept my questions answered and my spirits high.  He gave me a bunch of parts to start with, but not nearly enough to actually build a printer.    So a friend of the lab brought his in -- a prusa mendel, the first version that came after the sells.  He told me "if you can get this damn thing working, and printing right then you can use it to print the parts for your printer" and boom - I was off like a mad scientist.  In the end, it cost me way more to build my printer than the printrbots now cost but up until about a year ago I didn't know any 3D modeling.  My passion was engineering, fixing, tinkering, learning, coding, etc.  It eventually drove me to learn enough solidworks that I could whip out any part that I need in about 20 minutes, but for about 4 years or so I had no need for 3D modeling.   Arch is when I finally stuck with Linux.  I went something like Windows - Mandrake - Windows - Slackware - Windows - Debian - Windows - Ubuntu - Windows - Ubuntu - Windows - Ubuntu - Arch.  (RedHat was somewhere in there too...)  I found that I kept breaking the shit out of my Ubuntu installation, and not being able to understand where everything was, or how to put it back together.  I was also starting with a full blown desktop and trying to strip it down to the bare essentials to keep everything lightweight, but I was doing it completely backwards.  So I ended up deciding that I needed to start from the other direction.  Minimal and then build my system UP.  Arch...back when I installed it the first time, everything had to be set up through the beginners guide and that was the first time I had that "Eureka!" moment.  I finally understood the directory structure.  I understood the package manager.  (This was a BIG one) and it just was like boom, Zen linux user.  Obviously I'm still learning fucking LOTS (6 years later).  Moving toward teaching myself vim, slowly getting a hang of it.  SSH is fucking useful as all hell.  And the fact that you can do nearly everything from a command line is oftentimes complained about by normal people but I grew up on DOS so I love the command line.  And linux has come in way more use than I care to state.  Recovering bad data, I can read practically any damn filesystem format, imaging drives, and most of all the OS _not assuming that I'm an idiot_.  Additionally the development environment is a breeze to set up for practically any language you want, and generally things just tend to work as long as you pay attention...  The biggest complaint I had about ubuntu at the time was the package manager.  Pacman is intuitive.  Want a package?  -Q for query.  There's no apt-get search...I still don't fucking know how to find packages on ubuntu.   Don't feel this way.  It's just a new way of doing things.  A far more powerful, amazing way of doing things.  Keep at it.  I didn't get it on my first distro, went back to Windows over and over again - but this was back during the Mandrake Linux years. (changed to Mandriva, and now defunct)   Nowadays, you can install most distros and end up with a really nice looking graphical interface and actually be completely set up from the get go.  Once you're there, if you have any issues...google for them, and as long as your google fu is strong then it's likely the answer is already posted in the arch or gentoo forums.   The problem is that they aren't Arch.  Evo/Lution isn't a distribution.  Antergos and Manjaro are.  They may be based on Arch, but - you can't use the Arch Forums, the communities are smaller, etc.   You could just say "No, but thanks for the offer."  You don't have to mention your relationship status.   Don't try Arch as a beginner.  If you want Arch, without the hassle of the big follow-through beginners guide, look for Evo/Lution.  It's just a big, user friendly Arch installer (when it's finished, it's vanilla arch with all the same repos, etc)   This also makes you look like a _huge_ bitch.   Yeah, in addition to that shit, you've got chemtrail nutjobs.   You should Reply-All: UNSUBSCRIBE   Holy fuck man, tilt your camera up why don't you?  The whole video, you can barely see 10ft ahead of you because it's pointing at the pavement.  And christ, do you have the reaction time of a turtle or something?  Because you were nowhere close to getting hit, you could see that guy coming around the bus before you even got into the lane.   Tell that to the fucking people in Atlanta, GA.  You go ahead and try to go 55mph down there...see if you think the same afterwards.  If nobody follows the "rules"...then it's a stupid rule.   ...Which is strange.  Because Florida is mostly Philadelphian retirees.  Wait, are we talking about New York, or *New York*?   Yeah, sorry.  But scare quotes is the universal symbol for sarcasm.  Like, saying you were totally "correct".   What a huge waste of space.  It's amazing to me that we have so many churches, and so much money is funneled tax-free through them.  Ever notice how _every_ preschool is a "christian academy"?  Yeah...big tax dodge.   Not "some kind".  Changes have been merged upstream.  The newest builds can use a mostly vanilla Linux kernel.  (Of course a lot of packaged binaries for certain ICs)   Bluetooth Keyboard.  They even have foldable full size that will still fit in a good sized pocket.  There's no reason a device like this would ever be useful when we have smartphones with bluetooth capability.   No no no.  If they're 33% white, 33% black, and 33% asian, everyone is a minority.  60% of people _aren't_ white, so white is a minority now!   I'm not sure you guys are competitors just yet.  His points are all spot-on, given the wild claims you guys have made.  I'm not saying your work isn't exciting, but elmoret isn't known to just simply shittalk for the sake of it.  Did you realize how much this looks like you're ducking reasonable discussion when you drop down and start calling people names?   You had to flash your printer to think it was a cartesian, didn't you...   Sure it's not your fan?   Can you report cops locations on GMaps yet?   Additionally, it can save you a lot of money when things break down.  For example I had a shop try to lie to my wife about my car and say I needed a new head for my Hyundai - My OBDII adapter told me it was simply a misfire on Cylinder #2 and all I needed was a new coil pack.   I'm not sure how many of them you could install though.  A lot of them rely on http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html  So you'd be able to use them potentially, but not get push-notifications.   That stuff is Android, not gapps.  Gapps is specifically things like gmail, play store, the photos app that gets shoved down your throat, etc.   GMail and Hangouts are Google apps.  They wouldn't exist on this.   Yep.  It goes on and on and on...   An app store, obviously.  Also all the code that's used to track you.  Most other things have alternatives.   Because you're ruining other peoples reddit experience by bitching about "spoilers".   What the fuck does their employment have anything to do with _anything_.   Oh shut up.  The whole series is done and over with.  You can't bitch about "spoilers" when the damn show is completely done with.   This is the first picture like this one that freaked me out: http://flowergarden.noaa.gov/image_library/expedition/coralspawn10/divershia389a.jpg  Don't know why, but under water, where things start kind of fading off into the distance...creepy.   I'd be completely on-board with this.  If you've ever tested a phone without the gapps flashed package, you'll notice that battery life is a _fuckton_ better.   I see no way of setting tension on the extruder.   http://bukobot.com/nozzle-cleaning  You should do your best to perform a cold pull of the filament.  I don't know if any kind of design decisions make this useful on a UM2.  But generally this is how you fix a clogged nozzle.  When printing woodfill, purge with a different filament once you're done.  I've heard many people having problems after printing with it, and then leaving it in the nozzle.  I don't know if it's some sort of one-way curing process that it goes through or what.   Shitty service.  Especially during the WiMax period, they were terrible.   Well, given the upvotes I'm not sure most people disagree, I do think the most _vocal_ people disagree though, because it would somehow go against their selection of a mobile carrier and they somehow think I've wronged them by disagreeing.   brojob?   They sell a service.  They sell advertising to their users.  They don't actually sell the users' data.  The data is what makes their service what it's worth.   Sounds like they're getting a lot better than they used to be then.   It's actually downtown Orlando, next to Wet-n-wild, Disney, Universal Studios, etc.  Specifically the intersection of International and Sand Lake - don't know where the closest tower is.   T-Mobile is fucking amazing for me.   LTE nearly everywhere I go, 68mbps down, 42mbps upload.  Crazy shit.  	106
                   what a sad state of affairs. this is all changing!       good question, a quick google search did not provide any insight.    hell yeah   aggreed   very cool, thanks for sharing     	13
 They sure are, but the second half of Man in the Iron Mask felt a bit too depressing for me, I'm still a bit bummed out from it.   Hmm, maybe, but the last time the two meet Aramis is described as a frail old man, and he even says goodbye saying he will die soon.   I have a feeling d'Artagnan may have been condemning Aramis for some of the things he did, especially being responsible for Porthos's death, but I can't be sure.   The book ends just after d'Artagnan's final words:  "AthosPorthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!"   I'm not sure how to interpret this, is he making the distinction between Aramis and the others because Aramis is the only one still alive, or because he doesn't think he will be seeing Aramis in the afterlife like the others? Anyone have a take on this?   [Brazil's carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_aircraft_carrier_S%C3%A3o_Paulo_%28A12%29) also has catapults, I see that thing rusting away every time I fly into Rio. And they expect it to be in service until 2039...   Actually it looks like they just took Portuguese names for whales (since this was in Brazil, as she said) and threw them in google translate. We call one type of whale the ["baleia-franca"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleia-franca) which would literately translate to "frank-whale". There's also the[ "baleia-cinzenta"](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleia-cinzenta) which I could see someone translating as "grayish-whale".   It's a great book, it's just a bit hard to get used to the way it's written, as if Forrest himself is writing it, bad grammar and all.   At first, when I's growin up, she'd let me go out an play with everbody, but then she foun out they's teasing me an all, an one day a boy hit me in the back with a stick wile they was chasin me an it raised some fearsome welt.

And a little later you added:    "You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."    "Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"    But the little prince made no reply   You mean it doesn't creep you out that they play different music at different parts of the park? You are a braver man than I am.  And now for a unnecessary 1 second looping gif.      You can't solve it  They should have gone with "100% of math graduates can't solve this,"  would be a perfectly correct thing to say.     The BS part was that both Brazil and Spain were included, but not Portugal.   Brazil shouldn't be included, Hispanic and Latino are defined by the US government as "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American (except for Brazil), or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race." They specifically exclude Brazil.   It seems OP is the same creator of this one:  http://www.dcoc-vr.com/  Which does support prepar3d.   I think that happens when people mistake the "ask a question" form for the "search reviews" form. I may or may not have done that once.   Cool, so if I want to upgrade to a 970 I don't have to worry about bottlenecking?   My less than 2 years old build is basically i5-4570, 650w PSU, 8GB and GTX760.  I'm looking forward to VR headsets but apparently my PC wouldn't quite cut it. Can I upgrade my GTX760 to a 970 and expect enough performance or would I also need to upgrade something/everything else?  Thanks.   There are 3 left in the wild and two in zoos.

I'm hoping we hit $14.75 as I'm looking to DCA with some 10 oz bars and they have the Johnson Matthey ones currently on sale.  It might hit today, looks like we went down to around $14.91 so far.

I've been to that fair, man, what a bunch of fucking hippies! They still doing the painted tits?   If it's any consolation, I was price comparing 10 oz bars a day or two ago and they had a handful that were marked delayed.

Currently, gold is down .67%, silver is down 1.48%  according to my feed.   I'm looking to DCA via some 10 oz bars, watching to see if we hit around $14.75, I'd hit 40 oz, JM Bullion has some good prices on 10 oz RMC and Johnson Matthey.  Just picked up two 10 oz year of the goat via Bay Precious Metals @ $174 each. It's marked via a limited sale icon via their store listings which ends in a couple hours so if you're interested, I would not wait to buy.   I picked up a couple of these right at $180, they're nice.  They also have a 5 oz if you're looking to pair it up.  Edit: Just picked up two more at $174.00 each (spot looked to be $15.02 at the purchase time).       Where did you get the platinum CML? I'm looking for a deal on one of those.   Otisburg?...Otisburg???...Otisburg?????         RCM could totally nail this with milk spotting.         They've been selling that for a while. If you're really looking to pick it up, check back with them regularly. It's the lowest premium on a platinum coin I regularly see, though I'd personally rather have a platinum CML on a good deal. The "out of stock" may just be out of stock for this sale, again, I've seen the platypus in their store for a while.  They also have a 1 oz palladium CML.  It was $696 over this weekend, it's up to something like $721 when I was checking their current auctions earlier today.         I saw that this morning.  The Bison's are pretty much what APMEX was "special price" selling a tube of CMLs on ebay this weekend.  I'd rather have the Bison's, might have to hit a tube of those tonight.

What's the procedure when a passenger is carrying precious metals (gold/silver), be it government issued coins or privately minted bars?   It is getting nearly $800 million dollars from the feds for about 20 passenger rail improvement projects.  Amtrak has cost the government over $45 billion in subsidies over the last 44 years, allowing it to finance the upkeep of unprofitable routes, overstaffed trains, and the mismanagement of its food services.  Despite generous taxpayer subsidies, Amtrak has run operating losses every year since it began operating in 1971. Although these losses are declining, in 2014, the railroad reported what it described as a strong result, with an operating loss of only $227 million.  The operating loss is unlikely to continue to decline due to the losses in Amtraks long-distance routes, which bleed about $600 million annually. After factoring in depreciation and other expenses, Amtrak lost a total of $1.1 billion in 2014.   Amtrak has had 44 years to become solvent without success.

Would you recommend any areas I should look to improve? I'm trying to "regrow my farm" as far as pitchers because of all the trades. I'm thinking of trying to improve my reliever situation but I don't think I want to spend what it would take to get an elite reliever. I think the most I would trade would be Kazmir and I don't think the people holding the best relievers right now would go for that.    How do you go about that? I don't see a way to get around the price.    comment for updates   You can't pick up 6 of your own cards to seek validation for something you've already made! =)   Is the $20 bucks a month worth it?   I would pay.   Yeah I completely understand the idea that the best time to buy is whenever you're "ready," but I feel like 4K is pushing the advancement of GPU's faster and we're on the cusp of a large leap in hardware, similar to SSD's. I was tempted with the 980ti as well. Hopefully AMD's next GPU will be worth some of the hype and force Nvidia to quickly push something else out. I just want 60 FPS for 4K at around $500, then basically ride that out for 3-4 years before going SLI for another 3 or 4.    I sold my PC about 2 years ago and I've been itching to get another one. It's killing me because I feel like we're so close to 1 *affordable* GPU running 4k at 60 FPS, so I've been just patiently waiting... reading PC and hardware subreddits and crying.    I'll donate $15  Whats the purpose of shards anymore anyway. Each shard should just have different rules, and have like 10 shards. I know this option is currently impossible because people would lose properties etc so take this as more of a rant.    Well he doesn't hit any balls over the fence.   The trick for me is if you miss a Monday or you just don't feel like going on a Monday or a Tuesday etc because you won't be able to get a full workout in etc, just go the following day or force yourself through a day you don't want to be there. I can't tell you how many lazy weeks have started on Wednesday but I still continued the rest of the week instead of starting a bad habit.  Also this is a little more difficult but I have a few friends I go to the gym with. It varies daily but it helps keep me motivated if I'm having one of those above mentioned "off" days where I'm not feeling it.   I've been holding him on my non-dynasty team but it's getting old..., if SS wasn't my weakest position I would probably had ditched him already.

Your great uncle is a hero.   Never used or heard of Robin Hood. Zero commissions, where's the shitty part of this story. Truthfully I just watched their intro video and that was it.   I just did a trade that was centered around Hamels (3 other players also included) for Kershaw the day before the Braves outing, I feel awesome...    Not bad at all but my problem is I want to style my hair like that without all the height. Still enjoyed the video, good job.    Hey I just wanted to say incredible job!!

 Prison School, Gangsta, and Gakkou Gurashi are the best animes out this season.   I actually liked that arc. It reminds me a lot of the overly attached love in Mirai Nikki, except without the whole crazy murdering.   Baka to Test. It has romance but I'd say its more heavy on the comedy side.   I didn't get the vibe of a "dark" atmosphere. All I remember are ecchi/hentai scenes that involve the MC getting together with all the chicks. I wouldn't count that as infidelity because they're all seperate timelines. I guess the MC's twin sister was a bit overattached to him but I was more horny watching that than anything.   One Piece is actually a really good shounen. Check it out!   Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. It may seem that the main cast is invincible but, without spoiling anything, they aren't.   As someone who has seen the first episode of FLCL and decided to drop it, how is that anime a coming of age story? Also what themes are present in the "metaphors"?   Not sure if cooking counts as a sports anime but you should definitely watch Shokugeki no Soma!   I don't understand. How is it more like School Days? It seems a lot more like Amagami SS to me.   Yep, I second this. One of, if not, my favorite samurai anime. It tells a great story and I personally love the opening. Not sure if it's your cup of tea or not.   Go or Weiqi in Chinese. It's a great asian board game not yet very popular in most western and european countries.    I'm not a DC comic book expert but can someone explain to me what's the purpose of the Suicide Squad? According to the synopsis I read on imdb, apparently they're a group of antihero's who are hired by the government to do secret missions in return for shortened prison sentences. Why can't the normal superheroes do the job (ex: Batman and Superman)? I saw the trailer and it seems really cool and interesting but I have almost no knowledge of the group based on the comics. Also, why would they trust supervillains to do the job? Can't they just betray the government, run out, and then continue doing whatever thing they were doing before they got caught?   Your story reminds me of this anime called Welcome to the NHK. The main protagonist sounds a lot like you! You should definitely check it out.      There's so much shit I have to do. Most of my friends and classmates are off on vacation right now but I'm stuck at home with a ton of schoolwork I need to finish. Also my parents want me to get a head start on my college essay when I don't even know the prompt...    To answer your first question I have all my main Alpha skills on numbers 1-4 and my Beta skills on F1-F4. Then I have my health pots on the insert key. Do the storyline quests, leveling is actually much faster doing the quests than grinding. I suggest buying a 2x quest booster in the cash shop if you want to get to 180 and finish the storyline quickly.   I was thinking about getting that as well but I've been kinda speeding through the Zero dungeons and at level 137 I only have 43 dimension fragments... Apparently you need 600 in total for the whole set...   Hi guys! I just made a Zero and it's currently level 137. What are some nice endgame equipment for the class? I only have ~700m to spend. I know the CRA lucky item scroll is pretty expensive so I don't plan on getting the CRA set.    Not all hope is lost! Didn't you give her your contact information when you were exchanging phone numbers and such? Maybe she'll contact you.   Hey guys! This may sound like an advertisement but everyone should check out [AnimeCentrul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxx9D4IRDkjFrPdQ72AqBNQ) on youtube! He does amazingly funny live reactions and by far the funniest anime reviewer I know other than Gigguk.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centers_in_the_United_States   [Welcome to the NHK - Be my Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMZxs4K6Z3k)   [At the end when](/s "The soul finally discovers that Makoto's body was actually his own and his past mistake was committing suicide. I was crying when they showed a flashback/montage of everything that happened in Makoto's past." )   Watch Welcome to the NHK instead of Fate/Zero, it fits your description better.   I recommend the movie Colorful to anyone who's feeling down. The animation might seem a bit outdated but it's a beautiful movie with an interesting plot. Then ending is really touching/sad but it gives you a whole new perspective on life. Please try it!   Welcome to the NHK fits well with your description. It gets pretty dark  and depressing at the end but at the beginnning it's like a slice of life romcom.   I read that as Migi and I was like wtf what is Parasyte doing here on this list.   This is kinda different than the other other replies but I'd highly suggest Mousou Dairinin (Paranoia Agent) if you want to watch something darker and more psychological. I've seen it about a year ago and it's one of the darkest and possibly most depressing anime I've seen but it's really good!   Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko is more of a romance, comedy, slice of life than a heavy supernatural/fantasy/Sci-fi. I still think you should give it a shot. I liked it when I saw it 3 years ago.   Bruce Lee.   Umbrellas when it's not raining is used to block the sunlight, especially when it's really hot outside. idk about face masks   1. The animal species you chose will follow your every order and wishes. 2. You're able to communicate with the animal you chose. 3. YOU CAN'T PICK HUMANS.   Yeah I literally saw the first episode yesterday. It has really really slow  pacing but I can already see the depression and suffering after watching the first 10 minutes of the first episode. The art style may seem a bit different and old but I think it fits the atmosphere and mood of the anime.   YASSSSS I love Samurai Champloo especially the OP. It's been over 3 years since I've last seen it but I remember the anime quite vividly. I love the fight scenes especially with Mugen's breakdancing samurai sword moves.   YOU THINK NARUTO HAS EVERYTHING? YOU SHOULD WATCH ONE PIECE.   I second Mayo Chiki. One of the first harems I've seen along with Bokura wa Tomodachi.   I'd suggest Kara no Kyoukai if you want to watch something that's a bit darker. It's actually a series of movies and while it may seem confusing at first since it's not in chronological order, once you finish or get through at least half of the movie series then I'm sure you'll love it as much as I did.   I'd highly recommend Welcome to the NHK. It's a great show that has romance, comedy, slice of life yet at the same time it's one of the most depressing, darkest, and most psychological animes I know. You should definitely check it out! Also, if you're struggling through some difficult times or you're feeling down, I'd highly suggest watching it.   Be warned the anime starts off kinda comedic and light hearted but it gets darker as the series progresses. It covers some serious issues such as depression and suicide.   For anyone thats going through rough times or anyone who has just been feeling down or depressed lately, I highly recommend Welcome to the NHK. It's a great show and it's extremely underrated in my opinion. Please do check it out!   I second this! Especially this poem:  I saw it before me in shadows of doubt - My means to salvation: my only way out. It sat there in silence, and captured me, caught - Immune to my heartache, and deaf to my thought: 'I don't want a future, ' I solemnly swore, 'Of sadness and silence and loss anymore. I don't want a witness to witness goodbye - I just wanted someone to care when I cry.' I looked at it, waiting, and muttered a vow: 'Whatever. Lets do it. It's never or now. I'm ending it here, of an evening, alone.' I reached out before me... and picked up the phone.   This post should have more upvotes. Too many people put emphasis on being happy and to think "positively" when actually sometimes its better to just let your negative emotions and thoughts wash over you.   By the way, I couldn't help but think about Inside Out when I read your post. Your message is very much like the theme of that movie: You can't be happy all the time, being sad is natural and you shouldn't avoid it.   How?      I was going through a particularly troubling time period when I started watching Welcome to the NHK. The constant pressure from my parents about getting into a good college along with a slowly crumbling/strained relationship with a few of my closest friends dragged me into a depressed, helpless, and even suicidal state.    Watching Welcome to the NHK made me feel a lot better to say the least mostly because I saw myself in ALL the characters. I knew what it felt like to have social anxiety (Sato), I knew what it felt like to be depressed/suicidal (Misaki), and I knew what it felt like to have your parents control your life (Yamazaki). Just seeing another person, even if its fictional, experience the same thing you're going through makes you feel as if you're not alone. It's a really soothing feeling to have.   What did I takeaway from the show? Well, while there are a lot of various different lessons and themes you could find throughout the whole anime, I think the central and most crucial message is: Everyone has their own problems and although other people can comfort and help, in the end it is up to you to get yourself out of your own situation. Throughout the whole anime, it appeared as if Misaki was seen as Sato's "savior" but really she wasn't. I'll give credit to her for helping him become a more sociable person but in the end it was Sato, himself, who had to take intiative to get out in the world and overcome his social anxiety.    Overall, the whole anime series served as a "wakeup" call for me. My situation won't get any better just by me being depressed, I actually have to take the initiative, like what Sato did in the end, to make my situation better.   Edit: If you have time check out this amv. It really fits what Sato was going through. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMZxs4K6Z3k       Think about it this way  A key that can open many doors is amazing.  A door that can be opened by many keys is horrible.  Edit: it's just a joke. Calm down.   Are you stupid? OP was only going to text the italicized portion of the post. No one would text the whole entire thing. The non-italicized part is only further elaborating what OP mentioned in italics.     To his/her friends? Also I think OP was originally texting only the italicized portion but he/she further elaborated. Obviously OP wouldn't send the whole post as a text message.   I completely agree with your message! Anime is really beautiful and it often does teach its viewers valuable themes and lessons. I hate it when people just brush it off as a typical "cartoon" when it really isn't. Anime can have the same impact as a good book, movie, or T.V show.   As for the anime you listed, I enjoyed all of them. Toradora was also the first romance drama anime I've seen and although it's been over 3 years since I've last seen it, I still remember the story quite vividly. Clannad was alright for me, it didn't have as much of a lasting impact as Toradora or Anohana did but I also really enjoyed the second season. As for Shigatsu Wa Kimi No Uso, it was a great anime but it's not one of my favorites. I felt the story was a bit slow at the start and it really started picking up after Kaori was sent to the hospital. I can also kinda relate to what the main characters felt and the pressure of performing on stage since I, too, used to play the violin semi-competitively.   For me, the anime that impacted me the most is Welcome to the NHK. I definitely recommend it to anyone who's going through rough times (depression, stress, anxiety). The thing I like the most about it is how accurately it depicts depression and other mental illnesses. It also incorporates several genres such as slice of life, romance, comedy yet sometimes it turns really really bleak, depressing, dark, and psychological. Overall, I highly recommend it to you. I think you will like it and I hope you will watch it sometime soon!   I've seen Madoka Magica, part of Mushishi, and part of Death Parade. I liked all of them although I didn't really like the episodic nature of Mushishi. Death Parade I felt was more interesting. I do enjoy dark, psychological, and philosophical shows. I've seen Perfect Blue, Paranoia Agent, along with other Satoshi Kon works. I actually saw the first episode of Texhnolyze last night and it was REALLY REALLY slow. There was absolutely no dialogue at all within the first 10 minutes and the art style makes everything seem bleak and depressing. I felt it was sort of hard to follow but maybe part of the reason for that was because I was half asleep while watching it. I'll watch a few more episodes and if I still don't like it then I'll put it on hold. Thanks for your opinions and thoughts!   It doesn't help that literally the first page of the manga opens with the main character jacking off.   Yesss! I second this sooo much!! It really is a great story. I tried to recommend it to my friends but as soon as they heard the title they were like "uhh no thanks". I really do wish they make an anime adaption of the manga though, I think a lot of people would like it if they just gave it a shot.    I'm thinking about starting Texhnolyze. For those that have seen it, did you enjoy it and what type of audience would you recommend it to?      Yeah. The light novel actually didn't cover everything that happened in the anime. It focused more on Sato's own thoughts/lifestyle rather than the action and drama of the other characters. I actually liked the anime better but the LN was pretty good.    I've actually just finished Welcome to the NHK about a month ago! I love it and I also have the light novel for it!    You're really mature for someone your age!

 To be fair, there's a spoiler warning just before he gets into them. If it is a steaming pile, then does it really matter?

Probably my favourite piece of music of all time.   I was really hoping for some kind of Lost parody or something, a poster in the background somewhere, featuring ***this*** Matthew Fox as Jack.   "Bear" in sexual terms has several meanings. One is a promiscuous pot-bellied, hairy, horny man (that in some definitions can be gay). She's tasted bear before, because "her step-dad was a bear".   OR it was something actors are given so that they understand their motivations and attitude more. That often happens so that an actor knows how to play their character, especially when there isn't any information to draw from the material about a character's backstory.   Princess Carolyn called BoJack "BoJ" in the premiere. How would you pronounce that backwards, and who plays both of those characters?   Not to forget "My step-father was a bear." This was also a kinda gross play on words.   "We could have David Copperfield make the World Trade Center disappear!"     "Um...I hate to be the one to tell you this..." Here you think he's going to tell her about 9/11, but instead he says, "...but David Copperfield isn't really a big draw anymore."   I'm so sorry, Stephen Tobolowsky.   To be fair, from what I've heard, Psylocke's ethnicity is pretty complicated (having the mind of Captain Britain's entirely White sister and the body of an Asian warrior).

You know how I got past this? I started reading the books. The show doesn't do as good a job setting the characters or stakes up as the books do. I never really felt connected to the characters when I watched it, but now I've nearly finished Book 2 and I kinda love it. Being inside the characters' heads makes it much easier to invest in and understand the gratuity. There's a lot of backstory the show pretty much ignores or makes confusing, but with the books, it's all laid out.   Fletcher will go down as a classic movie villain.

There were no Rogue action scenes like we were hoping. She was only there because she needed something to do in the original script, and they had reshot her out for the initial cut for good purpose.     I'm sorry, but wtf was with that random sex scene? I can't believe Beast would be that naive. Why did we care that Cerebro was rekt, again?

For me, it's usually **"COME ON!"**   RDJ was a known star, most people were aware of Johannson, everyone knew of Natalie Portman, but Hemsworth, Evans, Pratt, Renner, Ruffalo, Olsen and Taylor-Johnson were *not* recognisable names to most people. It was the other bankable actors in the films in supporting roles, plus the franchise, that lent the series legitimacy.     EDIT: Yes, they did have solid careers, but they weren't particulary recognisable big name actors. That's what /u/Vanderlay_Latex_Sales was trying to say.   NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!   Well it was out for a full week in many countries before its US opening weekend. Might have helped.   tfw night's king is the real santa   What did it say?   It's been fully confirmed fake now.

Also, the Deadline report is from November (in case anyone doesn't check)   ALL HOT MUST PIE- wait, that doesn't work.   True, only Jaime.   The Mad Queen. She's going to burn that place to the fucking ground.   ["Weird Fishes"](http://youtube.com/watch?v=V_Ydoe4Q-Gg) - Radiohead. The way the guitars sound like one, head off in different directions, then transcend our dimension: mind-blowing.   Joel and Nathan Drake are pretty skilled mass murderers, so they'd both fit in here too.   He supported it because he's friends with Arnold IRL.          (edit: wrong abbrv)   Emilia Clarke is way hotter with her natural hair colour.     And Jai Courtenay is a boring Kyle Reese. Totally miscast.   I listened to several TV podcasts at the height of my podcast days, but mostly **LOST**-themed ones like Jay and Jack. Now, I guess the /Filmcast kinda counts, as they talk about TV shows half-and-half with movies in the portion leading up to their movie reviews.   Or Joffrey's, if the theories are to be believed.   Why would the peaceful Richard agree to purging DHARMA in 1992? He's such a righteous dude. Did he just have to go along with it because Ben and Charles wanted to?   I just call him Keith. That's how memorable he is.   What a coincidence! Yeah, [S5](#s "his sparrows (including Lancel Lannister) arrested Loras for the crime of buggery"), so he's supposed to be anti-gay, although I'm pretty sure it's different in the books.   First film: **OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA**     Second film: **BOY TOY NAME TROY USED TO LIVE IN DETROIT**   Huh. For me it was instant. He's introduced as Aeron Greyjoy, "Damphair" is introduced as his nickname, and it's really damp out there. Just clicked.   The entire opening montage being absent is what clued me onto checking. Everything past that, not sure.   Gay marriage was legalised throughout the US, IIRC (I'm a Kiwi, not an American), and this guy is supposed to be homophobic in the TV series (I've heard differently about the novels). I don't think it's supposed to be a homophobic post, just a joke about the character.   It's just a phallus, seeeeeee?!   DAMFAIR, PEE-TIRE, JENDRY     [Source](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pronunciation_guide)   His first chapter and a half were dreadfully dull, but after the Asha reveal there's just this funny air about the everything else in it. Listening to him feeling insecure while everyone else has fun was hilarious. Asha is described as this cute badass chick, his uncles are cool and he's just completely intimidated. It really gets to him. I loved it.   Jon not coming back is absolute blasphemy          That's exactly what they meant.   Game of Thrones' score has significantly improved since the early seasons, which I thought had a pretty bland score. True Detective has a great *soundtrack*.     Also, [your example sent me on a nostalgia trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_btA1bS53w).   Don't talk trash about St. Tyrion!   The polar bear one is hilarious when it's a genuine complaint.    Okay, so it must just be certain territories where it's in two shortened parts. Thanks. Hope you enjoyed it!   Just know if you watched it on Netflix in two parts, you're missing more than 10 minutes. Seek out the 105 minute broadcast cut!   So you're saying that I have to get shafted to realise I was shafted?          Kinda, yeah. There's a lot about this show that's worth watching. I definitely didn't call *you* pathetic, just the assumption you and many others have made - I worded that badly (and it made me sound like I was trying to insult you, which I wasn't. sorry). What I meant was that there's a lot of circlejerk over how Lost was or wasn't total disappointment, and then there's valid reasoning about whether it was or wasn't a disappointment. From your comment, you seem to assume that those who circlejerk over how *utterly offensive* the overall outcome and big picture of the show was, are correct. I never felt shafted, and plenty of people didn't. Season 1 was almost entirely character-centric, and expecting answers at the end of that kind of premiere season is, ya know, still valid, but nothing to be offended over. The show answers all of those questions in time, though with varying *relevance*. The relevance of those answers led some viewers to believe that certain answers weren't there, when they totally were - they were just pretty anticlimactic (in almost universally agreeable terms). This only speaks to several of the mysteries. And, like I said, they were not dead the whole time. Many people who even watched the show misinterpreted the ending. They all believe they were shafted and shout it from the rooftops. From hearing what aspects of the show you valued more, I can see you being disappointed in the ending, but you can never know. That's why I don't agree with you.   ...holy shit, I missed that anecdote!   [Lost spoilers](#s "They weren't dead the whole time.")          edit - fixed tags   The reason I love LOST is because the awesome journey and extensive interesting and often heartbreaking character backstory and development made the ultimately pretty fucking silly destination feel worthwhile, because the characters got the ending they deserved. Yeah, it doesn't always feel "complete" and "all tied together" by the end if you look back to episodes like "Special" and "Dave" which try to make a big deal about things that ended up being irrelevant. There are plenty episodes that feel frustrating on rewatch because of this. However, I don't blame the show for that. Every series has its shortcomings (I love BrBa and GoT, but they certainly have their hits and misses). These are my favourite TV characters of all time. LOST accomplished so many spectacular things, and to completely overlook its achievements just to be salty about it missing small details, *especially if you only watched 24 episodes (/u/horsenbuggy)*, is a bit pathetic.     I've heard fantastic arguments why the show is an ultimate disappointment, and I agree with many of their points, but...you can't assume one argument is right when you haven't seen the majority of what they're talking about.   I just spent ages reading that. Fucking hilarious.   You've certainly got a valid reason for disliking it. [Here's the interview where Lindelof recounts what Cuse told him about meeting GRRM](http://youtu.be/NzRjHDAgRmk?t=1572). Of course, Lindelof has always been salty about the backlash, so he may be stretching the truth.   Not a fan of the on-island ending? I didn't mind it. I mean, the show gets silly very quickly. There's a massive turning point in season 4 where it goes from still semi-realistic to completely batshit insane, and they resolve that specific cliffhanger in season 5 with an answer which was even more batshit insane. It was around that point where they dropped flashbacks for good (except for the occasional episode) as a means for characterisation. That's where it dropped most of the viewers. I'd say if you missed any episodes before you watched the finale, you haven't given it a fair chance. As for the ending, it was just as silly as everything else had become on the show. That's kinda what I like about it - they committed to the lunacy they'd built up to.   Nope.   That's what people say, mmm mmm.   Apparently when Carlton Cuse approached GRRM about why he didn't like the ending, GRRM said "I didn't like the fact that *they were dead the whole time*". GRRM didn't get the ending. I wonder if he would have liked it more if he understood it.   Maybe he did think they meant the scripts. Victoria did screw a couple of things up, like parts of discussing him being dissatisfied with Mr. Eko's death.   It's a reference to a time when some politician got a flan thrown in her face, apparently.   Oooooooooooooooooooooh, deary me...   Pizzolato and Fukunaga don't get along well anymore, which is why Fukunaga didn't return for True Detective S2 :(   He's directed some of the best TV episodes I've ever seen - ["Through the Looking Glass"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9ybaLbpQ-4), ["Live Together, Die Alone"](https://youtu.be/s4LvBV1GbtM?t=121), ["Happily Ever After"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65T-xl24W4E), and the classic [Walkabout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfKHVdmjzQ).

A pilot is a proof-of-concept episode given to the network before a show is green-lit for series. Most shows use their pilots as their Season 1 premiere episode because of how expensive they were to shoot. Almost all of the footage from GoT's pilot episode was discarded, as was with the pilot for Sherlock.)  	103
 I was 12, and scared like the title suggests. It was 1994, and my father married the love of his life. I was raised Christian and my Father was thrilled to find out that the 2 houses down neighbor woman was his age, single, and christian too. They met at a neighbors house for a neighborhood wine and cheese party (Sounds silly but this is Portland Oregon and this happens...) He dates her for a year or so then they get married, We go to church and everything's great. When they get married they both decide to keep their own houses and split sleep time between the two. Sweet! I think to myself. I had 2 bedrooms and 2 yards to play in, and now a wonderful little sister.  When Linda was here everything was great! We climbed the trees in the backyards, made perfume for her mother out of summer lavender plants, and went to summer camps and all that usual stuff. When she left to go back to her fathers house in Florida after summer ended, things would always turn dark. The light in the house would seem dimmer, sunlight filtration through the windows would be, I don't know, less like light? One particular night I was in "my room" at my step mothers, in the basement also know as the guest room. Do you know what it's like to bite into a real OREO cookie and how familiar and wonderful it tastes? Then eat a Safeway (West coast food store chain) knock off OREO and you can absolutely tell something is different? That is particularly what this night felt like. I was a fan of Archie comics, I was allowed to read until 10 PM on school nights. I was fully into a new Archie double digest when my flipper clock (Anyone over 30 knows what those are) said 10 PM.   So being the always eager to please youth that I was, I set my comic down and pulled the string on my lamp and made the room dark for sleep. As many kids do, I gave myself a few minutes to reflect and think, I could not get in trouble for being alone with my thoughts, That was my time. About a minute into my contemplation's of the day, week, or whatever, I heard wind. Slow at first, then steadily picking up in sound. I could not feel it necessarily but I could hear it. I thought, "Fine!" no big deal. But when the wind noise stopped with a sudden veracity, followed by a brief audible "Hshhhh"  I got a little scared, hell, I was 12.  As all this is sinking in (Remember it's summer time and outside it's like 65.) I could visibly see my breath, Puff, puff, puff... I reached my  hand into the complete darkness. A blueish white glow surrounded my splayed fingers and The temperature I felt was cooler than a freezer, the light seemed to be flowing around my fingers like petting a passing furry animal, then it was like there was a vacuum that seemed to pull the anomaly into the abyss directly away from my outstretched hand. Wide eyed and scared, I managed to pull the cord on my night light, scared as to what I might see, I still managed to. The lights came on, and the room looked normal. the temperature slowly over the course of a few minutes returned to normal.   I told nothing of my experience to anyone for a year or so. In 8th grade when I was 13, we were assigned to write a scary story for Halloween. I figured it had been long enough and I was not so frightened by the experience I would write about it. My teacher was really impressed with the imagery I used with words in the story, she read it to the whole class. Everyone told me it was a really good story. I had one friend I trusted. I told him it was true and he looked at me sideways and laughed and said " Sure Mike!" Later I come to find out my stepmother, after the divorce from my very Christian father, was a Luciferian. A tie maybe? I don't know. It is the most real supernatural experience I have personally ever had.    AHHH! You're correct! I have forgotten the face of Oy and Jake too. Father Callahan would be disappointed as well if he did not unfortunately meet his end that fateful day at the Dixie Pig.

 I may be an atheist but in the back of my mind i will always hope that i am wrong about the afterlife due to the fact that life after death terrifies me and i will never fully understand my own mortality. The surreal thought of life ending and there being nothing cripples me with fear. I am a human with my own unique life that enjoys many things but in the end none of that matters because after life i am nothing but someone who has once existed. Its been raining a lot lately and im kinda hungry.   I like fun skins that also may make the champ seem out if character so gentlemen Cho'gath is by far my favorite skin for him. For some reason i just love that skin and always makes the game fun if the skin is in the game. It's one of those skins that i just love seeing around.   Same been stuck trying to download for 5 hours. I had to restart it and i didnt do anything.   Thank you. I guess that i am just kinda pissed off and kinda depressed due to a lot of things going on in my life currently. If you look at the comments i replied to you may be able to like get what im taking about.   For the most part i wouldnt use it for a self medication due to me knowing that that is the main reason people get hooked on marijuana. Ive been severely depressed for the past couple years and one of the biggest things is this unbearable feeling of isolation and loneliness. I think that's the reason that these "freinds" have affected me the way i am. I mean i just lost my job since the store closed down which was also my hang out since i was 10, the girl i was with (she was 18 and all this shit. She has her own place and is going to college. I am not angry or anything and i understand her choices) kinda just cut me out of her life in the past 2 months, and ive been just really low of lately. If you look through my posts you can see that i have posted many times about it.  I just feel like that maybe if i did it every once in a while id maybe enjoy my high school life or life in general. It seems like all the people i know whp do shit are so much happier than me. All the people i use to know are getting high and they are so much happier than me i think.  This may be just some random itch and i am second guessing my past choices which may be frustrating me. Thanks for your output.   Ive never really had friends and that's a huge thing that depresses me. The people that i am currently associated with were completely drug free till about 4 months ago. I feel like that maybe i should at least give it one try before i completely rule it out or even like only make it an every once in a while thing.  Even at that the thought of smoking or doing any drug kinda scares me because i dont like shit that fucks with my mind. Thats one of the main reasons i refuse anti-depressants. I think that it may be because i am in a rough place right now and kinda want to find an outlet even if it will fuck me up. Ive lost the ability to care about my own well being and dont know what to do right now.  Honestly im more pissed off at myself for having any sort of second guessing or doubting of my choice to be straight edge since ive been extremely devoted towards it since middle school. I feel kinda lost due to these random urges.   I have been straight edge my whole life. I'm fairly young (16) and have very personal reasons for why i'm straight edge. More recently i have been struggling with trying not to participate in taking drugs. All of my friends that i use to hang out with and skate with only get high and shit faced anymore and i kinda brings me down that i spend most of my time alone due to the fact that most people i know do drugs. I feel like i would have more fun in my high school life if i loosened up and maybe smoked or something every once and a while. I feel like id be a huge hypocrite if i did due to how much i am/was against it. This is an issue brought from peer-pressure, my own chemical imbalances, and my struggle to actually belong/have friends. I just don't know what to do and i feel extremely lost lately. I've lost my job lately, i have almost no friends, and i just havent been feeling right lately. Anyone willing to give me some advice? sorry this is kinda poorly written. Finals and State testing have really strained on me and i havent been able to get some coffee lately.   I have been straight edge my whole life.

Stick with one adc and learn the range, skill shots, and combos extremely well. Make sure to really know your adc. A lot of adc's focus on attack speed a lot so that may be a good thing to build. Make sure to learn your place in team fights and know when to engage.   Most adc's are very squishy but still try to build up critical hit chance, damage, and such. Also never play too risky with an adc since it can be very easy to gank them. Always go for heal and flash unless good reason not to.   Im not the most experienced and this advice may be more specific for certain champs due to my lack of adc champs but this is the best advice i can give.   Yes. Ive been trying everything to connect o chat. Google doesnt help. Riot doesnt care.   Is this going around like before then? I know in the past it was an issue for a while.   I dont know if this is a good place to post this but i can not login onto the chat service. Ive tried googling solutions but nothing worked. Any advice?   Deathcore is better since it has more breakdowns. Morbid angel and all old death metal bands just sound like they're talking.   Thats rad as fuck   Id love to get the skins. For some reason i cant get the app. Help me out?   Bump   I feel a weird but horrible comfort in being sad. I do this aswell.   Cant agree more.   Okay thank you. I wasnt too sure if someone just managed to get him early. I know the jason posts are kinda annoying so i apologize.   I was online and the statistics on the bottom left shower that jason (some variation) was used 7 times. I know that its probably just from them testing him but does anyone have him?   I want a cat so badly to be honest but i just dont have the energy to take care of myself and a cat.    Because no matter how much you hate yourself or everyone there are still things you cant be angry or hateful towards (in this situation, lil cutie pumpkin). There are still things that can still somewhat make you smile or something of that sort. The world is a horrible place but such lovely things exist.  Just being depressed sucks and it makes me sad that such cute and wonderful things can exist in such a horrible miserable place. No matter how much i hate myself or want to die there are still small things that i cant help but smile at.  Sorry for my dumb rant just thought id put my input in. Stay strong buddy. It's okay to cry.   Yea i mean im sorta in the same boat. A bit different but the feeling is the same. The only thing ive done is just try to look foward and forget that she existed like she did to me. Maybe i did rely on her too much for my happiness but damn did i feel something that i have never felt before.  Just look foward, not meaning the future, but foward as in the next day. The next month. The things you couldnt do with her. Do all the things you use to do with people. Be you. Be confident with your ability to do all the things you've been doing in the dark on and off for the last 20 years. Life sucks. Im lonely. Im sad. The only thing left is to try to maybe grow to like myself and live a miserable life with a little content.  If anything, do not kill yourself. I have also tried to kiss death's lips and have them lure me to a place i thought i wanted to be. It is never painless and will only cause yourself to hate yourself more. Im horrible at giving any sort of advice but i tried my best. Ive been up for about 23 hours so i may have butchered some stuff on here.    Accurate   I like cant leave my house without showering but it takes a lot of energy to shower due to my long hair amd stuff.   I second this. Hollow body and dogwalk are also good examples.   Bates hardcore gym and the Mr.Roboto project in Pittsburgh PA   It has lyrics near the end but try Mogwai-take me somewhere nice.  Not really emo but its still a very sad/depressing song. On mobile so cant post link.   Reminds me of early blink-182. Its cool   I love their first EP "I'll get over it I guess" so i was excited as hell for this      Yea they're amazing. One of the first newer emo bands i got into. Im hoping to see them with modern baseball soon    Thank you!   Thanks!   Thanks man, The Descendents are my favorite punk band and actually is in my top 3 favorite bands. Also, it's not a bad thing cause Micheal Cera is rad. You're Rad.   Btw in your one pic you kinda look like Micheal Cera   	36
 IT by Stephen King, around 1100 pages I think.   Second is Fatal Vision at around 800 pages.   Loved both books, but there were times when I was like "I'm never going to finish this."   Just My Luck.    I've been reading The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold off and on for over ten years. I've started it and put it down probably six times.  This last time I thought "okay, this is it, I'm going to finish this book if it's the last thing I do."  And then I hit the 15% mark and I just can't read it anymore. I'm not sure if it's the writing that's putting me off or what, I just can't ever come close to finishing it.   Does anyone else have a book like this, that you've been trying to read for years but just can't get through?    I wouldn't do it. I'm sure some women would feel comfortable or even "grateful" like the woman you spoke to, but you don't and that's totally your perogative. It's your money, you should be able to handle it whatever way you want.  Maybe compromise -- you get a joint account with him that you both have access to. You both put 50% of your money into it, and then you each have separate accounts for the rest.  If he says no to that, that would be a deal breaker for me. You shouldn't have to ask your husband for an allowance if you're bringing the same amount of money to the table.   Godsend.  I'm probably one of 15 people that saw that crapfest in theaters. It's one of my deepest regrets.   October Sky   Have two dogs, go to the dog park fairly frequently. I've spoken to people but it's usually just "oh what breed? great weather we're having."   I'm 27 years old and I have no friends, and I haven't had one in years. And before that, even more years, and before that, never.  I was bullied pretty heavily through elementary, middle, and through part of high school. In high school I made a couple friends, one best friend I had through part of my senior year. In my senior year I met my current boyfriend. Around this same time my best friend and I had a falling out.  After high school I had a few jobs, never made any friends, went to college, made one friend. Her and I stopped talking about a year after graduation, and since then... no friends. I've had the same job for three years in retail, since I graduated college. I've always been way older than my coworkers, and now that I'm a manager I couldn't even be friends with anyone because it's fraternization and I don't want to get fired.  My boyfriend and I live together, we've been together ten years, and he's always been able to make friends and keep them. He's had friends for years and anytime he meets someone around his age, boom. Friends. They're chatting on Skype, gaming together, hanging out.   We were talking earlier, and I realized... he's the only person I talk to. Other than my coworkers that I have to be professional with because I'm their boss... he's the only one. I see my mom and his mom once every couple months, same with my siblings. But other than that, it's just my boyfriend. And I don't think that's healthy, I really think it's affecting me. I feel like I can't properly articulate my thoughts into words and almost like I'm forgetting how to talk. It sounds stupid but that's the only way to describe it. I feel incredibly awkward and self-conscious and the person I'm talking to thinks I'm an idiot.  I think the reason I never learned to make friends is because I was so heavily bullied. The people I thought were my friends in middle school were using me and teasing me behind my back. And even though that was 15 years ago for some reason it's still affecting me. And I don't know how to get past it. Whenever someone shows any remote interest in me (which is very rare) I think they're really just making fun of me and think I'm a weirdo.  I'm just looking for some advice. I can put myself out there, join a gym, do a hot yoga class, join a club, whatever. But that won't help me not worry that the person I'm talking to thinks I'm weird or annoying.  Tl;dr Bullied in school, never really had any friends except for a couple in high school in college. Worry it's affecting me and worry that everyone that talks to me thinks I'm weird.   Infant Sorrow is one of my top to listened bands on last.fm. Searching for a Father is my jam.   I love Apollo 13. I've seen it so many times but I still get really emotional, especially in one of the last scenes where everyone is waiting to hear if they survived.  Such a fantastic movie.    Maybe not "ruined," but when Inception came out I absolutely loved it. But then the Internet got ahold of it and went fucking crazy, every other post on Tumblr was about it and I just got sick of hearing about it.  I still like the movie but I definitely got tired of it.   I don't really get it.  Companies need people spending money to make money. People need jobs to spend money on the companies' product for them to make money.  The more unemployed people the more everyone suffers. This is why I think the entire idea of working robots you don't have to pay is just asinine.   I recently went to Vegas with my boyfriend, too. First ~adult vacation with no family.   I had more savings than him, so I paid for the hotel, flight, and a Hoover Dam tour ($900 or so) and he paid for the food and pretty much everything while we were down  there. Drinks, aquarium, etc.  I thought that was reasonable, and I think your request is reasonable too.    I have two minis and even though they're small grooming usually costs upwards of $50 each.  I've cut one of them myself a few times. The first time she looked really good, but the second and third it was really choppy and if she was in school she definitely would've gotten teased.   It's Summer and even though we're in the PNW it is freaking hot. I catch one of them sitting in front of the fan constantly and I know having shorter hair would make them feel better, I just don't want to screw up their hair.  Anyone have any tips on grooming yourself? A special kind of scissors or anything that makes it easier and look nicer?   Fast food places are the only places you'll have a chance. McDonald's might be more difficult, look into Dairy Queen, Wendy's -- smaller chains, or even just local restaurants.    I work retail and have to have customers sign on a digital screen and on a piece of actual paper occasionally.  People are idiots. Big ass box, people sign outside the box. Thick line, people sign at the top of the page, bottom of the page, anywhere but the line unless I point it out.   District 9 I believe   I live in WA and have heard of so many people getting fired or not getting hired for a job because they failed the drug test.   Just because it's legal doesn't mean anything. Company policies aren't going to change.   Harvest time!  (At least in my house)  	19
 I have no idea. I've been trying to figure out what's really going on. I'll know more once this lead pans out.    I've been apart of this fan board where we post about our favorite hobbies for the past five years. My specialty happens to be Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I love talking about it, getting into the mythology of the Buffyverse, debating with others what each item or character symbolizes, and merely enjoying a show that pioneered television. The other day, after posting frequently for the past five years, I get a message from the moderator of the Buffy board:  SpuffyFanatic: "Dude, what's your fucking problem?"  I didn't know what she was talking about. I looked at my recent post history to see if maybe I said something offensive and didn't realize. I noticed a comment posted to a "Best Villain of the Series" thread (I'm so tired of seeing a new thread popping up with the same overused material!). The thread was originally posted by user MellowD. I know I didn't post in it, but I read the comment anyway:  MrKittyFantastico: "Peek-a-boo, I see you. XXXXX W. XXXX ST, XXXXX, OK XXXXX"  (I've redacted the address to protect the user's privacy.)  I immediately responded to the moderator.   MrKittyFantastico: "I have no idea who posted with my account, but it wasn't me."  The moderator responded rather quickly.  SpuffyFanatic: "Change your password and make sure to keep your information private. Whoever did it scared the ba-Jesus out of OP MellowD."  MrKittyFantasico: "Got it. I don't know how it happened. Sorry."  SpuffyFanatic: "Just make sure it doesn't happen again."  I left it at that, a simple hack or something. Hell, I even thought maybe a friend logged into my computer during a visit while I was in the bathroom or something. But why would they doxx a user? Definitely not cool.  I approached Dev, the only one I figured had the capability of pulling such a prank. Let's just say he wasn't appreciative of my accusation.  "Seriously?" he asked. "You think I logged into your computer without your permission, got into some random Buffy the Vampire Slayer messaging board you're apart of, found some random thread, doxxed OP of said thread, and then logged out as if nothing happened just give you a hard time?"  I shrugged my shoulders. "When you put it like that..."  He didn't speak to me for a few weeks. I don't blame him. I was just wondering what the fuck happened. I even messaged MellowD.  MrKittyFantastico: "So sorry about whatever happened in your thread. Just know it wasn't me. I don't doxx anyone. I don't even know how! Please, I hope this doesn't turn you away from the group."  About an hour later, I get a reply.  MellowD: "Spuffy, explained everything. She said you're a long-time member and said you'd never do such a thing. Once she realized your account mighta got hacked, I cooled down. Just really freaked me out for a minute."  MrKittyFantastico: "Totally get it. I would be too. Thanks for understanding."  I pretty much let the issue go. MellowD wasn't mad, Spuffy wasn't too upset and was quite understanding, and I couldn't find anyone willing/wanting/capable of accessing my computer. It must've been an outsider somehow using my account to freak someone out. I upped my firewall security and changed passwords on various accounts, including the email I use for the Buffy board.  Let's just say I was surprised when I received an email from Spuffy.  SpuffyFanatic@XXXXXX: "MellowD is freaking out. She's received several PMs filled with pictures of her house, all coming from your account. I even took a look at the IP history and it's all coming from the same IP that you've been posting from for years. Are you doing this!?"  I was stunned. Absolutely dumbfounded. What the hell was going on? I didn't even live in Oklahoma! I responded immediately.  MrKittyFantastico@XXXXX: "It isn't me, I swear! I don't even live in Oklahoma, based on the address the hacker posted earlier. Please, you gotta believe me."  My heart is racing. I'm freaked out and I'm not sure how to make this right or prove I didn't have anything to do with this. Then, I get a PM from MellowD.  MellowD: "Thanks for letting me borrow your account. Now, I have my own to use at my disposal. Don't worry. I'll be seeing all of you real soon."  Blood drained out of my face as I stared at the monitor. Did this mean what I thought it meant? Did someone break into MellowD's house? Did they do something merely to get access to her account? Why? What was happening?  Shortly after I received the PM from whomever was posing as MellowD, I received an email from Spuffy.  SpuffyFanatic@XXXXX: "Okay. Apparently, MellowD's boyfriend had been playing a prank on her. Somehow, he accessed your account via phishing and used it to freak her out. She's really upset at him, all because he was jealous she was talking to people on a Buffy fan board. Jeez, what a creep. Teenagers, amiright?"  That didn't make any sense. How could Spuffy blatantly take a lie so easily!? *Oh, nvm, my boyfriend just played an incredibly elaborate prank on me involving cyber-attacks on innocent people all because he's a douche-nozzle who isn't being paid attention to.* Fuck that. I was pissed.  Another PM from MellowD further made things impossible to believe.  MellowD: "Nobody will believe you."  I immediately responded back with a fury of a thousand keyboard warriors.  MrKittyFantastico: "Bring it on, dickhead. I will get to the bottom of this."  MellowD: "Bored now."  Then, she, or whomever was using her account, blocked me.   Agreed. I understand missing things, but this was seriously overlooked by OP. Further, why message asking what happened if you're not going to continue on to the next episode as the transformation from Ben to Glory happens late in the episode?   And yet the dog is fine and lives a happy, rewarding life. OP learned from their mistakes.    People go through periods in their life. It sounds like the owner is getting a great handle on his issues via training the puppy. He fucked up at the beginning. He realized he was wrong and changed his behavior. He's not saying he doesn't deserve the comments from his original post. He's saying he is glad someone encouraged him and helped him to change, to be a better person. Whether he came back to throw it in people's faces or not, he isn't a bad person. Just someone who was lost and has now been found. Let's hope you don't make any mistakes that could be looked down upon.   I'm thinking the Phoenix would be great. I will hit them up and see how they feel about a small group coming in to start the group. As for the nerd/game bar idea, I definitely want to support them. I've been in contact with the individual who is starting it and told him that I am down for holding the group at the new restaurant should it open. For now, since it's merely a trial run at another restaurant/bar. So I think he should focus on the general nerd community in Tulsa.    Great! Well, I will most likely create another thread shortly with new developments. I'd like to see this go live within the next month!   I appreciate all your comments. I would love to see these meeting rooms, but I also think we might need a little more personality for our meetings. That's just me though. Secondly, I think we're going to focus on Saturday right now. So maybe a 5-7pm start time and go on for either however long or a couple of hours.    Just a quick comment since I'm doing 80 things at once. First off, thanks for all the info. Secondly, what about the Phoenix coffee shop? It has quite a bit of space and seating we could possibly invade as well as a bar. Just a thought because you mentioned Chimera.    I've never been to The Max though I've heard it's a great nerdy atmosphere, but I worry it might be too loud? Is the music pretty intense? Fassler Hall seems almost perfect, as long as people don't mind Geman food and drink. I know nothing of Chimera.   As for places to meet up, we could always try different places with each meeting. Or do you think it'd be safer to maintain a HQ where we always meet?   I wouldn't care so much about why Xander did it if there wasn't a huge context of Xander only doing it out of jealousy. Did Angelus need to be stopped? Yes. I didn't see Angel getting his soul back so much as forgiving him but more as a way to lock Angelus up. Nobody said they'd have to forgive Angel and just pretend everything was okay. Even in season 3 they never really accepted him back into the fold, hence his departure (as well as knowing it was best to stay away from Buffy).   Xander comes off as a pompous jerk who blames Buffy for bringing him into the supernatural and expects her to fall head over heels for him. Xander's useful, and has been, but he fares better after growing up and maturing. Sadly, this doesn't happen until season 7.   It wasn't until I got older and rewatched the show that I realized how messed up Xander actually was and annoying. I get why he does what he does, but it doesn't make it any less childish. He doesn't get a pass, even with Jesse's death. He chose to continue to be a part of Buffy's life, and not just because he's such a "good" guy. He wanted to jump Buffy's bones, and he couldn't deal with being friend-zoned for years.   BEWARE... SPOILERS AHEAD!  I loved season 7, and the Slayer potentials made complete sense. I don't get any of the hate. The atmopshere was similar to seasons 1-3, but our characters matured. In seasons 4 and 5, our characters were dealing with becoming adults. Season 6 really forced them to overcome their issues and mature. Now, season 7 has them being adults dealing with the typical supernatural nonsense in their lives while knowing their places in the world.   Buffy has moved on from dying, coming back from Heaven, and finding a way to use her 'protector' skills by becoming a student advisor. She's even allowed Dawn to participate in the reindeer games.  Dawn has become less whiny and annoying. She gets to be involved and actually becomes quite helpful throughout the season. I really loved how they distinguished the similarity between her and Xander, being on the outside looking in.  Xander has FINALLY gotten over Buffy choosing Angel, or even Spike, over him. He realizes he's messed up with Anya in season 6 and he's accepted his fate as a construction worker even leading his own team in the reconstruction of Sunnydale High. His loss of an eye refers back to being the outsider looking in. He really took a beating this season, which I think he deserves after the previous season.  Willow has evolved, but she's also integrated the things she hated about herself. Dark Willow mocked how weak and nerdy Regular Will was in her early years. But we see her now reminiscent of her old self, even prior to season 4. She's combined her doubting self and confident self in a version we all love. I don't totally agree with the way they handled her throughout the season (knocking her out all the time), but I guess if you don't know how to be creative (and I'm saying this passive aggressively because this show has been incredibly creative through the first 6 seasons) then there isn't much else you can do. I also disagree with how she got with Kennedy, but I can see how she got involved. I'm thankfuly they're no longer together in the comics.  Giles gets thrown to the side this season due to Anthony Stewart Head leaving the series as a regular in Season 6. But I feel he has ran his course during the series. He's the father figure, the wise old Wizard with the sage advice. However, I do like how they handled Buffy and Giles' relationship this season, showing that Buffy no longer needs his advice. She's her own person now.  Spike has always been volatile and this season he's at his most peaceful, despite being a murderous Sleeper. But with a soul, Spike feels more at home in his skin than any other season. He's the supportive boyfriend that Buffy always wanted/needed, so that's why I will always been Team Spike despite his attempted rape in season 6.  Anyanka hasn't really changed anymore than usual during this season, but she's still the same, sweet demented Anya she always has been in previous seasons. If anything, I'd say she accepted her humanity more this season than any other, per her speeches towards the end of the season.  I miss Tara. I wish she had come back for "Conversations with Dead People", but I would want her to call Cassie out on being a fake. Basically, Tara, a good ghost, telling Willow to see through the First's facade as playing Cassie. But that's me.  The Slayer Potentials weren't any different from Buffy being a teenager. So again, I don't see the hate there. After being brought back from the dead, Buffy affected the Slayer line, allowing the First to make a play. It wasn't far-fetched or out of lines for the show. If I have a complaint, it's that the big temple in which Buffy finds the last Guardian. All this time she's roamed the many graveyards and we've never once seen this really odd, out of place Egyptian temple? Also, we have the Guardian to give us a cryptic message only to be killed seconds later? Deus ex Machina if I ever saw it, but at least Joss admitted to it.   It'd definitely be downtown I thought. Not sure of a good place that would allow an intimate setting without being too noisy while also allowing a decent-sized group some space.  So far, Saturdays seem to be best.   I was thinking that at the beginning of each meeting we could do a writing exercise and then read each other's writing (switch with someone new every meeting, if possible) and critique. Then, we can go over a topic each discussion but keep it loose. Let everyone participate with general knowledge learned through their writing journeys. We can keep the discussion open and allow everyone to talk about whatever in their writing. But have at least a broad topic within which to focus the talk.   I agree. I just think it should be up to the school (high school or college) to provide the knowledge and resources to educate an interested student to research their major before picking one. I unfortunately didn't have those resources. But you are correct.   Why is a degree in, say, creative writing equal to a degree in watching Netflix? Do you know the amount of work I put into my work as a writer or my education? I am a self-publishing author who maintains two jobs in order to make end's meet while trying to fulfill my dream of writing. I don't want to sell millions. I don't want to deal with the massive corporate-owned publishers. I want to do decently, make at least $36K if possible, and be happy with what I do.  I don't appreciate the attitude that because it's a liberal arts degree that it means the students put in less work/time/effort or that their jobs are meaningless. Without liberal arts, you wouldn't have philosophy or movies or television or art or comics or music or books or digital graphics or the idea of creativity that has helped develop innovation with yesterday's technology to provide today's software and hardware.   In today's society, you can't go to school without getting loans. In order to pay tuition, you either sign away your life or begin campaigning in hopes of getting grants or scholarships. If you're not athletic or science-focused, you're pretty much screwed. Combine that with very few resources and little assistance when starting college and you have the situation we're in now. I started school without anyone to help me understand financial aid or what it meant to "pay for school" because my family either made enough to where I didn't worry about fees or made too little that they were covered by the school. I was alone, going into the process because my parents worked full-time jobs with overtime. I'd ask for help and people would tell me to "call the number on the back" or "go to the website at fafsa.gov".   It isn't fair that we either have to choose to go into debt for a job we're going to dislike, thus wasting time and money anyway, or working in service jobs we can get with said liberal arts degrees and get paid very little simply because we're "lesser than" on the totem pole.  Meanwhile, the ones sitting high on their horse's staring down at the menial folk who fix their coffees, make their pizzas, deliver their food, or provide their customer service get to act smug.  Thanks. Appreciate it.   Well, keep an eye out. Once I get something ironed out, I'll announce it officially in another thread.   You have a good point. See who shows up and act accordingly. See what fits for the group.    *Heroes*...  We distinguish them from the rest of us because of their superpowers, hold them high on pedestals for saving countless lives. They **are** different from their opponents, whom we call Villains, but only because they breed destruction in the name of justice rather than chaos.  Nobody is guiltless. All those who picked a side in this tug of war, with humanity as its prize, are blameworthy. And I'm here to set the record straight.  They call me the Godkiller, and I'm here to dispense justice of the truest order as I rip off the masks of these sadistic mother f*ckers and show the world exactly who they are for putting us in the middle of their selfish war.   A few people have shown interest in getting together and doing a loose workshop to talk about writing. I am starting another thread to further expose the idea and see if we can get any others interested. Further, I wanted to nail down some ideas of what we're wanting to accomplish in said discussion.  First off, what do we want to do during said get-together?  I'm stealing a comment made by /u/mike918 (hope you do not mind):  Workshop style: submit work, give and receive feedback.  Lesson/lecture style: targeted instruction on specific skills like point of view or the pathetic fallacy.  Book club style: read a shared book, but discuss it from a craft perspective rather than a meaning/interpretation perspective.  Shop talk style: writers getting together for drinks, motivation, and commiseration.  Note: We can do all of these. Maybe one gathering we could submit work/feedback; the next visit could be a lecture/lesson; monthly, we could do a book club style; and end off the month with just shop talk (relax, drink, swap ideas, talk about writing). We need to find out how often to host this group (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly).  This brings us to my next point: where do we want to host this?  I would prefer keeping this writing group 18+ in age. No offense to our younger generation of writers, but I would like this to be a pretty open-minded group in which we can curse and be jovial. BUT I am open to anyone's counter-point to this.   If we do decide to make this 18+, then I say we find places that A) allow a decent sized group to gather and talk loudly (not over the top loud, but someplace we don't have to hush one another), B) a place where we can drink and/or get food (nothing brings folks together like drink and a meal), and C) preferably someplace that feels relaxed and somewhat intimate to allow discussion.  Lastly, when do we want to meet up? Not just for our first meeting but for all meetings. I say Saturdays after 2pm (since I work until 1pm) or Sundays after noon to accommodate any churchgoers.  If anyone has thoughts on this, please feel free to speak up. I am open to all options and thoughts. This group isn't JUST about me. It's about you guys and everyone benefitting.  	20
    I would've saluted the motherfucker if i was there... thats the real American hero if you ask me... And i can know it, i'm Dutch.   well, you're partially right.    Why the hell is a KKK march even allowed, i like your country you guys, but this would never be allowed in the Netherlands. Here we would say: fuck your free speech, common decency is way more valuable to us.    Thanks for the tip! Tomorrow i'm going to try Alaba/Boateng instead of Schmelzer/Vertonghen!    I'm a bit of a chemistry whore, but with Schmelzer i can have my pink Reus at 10 chemistry. But i guess i can tolerate to see him at 9 with Alaba from Bayern? Schmelzer is doing fine though.      Thanks! I was a bit broke after buying Schweinsteiger (yes i'm that poor) but will definitely buy Alaba when i have the time to play some more and earn the cash!   Gravity has to do with the mass of the earth right? I'm the "Jon Snow" of science, so correct me if i indeed know nothing.    Wow, nice team!!    Since i've got my free Futtie Reus i've changed my squad to fit him in, i've been playing with this team for a few days and its just absolutely amazing.   http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36956836/   Nice! I've got Futtie Reus for free (thanks EA :D), he has been absolutely amazing for me. 12 goals in 5 matches.    Great to see a Dutch actress become popular in the US again, she's doing a great job in GoT, she really 1-upped the romcom image she had here in the Netherlands. The "naked in every movie"-image is still intact, but hey, i won't complain   Thanks EA, just have to find me a ManU Schweini and i can make this team happen :D  http://www.futhead.com/15/squads/36751930/   Yay, i've got Reus :D   All polar bears are lefties   Glad they've changed Fantfourstic       This video is taken in the Netherlands. People here call it the "Django Unchained incident". He was arrested because he couldn't identify himself because he had a false ID-card.       Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn, great trailer!      Love the Flemish accent. Great video!  	22
 This one is from LA in Los Feliz neighborhood called Churro Borough   They actually already make a horchata flavored ice cream here to go with the sandwich. Mine was a spanish latte flavor.

I'm looking for a decent espresso machine, but not one that's too cheap like those you can find in Walmart. Any suggestions? What do you guys think about the Waring Vero Barista? It looks nice.   I'm moving to Las Vegas next week and I'm afraid there won't be any good coffee shops/roasters there.

Looking for something that's inexpensive (I know, difficult) to moderate, definitely not luxurious. Specifically, looking to be there April 15-20. Also anything to do in the Guayaquil and Cusco areas. Also one day in Lima. Thanks!   nutella   have you ever considered a choose your own adventure book instead with alternate endings?

This is seriously one of the more cooler activities I've seen at con. Will be definitely keeping a look out!   They don't have them where I live. How much did they cost? I love the designs. Would they be able to ship them??    Where do you get those coffee bags? I've asked roasters before and they don't sell them.   awesome, totally looking forward to kickstarting this!   This isn't sold in the states is it? How'd you buy it? Also how would yours be different from this one?   Let us know when this gets on kickstarter. I'd definitely be interested in this.

    they don't have to release information regarding their policies  I'm sure a fast-growing private equity buyout firm like BC Partners will mind their legal P Qs. But here the issue isn't whether it's legal to do it, but whether it's fair.   the manager positions I mentioned are now off the career guide on the website.  You might also want to see if they are still visible through [the Internet Archive WayBack Machine](http://archive.org/web/) and if so take screenshots. At this point, I'd say document everything and figure out later which pieces are important.

Note that   (1) This report is as yet unconfirmed, and   (2) The link here is an .np (Non-Participation) link.        [Here's a video interview with the managing partner of BC Partners about his plans for PetSmart](http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/09/bc-partners-raymond-svider-on-buyouts-debt-and-his-affinity-for-cats/).   The union you want to talk with is probably United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), the largest union for retail workers. I don't want to discourage anybody from joining a union, but it's not easy and this company is already so far along in restructuring that you may not be able to do anything to stop it.  A recognized union, with a contract, only works when it formalizes already existing unity among the workers. For PetSmart to reach the point of recognition and contract would be a many year long process, necessarily involving thousands of workers, that could only get started if the UFCW believed it had a good possibility of success ... and right now, UFCW has other and bigger companies in their sights.  HOWEVER: the changes you describe may well create a situation in which there could be enough unity among the workers in your particular shop to get some concessions even without a contract. Go talk to the organizing director of your regional UFCW office, and don't be shy. You don't have a lot to lose by doing so. And if several workers go together to management and announce their intention to form a union, you may even get additional protection from retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act.  You can and should double check anything I said here with your state AFL-CIO before acting on it. I *was* a national union staff organizer, but that was years ago and my recollection may be rusty. Good luck!   Huh? That's the *archive*. What's the issue?   This article is *four months old* -- in terms of what's been happening here recently, that's a lifetime -- and it was a big part of the external pressure that led to the admins' change of policy.  So I'm a little confused about why it shows up here now, long after it appeared on 15 other subreddits and was quoted or cited in numerous press reports about reddit. OP?

How much?     Speaking of technical issues, can you address [this thread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3dz6n3/do_not_forget_to_find_a_july_29th_event_and/cta84f4)     people are scheduling it for the wrong time.  I don't think "people" are doing this, at least not actively. There's a common problem with scheduling software that sets the default at 12 noon unless the organizer sets it for another time -- which experienced users would know to do because most of the uses for such software are for individual, time variable events. But it becomes a problem when a lot of new folks are using the system to set up gatherings at a fixed time, because many assume the software will do that for them.  In any case, you can't possibly repeat your caution too often!    That's a weird URL by the way.  Which one, and why?   That study was in 2014. The most recent available estimate for the total voting age population in the US was [237,657,645 in 2012.](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/01/26/2012-1635/estimates-of-the-voting-age-population-for-2011) If the turnout is 40% (what Pew was expecting in 2014,not necessarily what happened), the approximate size of the Party of Non-Voters was then 60% of the total, or 142,594,587 individuals who need a reason to bother voting at all.  Of course those numbers are very rough, but the scale of it should provoke some hard thinking around here. To advance the campaign, much less win the nomination, will require refocusing from arguing with people who already read the news and vote to those who have everything to gain by voting (esp. for Bernie) but don't believe it yet.  And *that's* why face-to-face organizing matters.   OMG, I accidentally transposed two letters! That typo obviously means I'm an idiot.   So ... you got "volunteered" in your absence?   They're going to keep adopting and mistreating animals until someone convinces them to do better. Simply stopping them from getting this particular kitten, or taking it later, won't work. I think you have to do the more difficult task of sitting down with them and talking about your concerns, without precipitating bad feelings.   And remember, even adults can grow up more, and maybe they have or are starting to do so. In this case, it's a good sign that they went to a shelter that vets the cat and requires an interview and fee -- many people would have just grabbed the nearest "free kittens" ad on Craiglist. Try to build on that: "You obviously care enough to select a healthy kitten and make sure it's medically protected. Do you need any info or help with raising it?" is the gist of the message, although I'm sure you can find better words. Speak to their better selves, give them a chance to do the right thing, and keep advocating if you see signs of trouble. If his parents are also your mate's parents (am I reading this right?) maybe they can also help.  Just don't assume, even with the evidence you cite, that this can't work. Help them make it work.   So where's the Sanders vote going to come from? The only place it could come from in order for him to win: Existing Hillary supporters.  This is the failure of imagination that informs all of the Beltway press skepticism about Sanders. In reality, the largest block of potential supporters is what the Pew Research Center, using methodology far superior to that used here, identified as [The Party of Non-Voters](http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/31/the-party-of-nonvoters-2/). This group could be the clear margin of victory *if they can be organized and mobilized* in  the next year.   This 2014 study by Pew is so important that all Sanders supporters should read it and think deeply about what it will take to get these folks to believe it's worthwhile to vote at all. Fortunately, I'm willing to bet that many members of The Party of Nonvoters hang out on reddit.  The one sector of Clinton's base that is problematic for Sanders is her strong support among African-Americans, which may well prove to be unmovable.    ... and those short shorts with tall white socks!   Well, we do have a small lawn (in a bigger, non-lawn yard). Still: how do such rates compare to what it would cost if the cost were set by hourly wage rather than by the job? I can't see paying someone more for a half hour than most workers make in an hour.     Good point: just mowing. He's careful about edges, though.   Really! I pay an adult $15 to do ours. For $40, I'm tempted to do the OP's lawn myself.    If everyone that smoked weed signed the petition, this would be on the ballot.  Yes, because nobody who smokes pot has any critical thinking skills and would just automatically sign for anything that mentioned legalization. It's not like there has been a widespread campaign to discredit RO, or anything.  I prefer to call it mockery.  You can call it whatever you want. It won't change what it is.    Well, for pandering ~~demagogeury~~ demagoguery, that was pretty impressive.   EDIT: fixed typo   If no one here has a specific suggestion, you could ask at a nearby church or synagogue. The minister/rabbi will surely know of some reliable teenager in the congregation who will do it.     So it looks to me like a bunch of sanctimonious, pretentious leftists/progressives are the reason this was shot down.  This is not your conclusion, it was your premise -- and it's laughably wrong. Aside from not grasping how the political process worked here, your notion of who smokes is a baseless stereotype. Because you don't smoke, you have no idea how many lawyers, lawmakers, doctors, successful business owners, soldiers, soccer moms and other upright citizens smoke pot.  As for whose moral compass is broken, I'm happy to set my identity and record on this site alongside yours for comparison. I've never [set up a subreddit dedicated to hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/HamplanetHateMail/comments/31v2ko/i_started_a_subreddit_with_this_title_about_a/), let alone routinely used the word "retard" to disparage commenters who disagree.

He said repeatedly, "Athens and Columbus".   Try for a *foster* home, while the search for a permanent home continues. Perhaps a relative, friend or neighbor of your mom's would be willing to do this; at least this pool of people should have someone in it who can help you place the cats so you can concentrate on your mom.    Even if it were what the OP thought he was linking to, it would still be a ridiculous post.

[Previously submitted here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/3dzht1/a_new_southern_wedding_tradition_firing_guns_into/)   Well, stop the presses.  Why does this merit a post?   If Sanders gets the nomination, sure. Before then, not a chance.   The problem is that it's still, for a campaign, necessarily contested terrain. New users don't know and can't easily find out about alternative subs to discuss the general issue, and so go to the obviously named "gateway" subreddit.    Lazy to nonexistent moderating is the likely cause. I refuse to read Yahoonews, but that's the classic mistake made by newspapers in their own comment sections, and it's why [they're choosing now to eliminate them.](https://www.google.com/search?q=newpaper+comment+sections ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8#q=newspaper+comment+sections)   Should be posted to politics and other relevant reddits.  OP?   [It's worth noting that there are far more postings of this article on various subreddits than show up the "other discussions" tab here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/duplicates/3dzrl4/men_who_harass_women_online_are_quite_literally/)     middle-class raised males who display minor hostilities towards anonymous women   That's not who I was talking about -- and if that's who you were talking about, perhaps you're taking this rather too personally.        raising awareness does precisely nothing to cure cancer other than take money that should be going to research... the funds raised at these events hardly ever actually make it to research  You may know a lot about cancer (or maybe not) but you clearly don't know much about fundraising, and your assertions are absurd.   Read more about domestic terrorism by hard rightwingers and miscellaneous spree shooters. What I stated about them is not remotely controversial among researchers and LEOs.  And although I wasn't talking about them, it's hardly a stretch to assert that these findings will prove useful in dealing with ISIS-recruited young American men given what we know about them.  Adding, we all "know" a lot of things about social psychology, but it takes studies producing consistent results over time to change norms and policies. It's not like the money for this even *could* be redirected, even if we were dealing with a zero sum budget, which we're not here.     Exactly right, as I learned the hard way. Siphotrol does it all in one afternoon. But it really isn't necessary until your ankles are getting as many flea bites as the cats are.    Are people seriously funding research into "losers" who harass women?  You should take another look at the dominant pattern of lone wolf domestic terrorism in the US over the past three decades. Anger at losing control over or being unable to connect with women is the single most obvious recurring element aside from access to weapons. I'd be happy if results from this study *only* helped with this one issue -- and there are a lot for other benefits to learning what makes such men tick.   Wise move. That's one smart cat you have there!   I can't decide whether that's adorable or terrifying. If that's possible, what's to stop them from "borrowing" the car?   Better grab one of the clear nights this week -- they've been too rare this summer!   What do you mean "we", kimosabe?  Step back and examine your assumptions, please.   As much as the money raised on the day, these events are about developing donor relations. Having participants sign up supporters is an effective way of outsourcing the process of finding new donors, and every step of the preparation and follow-up ties all those people closer together and closer to the cause.   Have you used the search function to find other discussions of this? It comes up fairly often. There may also be something about it in the reddit Guide to Columbus (sidebar). If there *isn't* such a thread linked in the reddit Guide, you could do everybody a favor by adding whatever you find to that wiki.  EDIT: [here's one discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/269e7k/best_places_to_go_star_gazing_in_or_around/)   No, but it can bump you up the list.   [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3dxsgq/eli5_how_do_the_jury_members_of_multiyear_trials/cta4m48)   Are you a registered voter? That's often the bottom line. Voting for a long period from the same address also bumps you up the list.      ... and you just helped make things worse with that nasty, uninformed post about "stoners" being responsible for RO's petition failure. Why not try to improve the tone,rather than complaining about it and adding to it?   This analysis is assbackwards: Responsible Ohio's petition is failing because voters who support legalization have *succeeded* in organizing against this particular initiative, convincing others to not sign even to put it on the ballot because of the monopolistic structure of the proposed "reform". RO has so little support that they are having to use almost exclusively paid circulators, whose valid signature rate is laughable and probably won't get any better in the next 10 days.  We're all going to have to wait for something better, and it doesn't help that the competing "grassroots" initiative seems completely incapable of leading anything (for reasons that have nothing to do with being stoned).    I like you.    Caution: the "flea bombs" sold in most stores are a waste of money.  The best treatment for the whole house is NOT sold at the pet store, but at the vet's office, because this is what they use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. It's the nuclear bomb of flea treatments: works instantly and for months afterwards. But it's not to be used lightly -- if you're not being bitten, it's not time for this stuff yet. If you do have to use it, follow the directions to the letter ... and then relax, because the problem will be over for the year.     Congrats on providing a great life for Max. I think you've just significantly raised the bar on kitty birthday cakes!   I hope you're taking lots of pics at every stage, especially the pointy-tailed moment and the (later) jumping sideways stiff-legged stage. Those photos can make all the difference in finding homes for kittens.   It's a hard discipline. I still have the last four I tried to foster, eight years ago, so now I'm not allowed to even look at live kittens. When we go to PetSmart, I've asked my husband to make sure I stick to the main aisle and to stop me if I veer toward the adoption center. That's why I spend so much time looking at other people's kittens on reddit (usually with one or another grown cats plastered to my side).    He was just a big dumb happy shit, and his life related that.  Ain't nothing dumb about getting you to bring him inside and love him for life. Just sayin'.   OP, don't listen to the Unwelcoming Committee!   I've always had a tortoiseshell or calico cat, and I adore them. They have [distinctive personalities](http://consciouscat.net/2014/09/30/tortitude-unique-personality-tortoiseshell-cats-fact-fiction/), besides being wonderful to look at. Your Thea and Thalia (great names, btw) are gorgeous!   "The economy" can, should and will eventually be reorganized to value people before profit.    Maybe the answer is to create room in your budget by getting assistance with *other* necessary costs. Are you receiving Food Assistance? If not, it's very likely you're eligible, and this can make a huge difference. [The Ohio Benefits Bank](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/) can sit you down with a social worker who will assess your whole financial situation and show you what [programs are available to help you stay afloat and healthy](http://www.ohiobenefits.org/programs.php#health-healthystart).   I like this answer better than the real one.    Your general point is well taken, but if you mean the mural that literally says "Olde Town East", the sticker isn't ON the mural but on a traffic light switch box next to it.    Do you want all the comforts of home plus extras, or silence and solitude?   Capitalism. The same system that includes big, rich companies *and* a propaganda culture that promotes unrealistic expectations about entrepreneurship, mostly based on the notion that it's desirable to cut expenses at the expense of the very people who make profit possible. There are millions of businesses that are functionally under-capitalized and always will be, but their deserved demise is delayed by widespread acceptance of an unsustainable definition of value.  And that's all I have for now, because I have to go pick up my brilliant sweetie from his criminally underpaid job.     I don't understand why you didn't answer my question.  Okay, then: yes.   I'm referring to a whole system, not one business. I have sympathy for the employees tasked with enforcing the current definition of value by trying to hire people for far less than the true social value of their work, but that's not going to stop me from pointing out that the entire concept is distorted in a system that overvalues individual acquisition of wealth over social responsibility.  Managers who can't hire for this reason are being set up to fail by the people who set "the company budget".   In addition to listening to BLM, Bernie needs a reorientation on how to present his views on the relationship between race and class. His analysis is correct that eliminating wealth inequality is a necessary precondition to eliminating race and gender inequality. But simply making that assertion is insufficient, especially in a culture so divided by the history of slavery and the grotesque distortions of identity politics over the past 30 years. He has to be able to explain in plain English *why* that is the case.  Adding, the BLM folks were not attacking Bernie. They were trying to get the attention of a major conference of mostly white progressives -- and the national press there to cover Bernie. I don't know what panels NN15 did on racism or police accountability, but I do know they would never have been mentioned by the press if this hadn't happened. Sometimes, being formally "on the agenda" or even on the stage isn't enough. Sometimes, a little strategic rudeness is needed to reboot assumptions.     Who's setting the "value"? What if the current definition is not only wrongheaded, but massively unjust?   No particular suggestion better than those already posted, just a big THANK YOU FOR READING BOOKS!   Says the brave anonymous redditor for 57 minutes.   If you can't own your own coherent, unedited user identity, no wonder you're displacing anger against yourself onto others. *You* don't deserve to be deleted, although your comments do, and I hope you find the help you need in time to realize the benefits of compassion and community.   Er, a library would have a record of the previous borrower, who likely never meant to leave that Powerball ticket in the book.

And both Lowes and Home Depot are structured in such a way that any appliance repair service is probably from the manufacturer rather than the mall-type retailer. (I'm sure someone will correct this if I'm wrong.)   I've always bought from Sears because their Kenmore appliances are extremely durable and their prices (especially at the Outlet Stores) are easily the best. The installers are another story, and I would recommend having someone else do that if you can.   But I must say that the last time an installer screwed up, on an AC window unit, my complaint to customer service resulted in them *setting aside for review and then losing the entire purchase record* for that and the $800 refrigerator purchased at the same time, with the result that I got both for free. Never underestimate the power of clerks who don't get paid enough to hassle.   True. That second comment was below my set display level and I didn't see it until you prompted my to go back and find out what you were referring to.    It's amazing how much good we can do for others just by being a little vulnerable.  Amen! There's persuasive evidence across many cultures that an unwillingness to admit vulnerability is the ultimate weakness, because it effectively cuts an individual off from from the healing power of community. Conventional gender roles have placed most of the pressure to hide self-doubt and sadness on men, but it hurts everybody because we all lose the gifts of the ones who remain silent too long.

Any competent shrink (let alone mature common sense) will testify that when you think you're the only smart one in the room, the problem isn't other people. I sincerely wish for you a moment of rigorous introspection, followed by asking for the help you so obviously need.   Torties are the best.

They're all decorative items produced for the mass market starting in the 1950s. "The Circle of Friends" may reference earlier, less commercial art, but don't be fooled by its pseudo-rustic appearance or the fact that some hippies may have bought it. It's from a time when decorative art in the US was all about appropriating themes from Other Cultures and adding exotic backstories. I'd bet that most people who bought early versions of it rightly expected that their friends would be wowed by their selection of a supposedly ancient and unique "artwork".     Yes, because promotional copywriters never make shit up.

That's the saddest pic I've ever seen of a cat that has a home.  OP, doesn't your friend do anything to keep kitty warm?    By now he has probably reshaped the entire story to make it about how he made all of you wish you were as clever as he is, and he may even believe that's what really happened.

When you link to a post from another reddit, you're supposed to change the "www" to "np" in order to prevent brigading or just distortion of the vote balance because of input from people who aren't subscribed. If you vote or comment in an .np thread, you risk being banned by that sub's mods, or even shadowbanned by admins. This is a good thing, because it shores up the ability of subs to become communities based on the participation of people who actually care about it, rather than being disrupted by careless or hostile input.     Thanks for adding that!   /u/keltric is correct. Mark it solved.   Okay, thanks. I remember that Rez Rat moment; I just didn't realize the main motivator for creating /r/IndianCountry was the /r/NativeAmerican mod's refusal to act.   It's such a shame when an obviously-named gateway sub -- the one with the name newbies will look for -- becomes useless because of bad modding. /r/politics is the one that makes me white-hot angry on a regular basis, not because it's dominated by one political viewpoint but because the mods have decided that the definition of "politics" includes only news about elected officials and candidates. They remove anything about advocacy groups, coverage of government agencies, major cultural developments that have political implications, etc. In that case, too, there are several alternative subs, but so far none has emerged as the consensus relocation site for an all-sided consideration of politics.   Thanks again for the explanation. I have been lazy about where I post Native news, but I'll now work harder to make sure /r/IndianCountry is at least the *first* place I put things.    I just realized this conversation was taking place on /r/NativeAmerican instead of /r/IndianCountryso no point in reporting crazy racist stuff.  Could you explain this a bit? I subscribe to both, but never really understood the split.      just taking the piss, you know for the craic  I'm surprised by the number of commenters who don't understand this very basic aspect of what happened.     condescending  Exactly!

It could happen.  It *does* happen, all the time, and seeing scapegoating as a major dynamic in politics clarifies a lot of what's happening now. [Here's a helpful analysis](http://www.politicalresearch.org/1995/02/05/the-snake-oil-of-scapegoating/#sthash.8MtBqC6G.dpbs) of how this plays out, especially in America.     At the time, at all levels of government, radical protesters were considered un-American at best, traitors at worst. Calling in the National Guard was not uncommon, and the practice only came into question when they [killed four white college students](http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm).   Do you know where she was living at the time?   Aside from basic human decency, one reason is that bad food in prisons is a leading cause of prison riots, in which guards (who presumably get more empathy from the likes of you) get killed.   Nope. It's something reporters *aspire to*.   Depends on your experience, I guess. I love it because it reminds me of my grandmother, who had both a tree and a great recipe for black walnut bread that she shipped to all the grandkids every Christmas. So I pick them up and sniff them when I see them, and that transports me to a happier time.   Thank you! An hour later, there's no sign of further blood, and she's busy complaining about which flavor of Fancy Feast we gave her tonight. But when it happened, at 11:30 PM on a Friday, it was really scary.

When I moved to the southern US, I was terrified of unconsciously mimicking the regional accent.

It was written in 1952 by [American songwriters Harry Warren and Jack Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Amore) for the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis film *The Caddy*.    Thanks. Another user also clarified this below. You can see how I got confused!   Species: Feline  Age: 20 years  Sex/Neuter status: F/S  Breed: DSH  Body weight: 5.6 lb.  History: CKD Stage 3  Clinical signs: bleeding at SQ injection site  Duration: three minutes until stop  Your general location: Ohio  Our elder kitty has been diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease, and has been on daily fluids for almost a year. She's doing remarkably well, staying active, eating well and accepting the ritual of being injected. But tonight blood started coming out of the injection site as soon as we finished. It was enough to freak us out, but apparently stopped after soaking just two facial  tissues. Did we do something wrong? Is she in trouble (she seems even more perky than usual today, coming and going)? Is her skin just losing elasticity, or what? I can call the vet in the morning, but any answer now would help us sleep tonight.   Does Tigs always wear a onesie, or is there a medical reason?   Thanks for clarifying that! Personally, I think one should always dress up to the max when rescuing kittens, but for me that just means a clean t-shirt, not a heavy coat ...   Tell me about it: I just dislocated a knee for what must be the 20th time, and realized this time will not be the same quick recovery I got used to in my 20s. The psychological aspects of getting older are fine by me, but the physical changes are a literal pain.   This is an important number, because it's what really matters in determining wages -- unlike the "index to inflation" which is much less. But dammit, if they're going to squeeze more work out of us in the same number of hours, it shouldn't be workers who absorb the difference.    Ouch! Hope you got lots of sympathy mileage out of it.     I've always heard it as "turned out" meaning the firefighters are wearing their [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing).   I think OP meant "turned out", as in dressed in [turnout gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_gear#Turnout_clothing).   Yep: cats can go all boneless when it suits them!

It will be drastically reduced through negotiation, and much of the remainder will be absorbed by the hospital.      Kitty has a strange notion of what "fit" means ...

Thank you so much for this post! I just spent the time since you posted reading around the Justice Project and Open Communities websites, and I am totally inspired. I sent the link to my sister, a lifelong social justice activist who just moved to Winnetka and will be delighted to find these folks. What a great group!  Adding, you might be interested to look at [this project](http://www.comfest.com/purpose.php), which is not nearly as ambitious but has been plugging along, gathering fans and changing social norms, since 1972.   Wow: what an auto-fill fail. "Being Moody" is the name of the column and has nothing to do with the content of this piece. Much more relevant (and more likely to get readers to click the link) is that this is a report from the Netroots Nation conference.   That's already happening. I'm still hoping for a paradigm shift such that elders could spend their last years with their families (whether birth families or created collectives). Nursing homes, no matter how good, are a barrier to inter-generational respect and understanding.    Thanks!   Okay, thanks. I did get an answer from admin mail about my original question, and thus am now satisfied that admins can, in fact, see private/closed reddits.   Is the user I was talking to an admin?     when I get the chance, I do spread the word  The more people who do this, the fewer sad stories there will be about failed shelters. I don't know about other areas, but in Ohio there's a steady drumbeat of news stories about small rescue orgs getting overwhelmed and ending up dumping their charges into municipal kill shelters. So yes, let's spread the word!    next to the username   I'm sorry to be obtuse, but whose username? I'm looking at a private reddit that I created, and don't see anything like that, whether logged in as myself or another account. Do you mean, if I find my way to a closed reddit for which I'm *not* a mod that "turn admin on" will be next to *my* username?    I may have oversold that idea. My parents had such a tree, and talked about someday harvesting it, but when they died the last thing on anybody's mind was dealing with a tree.

Point taken. Let's say, instead, *people of faith*.   Can we send you out to preach this to the rest of reddit? You're so right about the awesome stories -- we all have so much to learn from our elders, and the reflexive dismissal of older people's opinions is such a terrible waste. Elders are exactly the people who have *earned the right* to rant, even when they're nutty. We need to learn to understand that, too.    Thank you so much for posting this. It's such a disservice to people who do rescue and such work when people choose to make an imgur gif without linking to the video. I pitched a fit at/u/Gallowboob about this last week, because he's such a frequent offender, and he pointed out that redditors are more likely to click on an imgur link than a YouTube link. I get that, but:  **Everybody, please include the link to the full video in the comments when you post an edited gif about rescue work.** These folks deserve support!    Linked above ITT.   Looks *exactly* like a Black Walnut. OP, here's how to tell: do you hands look stained and have a strong smell after handling the nut? Is the ground underneath the tree inhospitable to other plants? That's a Black Walnut.  If you own the tree, do what you can to make sure it grows straight. The wood from this tree can be very valuable, but only if it grows straight enough to cut into lumber.   Eww -- not *at the table*, man. Wait until you get home.   Amen!  This is the fastest growing and often the most effective sector of the progressive movement (think Moral Mondays), yet it remains invisible to many young activists who have swallowed the New Atheism koolade.

To my knowledge there aren't any really active private subreddits that are about hate.  Source of this "knowledge"?    stupid fucks off reddit  Gee, thanks. Being a vet tech -- even in a rescue hospital -- doesn't give you license to act like a jerk.   For others who may be tempted to take this dismissal at face value, I would advise taking this user's absolute dismissal with a grain or ten of salt. Refeeding syndrome is rarely seen in vet offices except in cases of hepatic lipidosis, precisely because veterinary care costs money and the cats that come in are more likely than not to have had basically good care. In rescue work and shelters it's another story, and the caution is *always* warranted when talking to someone who just found a starving kitten and knows nothing about cats.   It looks like you're right -- and just what this area *doesn't* need is one more threat to sycamore trees, dammit.   at the worst I think maybe two nights should acclimate most everyone.   That's optimal for 7K. I try to convince people to give themselves at least 24 hrs. before starting down, but even that's a tough sell for people who don't recognize the issue. I'm glad you and your co-hikers have had no trouble, but I'm usually talking to unprepared/overeager newbies, and over the past 3 decades I've seen a lot of them felled by "mysterious" ailments that were actually predictable and preventable consequences of elevation change. And hiking with individuals who ignored the advice is not pleasant, so I keep pushing it.        I'd appreciate it if you could link me to some convincing evidence supporting your claim, as I am interested, especially if they've been covering it up.  I can't because this all came out in a series of posts over a couple of years to the Grand Canyon Hikers and Backpackers Yahoo group, which is great day to day but not very searchable. The one person who knows the most (because he's an MD who practiced at the Canyon) has been effectively silenced by threats of a defamation suit. But it's something to keep in mind.  Anyway, thank you for this post. You may have saved somebody's life, and certainly saved some folks' vacations.     (1) You've done more than enough for now. Be patient.  (2) Please tell us you got the cats out of the house when you bombed it.   (3) If the problem is severe or widespread (i.e., fleas are biting *you*), the product that will end it completely is the stuff vet offices use: Siphotrol Plus II Premise Spray. You *should* buy this from a vet, so they can explain exactly how to use it. It's the nuclear bomb of flea eradication and should be handled with care.     You forgot one thing: they're mostly coming from sea level states to rim elevations of 7,000 feet or more, with no idea they need time to acclimate. Blinding headaches, fatigue and fear are the usual result.   [I think you'll appreciate this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/34y44e/this_is_why_we_dont_hike_grand_canyon_in_the/cqz4icv)   You should know that a good number of experienced GC hikers have concluded that such water delivery systems are actually dangerous because they encourage the hiker to sip *too much* water, leading to the danger of hyponatremia. The manufacturer you cite is extremely aggressive about legal bullying to stop dissemination of that analysis, but after one experience of hyponatremia, I'll never stop pointing this out.  BTW, it would be a mitzvah if you would amend your original post to emphasize the danger of water intoxication and urge hikers to carry very salty snacks and use V-8 in place of energy drinks.   Hyponatremia -- also known as water intoxication -- is a huge, under-appreciated issue for desert hikers. Following the advice in the original post here could get you in serious trouble, because it does not address salt loss.  You're absolutely right about V-8 being the best re-hydrating drink. It has *all* the electrolytes you need, unlike sports drinks. After one experience with hyponatremia (that even a concerned Ranger didn't recognize as such) I started carrying a can of V-8 for every day in the Canyon. It's worth the weight!   Now that you've survived it, you'll probably enjoy [Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon](http://azdailysun.com/news/local/canyon-deaths-and-counting/article_ba588a05-e816-55be-87f6-80f15b76f744.html), the book every new GC hiker should read before stepping off.   I don't even begin to know what to say about this -- but don't miss the note at the bottom about the name of the realty company.      Also, isn't following a suspect out into the parking lot moving into another jurisdiction? The parking lot is owned by the mall, not the store.   I ... I just couldn't help myself. It was such a tantalizing subject. I blame all that late night TV for wearing down my commitment to FWC. Or maybe it was my parents' fault. Certainly not mine, anyway. Please don't ban me!   Just did that.  EDIT: actually, I just messaged the admins. What you  linked is an archive, not a contact.   I was going to ask why schadenfreude -- but your user history makes it clear: one of these jerks was your teacher.   That doesn't answer my question. My understanding (from many years ago) was that the *content* of private reddits is invisible to  the admins, although they could see the fact that such reddits existed. I never knew whether it was a technical matter or a policy decision, and it may have been a myth to begin with. But it will take a definitive answer from an admin to convince me either way.  	200

Find the one person who's deathly allergic to grapes.  Hey, you only said I had to kill *someone*.   Sing a duet with it.   I'm not. It's just same old same old.   In the first case, why then do coin flips tend toward 50-50, or why do the number of heads in n trials come out to be binomially distributed?   I wouldn't say arbitrary, but heuristic. Scientists reject hypotheses that cannot be disproved, support hypotheses which have historically been successful at prediction, choose between different models by null hypothesis testing, AIC, BIC, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, maximum a posteriori probability, various regularization methods, and have heuristics such as Occam's Razor. As a culture, scientists converge on particular epistemological heuristics for assessing potential models.   Approximate Bayesian Computation?   Coalescent theory is fun. The branch of population genetics that kills me though is diffusion theory. Partial differential equations, stochastic differential equations, and continuous-time markov processes. Ech.    In other words, all it takes any other hypothesis that makes the same prediction and the two hypotheses would be impossible to distinguish.  But the space of potential models is infinite. You have to have some kind of model selection criteria.      Not just hard work, but successful people usually come from backgrounds where they have safety nets, connections, resources, and opportunities.   That would be the response of a rational healthy person, but addicts are neither rational nor healthy. They have a mental and physical illness which needs to be treated, regardless of how they got into the mess.  I think the money would be better spent supporting rehabilitation programs. Finding out who's an addict and denying them welfare doesn't help them.    And the institutions that were testing them had far more resources and funding than the Oklahoma welfare department. Yeah, that hurts the argument for testing, I get that, I'm just laying everything out here.  Uh, except they *also* have far more resources and funding and motivation to do their best to pass drug tests. Since these are at odds, there's no a priori reason to favor either way.   That was a terrible anti-joke.   Great premise and action.

Titled "Hard Problems" iirc.   I qualified for USAMO twice, though was never good enough to move beyond that. I started in between 7th and 8th grade, it took me 1 year to qualify for Mathcounts Nationals, and 1 year to narrowly miss the USAMO cutoff (was 1 AIME problem away). Didn't do well the following year, but qualified for USAMO the next two. My best Putnam performance was my first year in college, and declined after that since I got more rusty over time. I'm from a non-competitive region, so Art of Problem Solving was my main resource.  The first two years were spent going through the first two volumes of Art of Problem Solving, participating in the forums, doing practice tests, and doing competitions like AMC12, AIME, ARML, USAMTS, AoPS mock tests. AoPS has done a great job of democratizing the math scene by giving access to people who don't have local resources like math circles or strong math teams. I spent hours every day those first two years practicing or learning theory and tricks. I'd say it takes about 2+-1 year to get to a level where you can qualify for USAMO and maybe even solve 1 or 2 questions on USAMO, but to get the point where the first 1 or 2 questions on USAMO can be done in a few minutes so you have enough time to solve the rest of them, and can do it consistently with speed, takes years of additional practice. The people who are USAMO winners and IMO team members have probably put in a good 4-7 years of hard practice and over 10,000 hours.  Solving Olympiad problems is a matter of building requisite insight. The problems cover geometry (euclidean, projective, inversive), number theory, inequalities, probability, algebra, trigonometry, complex numbers, combinatorics and a few other subjects; calculus, statistics, and higher (undergraduate+graduate) mathematics are not required, though they can certainly be useful. Some of these topics aren't covered in high school or even many undergraduate curriculums. There's a kinda standard corpora of theorems and tricks and problem construction ideas that are common in contest problems, ranging from necessary even at the lowest level competitions to fairly advanced or obscure. However, combining these techniques to solve Olympiad problems is non-trivial and requires experience and insight. There is a kinda meta-gaming in that, unlike research problems, Olympiad problems have a solution of an expected level of difficulty, and there is kinda a limit to the breadth of problems that can be proposed, so familiarity with lots of problems is definitely helpful. At the same time, Olympiad contest writers must think of newer problems which aren't as easily solved by knowing similar past problems, so the meta-game moves forward over time--the present is always the time where the most past problems are available to students to study. The best problem-solvers have built great depth and breadth in the techniques, theorems, and problems they have in the back of their minds over many years of practice. They're self-motivated to do well and very passionate and generally start early, but there have been some people who have started later who have done very well.   Jamie Nanefuas slapping Jamie Jamies butts   *woosh*   Opening and closing their stomata in public.   Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg outfit.   This was only mildly interesting OP.   That 21 year old's gonna be on a list.   OH GOD SHE'S UNDER 15?!  *I'm going to jail.*   If only the movie had this many colored actors.   Sure, but to generate the stimuli, you'd need an advanced model of the physical world. Which in and of of itself could be interesting to explore.   Sure, but this article isn't about cross-contamination, or political economy, or intellectual property laws. It's in the title, this article is specifically about the health allegations against GMO of anti-GMO organizations and the hypocrisy in their public statements.  Sorry, I just don't like when people criticize work for not being about something else. If every article on GMOs were comprehensive reviews, all we'd be reading would be 200+ page tomes.    Things should be labeled for what they are.  Yup. But there are dozens of labels that are more informative and therefore should be prioritized over GMO labelling. The irony of your comment is that saying something is that labelling something as GMO or Non-GMO is very ambiguous. From the article:    GMO labels dont clarify whats in your food. They dont address the underlying ingredientspesticides, toxins, proteinsthat supposedly make GMOs harmful. They stigmatize food thats perfectly safe, and they deflect scrutiny from non-GMO products that have the same disparaged ingredients.   But then why stop there? If companies should be transparent, they should QR code all products with hundred page documentation. Why should we prioritize GMO-labelling when there are dozens of other labels that would be more informative to the user?    Patents and stopping farmers from planting seeds from crops they grow are the more scary side of the GMO industry.  But this is true of hybrid crop seed as well, farmers in general have been using commercial seed since before the discovery of DNA.    the whole article seems to fall foul of the same cherry picking it accuses others off and seems to imply all GMO products are safe and the health benefits/risks seemed overplayed.  To quote the thesis of the article:   The more you learn about herbicide resistance, the more you come to understand how complicated the truth about GMOs is. First you discover that they arent evil. Then you learn that they arent perfectly innocent. Then you realize that nothing is perfectly innocent. Pesticide vs. pesticide, technology vs. technology, risk vs. riskits all relative. The best you can do is measure each practice against the alternatives. The least you can do is look past a three-letter label.  So I think your claim is unfair, the article is arguing for nuance, and exposes hypocrisy in the dogma of a particular brand of anti-GMO organization. The article addresses the main classes of GMOs, of which there aren't actually that many: there are insecticide producing GMs, herbicide resistant GMs, individual disease immune GMs, and humanitarian efforts to increase yield, nutrition, and drought resistance. The only type of GM that I can think of off the top of my head that wasn't covered are the FlavrSavr tomatoes with increased shelf-life from the 90s.   Ugh, I hadn't noticed how Pearl's just *clutching* her stomach. The SU crew really know how to animate those bodily cues.   ...alien invader from high tech caste-based race bent on domination of Earth. Checks out.  Also, obligatory DOOOOOOOM   Question: Is holo Peridot a ship ability or a Peridot ability?  Either way, there are a lot of parallels between Peridots and Pearls in their form and function.   More like administrative, information relay, role.   As much as I love the Peridot foot pun jokes, has anyone else noticed the implications of that scene? Gem bodies are supposed to be illusions, so why does a detached foot remain in existence instead of going poof? I think her body may not be an illusion in the way other gems are, but fully mechanical.   Congrats on the threesome!   Also remember that she's young enough to be baffled by "archaic" Gem tech.   Take THAT Gravity Falls.   That's because we're all now years into adulthood at least. *Please die Spongebob*.   *High Six*    I don't want to support companies like Monsanto that use this technology to make crops that won't reproduce and force farmers to buy new grains from them every year.  But this isn't a GMO-specific concern. Non-replantable commercial seed has been the norm for farmers since the earliest commercial hybrid crops from the early 20th century.   But they're not informed choices. If you want informed choices, you need a better set of labels than "GMO" vs "Non-GMO".      "I'll drink your milkshake. I'LL DRINK IT UP." The entire ending scene of No Country for Old Men.   A nice way to see this is a geometric interpretation of multiple regression. Let there be N samples, and M predictors X1, ..., XM, and response Y. Each of X1, ..., XM and Y are vectors in the vector space V = R^N. The M predictors X1, ..., XM span a subspace U with at most M dimensions (if linearly independent) but possibly less. The estimator Yhat is the vector in U that minimizes the euclidean distance to Y, i.e. it's the orthogonal projection of Y onto U. Since Y = Yhat+residual, the residual vector lies in the orthogonal complement of U, which has dimension at least N-M (equal to N-M if linearly independent); this is the degrees of freedom.

IIRC, since 2011, USA IMO team selection is based on a year-long series of tests for a small group of people who did well on USAMO and the TSTST the *previous* year.   There's probably a lot of talent that slips through, but that's true of any competition, whether sport, music, or math. Local opportunities (good high school math teams, good local math circles, high concentrations of mathletes) is a big factor. The online community ArtOfProblemSolving has done a lot to democratize the process, it's much easier for students in non-competitive areas to join the community. The most important factor is still practice and determination.  The selection process is pretty complicated:   The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a 15-question 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% (or score at least 100) on the AMC 12 high school mathematics contest (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% (or score at least 120) on the AMC 10.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination   AMC 12 based indices are determined by taking AMC 12 Score + 10*(AIME Score). AMC 10 based indices are determined by taking AMC 10 Score + 10*(AIME Score). Cutoffs, based on AMC 12 indices, are determined so that approximately 260-270 students qualify for the USAMO. Cutoffs, based on AMC 10 indices, are determined so that approximately 230-240 students qualify for the USAJMO. If a student took the AMC 10 and 12 (i.e. AMC 10A and 12B or AMC 12A and 10B) and qualified for both the USAMO and USAJMO, the student must take the USAMO.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad#Present   The main purpose of MOP, held since 1974, is to select and train the six members of the U.S. team for the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). Students qualify for the program by taking the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). The top twelve American scorers from all grades form the "black" group. The approximately eighteen next highest American scorers among students from 11th grade and under form the "blue" group. In 2004, the program was expanded to include approximately thirty of the highest-scoring American freshmen and sophomores each year, the "red" group; this was later split into two, forming the "green" group, which consists of approximately fifteen of the highest-scoring freshmen and sophomores who have qualified through the USAMO, and the "red" group, which consists of those who have qualified through the USAJMO. The colorful designations of these groups were adapted from Karate. In 2013, the red and green groups were unified. Also, with the new system the Black Group includes more or less only the IMO team, which is not necessarily all USAMO winners.   Until 2011, only Black MOPpers were eligible for the selection to the USA IMO team, determined by combining USAMO results with results of a similar exam called the Team Selection Test (TST). From 2011, a new test called the Team Selection Test Selection Test (TSTST) was established; this test is open for any of the participants of MOP, and along with results from the USAMO, determines the students who take the TSTs. This ultimately, along with the USAMO and MOP tests, determines the IMO team.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Olympiad_Summer_Program   The people who are USAMO winners probably are past the 10,000 hour rule for experts. 1000 hours for USAMO qualifier seems about right to me.   Also in Russia, and other Eastern European countries like Romania, are where the traditions of math olympiads and math circles originated.   Check the artofproblemsolving.com community boards.   I love the idea of seeing science in action. The POV perspective, time lapse, and music choice make it pretty exciting. Would love to see more people do this.

    Fair enough in a standard brick and mortar setting.  However, what many people don't realize is that an owner/operator of a food truck with one employee in a busy location will pocket an average of $350-500 daily, if not more.  It is actually very lucrative if you have your product dialed down and are in a a heavy pedestrian area.   Terrible situation.  As someone who has owned/operated/built/ several trucks and food trailers, I'm curious why you say they we all barely making it.  That place always had people there plus spillage from the couple bars in the area.  I'm just curious how someone couldn't make money there.   Ouch.   I'm curious about this propane flavoring you speak of.  Will it help me get that charcoal flavor on my gas grill?   Are you wanting to can it?  Because curd is egg and butter based...   Back in my day, all we had was Bridgetown Hobbies and we liked it.  You will be getting my money too.  No game store in St Jphns.   I was going to say the same, sounds like her mind is made up though...   I know.  these videos are all I can find of the BDMS.

I believe that PDX still has a "maintain and upgrade the phone lines" tax on business.  Somewhere in all of the fees, there is supposed to be money allocated for that.    Why can't we simply shift part or all of that collected money into a different fund?  Like a "build an Internet PUD" fund?  Don't eliminate the tax, don't increase the tax, but apply it in a way that is tied to current technology and looking towards tomorrow.

Shops require it, can refuse service when it is posted, and do so to prevent being sued from injury.  Being in the hospitality industry, I've seen some stupid shit.  There is a greater chance of someone having a blood borne illness and infecting someone through ineptness, than there is from E. coli or anything else coming in on the bottom of someone's shoes.    People can operate how they like, I'll never say they can't.  I love seeing Darwin's theories being put to the test on a daily basis.  I mean, the product for consumption is unstaffed and unlocked...   It is an unsupervised food and beverage establishment.  I just don't see how it could be considered sanitary, let alone safe.     People can operate however they like.  Operating with unsanitary conditions shouldn't be encouraged though.      Call animal control and let them know when and where there have been off leash aggressive dogs. If you have a physical address where the dog lives, report it and they will come knock on their door.  They will dispatch someone immediately if you call and say that you feel you or your dog is in ANY kind of physical danger due to an off leash dog.   If you are in a public park, call Parks and Rec.  They can't always get someone out right away, but they explained to me that they have had their budget cut and are wanting to take calls to increase their "need for funds."    Also, remember that it is your right to protect yourself and your property (dog) from harm.  Next time a yippie little shit comes charging at you from anywhere in an agressive fashion, punt the fucker back to the owner.  You will not be held responsible if you are on public land, your dog is leashed, and the other attacked you.   Actually no.  I did not.  I have the legal right to defend myself and my animals if they are attacked.  Plain and simple.  That is not a threat, but a right.  Maybe I stated what I did poorly in your judgement, but I would not be found at fault for such actions.  I would just be found an asshole.  I also don't find park patrons a threat.  However, I do find the ones who break the laws and to be a *potential* threat in need of being reprimanded.  And as far as we go, I have talked with many of the other people who live on the edge of the park that are sick of unleashed dogs in the leashed areas.  Call P R and animal control, they will tell you that they get calls all the time.  I also didn't delete my post, mods did.  I can screen cap it for you if you like.   I have made no threats of violence.  I just pointed out that we appear non threatening to the naked eye, but it is stupid for people to assume that we are.  Not everyone is friendly.  We are, but we also don't tolerate wankers.    Sorry.  I forget that this is a moderated forum.  With that said, I'm going to leave it as is and keep it in check next time.  I have no ragrats.   I just moved back to PDX.  Born and raised in the SW Columbia basin.  I have spent a lot of time here.    Public offenses and what you deem to be acceptable doesn't matter when they impact others.  Also, the crackheads, tweakers, and homeless are an ethical based societal problem.  Not an asshole problem.   That guys dog bit mine.  I am not going to be nice about that.  He's lucky I didn't call the cops then and there.  No blood was drawn, so I didnt.  How would you react if you had a child at the park and another kid ran over and punched them in the head? You'd probably yell at the parent.   All unknown dogs should be assumed to be trained as much.     And we as a neighborhood love you here.  We want you to stay here and patronize the few bars and restaurants we have.  But the bad apples drive us all nuts and we are limited on what we can do.   On this measure and within this forum, you are correct.  And I honestly don't care.  This was a last ditch effort after repeated attempts to engage people at the park in a civil fashion.  The issue is, people don't see what they are doing as wrong and get defensive and hostile when you tell them they are doing it wrong.  I honestly don't think that the hardcore people are a problem.  It's the fucking casuals.   Just bean the party with a disc.  And then call animal control.  Totally worth the stroke.  There is an off leash park 1/4 mile away.   I just moved back to where I'm from.   That is my point, it is.  If a teenager or an adult walked up to an unknown dog to engage it, they understand there is inherent risk.  I still fault the owner for not having their dog under control and they will be the one getting in trouble of harm occurs. However, I blame the human for being stupid.  A young child doesn't understand inherent risk, so can't be found stupid or at fault.  I should have phrased that as "it was the child's parents fault..."   If you want to find the dog shit, take a dog to the park and let them sniff it out. You'll find it soon enough.  It is mainly on the skirt of the park, because people actually clean up when they see their dog dropping one in the middle of their walkway or they do it right next to them while on leash.  The litter is bad, but easier to deal with. I think the worst part about the litter is what kind it is and what people are consuming.    My dogs are on leash, non violent (unless commanded otherwise), and under control at all times in public spaces where they are required to be by law. As far as my dogs go, that is all I have to say.  The kid that got knocked over...  It was the child's fault for trying to engage it, IMO.  However, the kid doesn't know better at 4 years old.  So it is the dog owners responsibility by default.  That is just the way it goes.   i am calm.  Just slightly annoyed.   503 865 2381  Guy called me back in 5 minutes.  Said the more times people call, the more times they will go out.  Might not be today, but it will get put on the list of rounds and they are happy to "educate" people.   It isn't an ultimatum.  As a whole, I love your community.  I've even been known to help facilitate tournaments and am currently working on setting up more seasonal chains in the area.  I know the disc golf community has a bad rep.  And ya'll have been working hard to fix it.  and if you really want to help on this issue, you'll call too.  People typically don't learn until it costs them money.   Enough calls and someone will show up eventually.  Just hours late and on the wrong day.  And it will be some poor college student who gets dinged for an open container out of stupid luck as the cops walk through the park.  That is ultimately what I'd like to avoid.    However.  If a dog is acting hostile and acting aggressively, animal control will dispatch someone immediately.  If a dog charges at me from across a field, I assume it to be aggressive.  Animal control said that is a legal reason to call.  There is a good chance that if it happens on the first hole, animal control will be there before they are off the course.  They can and will write tickets if a dog is off leash, even if it is not being aggressive.  It just takes the phone call to get them out.  They also said they want the calls.  Parks and Rec had their budget cut and are spending more money having to clean up after this community.  If certain members of the community want to abuse the prevailage, they should be taxed.  Maybe then they will stop.  Or the community as a whole can help itself out.   You must be a pleasure to play with.  Must have been why you were by yourself and your dog whimpered when you violently grabbed him.   No, I'm just slightly annoyed.   I'm not trying to start a dialogue.  I'm giving a heads up to a community and giving them a chance to do something about an issue that could potentially have an adverse effect on them.   Not a threat, a fact.      Did you google the word Romano?   You have 19 sandwiches on your menu.  Fix that first and foremost.  Drop it to twelve.  First one to axe is that Brussels sprout grilled cheese BS.  You'll throw out more product than you sell.  And don't fuck with caprese salad and try to wanker it all up.  Kill that sandwich too, it's terrible.  do not give options on plating.  If you must serve a grilled fish, give it a different fucking plate.  Not fries.  The person ordering it is trying to be healthy.  Don't give them an option of deep fried anything.  You veggie entree option reads like an after thought of "I've got to cross utilize quinoa" and is completely unoriginal.  Give the veggies what they want - something good and different.  There is a lot you can do simple and well.  Include a veggie butter sauce pasta.  One that can be done with oil for vegans.  You are all ready trying to appease everybody with that menu, you might as well go all the way.  Google the word Romano.  Is that what you want to have affiliated with your shop?

WE ARE ONLY ASSHOLES BECUASE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS.  RESTAURANT FOLK THAT DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REST OF THE DREDGES OF SOCIETY ARE ACTUALLY NICE PEOPLE.   I know exactly what you are talking about.  I would love to pick up an early 80's Toyota 4x4 that has been rebuilt...   Thank you.     Thanks for the tips.  The $4k isn't fixed.  I haven't needed to buy a car in almost 10 years and don't know the market.  I thought that might be a good number to start at.  Would you say that $6-8k is more reasonable?  Subarus are great, we currently own one and have had others.  No complaints there and am happy with it.  I also don't mind dropping another thousand or two into a $4k car, I just don't want to do a whole motor or something else that expensive.  Or a job that puts the car in the shop for a week plus.  I never would have thought about a Kia.  I'll keep that on the list.   maybe I've had bad luck?  Looked at 4 rigs in 3 days.  2 weren't what was represented in the posting, one wasn't mentioned it was rebuilt in the ad plus she wanted full value, and the last guy refused to have it looked at when I wanted to confirm what he told me.  I don't want to buy a used car from a lot.  I also don't want to take on payments.  However, if I have to pull 20K and buy new to prevent buying a POS, I will.  I'm just hoping not to.   You speak the fears I figured.  However, I'm not going to buy a car to have it inspected.  It will go to the mechanic first.  My problem with private is that everyone thinks there shit is golden, wants way more than what is realistic, and usually refuses to have it inspected first or to split the cost to make the sale.   obviously, you're not a golfer.   I'm open to any and all leads.  If someone can deliver me something that fits my needs, I'm happy to pay a finders fee.   I want to.  But I'm feeling like I don't have the time to deal with running around, haggling, and dealing with people's schedules.  I really need to find a rig within the week and am running a fairly tight schedule right now and don't have much time to spare.  What I would like is something $4K and under, decent enough to take into the woods on unimproved roads, OK mileage Is fine, and has room for 2 medium sized dogs.  Basically, I nwant something that will last at least until the end of next summer without any major repairs.  Outback, S10 sized pickup with a canopy, older jeep, etc.   I'd much rather do a private sale, but individuals can be just as much of a pain in the ass.  I have an independent mechanic to do an inspection, know the basics to look for in buying a used car, and am hoping to to not deal with a complete snake.  Does anyone have suggestions?   TL;DR - not many.  And not many who have built up a business where they are making $50K yearly working for themselves would sell it for for under $200K.  At least in my experience.  And here is the main problem you have.  You can buy a business.  Hell, you can operate one.  But without the years of training and experience that the original person who built the business had, you will close your doors and lose your investment most of the time.  No offense, but you are looking at making a terrible mistake.  It is sort of like Suzi Q homemaker who bakes cookies for little Jimmys bake sale at school being told "you're such a lovely baker, why don't you open a restaurant!"  And then they go out and buy a place and after 6 months they realize they are LOSING $50k a year...   Head out to the beach for a weekend of camping.  Someone posted a whole list of places around Tillamook recently as a road trip guide.  I'd also suggest Ft. Stevens and Ecola St park for a nice drive up the coast.   Falafel I have not had.  Been by the spot and looked at it all, but did so with a pulled pork for the Belles in my hand.  I've been chatting with the Kruger folks and I might start making hand made pasta and whatnot in there.  It's a potential and they seem to be wonderful people.  Right now, I'm Trying to figure out what people would like, what is offered, and what is not in the area.    Here is the biggest question I have - who is open after midnight around here on the weekends serving food?   That I've not investigated yet.  We haven't been into the ranger yet, but it is an 8 minute walk from the house.  We hope it is going to be THE neighborhood bar for us.  However, Slims has pinball for me...   I'm honestly surprised by this, as I abhor vegan food 99% of the time.  I get being a veggie, but vegans mystify me.  No cheese?  What?  No fucking butter?  Are you kidding me?!  However, it can be done well.  It just usually isn't.  Which is why I have been quite surprised that *I* suggested to hit up the Proper Cafe on Lombard, after we had already eaten there was once.  I mean, we still had 15+ other shops to hit up.  If you check my submission history, you will see a lot of meat based food and even more homemade bacon.  I'm also one of the hardest critics of restaurant/hospitality establishments you can come across.  I have my issues with the place, only because I'm in the business.  Yet based off of the items I have tried there, I have no problem with the food.    I would typically say something like "this place is pretty decent for what it is, vegan" and leave it at that.  But I can't.  They are simply making some good food.  I understand that I'm just another asshole with an opinion.  But anyone has ever spent 5 minutes talking with me would be shocked to hear me say something positive about a vegan joint.  If you haven't been, check it out.     Thanks for the offer, appreciated. But we hit up Vinnies, simply because we had to know.  There are only so many shops in the hood, we have to give them all a go at least once.  Also, being the restaurant/food guy that I am, my goal is to spend $ in every restaurant/bar within a 2 miles radius of pier park in the next 6 weeks.  I need to find the places that we will be regulars at...     If you don't know about this stuff, buy it.  It will change your world when it comes to baking in general, but for ice cream it means still having seeds in the mix and not scraping insanely expensive beans.    http://www.amazon.com/Nielsen-Massey-Vanillas-Madagascar-Bourbon-Vanilla/dp/B0000W0GQQ/ref=sr_1_sc_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1433642049 sr=8-2-spell keywords=Vinalla+paste   I miss read the part about half.  I thought he said I've got half, implying securing the rest.  My bad.  But getting things on the DL and from cousin Bob is usually not nearly as cost effective in the long run.  I've been in the restaurant biz long enough, as well as consulting opening and failing shops on why they are.  $150k for a coffe shop is fucking stupid talk.  If you need $12.5k a month for "operating expenses" to run a coffe shop, you're doing it wrong.  Or it should not be operating as a coffee shop. Plain and simple.  Sit back and STFU is implied.  Simply because "bookkeeping and compliance work" are not day to day operations.  And if the bookkeeper is telling me how to run my business, I should shut down.    usually one friend (the talent) is afraid of telling the other friend (the money) that they need to do just that half the time.  STFU.  If the talent can do it, the money should just get paid.  Those are usually the best working conditions when someone says "I only want to be involved in X.  And no more than X."     Good to know.  and SS is quite fine and worth the walk from the house too.     They totally are, we got slices walking by the other day. Just new in the hood, unboxing, and didn't want to leave the house.      If you are the money and have a 9-5, and want to do this, you will need to sit back, shut the fuck up, and not take advantage of the "free coffee."  Your job is to trust your investment to not screw it up and to have basically 0% input while receiving 51%+ of the profits.  Honestly, $150k for a coffee shop?  that seems absurd.  What part of the country are you located in?  Are there NO locations where you could do it for. $40k?  Who decided that was realistic?  You realize, that a coffee shop that sells $4 in products to each customer on average will take YEARS to pay back your initial investment, not to mention the interest on the other half the money you don't have.  This sounds like a terrible idea to me.  Not cause you have a job, but because ypu will wind up $75k short and another $100k in debt of you do this.   If you were the guy with the tripod at the intersection on the hwy30 side of the bridge at 5:10am, we just want to know what the hell man?  That is *early* to be out taking pictures!   I'm currently doing it.  Poachedjobs.com if you're in a covered city is decent and usually has jobs CL doesn't.  Cold calling during the right time can yield results other than annoyances.  it is moving towards summertime, talk to the catering companies.  They should be jamming shortly.   Did not know they were even out there.  I do have several of theirs, thanks for the tip.   Good to know.  I'm used to paying $1 an inch.   Right on, I'll be swinging by there on Monday.   Thanks.    My roll needs some serious attention. I've got everything from good German steel, cheap Sanisafe, and Japanese sushi blades.  Also a couple of dead serrated blades that should be turned into a straight edge.  Who does stuff by hand in town? Or do most use grinders?   If your time is being eaten up by existing business and you get shit like this that you should just roll off and ignore, why on the fuck are you posting about it on reddit?  Shouldn't that time be spent servicing your current customers if you're that hard pressed for time?     Oh shit! I Seriously only had one come up in the search.  But then again, I didn't search 10 different key words just ISP.  Thanks.   Not $200, typically $75-100.  I mean, I'm only working with food.  Giving away free food only brings me business, which is why it happens daily.  It is also why I'm able to secure accounts.  It is a cost of business, plain and simple.    However, when the entitled of the world deem that because someone else decided to give away a bunch of free shit on some randomly selected day, that others have to as well, I see it as absurd.  It is also a proven fact the people who search out coupons and freebies are not the kind of repeat customers you want.  They usually only come in for the discount and never come back.   A lot of good advice already.  Do the math, put it in front of him.  Can you do cost analysis? P L reports? Labor counts?  If not, I suggest you learn how to, so you know how to approach these kinds of situations delicately.  Because you are trying to tell your boss that he can't do his job.  By the sounds of it, if what you say is true, he can't.  And my advice is GTFO if he doesn't pull his head out.  However, if what you say is true, do the math, and put it black and white numbers.  Get a pedometer.  Time your recipes to a T, step by step.  If you don't have the physical labor hours to do the job, it's simply not work faster.  You just can't fucking do it.  And if he won't hire someone else, he DOES NOT value you, the product, or the customer.  He is simply worried about his paycheck.  And if that is the case, then that guy can simply go fuck himself.   The butter is for extra body, a rounder flavor, and shine.  If you do a side by side, one with and one without butter, you will find the one without to have a dull appearance compared to the one with butter.    But the answer to your question is yes you can.  Just make sure you run the final batch through a chinios because you run a greater risk of curdles from the second cook.   Thanks for the kudos!  After we get into our house next week I'll give ya our new address.  I'd love a bag of whole bean Peaberry from the Kauai coffee estates if you can manage it.  Or whatever else you want to throw in a flat rate...   I would be grateful.  I'm in St. Johns and would be thrilled to buy you pint or a snack next week.   Title says it all.  I'll buy, or even make you lunch for it.   FUCK ALL YA'LL BITCHING ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET.  WE FOUND A HOUSE IN 30 HOURS AFTER DRIVING INTO TOWN, IN THE NEIGHBOORHOOD WE WANTED AND FOR LESS THAN WE EXPECTED TO PAY. STOP BEING A FUCKTARD HIPSTER BITCH AND GET A REAL JOB THAT CAN PAY YOUR BILLS.   Sani safe or Vitronix 10" off set serrated should run you under $25.   Sure. But half the line cooks I know can't even sharpen their own knives. It is also, in my kitchen, used mainly on strawberries or to concasse a box of tomato's.  Faster and more efficient with less waste.  Can't argue against having the proper tool for the job...   Can't believe I didn't see anyone else mention it, the rest of the tool kit was covered.  A tomato corer and a melon baller.     Thanks for the link!  I'm in Twin Falls currently and will be in PDX tomorrow house hunting. I hope that I will be in the woods within the week. But I do have tons of NM info I can plug into this.  This  is awesome and something I've been dreaming about.   Baked French toast "casserole."  Basically a bread pudding at that point.  Sandwich bar was mentioned.  I think taco bars are just as good and easier, simply because you can double the prep down for breakfast burritos.  Rice pilaf holds wonderful and is a great side with a slow cooked meat.  Just Make sure that you wrap it with both plastics and foil.  And a good pan sauce/gravy makes the starch stretch further.  Frittatas will be your friend.  Breakfast burrito "enchiladas."  Gyro/falafel station.  Greek salad, hummus, pita, tzatziki, and tapanade.     Tips?  Grammar, spelling, and punctuation go a long way in the world.     I've got about 7 pounds there.  I figure that will last me through the summer :(   August.  If ya'll only be buying and eating chile in August, obviously you're not a golfer.   I'm honestly not worried.  I'm packing the cooler with a good 25# of frozen green to take with me.  I mean, it is just chile.  But to a convert who has lived here long enough, it will be a culture shock to not just be able to get it anywhere on anything.   Granted, I do have a decent jar of Hatch seeds and a hot house waiting for me.  However, they will not be the same.      You are wrong to think that one business model is superior to another in the hospitality field.  There is one that is more profitable, if that is what you are asking. Which is fast food.  Fast food and casual dining, just like cocaine and hookers, ain't goin' nowhere.  There is a market for it and will continue to be a market for it in our current model of economics.    I don't know where you live, but if you are expecting any kind of quality food, let alone *hand made*, you're going to have to spend more than $4.  And if you expect me to wait on you for a $4 sale, you will be told loudly and vocally to GTFO.   You've already been down to Shasta this season?   Your eggplant parm ;)  http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/34h0lc/eggplant_parm_with_hatch_green_chile_and_a_pickle/      Very very nice.  That capo looks spot on.   Is that guy still alive?  He was an old man doing commercials before the bankruptcy and Gloria stepping in...  Holy fuck.  FREE IS A VERY GOOD PRICE.    You're pretty much spot on with that.   What else isn't around?  Ultimately, that is the question at the end of the day.  I'll make whatever.  And it is starting to look like (sadly) that the MO might be to ride out the GF and vegan fad.  I really don't want to deal with those clients.  However, it doesn't seem like there is to much out in the suburbs and someone does need to service the soccer moms...  edit to add... When I get into town, if you want, I'd be happy to come over and teach you how to make one the best EPP you've ever had.  While using and expanding your skills, tools, and knowledge.     Something like this that you can order and have in your hands in 7 minutes?  http://i.imgur.com/MnvbyJ7.jpg   That pic is a sub roll with fries.  Maybe 9"?  I personally would eat that one sitting. I'm also not an American fatty at 165#.  It looks good, but not gigantic.  Also, with a sammich like that for $10, you are getting your side ON the Sandwich.  Nothing wrong with that, I dig it.  But it does make your portion seem huge when you wrap it into one thing.  Also, if you look at my pics, realize that they are not hand held and most are on full size, 12" dinner plates.  It makes a huge difference.  Most of mine weigh with at least 1/2# or more of meat. I'll put my product next to anybody's and they will love it just as much as theirs.   $7 is a lot of money for lunch?   Caveman is on my list to look up, thanks for the tip.  The dish I described above is something (honestly) run of the mill to me.  My main background is in Italian food and high end French.  The other main idea I've been kicking around is a fresh pasta cart.     Ok.  Different.  From scratch, to order pasta?  Something like sweet potato quinoa gnoicchi with marinated artichoke hears, preserved lemons, and cured olives?  Vegan and gluten free.  I'd happily sell plates of that for $7.  Or carbonara with home made pancetta for $7.   That is exactly the kind of stuff I want to hear.     I know the market and have debated on simply going to work there for a while after I move to town.  They are a great shop.  Sadly though, I don't know the food/restaurant scene there anymore.  Been gone for 10 years...   The only authentic NM food is beans, rice, and chile.  And I *will* be bringing Hatch Green with me.  I've already struck a deal with a hot house to start growing them for me exclusively year round and am looking for another spot.  There will be fresh roasted Hatch in PDX on a regular basis by the end of winter.    	129
    A lot of people like McDonald's, it's incredibly popular but it's also not top tier food or even particularly good. It's average, it's there when you need it, it gets the job done. Kind of like The Big Bang Theory.    [It's actually from a graphic designer's website who works for the magazine.](http://www.andrearaymer.com/imagista-magazine-covers/)   What did you think of it as a whole?  Which was your favorite season? Favorite episode?       You know, I used to think the same thing but then I actually watched it all, it's very good (and I hate zombies). I wouldn't put on my top all time but it's a very well done show and I could see why it would be on this list.       This summer, /u/Bosefchrist92 stars in a movie about how his "Caps Lock" key finally came unstuck.    Yes, but McDonald's is crappy AND popular   Most of them I agree with, some that I wouldn't have on my top list but are still good, but there is one that I laughed at more than I've ever laughed at the show. The Big Bang Theory. Yes, it's popular, yes it has won awards. But for that mediocre bore fest to be on the same list with Breaking Bad, The Wire, etc is just laughable. The Big Bang Theory is the McDonald's of TV.   It's a potential spoiler considering he is thought to be dead. It should be treated as such for anyone who doesn't like read news like this   He had some really funny moments but in no way did he outshine the amazing pair of Amy Schumer and Bill Hader   Mother. Fuckin. Spoilers.    Same with his role in Kick Ass   I disagree, I think each season has gotten better and more interesting   California USA!... What do now?!?    Gun Fever Too: Still Hot   Kk   Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. Seth Rogen is in the main cast in both and they were only one season each. Both were hilarious   Breaking Bad for sure. Shameless is another. It's through 5 seasons and it just seems to get better each season. The biggest one, although a comedy, is It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's through 10 seasons and is continually hilarious and somehow fresh. This latest season had some classic episodes and Season 7 was my favorite.    It's true that the focus is on the 3 new leads. That has been made apparent. As for the originals. I think that one of them will die but the others may carry on or have cameos in the other movies.   Personally, I'd love to see them as integral parts of the whole Trilogy but my expectations are realistic and I'm just glad they are all in this one at least   For me it's Chardee MacDennis. But one of the best to introduce someone to the show would be The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award.    No. Not for real. Ha. I was just making a joke   [This should do](http://nerdreactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/19c0uzmi9bmv1jpg.jpg)    I don't think so, I've seen it quite a few times and it just... Is off. It doesn't feel right and the Jokes don't really land for me. It's truly the one episode I dislike.    I live in a major metro area and there is only one theatre in the area that does that   Here's what it is like at a major theater for a large movie like this one. Ticket sales are online at at the box office but they will go incredibly quick in major cities. But if you get ticket (obviously if you don't, just go to a different theater in a suburb) then you wait in line to get a good seat the night of. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was the last one I stood in line at a midnight Screening for (besides advanced screenings) and that's how it goes. It was a huge line and pretty fun actually   I was actually thinking about starting that!   It was very well received by critics and fans. It seems mostly this sub liked it but it's a mixed bag over at /r/movies. So no, you aren't the only one. Me personally, I enjoyed. It wasn't quite as good as the first one but all things considered, it was highly entertaining.    Community, Parks and Recreation, The Americans, Homeland, Shameless, Better Call Saul, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Silicon Valley, Broad City, Workaholics, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The Comedians, Daredevil, Tyrant, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Walking Dead, Ray Donovan, Masters of Sex, True Detective, and Mad Men  Damn, I watch too much TV. That's not even everything I watch, that's just the top tier stuff   Now that is incredibly odd. Why would US have a British series before the UK?    Yea, it's not as good as season 1 but I knew before I even starting watching that it wouldn't be because season 1 was one of the most entertaining seasons of a show I've ever seen.    This season has been different, it's a little slower but I've quite enjoyed it. The acting/cast is superb and the story has a slow unraveling.   It's intriguing and interesting each week but it's held down by expectations from it's superior first season. Let go of that and it's a really good season of tv   If you have FXX through Comcast then you can use the FXnow app to watch them I believe.    I would love that. It's been mentioned a few times on here but if they do actually do it, it must be actually Jon Taffer and not just a character based on him.   I honestly think he would be game to do it too. He seems like a pretty cool guy when he's not dealing with idiots.    He is playing himself as much as Jerry Seinfeld was himself, Larry David was himself, Louis CK was himself, etc. It's a fictionalized version of themselves. Basically a character which has similarities and aspects of their real life but it's still a character. The shell of their existence (name, occupation, past) are the same but everything is different (family story, actions, personality, speech etc)    I have all 3 series on US Netflix. But you are probably in a different country.    He is a supporting character in Paul as well. That is a funny movie. It stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.    This^. Also, Horrible Bosses 2, although a retread a times, is pretty funny as well.    I hadn't noticed but I'll look for it next time.    It's not as good as the first two for sure, but if you like the movies, watch it. It's still entertaining. Just don't expect T2 and it will be satisfying   As I said, it's the way people go about it. People do just come on here and put an opinion that something "sucks". They aren't looking for a discussion, they just want people fuel them to support their own opinion as to make them feel right in disliking something.   There is nothing wrong with disliking something. What I am getting at is that people on this subreddit tend to post an opinion thread that is targeting a show for being terrible that is something a lot of other people like. They don't provide criticism like you said, just that it sucks like I said. It's done so in the manner of trolling rather than discussion. The people who post that aren't looking for any opposition from people who like it but just other people who hate it. Whereas, in a discussion thread, there are both and they are discussed in depth.   As for your Waitress analogy, that really doesn't apply. You are talking about food that is sitting in front of me and a Waitress asking if it's correct. Which I would tell them obviously. In that scenario, that would be a sort of survey taken after watching a show. Not coming on Reddit to discuss. Your analogy works more like after the meal, you go on Yelp and say the food sucks but the place has five stars and only a couple bad reviews. People are just going to skip your review and read the good ones because it is highly rated.  I agree with you that downvoting isn't the answer for an actual reasonable discussion but for an opinion that is hate fueled and looking for a one sided discussion of how much it sucks, that is deserving of a downvote. If it's not a show I care about, I personally leave it alone, but if it is one I do care for, I will respond rather than downvoting if it's an open discussion rather than trolling.    It's not opposite though. You are mad that there is not enough negative threads. If there was an opinion that a show sucks and a majority of the people also thought that, than it would get upvoted. But if a show sucks that everyone thinks sucks, there is not much of a point to talk about it.   So then there are shows that are popular. People come in and say it sucks which is a minority opinion and because of that, the majority is probably going to answer.   And the majority of the time someone doesn't like a show, they create an opinion thread for anyone who doesn't like the show. It's usually not a two sided discussion but a negative hate thread.   Let me put it this way. I wasn't a big fan of the movie Mad:Max Fury Road but /r/movies loves it (along with the majority of critics). If I went in there saying the movie sucks in my own post, it'll get bashed and downvoted to hell because it's a poor way of discussion and a minority opinion. But that's not the way of going about putting your differing opinion. I went into a Mad Max discussion thread and had good discussions back and forth about what I liked and disliked and what others thought.   Lastly, another analogy, I quite dislike The Big Bang Theory. I'm pretty sure there might be a good portion of people on reddit who dislike it as well and some that do like it. But I'd rather talk about the shows I do like rather than bash a show that I don't care about because it's popular.    The difference is between a show discussion thread that has both positives and negatives and a opinion thread about how bad something is.   It sounds like you arent looking so much for a place to "talk about tv" but a place where people can hate on tv. Sorry if we like liking things. If there is a negative opinion that gets downvoted, thats either because it was presented in a poor manner as to offend people who do like it, or they just happen to be in the minority of that opinion.  Edit: Interesting and Ironic. I'm getting downvoted for having an opposing opinion and providing criticism in this thread.   Tommy Boy   It's "Mantis Toboggan"    Community (by the same creator of Rick   Morty), Arrested Development, Party Down   In a way, there was. Magnitude's character in Abed's movie gets shot twice. The typical sound a person makes to replicate the sound of a gun would be "pop".    The cast. All four are incredibly talented   I feel like people just don't understand that Adam Sandler movies are SUPPOSED to be stupid. I always hear people say how dumb his movies are but that is the point. They are so dumb they are funny. That is intentional. You Don't Mess with the Zohan is incredibly stupid but it is so damn funny.   Yes, he has done some straight up terrible movies, but he gets waaaay too much flack for what is perceived as a "stupid movie" when that is just his style. If Billy Madison came out today, people would say the same shit.   You are right, it is season 7. It is pretty much perfect other than "Frank's Brother" which is the worst of the series.    I loved Daredevil season 1, Agents of Shield Season 2, Avengers:Age of Ultron, and Ant Man. So...no.   Tommy Boy   Season 7 is my favorite season, 8 and 9 have some really great episodes and 10 was awesome. So...yes.

A 3 way crossover. An It's Always Sunny episode with the guys from Workaholics and the gals from Broad City.   Adam, Blake, and Ders fly to New York City after they won a trip to see a live concert. Their plane gets landed early in Philly when Carl was caught with grass on the plane.   They immediately go bar hoping which leads them to Paddy's.   Meanwhile, Ilana and Abby are traveling to Philly for a wedding and decided to checkout the culture of south Philly. They run into Dee and Artemis who immediately click with these two.

They then find only one way to settle the argument (you decide what that might be), a game of Chardee MacDennis. Workaholics v Paddy's v Broad City/Dee/Artemis   I was surprised how funny it was. Watched it last night and it was not bad. Great that much of the main cast was back. Christopher Walken was hilarious   Go see Ant Man or Trainwreck   I still think the movie worked fine. Jai Courtney was really miscast but  he did a fine job anyway. But I really thought Jason Clarke was great. You actually felt that he was fighting in a long war that changed him. And he was menacing yet you still kinda hoped he could still change back.    Kingsman, Whiplash, and Nightcrawler in that order.    I loved it. I haven't seen it in a few years but it was a great movie back in the day.    Without Chromecast support... I'll wait   I got to watch that episode at Comic-Con with the cast and about 6,000 people before it aired. It was so damn funny. Just as good when it aired   I mean, there really has not been a bad season yet. In fact, all of them are top tier. So yea, I enjoyed 9 as well. Haha. The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award is one of my favorites   Community, Party Down, Arrested Development, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Silicon Valley, Last Man on Earth, Chuck.    Pop Pop gets a treat?    I loved season 4. Sure, it's not as funny as the other seasons (maybe sometimes it is funnier than season 3) but the way it's rolled out is genius.    For sure! Cant wait for season 5   Yea, he definitely doesn't look 70 as Frank but he does have all grey hair in real life. He dyes it for the show. But I hope he doesn't retire. He is still at the top of his game and he continually says that he loves doing the show   It's not. It's more so to reassure fans that missed them in the prequels. In fact, the prequels actually did have quite a bit of practical effects, sets, and miniatures but they were glossed over with CGI for finer detail which made it all seem like CGI.    Starkiller is confirmed to be a First Order base in The Force Awakens. It would be odd to have that name pop up twice   I can't remember his name but wow, you had worse luck than we did   Personally I think season 7 is the best It's Always Sunny season.    That's my 2nd favorite season of any comedy show! (see my post for first)   1. Star Wars: The Force Awakens 2. Spectre 3. The Revenant 4. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation 5. The Hateful Eight  Honorable Mentions: Ant Man and Bridge of Spies   I've read the first 5 about three or four times and the 6th and 7th just once. I think I need to get back on it again   Aquaman 2   Season 2 of Arrested Development. It's the greatest comedy show I've ever seen and specifically that season is incredible.    Yea, it would probably have looked better but it's Oscar Isaac so we are in good company   No Way!!!! Peter Parker!?!? How did I not see it from all tons of comics and 5 movies that have come out   Um... Maybe some context or explanation on what the hell this is?    I'm going to Ant Man tomorrow night and Trainwreck on Saturday   A Xcel worker told me this at a Playoff game at the end of the season. 3 seats slipped off the hinges and they had to replace all of them during the game. He said that was the 3rd time that game in the 2 sections he covered that it happened to.   This confirms it and that's great   No way, they won't start shooting until next year. It most likely, if it's Star Wars related at all, is for reshoots   Who do you use to watch Ultraviolet? I use Flixster and it's great. The thing about Flixster is they have their own input code system that works great every time. That way you don't have to go to the individual studio's website and then log in through their site and ultraviolet and then Flixster. The one time it didn't work, I called their hotline and they got the movie in my list right away.    Wow, who does that?   "Why isn't the Second season of 'True Detective' the first season of 'True Detective'?"   That's really what everyone who is disappointed by it is really thinking. Take the unrealistic expectations and comparing to Season 1 out of it and you still have a really good show.    I also disagree. It was different sure, but thats what kept it fresh for me. I would rate it better than seasons 1 and 4 but not quite as good as 2, 5, and 3.   Currently, 7 Days in Hell. Also, The Slammin Salmon   Totally agree. It's pulling itself together now and was really funny other than the water sketch. I loved Hannibal's Panel and GTFOH. I honestly am drawn to the fact that it's imperfect.    Yes, they are fantastic. I'm incredibly surprised not only have you not seen them but know pretty much nothing about them.   Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne/Batman. His Batman voice is odd but you get used to it.   The Dark Knight has probably one of, if not "the", best portrayals of a comic book character and that is Heath Ledger's Joker.   Watch them in order: Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises.    Kingsman is at the top for me thus far. I also liked Jurassic World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Although none of those will have any Oscar chances  I have yet to see Ex Machina, I hear that's amazing but it looks very weird. Should I still see it?    Gif of the century? More like, Gif of the second that I watched it and then moved on to the next thing and never remember it again   Head Canon: Harry uses his invisibility cloak just after they catch BCJr to sneak back in the office and grab it.    I saw the original Trilogy when I was 5, got the VHS special editions for my 7th birthday and saw Episode I in the theaters at 9. Personally, I think it should be fine. This one may be a little more dark but I think it should be ok   You may not think so but both are critically acclaimed and the majority of people who saw them liked them. And they made a ton of money. All signs point to my statement being correct.    Chardee MacDennis: A Game of Games   I think, if the movie is as good as it looks, that it will have a very positive effect on his legacy. But, I also don't believe that his current legacy is "complicated". He is the creator of Bad Robot which has produced tons of great TV shows and movies. He is the creator of Lost, Alias, and other huge shows. He brought back the Mission Impossible franchise with 2 great movies and the same with Star Trek. All well received. And his original movies have been shrouded with secrecy that is unheard of in this day and age which people enjoy. Yea, he uses lens flares a lot but that's his thing and he likes it. As for borrowing other directors styles, most everybody does that. Even some of our favorite directors have influences of their own. But specifically calling out him borrowing from Spielberg on Super 8 is funny considering Steven Spielberg produced the movie.   tl;dr JJ Abrams is already pretty well beloved but if Star Wars is good, his legacy will be solidified as gold.   Captain America: The Winter Soldier   This^. Take the comparing to Season 1 away and it has been solid thus far. It's all huge expectations. I went in knowing there was no way it could be as good and I've loved it so far   Wow, that is legit   When I first saw part 1, I felt the same way. But then I read the book again and realized it is meant to. It's their way of showing time passing. Otherwise it seems everything happens in like a week. When in reality, and entire school year passes while they are on the road.   You are right that as standalone movies they never really work the best but that's why they are parts. I think Harry Potter is the only one that it worked successfully so far   Money. Another movie means more money. Harry Potter started the trend but they did it because the last book truly could not have been represented well if it was not split. Then Twilight unnecessarily did it and every other series seems to now   I have watched them over and over again and they are some of the most rewatchable movies I've seen.   	104
 Gave in to that, too. Didn't really help and I realized that I've missed out too much...   Hello everybody! I'm 22/f and new to this subreddit. I don't know, if I suffer from depression (if so, it would be self-diagnosed, so probably doesn't really count right...) Went to a psychotherapist, but only like three times. We had to abandon the sittings, since we both thought I would be accepted for university in at least one of the different cities I applied (which wasn't the case in the end). So I do know that something's wrong with me, but I don't have a name for all this...  Anyway... I'd like to know, if there's anyone, who found a way of dealing with the physical and mental tiredness? If so, would you mind to tell me? How do you "deal" with your depression, what's your view on it and how do you deal with life? Do you guys have any other tips, that helped you in some kind of way?  I'm very curious about your thoughts and tips.   Wish you guys all the best. :*   Aww congratulations! :)   I wish we wouldn't be so scared to open up but have the courage to be *so* kind to each other... I mean openly...  While reading your story, it felt like I was there with you and could see those two and feel the beauty of the moment.  I hope she's okay, too... maybe you could ask your co-worker, if she's fine and tell us?   I'm quite like your friend, but I know where this quirk I have comes from: I'm kinda scared that when someone gets to know me better, the person won't like me as much as before, because of how I view things, how I deal with certain things, because I am quite different (not necessarily positively meant). I don't want people to know about my insecurities, because I don't want them to be used against me some time. I always expect people will leave me and therefore I kind of leave *them*, before someone decides to leave me all alone... vicious cicle.   Do you think some of these points could be a reason for her behaviour?   I think so, too. The ones downvoting could for example ask "What exactly do you mean by..." before misinterpreting, or just start a respectful discussion! Let's talk about our opinions! But noone should downvote just because they don't share the same thought.. I feel so bad not knowing what I did/said wrong.. as bad as knowing it, but by knowing it I can at least explain myself/my thought and try to make it better.   Thank you! :)))   Don't give up on exploring your personality, it can be a lifetime journey and can still make a lot of fun, especially with people close to you. :) *Existing* is not the ultimate, you'd miss out too much. :) Have a great week!   I know you know it's not the best idea to make an expressive move so soon, it's just the fact that there's such a nice considerate man in her life, that cares about her and likes her. :) Although she may not know the true meaning behind it, yet... I really hope it works out great for both of you!! :)   I'm kind of jealous of her.. :)  	10
 My children loved this one restaurant, known as Austin Steakhouse. From the outside, it looked like a worn down apartment sitting smack in the middle of the sprawling downtown metropolis. Inside, it was full cowboy in an almost childish manner, with the waiters and waitresses spouting a apologetically fake smile and talking in a forced high pitched accent  that on many occasions had me laughing half way through my order. The chef however, was a solemn burly old man, who I had only met on one occasion, that being a mutual friends birthday outing at a club. He had a suspicious manner to him, gazing around the room like he was being watched. I had heard about him serving in the Gulf War, and thus chalked it up to PTSD.  The last time I ate there was my own daughters birthday party. She begged me to go there, even though my aversion to the atmosphere, and like the normal parent I caved in pretty quickly. You know that look they give you, with the wide eyes and the folded hands, like a stray puppy. My head was pounding from a migraine, a combination of stress and possibly illness,so I popped a Ibuprofen.Letting the drug do its magic, we loaded the car, and drove down to Austin's   The waitress at the door, a newer person, I assumed by her age and lack of any cohesion or competence. "Hi uh sir, welcome to Austin Steakhouse, yee haw!" she tried in her best impression of a old timey southern belle, before muttering something and showing us to our table.   "So, can I get you any drinks?" she said, beginning to sweat over the past embarrassment and the lack of any air conditioning whatsoever in the restaurant. I ordered a coke and vodka, and my sweet and innocent daughter ordered a glass of milk. She left to go process our drinks, and we began to scan the menu. "Can we get an appetizer?" she asked quizzically.  "Do I look like im Fuckin...err...freaking made of money" I raised my voice, before calming myself down and in an attempt to backtrack like a dirty politician said "Im sorry sweetie, what would you like for your special day?" She answered that she wanted a blooming onion (a heart attack on a plate, the health nuts joke).  When the waiter came back, I asked for one Blooming onion for her special day. But as soon as I said it, I wish I hadn't. The Austin Steakhouse does this thing where the WHOLE ENTIRE FUCKING STAFF come out and sing to you. A lot of racket, and I have suffered from many cases of second hand embarrassment due to other people's experiences. But then I remembered who I was here for, and began to let loose. The waitress shined a smile, and patting my little angels head, said "we have a surprise for you later!, now what would you like for you?" and soon she was writing down her order, a kid's brisket. I myself ordered a 12oz new york strip steak with a portobello shroom.  After enjoying our appetizer our meal came, with the whole crew. They had put a cute little candle on her meal. I myself was beginning to feel a buzz. As our waitress, the chef, and the hostess led the others in the first lines of "Happy Birthday" a scream overshouted them, a scream of "FREEZE! NOBODY MOVE!" and 4 policemen ran into the dining area. The chef flared the deer and headlights look. The youngest cop screamed at him "You are under arrest for 17 counts of murder, you sick piece of s***!" and proceeded to read him his rights in an angry and disgusted tone. And then it dawned on me, I looked at my plate, and I vomited     dangerous to who? corporate interests   I always saw it as "Hillary Clinton: Moving the Democratic Party to the Right (Wing)" The arrow is pointing right   hmm Sweden is an obvious failure. Mr/Mrs Xyexs, is your country a stalinist hellhole?  Conservatives need to realize that socialism Bernie advocates isnt the same as the old school socialism. It is a capitalist-socialist hybrid that helps push up the working class while keeping free trade somewhat   There is an existing cocktail called "The Sandman" which includes  -vodka  -triple sec  -Lime juice  -Pineapple juice  -cola  Bernie Sandman Anyone?   XD I changed my minecraft username to BernieSanders16   done   Hmm. how about you educate yourself. Its not as if Social Democracy like Sanders advocates has led to prosperity in Sweden and Norway. Or pre-harper Canada  However. I do want to see FOX's reaction when he wins. If they were screaming about Obama being a socialist, communist, etc, then they will be taking antidepressants on air lol     this is politics, where even the most moral of politicians have no morals  	9
    Sure!  I used Alton Brown's recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/tortellini-recipe.html  but just for the pasta part.  The dough started out a little dry so I added some water and that helped.  Rolled out by hand!     They are in the feeezer until tomorrow, but yea I expect some seperating!  only second time making pasta so we'll see what happens!

For me it was easiest in Shaded Woods, using Profound Still and Great Lightning Spears.  Just remember that if they cast a spell, then die, the spell will still hit you!

 and if you're a male......you don't really want to deal with women that feel this way because they are flaky and irrational. We're not talking about an isolated area here.....going to the coffee shop with a stranger is something you probably do every day already. Had a much better time on dates with girls who were willing to show up with minimal BS. Been dating one for nearly 3 years.   Who said fuck about a relationship? A date. Any reasonably attractive woman will have orders of magnitude more messages online than an equally attractive male, even in Boston. Also...why does college/post-grad matter? Maybe someone is being too choosy. There are supposedly 1.09 single women per 1 single man in Boston....hardly an overwhelming ratio. Go into virtually any bar this weekend and you'll see guys taking on much worse odds.    I'm going to be very blunt. If you are female and have failed at online dating you're probably not that attractive. Sorry, truth hurts, work on improving attractiveness.  If you're male and have failed at online dating, you may be unattractive OR you're doing it wrong. Don't chat with women. Exchange one message and then start pushing to meet in person. If they "want to chat to get to know you" DO NOT waste your time. There is an inverse relationship between the number of pre-date messages and your chance of sex. Also, try to go after women that aren't originally from the Boston area. Much more likely to be friendly and not crazy.      Right up Abe Simpson's alley http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_QwHxZ-bJ4 t=0m6s   Turn in your brother who killed 17 people including young women? I would.    "Be careful about the hospital you go to- Memorial is a teaching hospital. You may not know if you have a doctor or a student, and there have been horror stories. Try St. Vincents. Its close to everything and they actually know what they're doing."  they're BOTH teaching hospitals.....ya know, like MGH, BWH, Hopkins, Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic....   I played Chutes and Ladders with some 7th Day Adventists once. Never Again.   Personally, I can't wait to leave      one of Moe Syzlack's best lines   This movie will offend people   OMG YES    yea, Marine Corps   It depends who you are. You have to keep you head shaved (or high and tight if your seniors are nice) until you deploy. After that you can get a medium reg and maybe a low reg depending on your command. SNCOs, corpsmen, and officers get a lot more latitude.   http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/16/us/tennessee-naval-reserve-shooting/index.html      i think you missed my sarcasm   Shooter's graduation per mom's facebook :https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=186192644855039 set=pb.100003929156418.-2207520000.1437081426. type=3 theater  mugshot of shooter: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKEJNoCWEAEjXR_.jpg   http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/wp-content/uploads/isis-chattanooga.jpg   agree, also really, ridiculously, good-looking   Shooter ID'd as Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez.....let's not jump to any conclusions   ISIS linked twitter account: https://twitter.com/K_H_O77777777/status/621734561228177408   "pork chop platoon"   he was raped by a gun :(   remove toilet paper after the shitting begins   I kept firearms in my dorm room in college. There was no state law against it. Never had a problem.   WRONG   Do you feel poor in St. Paul? You will feel poor in Boston on 39k a year, especially for two people. How happy are you with St. Paul/Minni? Lots of people in Boston have an over inflated sense of their city's awesomeness. Boston is a great city, one of the best in the country, but it isn't the fantastic fairy fantasyland of fun some would have you believe.   they were both wrong   fair enough, my point was that what is and what should be are often not the same in mass....especially with regard to firearms - got arrested in highschool for having a watergun   go walk through DTX with a gun in your belt and see if you get detained   "how many do you think you personally killed?"  "Well, I dunno, hard to say, at least 40 or 50"  damn....the reporters and grunts keepin it real   he'd lose....they've been stoping people when they see a gun in the waistband since the beginning of time and I don't see those charges getting dismissed   They could technically charge him with possession of a large capacity feeding device as well....that's another 5 years   The rounds are made from real bullet brass cases, in mass this is legally ammunition and he IS guilty. He is facing 2 years in prison for the ammunition charge alone. "Common sense" gun control.   I like this guy   no   UPDATE: Victim has died, hopefully this young lady spends the rest of her life in the cage where she belongs.   ITT: Racist comments aren't racist so long as I like the person saying them more than the intended target   why do we care if they fired some random person? I know I don't   "prosecute them to the fullest extent" .....for what....putting up posters?   I went to a similar college and almost everyone didn't like it. Do girls really want guys in there while they take a loud, stinky shit? Do guys want to wait forever while girls piss instead of a 10 second trip to the urinal. Classic PC bullshit that makes the vast majority suffer to accommodate a few whiners.    that place fucking sucks but seems to have a cult following, as stated elsewhere, Blue Nile is 100x better   this is the right answer   Politically correct bullshit...read DSM-V it is pretty fucking clear that being trans means you are suffering from an abnormal mental condition and they replaced "disorder" with "dysphoria" to avoid hurting feelings "Part of removing stigma is about choosing the right words" in fact "concerned that removing the condition as a psychiatric diagnosisas some had suggestedwould jeopardize access to care" if there is no disorder....why is care needed?   Id rather the mentally ill get over themselves....no one is preventing them from using the bathroom...this isn't an access issue as in your other examples, this is "I want to use the bathroom I'm comfortable in, fuck everyone else"    classic case of "lets make 1000 people less comfortable to make 1 person (with a mental disorder) more comfortable   Potluck.....this is something my friends an I still do....for some reason it seems alien to many young people   yea I'm off to the jewish cemetery with some spray-paint to really show hitler who's boss   clearly their civil disobedience plan didn't actually extend to real disobedience because they stopped as soon a cop told them to....so they decided to improvise and make dumb situation dumber...

If this is your worst experience with a police officer you need to get more life experience   uh, more than that   thats more like how ww2 got started   won't somebody please think of the children!!??   well we do pay them more, give them plenty of meaningless lip service, provide them with a much safer working environment, allow them to work at will, give them more time off, and we don't make snarky remarks about them when they die....but less monuments   I remember college   *nations that are expecting to have to win a war at some point in the future   did you know retroactive prayer improved outcomes in patients with blood infections? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC61047/   well....he is   who are you going to send to fight for some rocks?   its also just waiting for a white male to take her class, get a poor grade, and call discrimination   I didn't touch any of those resources until my Step 1 study time and I did fine. That said...I sort of wish I had. They cleared up a lot of stuff that I had been confused about for a while....especially pathoma.   I did a NBME followed by 3 blocks on Uworld a few days before the real thing. Good way to get an idea what it feels like. Test day you will be less burnt out but more frenzied.   Let's hope the crew and passengers are OK   I like this, very simple, specific, and true   man, I'm sure the managers at McDicks Parkstreet and Central Sq locations don't get paid enough   Been following that case for a long time. Whole thing sounds dirty as fuck. Hopefully they don't try to try him again.   I'm gonna go with training too. Otherwise why not burn the jeep?   the real one and I bet I've been in more gunfights than you   strangely enough the homicide rate has fallen significantly since concealed carry permits have become widely available.  Have you been to the USA? I work in a hospital and I've never seen a gunshot wound. I've never known someone who was a victim of a violent crime. The "gun violence" problem in America is *cough* unique to certain groups. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/figures/m6227a1f3.gif   no, jumping and beating random strangers is psychotic, defending yourself by any means necessary is nature   maybe, but 20 people randomly jumping on you could already mean you're gonna die. I'd rather kill a couple and hope the rest come to their senses.   You can get one in plenty of towns (specifically towns that are mostly white)   not that dangerous, lots of rights   one of my favorite parts about being american is not having to give a fuck what anyone else thinks   I agree that it doesn't really make sense. Id guess it mostly has to do with the concern that some soccer mom is gonna flip a shit   personal defense/constitutional rights   Shall issue- they have to give you a permit if you meet requirements May issue- they can give you a permit if you meet requirements (comes down to some officials personal opinion about you) No issue- no one gets a permit (except cops) No permit- just carry your gun, no need for a permit   if you look at it from satellite it says "SEX"   and this is why you wear your helmet in tactical vehicals   yea, they tried that. It's called Haiti.     	106

Funny that was ruled on the same day/month as this decision, wonder if theres a reason for that.   oh hey its cool to see my quote come full circle! posted this back in /r/quotesporn a year (?) ago. shameless plug for more of these: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/wattsquotes   Well you can click on the link in my last comment, then click the 'edit' button just below the comment and just copy and paste the story in. (the story being here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aypkl/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/)   You could always edit the story into this comment: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aydou/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/csh53n2 it seems pretty high up with a good number of upvotes. Also no need to be sorry! I remember reddit being confusing for me too when I first started.   Its listed in your user account page - http://www.reddit.com/user/RandomnessXo   best idea would probably be to make a comment here with the story, as there is no way to add the story text into a link post.   looks like your first post was deleted, heres a link to it: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3aypkl/update_surprised_my_boyfriend_with_a_ps4_for_his/   TIL, thanks Mr Irani   an   I wasn't talking about the tweets, I specifically said comments because I meant the comments on the article, the most liked of which talks about race culture and Blair's 'labour government'. http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9   I admit I did misinterpret the article, only because I didn't actually read the tweets, maybe you can see how the article coupled with it's comments makes it seem serious. I'll take out the part in my comment about the article being serious.  On the subject of the 'comments', I wasn't talking about the tweets. It's extremely obvious to anyone that understands a laughing emoticon that they find it funny, and if I had actually read them and seen checked their names against the authors then I wouldn't have said that the article was taking it seriously.  What I was talking about: http://gyazo.com/7b8791a9050585d904fb622d1d21ada9 The very first and most liked of the article comments is about race culture and Blair's 'so called labour government.  Please dude, take a chill pill next time and scroll down the page a little more. Maybe re read someones post and the article they're talking about before calling them an idiot.   yo landon cool name bro but you're on the wrong subreddit - /r/destinythegame   The article seems to take the video serious (although it doesn't actually)...and the comments are absolutely hilarious. It seems like they all read the title and watched 5 seconds of the video before going on a rant about race culture and british politics. They can't even use the excuse that they're Americans misunderstanding British humour.   Genuinely curious, why wouldn't NowSecure contact samsung beforehand and let them fix the bug before publishing this?    116,171      Shit hes getting older with every comment reply. He's 5 now!   You get that ending if you're too controlling of Ciri, no sidequest, its literally the end of the game.   Nugo what!?!   hey you got upvoted now, bet you feel silly   wat   sexy AF   This is the only good reply to a shitpost like this. 10/10 good job Fozzie.   hey man geemu isnt dead....it's still wriggling...a bit...   http://i.imgur.com/3OuqnR6.gifv   It seems like the majority of these are just common sense. For example, in Germany, you shouldnt stare or make the Nazi Salute....really? The implication being that it's alright to do this in other countries?   taken out of context what dragonstalking said is contradictory, lol.   Looks like he lost. Damn!   The unknown unknowns..hah.   I'm guessing this is the difference between someone with moderate fighting training vs people with 0 fighting training.   It's all for the greater good until you let Apple use your brain to power the iCloud.   The sky's the limit when you've got a rocketship.   You're on Reddit, here everyone is a legal expert! Even you!   This is  3 years old...wondering if it still applies?    ya know.   Sounds good, what time shall I come over?         in this occasion its real money.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Blom   yep. 50/50.   But them are fightin' words.   Temporary residency*, one year IIRC   Call a Witcher.   o7   Well I didn't see that ending but i'm guessing it means she stopped it and then came back, in mine i'm just thinking she stopped it and didn't come back to Geralt.   I think it worked. Good job, you finally killed it. We will now hail you as our lord and savior.   + mirror of his banning spree on subs for doing nothing: https://sendvid.com/ewe9he02   That's awesome. Do you have the link to the original one?   The Crone also said she would kill Geralt, which she didn't. Crone's were wrong about a lot of things. I doubt they thought they would all be killed by Geralt/Ciri, or that  Geralt would betray them and release the children (what I did).   Also if you also look in the quest log for the final quest it say something to the effect of "well as for Geralt, that's another story.". Dandelion also dosen't say anything about Yen,Triss, etc (at least in my ending), he only speaks of the political situation. I don't think that's really implying anything.  I'm not saying he didn't kill himself, it's definitely possible. I just think CDPR wanted it to be open to interpretation.   Yeah sounds about right, I think I did only two of those 5 things.  Cheers   If you're talking about the Crone ending where he gets back Vessimirs medallion, we don't know if he commited suicide.   To be honest we don't know if either happened (which is actually worse, I think.) We assume Ciri died, but in another ending she survived stopping the frost. And I guess Geralt could have gotten up and killed all those monsters (pretty easily actually).   Yeah definately. I chose not to kill Radavid which of course affected the political landscape. And actually I did see the lodge discussion, but I assume thats because I went in with her. In the flashback you see her standing behind me, a bit displeased, with me talking to the lodge.   Sounds like a better ending than mine.  Ciri goes into a portal created by the Elven mage, crosses into another world and then walks into the White Frost, she has some flashbacks of Geralt and her (now that i think about these were all from the last 'chapter', like me giving her the necklace instead of burning down the laboratory, i assume all these event flashbacks are the ones that caused this specific ending). Then the Frost in Geralts world stops, so I assume she stopped it successfully. Don't know if she escaped it like she did in another ending or what.  After this Geralt goes to the Crone's house, kills the remaining Crone and gets Vesimirs wolf medallion. He then kneels inside the house, clutching the medallion. You see a ton of monsters approaching the house, and then it fades to black. No idea if he was sad enough to let them kill him or what.   Yeah it was the ending with the Crone...don't know if CDPR ran out of time or if maybe it's meant to imply in some weird way that Geralt feels extremely lonely and that his and the other characters fate dosen't matter.....that's stretching pretty far but it's the only thing I can come up with lol.   Yeah good points, do we know how far away their planet was from the ice age?   In my ending, we get to know a bit about the political situation, but I can't really say I care about that that much. In terms of the characters, the *only* thing we know is that Geralt and Ciri may or may have not died. No idea what happened to any of the other characters. Was really let down.   It seems really lazy. I can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to her or the other characters.   Nope and that sucks.   Geralt goes back to Crookbag Bog to get back Ciri's medallion which one of the Crones stole. In the end he kills the Crone and ends up kneeling in the house, clutching the medallion while tons of monsters approach the house. Fade out. Don't know if he or Ciri died.   Why would she not tell him?   Yeah I don't even know what happened to Ciri. Pretty much a given that she died, though. And even Geralt, last we know in my ending he was just sitting in the Crone's house, clutching Ciri's medallion, with tons of monsters approaching. Don't even know if he let them kill him or if he killed them and got out.   Got the ending where she sacrifices herself to stop the Frost. Can't believe I don't get to know how the other characters reacted and what happened to them....wondering if this is just a CDPR fuck up (maybe they ran out of time like suggested below?) or if there's something im missing? On the other hand, I feel like this is one of the morally 'better' endings, as Ciri is saving an entire planet.  Also, did anyone find the boss fight with Eredin/Other Wild Hunt General really really easy? Like each one of his hits only took away about 1/20th of my healthbar, and each of my Quen signs absorbed two of his hits. I'm 99% sure even the wild hunt dogs were doing more damage to me.  I was using full master ursine armor/sword, specc'd mostly into the red skill tree, at around lvl34.  I just can't imagine why they wouldn't tell us what happened to the other characters (in this and other endings).   What the fuck. So different to Ciri dying...how the hell do you go from her sacrificng herself to her becoming empress......lol.   Also got this ending and felt the same way, would really like to know what happened to the other characters.   yeah i thought the same with how geralt acted....guess those peasents  were just insulting me   They state a couple of times in witcher 3 that witchers are emotionless, is Geralt the exception the rule? How else can he 'love' Yen?   Fortunately it was run by an organization that just wants to aid discussion on international issues, not by some Bond villian.   Any chance you could put the cards in a pdf like cards against humanity? Give us euros a chance to play without the killer shipping fee. (http://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/pdf/CAH_MainGame.pdf)    Any idea where the sword's are ?   f5    For superior do you mean just north of the crossroads inn? And mastercrafted is the shattered tower on Skellige on or Vellen?... Also I found enhanced in Skellige isles, at least part 1, still searching for part 2, cant remember where now.   No stash box but there's a mod already out to increase weight limit to 9999 (its on the sub).   is there any way we can edit this ourselves to set the weight limit? just change an integer or something (lol)?   For someone with so much money he sure does have a shitty website design.   Those are all completely different games. With different engines, different amount of calculations running in the background, different gameplay goals, different core mechanics, different art styles etc etc etc. Not to mention GTA had a 265$million budget and their game still takes 5 minutes to load into multiplayer, compared to DayZ which was a free mod (initially) and is the most tense gameplay experience i've ever had.. Saying shit like that makes it sound like you have no idea what you're talking about OR like you're baiting.   bB!   Glad to see you replied to my points rationally and showed you aren't a child...wait a minute.   I mean we know it's improv..anyone thats ever been on the show or been in the audience confirms that. The music also could have been added in post, or they just know that at a certain point they 'start' the mission and are ready to start playing the music. No need to throw insults now just because someone has a differing opinion, that's just childish.   Can you expand? The music in that scene is just on a loop...   It's all improv. It's worth noting though that for 30 minutes of footage it takes like 2-3 hours of filming, so the viewer only sees the best scenes/jokes.      Cool.   This book has never been more relevant: http://www.amazon.com/Conquered-Clippy-Erotic-Digital-Desires-ebook/dp/B00UJ01WBW   Yes, that's an erotica involving Clippy.   Can someone explain exactly how she fought him off? Did she have pepper spray or something? Looks like he just gave up.   I have never seen this picture before, along with all the other people who upvoted it. Even the rediquette says not to complain about reposts. These comments are complete shit because people are ignoring that.  edit: Rediquette also says not to downvote just because you disagree with someone...seeing a pattern anyone?   I'd hope a professor at one of the best universities in the UK would account correlation =/= causation when saying something like this.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/2bla2t/here_for_bungies_new_game_wrong_subreddit_visit/   What you mention definitely takes away from the main game being so polished, something to take into account.

Remember kids! Murder is only hate motivated when perpetrated on someone with a higher melanin count than yourself!    Ah, so a five time repeat illegal alien felon murdering a white person couldn't possibly have been done because of that reason but a Hispanic killing a black guy after having his head repeatedly bashed into concrete is a hate crime.   Gotcha.   Thanks San Francisco!    I thought all crimes were hate crimes. Some are just hatier than others.   Besides, who cares about a 5 time repeat criminal who gets repeatedly released?    Right? It's not like she was a Treyvon Martin!          The second pic is also Leto.    Viral marketing works.    Yeah. But they know about condoms. Getting pregnant was just a trendy thing to do. Let's not sit here and pretend we don't both know that and cater to the bigotry of low expectations.   So kids today still don't understand that condoms prevent pregnancy STDs? Maybe Jen McCarthy was right.    The author can derelicte my balls!    Maybe it's none of your business why she got fired.    "I'm a good person because I care about other people's marriages!"    I want to do one cycle but don't know where to get it. Just one.    I remember that scene with the snake bot in Terminator Salvation...   Not so adorable.    Maybe he also let him fuck your mom... just before you were born!    Butters promised to dig you out of the snow in three days.    That old guy's seen too much to be shocked by our modern standards.    Who the hell carries that much cash these days in this cashless society?    You missed the chance to say "Van-goo".    Maybe Diogenes was an asshole!    But you can! Just go around naked trolling people!

So brave.    I'll bet you also lick windows too.   Nah, you're right.  I'm sure she was actually just making an artsy statement about the plight of obesity in America by licking a donut.  Or whatever line her PR people came up with for you.   Terrified to say what country you're from, eh?  Well, can't say I blame you.   Are you from a country that wants people to hate you?  Where is this magical land?   By licking donuts  in display cases? Is that what you do in Khazakwhereverthefuckyourefromstan?    "Cuz Ariana grande saying she hates America has so much to do with music?"  I refer you to Soulsetmusic's reply above asking what this had to do with music.   Well then, I suppose I'm just expressing my disgust at being associated with an "American" who would lick a donut in a display case.  She's a fucking disgusting pig.   She's a "musician".   Music.   Gross.  I couldn't finish watching it.   My bad.  Forgot she was a writer.   What's a herpes culture going for on eBay these days?   You seem like a fairly rational human being.   She's an idiot with a panicky PR team.      When was the last time you heard about the Dixie Chicks?  Maybe the Dixie Flag..   Kornbekistan?   Is that why you generalize about 300 million people? Because not to do so would hinder progress?    If you're the type of person that says I hate America to the country that made you rich and famous you're probably the type of person that would lick a donut in a display case.      I'm assuming she also hates the American dollar.          A klitter.    He creeper us all.    Enhance!   Ask him when he's feeling your mother!    HA! I'll give those a try for sure!

Add up all the acreage.    That's nonsense.   tp://goo.gl/maps/OBjiX  I could provide thousands of examples. Not sure why you're so going up on the property tax aspect.    That's not what ANY charity does 100% of the time.    They feed, clothe and council people all of the time. How is that not what charities do?    What about other charities? Should they also pay property taxes?    Not /r/cumsluts!    Autocorrect. Ever flown on a plane?   Is it all urban area coast to coast? If course not. There's plenty of space. People just choose to live in high density areas for convenience.    Ever down on a plane?    Churches do charity work.    So do farms.    Why? They do charity work independent of conversion. Should all charities lose their tax exempt statuses?    It's a short cultural hop to force churches to marry gays or lose their tax exempt status, etc.  Of course, religious bigotry is perfectly OK.   Of course religious bigotry is OK.      Yeah, "The state mandated that I call my union a civil union" is totally the same as 400 years of brutal physical and cultural oppression.    Great! I'm sure you'll be just as adamant in your defense of state mandated gay marriage if it ever comes to that.    Actually, I'm in favor of getting the govt completely out of the marriage business. It's none of their business who marries who and I don't need my union approved by politicians.   Thanks for your assumption though.    Oh, is he a racist? I'd like to see that story.    OMG he disagrees with your position about marriage. He should DIE, huh?    Well, yeah, if he did it. Seems like a pretty strong reaction for just that though.    What did he say / do?    Outer Space!   https://youtu.be/giAzopSy-g0   Man, fuck that fail whale guy.    Why didn't the cops frisk him in the bathroom?    Well, he was white, so no news story here.    Yeah, Fox is the channel that you always see the police hate on.   /s   https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/5286764032/h599BAE5A/   For doing what?    Remember.... at one time gay marriage was a 'bad thing'.  Just 3 years ago for both Obama and Hillary!       As a sales dude, I live for people who come in with up front objections and defensive walls. It usually means they're either terrified of following their feelings or have had bad experiences before.    Where does he say acts of terrorism? He just means they are willing to resist all attempts by the govt to force them to perform marriages.   This seems like a desperate and dishonest statement on your part.    LOL, Communist!   Try statist capitalist.   Unlike corporatist like we are in the states.    You're not helping.    Yeah, but we have Detroit.    China is lovely this time of year.    This is Murica.

       His approval rating dipped below 30% when one of his measures to wipe out collective bargaining for public employees failed massively.  He dropped that and has been relatively quite and boring since.   He played the race card to Bill Cosby's race card.  It was in the news long ago.  SNL did a bit on it.  30 Rock alluded to it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzB8dTVALQI   It's depressing satire, though.

"There's no business in the worldno bank, no venture capital fundthat would give money to an entity without asking for anything in return. Negotiate a position in the same way that a venture capitalist would. You become a partner, not simply someone who is playing Santa Claus with taxpayer money."

DeBartolo pleaded guilty to a charge of failing to report a felony, and received a $1 million fine and two years of probation in return for his testimony against Edwards.[5] Edwards was on trial for extortion and other charges, among which were the $400,000 he demanded from DeBartolo to gain a river boat casino license.

It's odd there's no time penalty for this.  It was an equipment break in a race.  Racing is a panic.    I don't think he really gained anything by it.                                                                  Bang up job you're doing.                                           Different cultures, cunt.   Deadspin isn't.  It's just an irreverent take on sports.  It's got a great sense of humor.   TMZ breaks news.  They do some shit unethically but so does the New York Times.  For the most part it's harmless fluff.  The people they talk to either want to talk or don't mind talking.         Standard shindie shit.                                                         Do they have sensors to tell you when they're slipping?   Or those backwards policy thingies.   It didn't really happen.            You obviously didn't watch it.  Hopefully you downvoted it without doing so.        	161
 Agreed! Ian McShane was so good in it! It was a shame it got cancelled so quickly - I think it would have fared a little better in this day and age.   No, but will have to check it out!    +1 for all of these movies    +1 Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - fantastic chemistry between the leads. Also RDJ being pretty awesome and hilarious.    +1 for Children of Men. Way grittier than I expected.    Agreed. Personally I put Prisoners above Inciendies in terms of Denis Villeneuve movies, but only by a slight bit.    District 9 really surprised me when I watched it. It was definitely not what I expected. I don't know if it was mismarketed or I just wasn't paying attention to the trailers when they came out, but it was great.    Absolutely! Martin Mcdonagh is an amazing writer. Still need to read Pillowman, but I'll get around to it one of these days.    Harry Brown is highly recommended if you like Michael Cain.    City of God is such a fantastic film, so different from what you'd see from American cinema.    I know it's said again and again, but I absolutely love In Bruges. The writing and acting is really top notch.    Going with a fantasy theme here:   You've probably heard of American Gods  You might have heard of The Amulet of Samarkand  You probably haven't heard of Lies of Locke Lamora  You've never heard of Ruins of Ambrai      This reminds me that I really need to watch Orphan Black.    Love Fargo - have you seen the series (not a remake of the movie)?    Love Shaolin Soccer (and all kung fu movies). Have you seen Kung Fu Hustle (also by Stephen Chow)?    Love Gattaca. And Primer is so innovative and it's amazing how low budget the movie was. Makes me wish that extreme indie movies like that were more of a thing. I feel like there are alot of people out there who could be producing some amazing little gems like that.    Love Rock n Rolla. Such a shame all of the actors in it really blew up and Guy Ritchie wasn't able to get the gang back together for the sequel.    You've probably heard of The Shield  You might have heard of Carnivale  You probably haven't heard of Terriers  You've never heard of Kings   Agreed! And the cinematography! I also really enjoy the fact that characters speak in Cantonese, Shanghainese, (and French I think) - it really adds to the setting and realism of the movie.    Stolen shamelessly from /r/music and /r/manga. Those threads turned up some great gems, let's hear everyone's favorites.   You've probably heard of Prisoners   You might have heard of Miller's Crossing  You probably haven't heard of In the Mood for Love  You've never heard of Le Samourai   Stolen shamelessly from /r/music and /r/manga. Those threads turned up some great gems, let's hear everyone's favorites.   Stolen shamelessly from /r/music and /r/manga. Those threads turned up some great gems, let's hear everyone's favorites.    It's a good gateway manga for guys who are otherwise wary of the typical shoujo fare (ie high school romance drama/comedy). I think it's almost a little unfair to label Basara as shoujo (just because of the label it's published under), it's really first and foremost a fantasy genre manga imo.   Also, for those who read and like Basara, Anatolia Story (aka Red River) is similar though it has a tad bit more romance if memory serve (it's been at least 10 years since I read that haha).   Ah the nostalgia...     Agreed - I think most people get turned off by the "shoujo" tag, but it's really a sweeping fantasy epic with tons of action, drama, and tragedy.    Cast of season 2 looks fucking fantastic. Main cast of Patrick Wilson, Kirsten Dunst, Jean Smart, Ted Danson, and Jesse Plemons (Meth Damon). And supporting includes Jeffrey Donovan   Bruce Campbell (Burn Notice), Nick Offerman, Brad Garrett... the list goes on. This is gonna be AMAZEBALLS.    Agreed - I loved S1 of Fargo and I thought the only misstep was the ending, which was way too cliche/neat. For how menacing and a force of nature that Marvo was the entire first season, he really should have just escaped into the open at the end of the season... not just get shot by Colin Hanks...    Completely agreed. Cast looks fucking fantastic. Main cast of Patrick Wilson, Kirsten Dunst, Jean Smart, Ted Danson, and Jesse Plemons (Meth Damon). And supporting includes Jeffrey Donovan   Bruce Campbell (Burn Notice), Nick Offerman, Brad Garrett... the list goes on. This is gonna be AMAZEBALLS.    Love the Wars of Light and Shadow. One of the first fantasy series I read when I was a kid. Agree with most of the points here about how it's epic and mostly serious. But it's an incredible read and you will really sympathize with the main character.    Love the Trickster series! Highly recommended.    You've probably heard of Rurouni Kenshin  You might have heard of Parasyte  You probably haven't heard of Basara  You've never heard of Billy Bat (same author as Monster and 20th Century Boys)    During the season 2 finale, when Alana first comes into the house and discovers Hannibal trying to break down the pantry door to get to Jack, he tells Alana that if she leaves now he won't make any plans to call on her.    And then after you see that, I recommend you watch the other Martin Mcdonough and Colin Farrell movie - Seven Psychopaths. Very different from In Bruges, but still very good.    This makes me think of when someone asked Hugh Dancy if he thought Will was a funny guy and he replied "Yes, I think Will is a funny guy, he's just going through a very unfunny period in his life."    Unfortunately for him it seems like Nic Pizzolato gives him the most verbose lines of dialogue in the show. I feel like Vince tries to make them work to the best of his abilities, but there's only so much you can do with lines like that.    I like how it ties into the episode title "Other Lives" as well.    That look that crosses his face as the knowledge that he killed some random guy for Frank dawns him was amazing.    Huge "Oh shit!" moment for me. Also, amazing acting from Colin Farrell.      Colin Farrell is amazing when he's given the right material. He absolutely blows it away in In Bruges if you haven't seen that.    I can't wait to see the confrontation between Ray and Frank next episode as well.    Completely agreed - best ep so far this season imo.    I'm hoping he'll be able to stick it to that actress chick who was accusing him of improper sexual misconduct. Though if that happens, it'll be revealed that he's gay and there will be fallout with his soon to be wife.    Yeah the dialogue was only over the top once or twice this episode. And not terribly noticiably so.    He also may or may not have beat that psychaitrist to death.    She's really gonna hate herself if something happens.    Ray really beat the shit out of that dude. I wonder if he's still alive.    I think this has been the best episode of season 2 so far.    I think this has been the best episode of season 2 so far.    Because it's so absurd and Will is like am I the only one here sane enough to realize this.    The little pigs hanging above the bed were also super creepy.    Loved Hannibal's epic faces of smug this episode. He was just so fucking pleased looking this entire episode. Everytime Cordell and Mason talked about chopping him up and cooking him, he was just so delighted with how much thought and creativity they had put into it.   Also, his look of pride and amusement when Will bit off Cordell's face.    RIP Mason Verger.   I'm going to miss Joe Anderson a lot (though I'm really looking forward to Richard Armitage as Francis Dolarhyde) - Mason was especially fun and smarmy this episode. Loved his exchanges with Will at the dining table.   *"You could wreck some foster homes and torment some children."*   *"And drink martinis made with tears."*   *"No pajama party for you Mr. Graham."*     I loved the scene in this episode where Hannibal frees himself. That look on his face full of triumph and promised death... so perfect. It's a shame we didn't get to see him actually rescue Will and kill all the guards in the Mason household.    I love that even though Alana has been bent on revenge this season, so far as to throw her lot in with Mason Verger, she still risks her own life by freeing Hannibal in order to promise him to save Will. Unfortunately, I totally think Hannibal is going to keep his promise to her and kill her during the second half of the season.    *"You're going to eat him... with my face..."*   I laughed SO hard at this line. Poor Will, he's really just had enough of it all.     Added!       Yes absolutely. The show is either original material, a "remix" or expansion of the source material. Though, we still don't know how closely Red Dragon will follow the book. That's the only thing  that may be a close adaptation.    Hannibal was just so fucking pleased and smug looking this entire episode. Everytime Cordell and Mason talked about chopping him up and cooking him, he was just so delighted with how much thought and creativity they had put into it.      Nope, it was up from the beginning. Also you can't edit post titles.    The Hunt is a great movie and Mads' is incredible in it. (In fact, he won Best Actor at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival for it.)   It's also interesting to see him act in his native language.    Yup. And he's so over all the over the top shit he has been through because of Hannibal as well.    I think it would have been cool if it were actually Will who had manipulated Hannibal into turning himself in peacefully by rejecting him. But I think it was just Hannibal being a dick.    And Will looked like he was so tired of this shit all the time because of Hannibal.    I wanted to believe that Will manipulated Hannibal into turning himself in peacefully by rejecting him. But I think Hannibal just turned himself in to spite Will.    Made of me think of that expression that Jack had on him when he sees Pazzi hanging there with his guts hanging out. Will was sooo tired of this shit in this ep.       I'm a little bummed out that Hannibal just turned himself in... especially after he was so pissed that Will would deny him his freedom in last season's finale and went on a bender to essentially prevent himself from getting caught.   I understand Hannibal is doing it to try and have the last laugh with Will, especially after Will "breaks up" with him. But it just seems so out of character for him. Unless... Will actually manipulated Hannibal into turning himself in by pretending to not care about him and using his need for Will's attention against him. THAT I could get behind 100%.    Completely agreed. While I'm happy with the decision because that means we'll get to see Red Dragon on screen (I was fairly sure that season 3 was going to be Hannibal's last even before it aired). But so many of these points are right on the money. The pacing of the first half of this season was definitely off and it could have been better allocated in the first 2-3 eps.    I also a little bummed out that Hannibal just turned himself in... especially after he was so pissed that Will would deny him his freedom in last season's finale. Plus, a huge part of his character is his hatred of being caged.    I'm going to miss Joe Anderson as Mason Verger - he was so fun and smarmy this episode. Especially loved his exchange with Will at the dining table.   *"You could wreck some foster homes and torment some children."*   *"And drink martinis made with tears."*   *"No pajama party for you Mr. Graham."*      I love that even though Alana was bent on revenge, so far as to throw her lot in with Mason Verger, that she risks her own life by freeing Hannibal in order to promise him to save Will.    Aww Will... don't you know that spitters are quitters.       I thought he was going to find her at the end of the episode after he rescues Will and be all like "I always keep my promises" and kill her, but I guess he's going to do it somehow via the Tooth Fairy or after he escapes in the Silence of the Lambs story.    Hannibal was just so fucking pleased this entire episode. Everytime Cordell and Mason talked about chopping him up and cooking him, he was just so delighted with how much thought and creativity they had put into it.    *"You're going to eat him... with my face..."*   I laughed SO hard at this line.     Oh I like this.   More like at 11:05 PM tonight.    Amazing. Thanks for sharing.    Thanks - I'm glad you're enjoying them! Unfortunately, that was the weekend of July 4th and I just super busy. If I have time I'll try to go back and do that episode, but real life just gets in the way sometimes. :)   God bless cable TV, where they don't give a flying fuck about "mature" content.  And god bless the golden age of television, may it never die.    I love them. So meta.    I was totally expecting them to kiss! Which is why I was really thrown off when they didn't and Angela and Shayla kissed in like literally the next scene.    Agreed. Great cinematography (and lighting too!) I especially like the way they frame people - which is purposely cut out the other person they're talking to and frame them tight in a corner with wide behind them or above them. It really adds to the feel of the show.    I love the title screen of this show. I always look forward to what they're going to do for the scene every week.    And helps your tightly wound friend let loose a little.    Agreed - amazing acting, interesting characters, great writing, novel concept, unreliable narrator, and great cinematography to boot.    I didn't think he was fake until the episode where he pushed Elliot off the railing and landed him in the hospital and there was literally no repercussions or confrontations and everyone thought Elliot had tried to kill himself or something. Which made me wonder with all of the unreliable narrator stuff if Mr. Robot was all in Elliot's head space. And then after the thought crossed into my mind, I literally could not unsee from the show.    Raspberry Pi   Also loved the commercial of Mr. Robot playing during Mr. Robot. Definitely made me do a double take.    I cannot believe there's a show on USA, or any network, where there is a 5 minute hallucinatory conversation featuring the main character and a beta fish that ended with that line. Just fantastic.    Love this show.    Angela 2K15 does E and stays out all night and makes out with girls. Just releasing some of that pent up stress.    And it was an awesome, visceral trip.   Those were pretty much my thoughts when I was watching the scene. I was really excited because Mr. Robot finally interacted with someone else, but then it all turned out to be a hallucination. So we're back to square one.    Nope, turns out it was just a hallucination. I'm fairly convinced at this point that he's 100% Elliot's head space.    Wow... this was a bold episode. They pretty much spent the entire episode as one long drug withdrawal trip. I got vibes of Hannibal level  artsy-ness from this episode. Loved it.    Is City TV still showing it at the same time on Thursdays (10 EST)?    Also all area hospitals.    Quick someone call in Nicholas Angel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5QIUYg5M6w   It's part of LA county.    This is a pretty good summary of what's not working well season. The dialogue is jarring to the point that it sticks out, the editing awkward as hell during some scenes (which makes me wonder if Nic is having too much say in the editing room), and a plot that's still making me scratch my head as to what the point of it all is. There's a lot of on screen talent, but they only have as much as they're given to work with. I think all of the leads have been fantastic.    I felt like a few of the early ones really broke the tension in the scene for me. Also, the three main characters had so much plot armor that I really didn't feel worry that they were going to get killed at all. And it didn't help that the other cops with them were just dropping like flies and I felt nothing but they were essentially cannon fodder.    I couldn't help but notice that as well. Wonder if this season will follow similar story beats from last season as well.    After last week's tongue twister dialogue, I really enjoyed this week's Frank   Ray bar session. Especially when Frank tells him to "put this cop shit to bed." Makes me wonder if Ray will toy with the idea. Also, the line "Sometimes your best self is your worst self" was pretty good and direct reference to that Lera Lynn song from ep 1.    Lera's back this week! Though sometimes it almost feels like it's product placement with how prominently she's featured.    WTF there was just a freaking massacre in the middle of LA?? That was minimum body count of 30, including like 5-6 cops.    During the entire shootout, I couldn't help but wonder how the scene would have turned out if Cary Fukunaga had been directing.     Agreed, I felt like there were a few too many cuts at the beginning of the scene and that kind of killed the tension a bit for me.    During the entire shootout, I couldn't help but wonder how the scene would have turned out if Cary Fukunaga had been directing.    Um WTF there was just a massacre in LA?? That was minimum body count of 30, including like 5-6 cops.    "Sometimes your best self is your worst self."   "Maybe it's time to put this cop shit to bed." Don't think I've ever heard that from a character before.    Yay Lera's back!   With his wife. I think it might have gotten censored in certain areas?    Something creative, where you actually produce something, such as film production, art, creative writing, etc. I was also BS in Economics in college and classes like that really make your brain work in different ways that the usual business or academic classes.    I really like this idea - thanks for putting this sub together. I'm in! Sent you a PM.    Nothing remotely close.    And the kaleidoscope scene (which is omitted) can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HannibalTV/comments/3crg7y/the_kaleidoscope_lesbian_sex_scene/      And this one too: http://i.imgur.com/QjZcgJX.png      Bedelia - I just wanna enjoy my high, fuck off everyone   Jack - Fuck everyone   Chiyo - Fuck you Will, what part of Hannibal's mine did you not understand   Alana/Margo - ACID  Mason - Prepping his sitcom(s), Two and A Half Vergers and Dining with Mason Verger and the Yellow King   Hannibal/Will - JUST KITH ALREADY    I loved that line. Also the rest of that scene.   "You forgive how God forgives."   "Would you have stopped to gloat?"  "Does God gloat?"  "Often."   Reminded me a little bit of the True Detective opening sequence.      More like jokes on everyone trying so damn hard to get a piece of Hannibal... Chilton's just gonna reap all the reward at the end. And he's not even in the chase!   	128
 I selfishly made this because the guy from person of interest would make a great James bond.    I don't get why feminists don't go after stuff that is genuine inequality like female genital mutilation or even something like not being able to drive. But that doesn't affect them so they find stuff that might potentially affect them in their first world country. I'd be 100% behind the movement if they focused on actual issues but none of those issues affect them   Bad timing   Wow OK I can't think of a way to say this without getting ripped on and down voted to hell and I know this was just for fun. But how has nobody here considered the cumulative time you've wasted of all the people you've done this to after pulling them over?    Fuck you.   How did they get the battery to last five momths]?   Half the movie is in Chinese and the subtitles are in arabic   I don't think its out on DVD yet so it would just be some shaky shitty quality video of a theater screen   Talking to a cop   So without knowing anything, you've accused me of committing a traffic violation, said I'm a bad driver and ruined someone's day. BTW she slammed the brakes on the highway because of a plastic bag and said that to insurance. /r/protectandserve at its normal   Yup theres the blame shifting I've come to expect from p s. Don't get me wrong, other subs would still blame me but because I talked to a cop when I didn't need to   Well I saw something on king5 last week about some podunk in Washington buying military heavy vehicles. So yeah...   Why not just ask mercer island for it   I just got a ticket after getting in my first accident. I felt like shit about the damage to my car and then up walks a cop who I mistakenly talk to. Next thing I know, I'm handed a $200 ticket. Why? Just to add insult to injury?   I'm from Wyoming and whenever I get jealous about their free apartments I just about their what their  great grandfathers went through and I kinda undersrand. But I'm still jealous   Where on 5th street is that? Or is that the viaduct in the background?   Do you have a brand of choice? I've heard long lasting kind has more dextro dxm   Oh a nipple that looks like a dick. I was thinking dick that looks a nipple. This makes more sense   Just because this bugging me. Look up my history and check out the post titled "I cheated on my bitch." I saw the joke a mile away its just not original or funny so I ignored it. About the other stuff, I don't see any point in talking to someone so close minded   Well said   No I think they're just cops.    Wow that kid looked scared shirtless at the end when the thug was punching him   Boy you sure told me   So I'm not allowed to call a random asshole on the internet an asshole just because he's a cop? Oh and I also noticed similarities between the downvote brigade and the blue wall of silence.   You just want drama   What? Who are you? Why did you write me a condescending paragraph?   Thank you. You have a good night too  Edit:  Even this got down voted too? Blue wall of silence knows no bounds   OK I think we're done. Thanks for your input   So just be grateful for what we have and don't complain?    I'm just bored but think down voting someone you don't agree with is asystematic to our problem of bully police and the blue wall of silence that protects them   Since we're being honest I'm affaid for my country when the blue wall of silence condemns someone who thinks that cussing out a softball ref isnt funny and silences my feelings on that   Is it crazy or are you being sarcastic? I can't tell   People lie on the internet?    I mean MLB where you're in the stands. If you think its OK to cuss out a ref to his face then you're just an asshole   I meant the swearing at a ref part. If it was baseball I might understand, but softball?   You sound like someone I never want to run into. Scary to think you have a gun   What about dogs?   You just say that because you have princes who fight dragons and evil wizards   he's like Stephen Colbert    The first thirty seconds of this and the first thirty seconds of his 9/11 show are exactly the same   Its funny that's what I think about so I don't cum early   You can't OD on shrooma but saying so does make the cop who can't take down someone tripping on shrooms more heroic.   Well at least nobodys gonna get shot over this... Right...    I hide money in books. Check ur books   Once when I was arrested I asked the cop if he ever smoked weed when he was young, he said he never got caught and laughed as he pushed me into his backseat    The vodka handle costs $10, the rest is Washington state tax btw  And the steelies are 8%   I used to think that I invented egg drop soup by dropping an egg in top ramen.

I forgot to say that was part 1. here's part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZjbQPhduVk      why would you let it live? it's your civic duty to kill those things before they multiply   Hobbits gettin karma for isengard   I've always wondered what's the point of recording a cop if they can just delete it. is there an app that sends video to a server?   so compare to number of postal workers who kill dogs instead?   a better statistic to judge the misconduct of police is how many dogs US police kill compared to UK police. the UK probably haven't killed any, hard to do with a baton, while there's a whole subreddit to US police killing dogs /r/puppycide   Everyone assumes reedit is so anti police that any sentiment close to that is immediately disregarded    What I want to know is how many dogs US cops kill compared to how many dogs UK cops kill   that was my point.   "Detective Patrick Cherry has been removed from the departments elite Joint Terrorism Task Force and will be doing desk duty until he is officially transferred out of the prestigious division."  your title makes it sound like he was fired, he wasn't. he was transferred. no justice at all here   "Detective Patrick Cherry has been removed from the departments elite Joint Terrorism Task Force and will be doing desk duty until he is officially transferred out of the prestigious division."  your title makes it sound like he was fired. he wasn't fired at all, just transferred.    Who the fuck do you think you are? You a fucking lawyer? Dont get smart with me, boy.    a minute ago I watched a video on r/videos of a party girl who passed out in her car on the freeway. everyone in the comments gave her the benefit of the doubt, but he's homeless so fuck him right. it's on the front page of r/videos right now btw   what makes you think he was drunk? looking for half a cigarette in the ashtray is something all homeless who smoke do   that's called premeditated assault... he knew he was gonna have to mess with the guy's bleeding unconscious body    that interviewer was pretty good guy   took me way too long to realize skiing isn't some Slovenian word and she's not a queen. not even high   joking aside, why would any cop be against this?   i'm no animal fucker, but I think that's a cow   yeah sucks stargate got canceled    they get too much hype and are pretty weak. try heroin instead   what's the single best episode, if i don't have time because i have a meeting and children to pick up n shit?   you can hear the sound of the bell some stores make when you open the door. doesn't make sense for a house and we never heard that before, but that shittily let's you know the door was opened. but maybe the cops were waiting inside the house  	74
    I've seen this in NYC too, at a Japanese place.    Had sex once. Then operation and pills. Now I have two sex.   This looks like a cut scene from the walking dead.   Such great opportunities for public shaming/learning are being missed.   Wow. Did no one say anything to J?  Or at least hint that he was being selfish and rude?   TIL Movie rental stores still exist.   She looks like that droopy dog from old Loony Tunes.   My thoughts exactly. Just imagine a guy going to a bar, having a bit to much to drink, stumbling about, and taking a cab home. It's silly and funny. Then there is the drunken degenerate on the street who's life is consumed by alcohol. That's dark and depressing.     I fluctuate but I tend to get just under 7 according to my fitbit.  I do notice that during times of more intense training I require more sleep.   Ah, personal amusement. Seems legit.   You obviously don't like Weeblyn. Why allow her over in the first place?

Americans work hard and are labor force is productive; relative to other developed markets. I look at myself, and my coworkers, and we are so productive that we can use technology to cut thousands of manual labor hours out of our lives by creating programs to automate day to day functions. This lowers costs for our company and in economics is known as 'gains from productivity.' The problem with these gains is that they are not distributed to those creating them; they flow almost entirely to the capital owners. And this is the problem. Jeb is a capital owner. He was born into that. It is not so easy to build a large capital base these days; with stagnant wages, increasing costs of housing and education, and tight credit, it is unfair that the productive only serve to enrich the already rich while being robbed of the fruits of their labor.   I think about if I was armed at what distance I could accurately hit targets. By targets I mean random people on the street.   What? No one was happy with the six pack of duck tape?   I'd be too curious to see what he'd actually do than to contact HR.   Wow OP. He seems to know a lot about her. Ask him what that snatch tastes like.   8/10 - you look great. Please don't try to get more "curves" as I've read in other comments.      	39
    And Democrats will register dead people to vote, and then have people vote multiple times a day. Give the whole country a day to do that? Yeah right...   So 1 party? You gotta be out of your damn mind. They at least have to be replaced with a center-right party.   Better than making that 'deal' with Iran altogether.   That and Vox    These are young college aged kids who haven't yet had the opportunity to live through the long term aftermath of the policies they espouse  The problem is that these dumbass kids might succeed in getting their ridiculous unrealistic and naive progressive policies passed - and then when they realize those policies suck, it will be too late.   Oh man will those tears be sweet. The only candidate Sanders can beat is Trump.   Fine, but one party of Democrats would be even worse.    yea, it is a paltry 45%!    but the amount of narrow minded clowns that cant even be reasoned with that ive run into lately scares me  I feel that way about liberals.

Fuck I was think of selling at 3pm today. Bought at 123       What problems do you have with the 'free' public college plan? Has it's flaws, to be sure, but what's wrong with it specifically?  I'll answer that now in short - basically that it doesn't address the core issues of our public education system. The main issues, as I see it are the cost, actual benefit of going to college, and post-graduate unemployment. The cost for attending public universities are astronomical when you talk about living expenses as well (which Bernie's plan does not address). Tuition is only half the cost, sometimes less.   Getting more students into college wouldn't help either, even at no debt. There is an inflation of students with degrees who cannot get jobs at all. So why do we want more of that? And also, his plan does not force colleges to lower their tuition rates, nor does it prevent them from *raising tuition*. In fact, the abundance of student loans is what has allowed colleges in America to continue to raise their tuition, to the point where going to college doesn't even make financial sense.   What we need is more of an emphasis that there are options outside of college that need to be pushed (see Mike Rowe). Germany, for example, pays for college in full - but they limit who goes to college. It's not a blanket free for all. That is bad for the economy, as well as students.   As Mike Rowe said, "We are lending money we don't have to kids who can't pay it back to train them for jobs that no longer exist". So I think Bernie's plan is fundamentally flawed, and damaging to everyone (except the people who run the universities of course!).  And we haven't even gotten to how this bill is going to be funded (that's another issue).  To me, it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues that face our education system. And all Bernie is doing is trying to solve one particular symptom of a very big problem (they symptom is the student debt).  Student debt is obviously a big problem - but it is only a problem because the *debt is too high in relation to how much new graduates can make*. $15,000 of debt is not a big deal if you are starting off by making $70,000. What we have now is someone graduating with $100,000 in debt, with a job that pays $30,000. That's the problem.    http://www.aim.org/guest-column/the-democrat-party-and-jewish-anti-semitism/  http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2015/05/a-sign-of-things-to-come-in-the-democratic-party.php  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/19/berkeley-s-swastika-problem-are-america-s-liberal-colleges-breeding-anti-semitism.html  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valerie-tarico/sophisticated-liberal-jew_b_191135.html  Antisemitism is on the rise around the world, and it's not coming from Republicans - who actually are the only group that strongly supports Jews in Israel and defends Jews consistently.    Really? Evidence please. And even though the .1% crazies are 'Republicans', the general populous that is anti-semetic, is liberal. Please. It's like liberals can't possibly admit that they have widespread hatred within their own group. It's just soooo unfathomable!  How bout Jimmy Carter, a former president. Antisemitic asshole. http://allenbwest.com/2014/08/jimmy-carter-leads-democrat-charge-anti-semitism/  Wait for the next Israeli conflict and watch the liberals and democrats spew their hatred.    "but so does reality" is something liberals say :)   Read or change all the data on the sites you visit?  WTf? Don't download this...   I got to 7,000 yesterday, but then went down to 5k. I hovered between 5k-6k for about 20 minutes before screwing up. I couldn't get back to 7k (I was #1 for a while at only 5.5k)   Yea the vicious primaries doesn't help the Republicans at all.    Yea I'm not sure what a 'National Socialist'. I think we can just say Bernie is the closest thing to a Socialist that we've seen actually get some traction. Redistribution of wealth technically is not socialism.    Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy     At work, can respond more later, but Bernie is way to socialist for me. And I don't like a lot of his solutions, as they are short-sighted solutions that only fix symptoms, not underlying issues. His 'pay for all public colleges' bill is a perfect example of why I don't agree with most of his stances. That, and his profound interest in wealth redistribution.    Vox is a blog. That's why. Just like TheBlaze.com. And it is heavily heavily liberal biased, so it loses some of its objective credibility. Would you take a Blaze article that criticized Obama seriously? Then why would I take a Vox article that criticizes a Republican seriously?    All the BDS movements, anti-Israel agenda comes from the Left, exclusively. Certainly not all these people hate Jews - but that is where all the Jew haters go. Go to a liberal college and wave an Israeli flag and watch what happens. People are using BDS and 'Occupation' as a cover for their hatred of Jews.         anti-semetism by and large comes from the Left, not the Right. Let's keep that straight.   Because Vox is a reputable news source? I would barely call it a blog. Not that I'm saying their response is incorrect, but honestly, I wish we would stop linking Vox. Unless you want me to link TheBlaze.com   To be clear, this is a right-wing news source. Saying this before I read the article. Nothing wrong with a right-wing source, just make sure you realize what you are reading.   This can definitely be taken the wrong way. I say you guys figure out a different hashtag.   I posted this for karma. I have no intention for voting for Bernie         I'm sorry for your loss :(   Yea so I'm not sure what the default is, but I don't think it's cmd.exe because it gives me certain things that I don't think come with cmd.exe (scp, ssh, touch, tail, head and other linux type stuff). But maybe that's just stuff that is built on top of cmd.exe and really they are just small programs that are essentially similar copies of those linux functions.  I guess I'm a bit confused now because now I'm trying to run this script that came with Spark that launches a cluster on Amazon.   The script is 'spark-ec2', and when I do './' or '.\' when using cmder, it simply does not work. Also tried with git bash - that also didn't work. The only time it worked was when I used Cmder - but used the Cygwn option.   Does that make sense to you?    I think he means specifically socially conservative, but fiscally liberal. I think there are many people who are the other way around (fiscally conservative, but socially liberal).   No problem - It was .tgz file to be specific, but anyway I downloaded the Hadoop version and was able to get the command line working.   So that is why they started fuzzing the numbers? That makes sense. Then you can't tell if your downvotes are working or not.   Isn't Cmder built on top of MSYSgit?   I like how someone downvotes you without offering any information...  So interestingly enough I got it to work by flippling the '/' to '\'. Just for fun though, I tried the same through Cygwn and GIT Bash and it only seemed to work when I was using Cmder. Not sure I understand that.   I'm using Cmder for Windows currently.    Having some trouble using Apache's spark library, was hoping someone could help me out here.  I downloaded and unzipped the tar file for Spark. I also installed Scala.   I wanted to just play around with Spark using [this quick guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html), but as soon as I try to run:       ./bin/spark-shell  I get an:      '.' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  error.   No one else I am working with is able to get this working, so we must be missing something. Isn't this supposed to be able to run on windows?  UPDATE:  I downloaded the version that comes pre-built with Hadoop (didn't have Hadoop before), and now when I run :      ./bin/spark-shell  I get:      /c/Users/USER/workspace/spark-1.4.1-bin-hadoop2.6/bin/spark-class: line 76: conditional binary operator expected      haha ok sounds like a fun assignment   Hmm gotta be creative then i guess. Maybe 1000 accounts, but have the voting happen over a period of 24 hours, so it's spaced out. I doubt their algorithms could detect that. Maybe I'm wrong.      What about using AWS ec2 instances? 1 instance for every two accounts. It would be expensive. I wouldn't do it, but its fun to think about. Hypothetically, would that work? Doesn't every ec2 instance have its own IP?   well fuzzing is for one particular comment. Let's say I create 1,000 accounts, and downvote *1 random comment*. Each account will be downvoting a different comment (with some overlap). So you are saying there is a way they can just block all votes from an IP?   I just opened incognito mode made an account without email confirmation or anything of the sort. Just put the name in and password and that's it.   So I was thinking, purely for fun and not to abuse - I was wondering if it is possible to create a program that:  1. Creates a randomly generated Reddit account (account name would be X8Kh29Klw1, or something). 2. Goes to a particular user's comment/submitted section 3. downvote/upvote a random comment/submit 4. logout of that account  and then repeat 1000 times. Is there something that Reddit has in terms of spam detection or IP address monitoring that would prevent someone from doing this?   I'm also wondering why someone hasn't tried this already (or maybe they have).   And how long would it take to run? I would probably write in PHP. For each user, you have to create an account, go to the user's page, downvote, then logout. It might take a few seconds each time.    Who does the 1 star hurt more? Only you.  Stop being a troll.   I don't think you understand how this works.   Everything you just said is irrelevant. If you tell me you are going to be at my place in 2 minutes - and then don't leave for 8 minutes - you are lying and being dishonest.   No, you didn't owe me a ride in the first place. I'm not entitled to a ride - but once you make the commitment and say, "I'm 2 minutes away" - then you need to be there in 2 minutes. And stop being such a troll.  And if Lyft cared about money, then they will be pissed to know that I went and took an Uber instead, and then complained to all my friends how Lyft sucks and this shit never happened on Uber.   Next time I'll wait for the ride, and then give a 1 star review. That should send the message.    His car didn't move for about 8 minutes - then his car started going in the wrong direction. That's when I cancelled.   Glad to see most responses are like this, and no /u/chr0nic_liar 's douchey response.    I will be reporting the user to Lyft. And to be clear, the GPS said 2 minutes - and after about 8 minutes, the driver just started moving - in the wrong direction. That's a big fuck-up, and it's unacceptable considering the entire sales pitch from Uber and Lyft is that it's faster. And again, you are stealing business from other Lyft drivers that were already on the road. **It is dishonest, and no amount of swearing can justify that**.   No, that's not it at all. See [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3drraq/republicans_screw_unemployed_to_protect_the_rich/ct8k3h5)   From /u/mattsah - please don't let this be burried under the sarcastic comments  Bernie introduced it and said it would be paid for by closing the Carried interest tax loophole (although I can't find a text of the bill to support this). The carried interest loophole is describe here: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/42/tax-carried-interest-as-ordinary-income/ He was rebutted almost immediately by Lamar Alexander who made the following arguments (by the way, he sounded pissed):  * Unconstitutional, because it proposes a tax, it must be introduced in the house (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origination_Clause) * Three workforce programs created last year which are similar (jobscore, youthbuild, dislocated workers) * It's a big tax increase. Presumably the argument being that such a large tax increase should not be added to an amendment to another bill, but debated on its own.   Can we talk about how the amendment "Creates 1 million jobs"? A lot of these types of bills end up doing a really shitty job at creating jobs most of the time. Also to note, the main objection here is that *it is a tax increase that must be proposed in the House first*, and therefor it is unconstitutional to begin with. This is some second-rate analysis that leaves a lot to be desired. It's a simply knee-jerk reaction to depict (R) as evil (what else is new?)   Because it's easier to just yell, "Republicans are evil", than to do actual real reporting, which might tell us why they voted that way.    I hear that. 1 minutes seem acceptable.     Shut the fuck up you whiny poop snatcher.  Maybe I'll just take Uber then and tell everyone I know to stop using Lyft.  No but really, your rude comment doesn't change the fact that not only are you abusing the system to make it appear that you will pick me up sooner than you will- but you are taking business from other Lyft drivers that could have been there before you. It's dishonest. I made decisions based on the gps location of the driver. In fact, in this case, I chose Lyft instead of Uber because the drivers were closer. I've never had this problem with Uber. The fact that we all used to call Taxis is completely irrelevant.                I'm gonna do that. He also started going the wrong way when he finally got in his car   Happened twice. This last time the guy took 6-8 minutes to get in his car. I cancelled the ride, but missed my bus I could have taken instead. I'm pretty pissed. This has never happened to me on Uber   We are talking about food stamps - about food, and lack thereof due to economic position. If someone starved to death because they were locked in a cage, what the hell does that have to do with food stamp availability? An extreme example, but it illustrates my point. If we weren't talking about food stamps, you would be right.  Even so, we are talking about 2000-3000 old people, and less than 100 people under 40. And those 100 people are due to caregiver abuse/neglect - and not a lack of food due to lack of enough food stamps. That's the point. **No one in this country dying from starvation due to a lack of food stamps provided from the US government**.  Sure, someone could die from being left alone, being abused and underfed (caretakers not doing their job), physical disabilities - but none of that has to do with food stamps.  There.    Surprising at first, but here:   This can stem from certain medications, trouble chewing due to dental issues, problems swallowing or difficulty absorbing nutrients, according to the Mayo Clinic  So it has more to do with old age, being alone, and physical disabilities. Not "They can't afford food". I'm sure many of those 2000-3000 elderly adults who died had money - but did not have people to help shop for them and lacked the physical ability to properly take care of themselves.   What you believe doesn't matter, facts matter.  I agree. Thanks for the link, although it does not invalidate my point.   I edited my comment, please re-read.    dying because you didn't have food to eat...  Maybe it should have been, "how many people die per year from starvation"  The answer is none. But go to Africa, and children die from starvation on a daily basis.   Never made a 'red-line' that I couldn't back up. Threatened to use force, follow through at least once exactly how I said I would. Not war, but a demonstration of the *willingness* to use force, regardless of public opinion. Also made a considerable effort to get several EU countries to do exactly the same with me.   The point is, in some way, make them understand that I follow through on any redline, that I use force if I have to, and I won't let public opinion make me timid and weak.  It's like, Bush is the extreme - start a huge gigantic war that costs billions. Obama is the opposite. I would meet somewhere in the middle. Using more force than Obama, but not starting wars.  Although you could argue my actions would lead to war. But with 3-5 willing allies in Europe, no middle east country would dare consider war.   It does not seem like a question to me. It looks like rhetorical sarcasm. Not to mention I only said that currently no one is dying form lack of food - *we have food stamps now, and that's probably why*. It's an accusatory question.   Food stamps are great. And really, even if I'm not so fond of how much and to how many (without limitation of time) get them - in terms of overall budget, it's very little. Social Security, medicare, medicaid and defense is where our spending is.   There are what, 50 million on food stamps? Maybe it should be 30-40 million. And maybe we need to have time restrictions (2 years) on them. Not just for budget, but out of principle. We all know the saying about teaching someone how to fish vs. giving them a fish. It's meant to be a safety net for those in hard times - not a permanent lifestyle.   I don't think the abuse is so widespread that it's a #1 priority, but I think we need to be able to say, "hey, maybe 50 million isn't necessary, and maybe we aren't really helping some of these people in the long run". It's worth a conversation.   I just get really frustrated because anytime I talk to a liberal about possible making *any* change (even a minor one) to the program, I get a response like, "So we should just let people die?". No you asshole, stop putting words in my mouth. If we reduce the number of recipients, only the most well-off recipients would be effected.   In regards to food stamps and drug testing - I'm not too fond of that. It's not like they take their SNAP cards and buy drugs. The bible also does not teach "give charity - but when you do, make 15 conditions on the charity, and if they don't meet those conditions, then don't give to them". No, it says 'give charity'.   My other issue however, is the general mixing of charity and taxes. I don't think charity should be part of our tax expenditures. Charity should be charity, without government (screwing it up) in between. The more liberal and heavily taxed a country is, the less charitable they become (see France and England compared to the US). Part of that is religion, but part of that is that when people pay high tax which pays for social services, they feel they have done their duty in regards to charity. I don't believe that, and give around 8-10% of my income regardless how much my country does for the poor.   I think this is a validation of the /r/fatpeoplehate banning.   Did i say I didn't? Wtf? It's like I can't even talk about them without being accused of saying I want everyone to starve?   1 is pretty awful, but OK.   3 I think you are missing the point. "We will pay 2/3rd of the cost, so you don't charge students" - well, 2/3rds of what? Right now it's 2/3rds of $20k. They can say next year, "Well our costs have gone up, so you need to pay us 2/3rds of $22k". Not to mention the amount they charge now is far higher than it needs to be.    Are you invalidating the content of the article? Sad that *this* is the highest upvoted comment. People care more about bashing right-wing sources than actually just trying to talk about the content of the article. Regardless of who this came from, the Netflix tax is garbage.  I wonder if you are this thorough when liberal sources are posted?   It's really a joke to say any Americans are starving. Look at pictures of children in Africa, or Jews during the holocaust. That's what starvation looks like. Eating ramen noodles and tuna is hardly starvation. It sucks , it's pretty awful, and probably not good for your health -but using the word 'starvation' is misleading.   'Food insecurity' is what, exactly? Certainly not enough that anyone is dying. I see that particular statistic is hard to come by (I quite sure it does not exist).   The point is, *nobody in this country is going hungry*. Have you ever seen the stat for how many people die per year from starvation? Exactly 0 I believe.  If you want to downvote me, please show me a statistic that proves me wrong. I'm not saying we shouldn't have food stamps - in fact without food stamps, *we would* have children dying from starvation.     but it's shown to be pointless in states that have done it in the past  I was all for it, until we say that it did not save any money.   This is shocking that 'True' and 'Hilary Clinton' can be in the same sentence.   Not just Obama, but also the EU. Between the two of them, Iran has no fear whatsoever of breaking the rules of this agreement - in plain sight or in secret. If a Republican behaved exactly as Obama has, then it would be the same bit. It's not a blanket, "Because I hate Obama", it's, "Because of the actions he has taken".  Truth is, he is gone in 2 years, and someone else will take his place. Unless it's a Republican, Iran will have no reason to fear that America/EU will take any action against them. Add that to the fact that they are not trustworthy to begin with, and it is just a recipe for disaster.   Me neither   I don't see that anywhere - maybe I missed it, but it does not seem to be part of his plan. Not to mention, the prices are too high to begin with - so it doesn't fix that problem either.   I believe so   Yea I hear - but what you can do is replace them with 'temporary' workers, and refuse to give them a raise. You could even lower their wages and put 'temporary workers' in place of them until they quite, or accept the new terms.    "Gay marriage and the Confederate flag going down everywhere. Tough week for your redneck uncle on Facebook. treated as negative towards gay marriage by algorithm.         Great. Those tube drivers are lucky they still have a job.   So what prevents the university from raising tuition??   What is to prevent public schools from raising prices?   This. My biggest issue with him is his shortsighted solution that addresses the symptom, but not the cause.   Monthly expenses added together with 1 time fixed cost items? Wtf?      I wanted Obama to behave differently up until this point, so that this deal would have a high probability of succeeding.    It's great that Trump is now in politics, so we can bash him here. It's fun.    They went there not for some new desktop wallpapers but to apply theories of planetary evolution in order to understand how the Earth came to form  And then what? What have you gained?     instead we should have done nothing at all and somehow that would be better  I don't know why that is always the only suggested alternative. And this only has to do with Obama due to his lack of action and any show of strength throughout his presidency.   And you think any country in Europe wants to go to war or will actually follow through on such a threat? C'mon. The EU and America won't do anything. They'll just sit down and write another deal. And if another (D) gets in office, it will be the same.     If they violate the agreement then sanctions or force are the consequence.  You mean like all the "red-lines"? Even if he says he will use force, no one in the middle East believes he has any backbone. They have no fear to screw up. Obama will just give them another chance and make another 'deal'.   I plan to do this next year. That plastic from Home Depot. Hopefully it will help   When we let young children who don't even understand sexuality - to 'chose' their gender - then you *are* causing harm to others.   I identify as a turtle.   	114

I'm 61, much older than most folks here, and at 5'6" am weighing in at 202. I have put on the weight gradually over the years. I tend to be sedentary and am a stress eater. My goal is 150, using My Fitness Pal and aiming to walk 10,000 steps a day with a tracker.   Thank you!   I had a bad spell a couple of years ago and ended up going to physical therapy for it. They told me that freezing one of those ridged Ice Mountain water bottles and rolling that under your foot for about five minutes a couple of times a day is helpful, as is spreading and then relaxing the toes on the foot, also for five minutes or so a couple of times a day. I agree that getting lighter is probably the ultimate fix!            Wow, what a noticeable difference, and in only a month! Congratulations! Do you mind if I ask what your daily calorie allotment is?   What are you doing for the plantar fasciitis? I had it a few years ago.   You're right, that is their standard response -- that and saying that the tax cuts didn't work because they just weren't deep enough.                              Is there a dietician associated with the practice that's treating your dad? Or one his doctor can refer you to? That might be one source of advice.         Irrational wouldn't bother me as much as the ideological bias I see. Seems like right-leaning mods have managed to ban all posts from certain publications, and now they are also going after posts that are unfavorable towards Republicans from their list of allowed publications, using laughably inappropriate rationales.   Pretty ironic for a political forum.   This post has been banned from r/Politics, supposedly because Giuliani is a "private citizen" (He's not, he's a public figure) and the column is just nasty old gossip (It's not, it's all on the public record).    Here's the mod reply I got when I asked why it was being censored:   from hoosakiwi[M] via /r/politics/ sent 45 minutes ago "The entire post is about a private citizen and his statements about Obama. More than half of it is about the personal life of that private citizen (Mr. Guiliani). It is not explicitly political and at best could be seen as a gossip article."  Here is my reply to the mod:   Mr Giuliani is a public figure. He is still referred to as "Mayor Giuliani" and he tried to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. He made the remarks about Obama's lack of love of country in a speech to a political gathering, and the remarks were widely reported by the media. If Giuliani wants to be regarded as a private citizen, maybe he should not speak at political gatherings about political figures, then follow up by talking to the press about it. In addition, all of the facts in the article you censored are a matter of public record. Do the mods have a system of checks and balances or is one mod's decision final? This is pretty clearly an attempt to shield Giuliani. P.S. Learn to spell the name of the "private citizen" you're trying to protect.     You had a pretty face before as well, but now you're a stunner! Congratulations!   Yes, somehow not knowing my calorie count with WW always bugs me and the fruits especially can add up. Thanks for your reply, and congratulations on doing a fabulous job!   This is obviously censorship on the part of the mods -- happening more and more. Message them bit don't expect a change of mind.   You are adorable. One question: how did you do both WW points and MFP? I tried that for awhile and it drove me crazy. Recently dropped WW and trying just MFP alone.       Here's a good analysis of what the threats against Rome actually mean:  http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/02/what-isis-really-wants/384980/         "Guess it's out with the pointless "healthy" ready meals and back in with elbow grease and proper food!"  Yeah, I come back to that conclusion every time I try the prepackaged stuff for awhile. I also tend to get less tired of the homemade dinners, even if I repeat them often, than I do with the frozen stuff, much of which tastes kind of the same.   I think it will turn out to be more complicated than that.   Really interesting study -- thank you for posting.   People in Montana aren't required to get malaria shots because unless they leave the country they don't get malaria. You include a quote saying that epidemiological studies show that Hep B can be transmitted in daycare. It can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their children, or from close contact in the home.  Hep B in its chronic stage can be symptom-free and can go undetected for decades. Has every parent and daycare worker been tested for it?The Hep B vaccine is safe. It gives immunity for 20-30 years and possibly for life. The consequences of getting the disease are extremely serious. Risk-benefit analysis would seem to indicate that the Hep B vaccinations are a reasonable solution to a threat to public health.      None of the situations you mention is the same as needlessly spreading a very communicable disease to a vulnerable population such as infants or the immunocompromised. The line should actually be drawn not at smoking outside in my vicinity, or at coughing or having the flu, but at putting others at risk of catching an extremely contagious disease that can bring serious complications or even death to vulnerable individuals -- a disease that would be virtually nonexistent in this country if people would resume vaccination at the rate they vaccinated 15 years ago.  Vaccinations -- and the isolation of those with communicable illnesses -- are not a new idea. Ever hear of leper colonies? Modern medicine has come up with vaccinations, so isolation is not needed much anymore -- unless you refuse to partake, and in that case civil society has the right to protect its members from preventable risks. Here's an article about the legal history of compelling vaccinations in our country from the current online Atlantic:  http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/02/cowpox-and-the-constitution/385245/         Funny! That's just how I feel!               The context is the current MMR vaccine, and the Disney outbreak. Measles is much more easily communicated than the other diseases you keep bringing into the discussion. In logic and debate, changing the terms of a discussion is known as a "red herring." People use it when they can't make a legitimate counter-argument on the actual subject under discussion.   Again, the context of this discussion is the MMR vaccine. You keep trying to change the subject.      Kids -- and adults -- who are not vaccinated do constitute a public health risk, as the Disneyland case shows.   People with AIDS don't pose any danger to the public, and I don't think they are being referred to in the current debate about the MMR vaccine, are they? Although I suppose if they have an impaired immune system, they themselves are endangered by exposure to unvaccinated people -- all the more reason to worry about those unvaccinated people being in public places.    AIDS is much less easily communicable than measles. Who said anything about AIDS? Is there a vaccine for AIDS? Are you able to follow an argument?   @FlowCannon -- A parent's decision not to vaccinate impacts those in the community who cannot be vaccinated -- infants under one and people getting chemotherapy, for example. I'm okay with people having the freedom to not vaccinate, but then they will need to give up sharing public space with other people, whom they are putting at risk.   @WowLucky -- A parent's decision not to vaccinate impacts those in the community who cannot be vaccinated -- infants under one and people getting chemotherapy, for example. I'm okay with people having the freedom to not vaccinate, but then they will need to give up sharing public space with other people, whom they are putting at risk.   @planetofjunk -- A parent's decision not to vaccinate impacts those in the community who cannot be vaccinated -- infants under one and people getting chemotherapy, for example. I'm okay with people having the freedom to not vaccinate, but then they will need to give up sharing public space with other people, whom they are putting at risk.     But people should be required to have their children vaccinated if they want them to go to school, travel, or sit in the waiting room of a pediatrician's office with other children.   I thought the exact same thing, Eliot_2000. He isn't ignorant, he's an opportunistic, cynical liar who is indifferent to the harm caused by his pandering to the stupid.   @Fuzzymuscles -- Infants under one year of age are too young to be vaccinated. People who have compromised immune systems, like those who are getting chemotherapy for cancer, can't get vaccinations either.   These groups depend on "herd immunity," which is produced when a high percentage of the general public is vaccinated. If more than 95% of a community is vaccinated, the unvaccinated people are very unlikely to be exposed to the disease.   So by having your kids vaccinated, you are protecting those in your community who can't be vaccinated -- the very young and the very sick. These are the two groups that would also get the most seriously ill if they got the disease, whether it's measles or whooping cough or whatever. Also, vaccinations are not 100% effective, so even a few vaccinated people can end up with the disease if they are exposed to it.  So those people who refuse to vaccinate their kids are not only putting their own kids' health at risk. They are also putting other people's kids (or older relatives with immune problems) at risk too.   It's a public health issue.                      Very broad interpretation of what is off-topic. Speaker of the House invites foreign head of state to speak, cuts president out of the process. How is that not US politics?   Really hard to find a publication that has your take on the matter, eh?      I honestly don't know. I put it out there because the banning of five female editors by an overwhelmingly male arbitration board seemed concerning to me. Please feel free to post opposing views of the situation.  There is an article in The Guardian that may be more even-handed. I'll post that.         So what is rehosted about this article, mr mod?   Conservative mods got MJ banned awhile back. It has nothing to do with rehosted content, really, as you can see from the lack of links or attribution to any other original "host" of the story in the MJ piece -- the publication is just too liberal for the mods. Same with Salon.         Well, it was a couple, I think.   As you say, testing is a very personal decision. Congratulations on the birth of your son!                                          Great job! Congrats!   Obamacare has brought health care costs down.     	145
 I just watch movies for fun in my free time, so it is OK for me. Unless those concern with the themes that I really don't like, I have no idea about which is good and which is not.    Haha, and I also watched his Knowing and other movies too.    I do love Ip man too. Jackie Chan can be the most successful action movie actor in China. Besides, Jet Li and Donnie Yen are great actors in China too. There are still actress who is good at martial arts in China such as Zhang Lanxin in Chinese Zodiac. Movies with Chinese martial arts can make me excited and I'm always dreaming about learning Chinese martial arts!   You love Jackie Chan's movie? What about Donnie Yen and Jet Li then? But seriously, Jackie Chan's action movies are excellent!!   Anne Hathaway, The Devil Wears Prada. Natalie Portman, Black Swan.    Bad roommate can really make you crazy. I have this kind of crazy roommates at my dormitory at college. They don't want to talk and they just focus on her own things. So I really didn't like the atmosphere at my dormitory.    If it's only one grape, find someone who is allergic to grapes so he/she can die easily. Or to find someone who is addicted to grapes, he/she wants to eat a lot of grapes but they have only one. Then they may get into anxiety and finally die. If I have sooooo much grapes, I will choose to feed him/ her with all the grapes to kill him/her.    Wow! Looks fantastic! This thing is the combination of all the things I like!!   But somebody said that Furious 6 was the best one and Furious 7 was even better. I don't know why.    OK, that means you both know that you don't want to obey his order and he says nothing and let you go. Then he is a great father. He doesn't force you to obey.    A very cute sheep!    Fortunately he didn't! I can't imagine any other actors for these two roles!   But you still can't do your own things since you are hiding from your father. You stay out late to do your own things? And when you are back what will your father do? He must know you stay out late and leave early on purpose.    Can't believe they are back but they will be on the movie screen!!Love their song but still confused about what the movie will be. Besides, why is a horror film?!!   Seriously, when it comes to actors of Chinese martial arts, I'd prefer Jackie Chan than Donnie Yen. So I will choose Rush Hour rather than Kung Fu Killer.    Your parents may ask you to do something you don't want to do when you are at home such as ask you to take out the trash when you are busy with your own things, or your teacher may ask you to do something for her and you have your own things to do, what will you do under these conditions?    Yeah, the plane crash scene was good and the last scene of the movie, the destruction of the earth was ...not that good. And the plots in the movie seemed to be too flat.    Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's not my favorite movie but I did watched it for more than three times.    Knowing. At the very first, I thought it to be a horrible movie. But later I realize that it intends to awake people's aware that we have no idea about when will the world vanish and when will be the destruction of human beings. treasure our life.    I hate reading,too. But I like books. I usually buy a lot of books and wish I can finish reading them in a certain period of time. However, up to now, I've bought so many books but haven't finished reading one of them. I think reading is boring and time-costing. I know reading can help me a lot and I should read something and keep the habit of reading in my life. But I just can't make myself be addicted into books. I don't know why. I really admire those who loves reading and those who can finish reading one book in several days and I want to be a member of them. Can somebody give me some advice?    Actually I think Momy will be more excited than Dady because Momy has spent almost then months with him already but it will be the first time to see how he looks like.   	21
 The Norwegian Version seemed much more valuable than the others, so that's nice to know i guess. Thanks ;)   Well, it's a good book so far, so rarity isn't much of an issue.   I thought so until i found out all Nordic versions were printed the same year. Well, if it's not rare, i do not care, the book is really interesting from what i have read already. Well, thank you for wanting to help, Sir and/or madam.   They are in Swedish, Printed in 1957 yes, but after the ones in Norwegian. I was a bit unclear , but yes mine is in Norwegian, sorry about that.   I'm Reading **Aku-Aku The Secrets of Easter Island, By Thor Heyerdahl** when I am at the Cabin, and at home **A Man Called Ove, By Fredrik Backman**   Not in the original language though   Hey here /r/books ! My Family Recently pruchased a cabin here in Norway and we found some books left by the previous owner. There was one book that made me wonder how rare that book was. I love books so i would never sell it, but knowing the rarity of the books i own is nice. The book was Aku-Aku the Secret of Easter Island, First edition 1957, written by Thor Heyerdahl. All other first editions i found online were not Norwegian, so not printed in 1957. It seems to be in a good condition and i already started reading it. i was wondering if any of you guys know how rare it is? My bookshelf is sorted in Year, Rarity, Author. So knowing where to put it is also nice. Thank you on beforehand !  And i also found a bible from 1871 which was quite interesting, made with what seems to be made with a Hectograph. For some reason i put it in the closet where we keep the wine glasses.   Sadly i cannot provide pictures of the books, as i left the books at the cabin where i keep my books.  EDIT: Took the well used bible home, some photos: http://imgur.com/a/GFBcH   Push space to jump, then push R after releasing space. That works for me atleast   	8
 The Guardian's best 1000 novels of all time.  They seem to have collated a lot pf existing lists so most of the old regulars appear.    http://gu.com/p/2nm2c/sbl  It's an odd mix.    I've only read two books based on this list's recommendations - The Poisoned Chocolates Case and The Wimbledon Poisoner and was very underwhelmed by both.  Anyone see any gems on the list?  Edited to include link to list - thought I had.   The Guardian has a good list here http://gu.com/p/46t37/sbl  	2
    Really? How long is he gonna do this for? Come on guy...    Saw it while I was in. E6 and an E4 get caught stealing ammunition and selling it. E6 dropped to E5 and good to carry about his career, while the E4 went to E1 and was kicked out of the army. The militaries justification, the E6 had more time in service and was valuable enough to the army to keep around due to rank and specialty.    I'm hungry, man... All right, yo.   I dont think thats how hyphens work   Look, you gonna use punctuation or not?        at a water park   you fucked us      **"It's a water park. And they ran out of water," says Vega Crain, who waited for two years to see "Panic! at the Disco".**      it was a she dumbass. look at those sexy ass feminine fingers.   Ive traveled. I know what different Islamic cultures are like. Thanks but no thanks on the read. I was just giving my opinion on the hijab. You can keep your hijab. I don't give two flying shits. While you're at it just where two. Or three. Knock yourself out.    No. You're wrong. Those comparisons arent at all similar. You can't compare lingerie to a hijab. It's obviously not fashionable if it's the highlight of an article about a woman winning best dressed. The articles pretty much says hey look this girl who won best dressed even though she wears this stupid oppressive shit scarf.    what type of winter coat you wearing?   turn it around   Is there a Hijab for men in Islam?   I'd say an article of clothing that exist for women, but not men, and is sole purpose is modesty is pretty oppressive against women.   	19
 As long as you aren't TOO afraid (   )      how did you make the flags wavey, i have some designs of my own and want to make them look good   it's generally regarded that brotherhood is the better of the 2 series   how did you make the water?   http://i.imgur.com/eCd40Yd.jpg  So I made this land mass (yes it is Ireland but that is irrelevant) and I need a good way to make a realistic water texture to go in the black area.   just click on the image and it makes it bigger...   http://i.imgur.com/cmVmywq.jpg  This is what I managed, sometime during the process this white border appeared and i couldn't find a way to effectively get rid of it.       no servers PC US East and West   A group of 3 friends hear of a sponsored tournament for a popular virtual reality game in the near future (as in they are actually in the game, not like an Oculus Rift kind of VR), they play this game rather often, and consider themselves quite good at it. They decide to enter for a chance to play in the tournament, along with hundreds of other people. They need to win a certain number of preliminary games in order to be placed in the tournament against 4 other teams of 3,  15 people in all. They quickly win many preliminary games and find themselves in the roster for the final game of the tournimant.   The objective of the game is to find an object in the world, game settings are gigantic and could be in a city/forest/etc, and place said object inside the goal which is at the very center of the map - by any means possible. The winners money starts at $100,000 from the sponsors, but throughout the tournament viewers donate money to the pool to increase tension amongst viewers and players. Players are allowed to do anything within their power to kill or trap players in other teams to give themselves an edge. The game lasts many days, depending on how fast players find the object and deliver it to the goal.  If you die, you are placed in a lobby where you can leave or stay and watch the rest of the game. I dont know if it should be where if you die you get no money if your team wins, or if you SHOULD get money for your team winning once dead, i dont know.   I dont want it to be just another hunger games esc book so any feedback is greatly appreciated.   I think ill post it on here and on /r/fantasywriters and see what i can get from both   do you know of any specific subreddits of that sort?   Can people use this subreddit for book/story ideas, or is it just for maps and fantasy worlds. I've got an idea for a story and would like some feedback on it, but i dont know if this is the subreddit to do that.  Thanks!      Valve released the first Train teaser on June 1st, 2014; They then released the full map on December 10th, 2014. 6 months later.  Possibly using this time frame we can predict when the new Nuke will be released.  Valve released the first Nuke teaser on March 31, 2015.   I presume we will get the new Nuke sometime in September.  Or they could be completely unrelated and have nothing to do with each other, that could be a possibility.    How long after the Train teaser did it come out, i think from this we could determine the time until the new NUKE is released. unless its already been beyond that time   what about the first part, where the map is only loaded once, and the server you are on is what determines doors/loot/cars/helis/time of day/etc   So I recently had an idea for a new way for servers to load the map, I have no idea if this would actually work, seeing as how i have no idea how servers or games work.  So my idea was that the Chernarus map is only loaded once, either by 1 server or something else. This way, the only thing somebodies server has to load is dynamic things, such as doors being opened/close, loot, heli crashes, cars, etc.   There could also be a thing similar to seeding a torrent, where if somebody else is rendering the same place as you are, your computer doesnt have to work as hard because of the other person. So say you are at NWAF and somebody on a completely different server is also at NWAF. Because both people are rendering NWAF, they both have 1/2 the load of the render until one of them leaves. If there are, say, 200 people all in different servers, they would each only have to render a fraction of NWAF.  I have no clue how that second part would work, and it probably wouldn't, but its just an idea I had.  Sorry if this made no sense, I was just rambling ideas out.   you're not missing much, thats pretty much all it is. I dont like the current menu so i made my own   they said with winter (at least in chernarus) that they might add a snow effect but not snow settling on the ground   that wouldnt probably work, some people would spawn near military loot and others would spawn really far away     	23
                   What's the game plan, Kevin? It was a nice run, Kev; had to close out some day. Nobody wins em all. ;-)       Fucking feminists.  They just raped me!                              +1    The audio on your xbone is not set up right then ...took me an hour to figure this out too...   I'm not sure actually...I just noticed this while playing through the campaign...there are so many games where I end a chapter or mission in the middle of it and then when I come back to it...sometimes i forgot what happened in the last chapter lol... but to answer your question...maybe??? :-P ...I did just notice that when exiting a chapter in the middle of it instead of the beginning...lets say after you have completed one fight...when I played it again instead of getting the same fighter ...I ended up having a different opponent.    :D            	25
 Why exactly, though?   Yes, of course there are such people.    His stance on the deal is defiant.  Actually, doesn't he agree with this deal?   Yep. :)   Oh sure, I think that FDR knew that he was near death for a while; however, he unfortunately could never relax due to the fact that we needed his leadership in World War II right up to his death.    I believe even more that we need to try something, and this deal is the best thing we can get.  Completely agreed.   What is your ethnos, though?   Yes.   An outright invasion of Iran?   Thanks. :)  God, a majority of Americans really is stupid. :(   Thanks for clarifying this. :)  Also, if you don't mind me asking, how old are you?   Agreed.   I think that you made a double-post here.   Agreed; after all, if Bush would have said back in 2003 that Kyrgyzstan was developing WMDs and/or nuclear weapons, then a majority of Americans might have believed him. :(   A majority? Source, please?   Weren't Jews only 10% of Poland's population back then, though?            Focus on the story rather than on the messenger, though.    and its possible there wouldn't even have been an Afghan War,  Can you please elaborate on this part?   The soup is in Strasbourg, but you need a German visa to travel there beforehand. ;)   A.D.?   It doesn't happen here in the U.S., though (well, at least not since the 1692 Salem witch trials, which was before we declared independence from Britain).      If so, then Germany will still end up a literal shell of its former self after the end of this war, which in turn will make this victory a Pyrrhic victory of epic proportions for Germany. After all, France, Britain, the U.S., and Russia all have *a lot* of nuclear weapons which they probably wouldn't hesitate to use against Germany if necessary.   The Golan Heights look awfully tempting, though.   I think that Israel will be able to defeat a built-up Syria, though; after all, Israel previously managed to do this in 1948-1949, 1967, and 1973.   Agreed.   Exactly which lost film do you most badly want rediscovered?  Any thoughts on this?   You can obviously dispute whether, say, 5.5 or 6.0 Jews died during the Holocaust; however, what you can't dispute is that most European Jews died during the Holocaust due to a deliberate Nazi policy to exterminate all or almost all of the Jews under their control.   The Holocaust obviously happened; are you a Holocaust denier, or what?               Actually, the U.S. was 10 years old when he was born. :)            Anyway, this question is pretty simple--would you agree to let Israel permanently keep the Golan Heights in exchange for Israel paying for Syria's reconstruction (after Syria's civil war, obviously)?  Any thoughts on this?   What do you think that the future of the Eurasian Union will be? Exactly which countries do you think will join the Eurasian Union in the future?  Any thoughts on this?      Disagreed.      It's still better than being dead, though; after all, you don't see Martin Bormann's children committing suicide, do you?   I'm honestly not sure, to be honest with you.      So how exactly do I fix this?            A duck? Why a duck?          If you haven't seen it, you should definitely check it out.  Will do! :)   Yep. :)         Frankly, you should have watched some anime on Netflix instead. ;)   Please elaborate on this.      Yep, unfortunately. :(   Frankly, I wonder if there would have been more if it wasn't for World War I breaking out.      Thanks for sharing this info! :)                           Unless (God forbid) some Muslim terrorist retaliates by attacking them  for this. :(                           Fair enough, I suppose; that said, though, didn't Clinton have some sort of plan to fight al-Qaeda at the end of his Presidency that Bush Jr. ignored?      Yep. :)      No us, but apparently the Italians do (or did).   But he didn't do anything about this threat afterwards (as in, before 9/11), correct?      I hope that you don't mean that literally. ;)      Yep! :)   Yep; completely agreed. :)      Indeed, several years after he got released, he finally became a good Nazi, if you catch my drift here. ;)   On the bright side, though, at least he died several years after he got released. :)      Yeah, it was definitely a mistake to release him. :(      I guess that this shows that the only good Nazi is a dead Nazi. :)      What I am wondering, though. is if Gore would have been likely to do anything before 9/11 (such as increasing airport security) which would have prevented 9/11 from occurring in the first place.   You might be correct in regards to this; of course, what I am wondering is if Romney would have focused more on bombing ISIS or on helping Ukraine fight against Russian-backed rebels.      Yes, because the U.S. had already pulled out of Iraq by 2012.   Thank you very much! :)   This raises the question, though--what exactly could Gore have done after he would have received that "Bin Laden Determined to Strike the U.S." memo?  Any thoughts on this?   OK.   Didn't Bush ignore a memo titled "Bin Laden Determined to Strike the U.S.", though?    September 10 2001 bill Clinton bragged about not killing bin laden.  Source, please?   I don't know if Gore would have prevented 9/11; however, I do think that he would have focused more on the threat of Al-Qaeda than Bush Jr. did before 9/11.   Care to please elaborate on this?   It looks like this is the Texas Schoolbook Massacre. :(   Also, *if* 9/11 would have been prevented in this scenario, then would Al-Qaeda have eventually succeeded in launching another large-scale terrorist attack on U.S. soil in this scenario?  Any thoughts on this?   The one in the center is the one who is dead.   The one in the center.            Yes, she is. :(      Done. :)            Yes, he is.   Yes, I agree with this. Now, in relation to embryos and fetuses, if they are considered property, then should a man be forced to pay child support if he can prove that a woman promised him an abortion and lied or changed her mind in regards to this later on?   Yep--Hedy Lamarr was certainly both smart and hot. :)   I think that I found it here: http://io9.com/the-strangest-tradition-of-the-victorian-era-post-mort-472772709                     OK--thus, let me ask you this--if I let someone borrow a baseball bat and this other individual will unexpectedly use this baseball bat to beat several people to death, then should I be held responsible for these people's deaths and/or for paying financial support/financial compensation to these people's families? Serious question, for the record.                     So you consider non-viable embryos and fetuses to be property, correct?   OK--first of all (this is part of this elaboration), do you consider non-viable embryos and fetuses to be persons or property?   The taxpayer argument doesn't really appear to work for this, though. If you want, I can elaborate on this.   What exactly do you think were the main factors in Grover Cleveland's loss in 1888?  Any thoughts on this?    Socialism is when the workers control the means of production.  You mean like in the Soviet Union?   Yes, all of these things are socialism, but they should also be combined with free-market capitalism (or at least with relatively free-market capitalism).   Yes--basically, socialism is a good thing as long as one keeps the free-market capitalist "core" of an economy intact.   Sure, but it was already harder to expel the Arab population of Gaza in 1967 and afterwards than it was back in 1948-1949.   Are you a potential Hillary Clinton voter, though?   I think that the best thing for Bernie Sanders would be to come close to winning the 2016 Democratic nomination but not to actually win it. That way, another, more electable candidate which views similar to his might win the U.S. Presidency at some point in the future (similar to Goldwater in 1964 paving the way for Reagan in 1980).  	153
 I've always thought that stunt performers and choreographers deserved to be recognized at the Academy Awards. I know a lot of people might look down on action movies, but I don't see how this category would be any less deserving than any special effects or other technical categories.  This year we've had Avengers, Fast and Furious and Mad Max, and we've still got Star Wars, Mission Impossible and Spectre to come.   Obviously this year has been a hell of a year for stunt performers and choreographers, and would be the perfect year to finally show some respect towards people who literally risk their lives for entertainment.  Edit: This YEAR not tear. Dammit.   This seems like it'd be the climax of a comedy of errors movie where Nic Cage accidentally becomes a politician and eventually has to give a speech that he forgot to prepare for.   This is my favourite 'Lovecraftian' movie    Pretty sure he appears when Simon Pegg is walking towards Timothy Dalton's office in the supermarket. Simon is walking towards camera and Edgar quickly passes by in front of him.   I hope it shows DD using a knife like in that leaked snippet.  Also, was it ever confirmed that there was more than Afghanistan and Africa as locations in the game? A lot of people have been saying there's a third, and I was hoping for a snowy forest/tundra environment, but the release is very close and it doesn't seem like anything official has said there's any more than 2.   Too soon   The part about the sky opening up to reinvigorate Superman's powers sounds super cool, but aside from that I much prefer how it played out in the comic    But cassettes of his music can be found and listened to in MGSV so he must exist    "Heelloooo" *schluuck*  ew   Yeah this looks really bad, but I think both Jim Jefferies and Alex Williamson are hilarious. Too bad this is the project that brings them together.   Amazing!   This is my favorite video from E3. This is insane    It totally looks like Rico has space for 4 weapons. 2 two-handed weapons on his back and 2 one-handed weapons on his hips. But apparently you can only carry 3 weapons at a time.   P.S this game looks ridiculous and amazing and is definitely one of my most anticipated games for this year    The T-Rex is not in the cargo bay when he is shipped over on the boat, he's in that big cage on the deck. He breaks out of the cage, you can see it all smashed open on the deck when Malcolm and Sarah climb on the boat, eats/injures/disfigures everyone, dying crew member locks him in the cargo bay.   Rockstar don't usually show up at E3 do they?   You should watch the first one regardless    Yeah fuck Jurassic Park 3 for sidelining the T-Rex and only giving it one appearance and giving all the screen time to some other larger carnivore.... Oh wait    I only ever watch movies in 2D, I don't like 3D at all. Didn't seem like there was any real crazy fly at your face type stuff I suppose    What was he saying/doing that was so bad?    I thought it was fine. Some great destruction porn scenes, great CGI and San Francisco and LA get nicely decimated over and over again. Not as crazy stupid and cartoonishly over the top and insanely massive as 2012, which could either be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for. The Rock has some emotional serious moments, there's also some terribly cheesy moments. Not the best disaster porn movie ever but probably better than most maybe, I never thought it dragged or got boring. Pretty much no better or worse than I'd expected from the trailer.   Has there ever been an old school Mustang in GTA? Seems weird that there isn't one in GTA 5, they're insanely popular cars.   I'm not expecting good dialogue or story or characters, but is there at least lots of destruction? I hate when you go into a movie for some mindless dumb fun, and there's like 2 or 3 action scenes between long stretches of soap opera.    In the fourth picture there's grass on Mars?   DriveClub looks slightly nicer, but Project Cars has way more content. DriveClub is super sparse and bare bones.   They should really set this one in China    I watched this for the first time with my dad. That movie will always make me tear up   I thought it looked average until Manzoukis showed up at the end. That was hilarious   Well now that Guillermo Del Toro is involved I guess it's just a matter of time until it gets cancelled   This guy is a fantastic actor but all his American stuff so far has been pretty poor. I hope he gets given a decent role this time.    I think Jonathan Levine is the only good choice on that list    Isn't differentiating between a unisex and women's toilet exactly acknowledging it?    The velociraptor models look like they were ripped right out of Jurassic Park 3 as well   Pretty sure that movie got cancelled a while ago   Thank you so much for this! This is my all time favourite Giant Bomb and I always have trouble tracking it down and the GiantBomb video player always screws up at least once for me   Even if Talia was the real villain she also got an incredibly shitty death scene    I don't know why every COD game hasn't had this. Seems like such an obvious and awesome idea   That's actually a really good idea for fighting game QTEs   So do you have to fulfill certain specific requirements before you can do them? Are they hard to do?   Really wish this would come to Blu-Ray. It's one of Scorsese's most visually beautiful films.   In some of the early videos, it looked like there were dev options for "easy" Fatalities or even maybe turning off Brutality requirements. Are these options in the same for single play or local multiplayer? I'll probably play a lot of this game with friends, and they don't really know how to play these types of games, so I thought it'd be cool if there was an easy mode so we could just hang out and have a laugh and see all the violent stuff.    The first half of that movie is super cool and unique and terrifying and atmospheric, but it really turns shitty as it goes on   ok   Yeah he definitely is not in that film at all   5  7  1  6  4  2  3   5 might still be my favourite, but I thought this was still better than 6. My friends and I watched all the previous films before seeing this one and 6 was pretty terribly written and stupid. This was way even more over the top in terms of action, but it was a bit more solid overall.   I have seen that movie so many times and it's one of my all time favourites but I have never realized that it was supposed to be set in the 80s   F F is funny, feel good entertainment with likable characters and inventive original well choreographed action. F F knows it's silly and goes with it.  Transformers is obnoxious annoying characters and offensively terrible cringey comedy along with exhausting shaky cam incomprehensible loud dull cgi action scenes. Transformers movies are self serious boring 3 hour long messes.   I guess it's the same reason everyone around here absolutely hates anything Michael Bay comes close to, but absolutely adores every big dumb explosion filled CGI cartoon Marvel puts out.   At the end of the first one he let Vin Diesel go and got fired, but then I think he was reinstated/had his crimes forgiven in exchange for helping the Feds bring down Verone in the second one.  Although the fourth movie seems like it almost ignores the second one and acts like he just never got fired or anything in response for what he did in the first film.    Maybe he's a Captain Marvel fan   MI5 is set in London for a significant chunk    1 was ok. 2 and 3 were crap. 4 was average. 5 and 6 were fantastic.    Oh that's okay then. I would be bummed if if had to pay extra for 1080p   HD and ultra HD?    Looks like shit    I guess I'm not as familiar with MK as I thought because I have no idea who Tanya and Tremor are. Could someone please explain basically what these dudes are about?   They specifically said he would 'retire'   No way in hell they'd just kill him off   They've both been in more good movies than Josh Gad   I thought Ninja and Yolandi were the most interesting and entertaining parts of that movie by far. If Chappie was just 2 hours of Die Antwoord trying to raise a robo child then I would have liked it a lot more. It could have been a very cool look at nature/nurture and raising a child in a harsh environment, with a really crazy funny South African sci-fi twist.    And Road to Perdition (at least the comic book the movie was based on) was based on the manga *Lone Wolf and Cub*   Aw dang that's a shame. I've always thought Liu Kang was really cool. Mainly because he's a fake Bruce Lee   I honestly wouldn't mind if most of the characters from MK9 came back, as long as there's still some cool new characters as well.  Also I really want Liu Kang in this game    You're right. It's not just about the technical quality or complexity of the CGI, it's about the way it's used. CGI in Jurassic Park was used only to animate very realistic animals, not a crazy cartoonish fantasy future theme park.   I just hope it doesn't take another 2 years    I really hope they add a Casino heist in the near future. These heists are really cool and all, and I don't want to sound negative or anything, but with the first one being a super short 2 person job, there's really only 4 full scale heists. Still an awesome update though.   I don't want to be negative about an unfinished film but whenever these updates are posted it never seems any more realistic to me. I can see differences for sure, but it still looks like a totally fake cartoon    Huh I don't remember that    I thought this was a really terrible stupid line in the trailer and I'm surprised they're using it for advertising purposes    Kojima just retweeted this   Yeah it'd be a shame if he ruins the classic masterpiece high art film about a jelly blob from outer space that kills people   I'm assuming we'll get a trailer for the Good Dinosaur in front of Inside Out    Very. Go watch them and have your life greatly improved.   What about the Casino? Is it open finally?   He was a cop in 1 2 and 4 I believe.    4 was pretty cruddy, 5 is really fantastic, 6 is the craziest dumbest thing ever but very awesome   Hans did the music for MI2 and it was a pretty terrible score   Ugh why would anyone want to keep Alien 3 and 4 in canon    Gangs of New York  True Romance     Is she not referring to Chappie there?    Man, I used to think Tim Schafer was the coolest dude. I even have an autographed poster of Psychonauts on my wall. But regardless of my, or even Tim's, personal stance on the recent controversy in the video game industry, he's been really cringey and obnoxious with this whole topic recently. I'm all for opening up a dialogue and talking about certain topics and I'm certainly not trying to be biased towards one point of view over another, but stuff like this is just annoying and embarrassing and pointless. Plus Double Fine's recent business practices and game development has been a huge bummer also.   Would it be possible to import it to Australia from another country? The PS4 is region free, but might the download codes for all the digital extra content maybe not work   Needs Wolverine   I actually haven't played PW, so I'm happy to hear that the tapes still pack a wealth of content!   It's more the fact that you can't just randomly call anyone at any time to get context sensitive conversations. That was the really cool unique thing I'll miss    That's a good point. Kiefer was almost mute in Ground Zeroes and doesn't seem to be doing anywhere near as much voice work as Hayter usually would, so I guess it makes sense that they can't do the Codec stuff with him.   Recharging health? Great. Sutherland instead of Hayter? Perfectly fine with me. Open world instead of linear levels? Awesome.  However, not having access to the awesome Codec at any time and being able to call who ever you want whenever you want is a real bummer for me. That was honestly one of the coolest and most unique and impressive things about the older games. All that detail and crazy back story and funny secret dialogue being put in to boring cassette tapes is a real step backward.   What's the name of this race?   Id like to see a video compilation of all these    He's in all the concept art with a pretty gnarly facial burn scar. So I'd guess he's back as a main character along with Sigourney   Wasn't there a homage to this scene in the first Die Hard?   Yeah just like Alien 3 and 4   I love this movie so much. It's so fantastically stupid   This like an /r/thathappened post from the Marvel universe    Damn, I missed it last year and I really wanted that tommy gun   yikes   Zentorno is faster but the Entity has better handling. I have a Zentorno and my friend has an Entity, and we race each other all the time. It's pretty much 50/50 between us in terms of wins/losses    I don't remember exactly what morning talk shows he was on, but I've seen at least 2 interviews where he talks about how difficult it was for him to film scenes without Paul and pretend he was still there and how he basically couldn't stop crying the whole time. He said it was the most difficult time he has ever been through. He didn't say anything overly negative, probably because he was still selling the film, but it was clear he really didn't enjoy pretending his friend was in scenes with him.   Maybe in a year or so everyone will be feeling better and want to make a new film, but it seemed pretty obvious that everyone was having a rough time continuing the film without Paul.   According to the behind the scenes videos and pictures that were leaked/released, Paul was on the set for most of the bus stunt and cars jumping out of the planes. There's behind the scenes clips of him doing the bus jumps stunt and shots of them filming the cars falling from the plan in front of a giant green screen. Also that scene at 1:33 was in the first trailer.  However, Jordana Brewster had yet to have her first day of filming before he died, so any scenes he shares with her (like the house exploding at the start) would be faked.  I believe they said they had reshot the film so that Paul Walker's character would retire to be with his wife and child, leaving the rest of the crew open to more adventures if they felt the need to make more. I know the plan was initially to make at least another 2 films after this. But who knows what they're going to do now. Vin Diesel seemed to really struggle working on the film without Paul.   Obviously anyone driving a vehicle can't use two handed weapons, but it really bothers me that passengers can't.  Often during a job or a mission my friends and I will be in the same car, and if we get chased by cops or Merryweather or anyone with a helicopter or heavy vehicles, it seems really silly that the passengers just have to sit there and use SMGs or pistols. This seems especially silly in boats because there shouldn't be any reason why passengers can't use every weapon there.  Throwing grenades or sticky bombs out the window as a passenger is pretty helpful sometimes, but I don't see why the passengers can't lean out the window and use a normal gun.  Maybe there could be a button that has your character lean all the way out the window, which would make you way more vulnerable and a much easier target, but you'd be able to use machine guns and launchers.  Just a little thing that would improve online a lot for me.   This is awesome! Would love to see the 1998 Godzilla added in   Hah, according to the size chart the Mosasaurus is 18m long, which seems reasonable. In the trailer however it's head alone is that size.   What? Proper fucked?   Darjeeling and Life Aquatic are my favorites even though no one else ever seems to bring them up or really like them. I think they strike the perfect balance between honest heartfelt human drama, and the wacky fun of his later films.    Obviously we've seen there's a few more cars and masks and whatnot, but I really hope the Heist update comes with a whole tonne of new clothes and tattoos and properties and new fun stuff.  I've only just hit level 90, I don't have a crazy amount of money, but I just feel like there's nothing left for me to buy. There's not really any more cars I want or any reason to go buy a new property. I feel like I already have everything I want in the game so I have nothing left to work for.  I'm excited for the heists because my friends and I are kinda bored with the regular jobs and would like to play through all the heists together. But I really hope they add in heaps of new fun things to buy so we have a reason to earn hundreds and thousands of dollars after every heist. Because right now there's not really a whole lot left to unlock and not really anything left to spend my money on. Not anything that's worthwhile that I really want anyway.  EDIT: I wish they added the ability to fast travel between properties, that way I'd have a good reason to buy a second property up in Sandy Shores   Wow I'm surprised that's so low    I couldn't maintain my interest for the full 3 minutes of that video    Yeah Bin Laden is gonna be really upset    I only just started playing GTA Online when the PS4 version came out, and playing missions and leveling up with my friends in a crew has been super fun. But now we're all a high enough level that there's nothing new to unlock, and we all have enough money that there's nothing new to save up for. So I'm eagerly awaiting Heists so we can get excited about playing together again and have some new fun things to do.  Also I really want that Kuruma   I honestly think Los Angeles/Los Santos has always been the perfect setting for GTA games. It just suits everything about what those games are. But if I had to choose, either Hawaii or a fictional Texas border town.   I don't know why you're getting down voted so much for having a responsible and polite opinion. I agree that SR2 was the best game. SR3 was fun and cool but felt a lot smaller, and SR4 was just not my kind of game. SR2 felt like the ultimate open world crime sandbox and I enjoyed it way more than GTA 4   Intolerable Cruelty was pretty goddamn intolerable as well    He always seems to show up unexpectedly in like every other movie I've watched recently, and he's always great. Although I confused him with Casey Affleck once or twice a while ago, but now in recent years I've become a big fan.  	111

 Every procedure holds the risk of adverse events some have greater risk then others. The question for a specific patient do the risk away the gains.     [A survey of all patients who underwent leukotomy in England and Wales from 1942 to 1954 (Tooth et al 1961) documented 10,365 single leukotomy operations. An additional 762 patients underwent more than one operation. A follow-up study covering 9,284 of the above mentioned patients showed that 41% had recovered or were greatly improved while 28% were minimally improved, 25% showed no change, 2% had become worse and 4% had died. Not surprisingly, patients with an affective disorder showed the best prognosis with 63% recovered compared to 30% among schizophrenic patients.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1949/moniz-article.html)    but we have much less abrasive medical technology to treat the cases you are siting than a frontal lobotomy.     I am aware, but at the time medical alternatives were close to nonexistent.         I have a set of sport summer tires that are nearly bald but my care has AWD, this means still good to go in driving my car up here in the Alaskan snow right?    Why?    An Ignobel minus is what he deserved.    Why?   I've already provided a citation showing the effectiveness of lobotomies compared to a control.     [Here's another study looking into the effectiveness of the frontal lobotomy.](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.98.4.524)     Of sixteen agitated depressions twelve recovered sufficiently to live in their own homes, and continue to live at home in a relatively satisfactory degree of emotional adjustment. Of the five advanced schizophrenics two have made apparent recoveries. Two have improved to some degree and one, after making only slight improvement, succumbed to a virulent lobar pneumonia.    [And another.](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=320302)    The bimedial procedure gave the best results, in that 54% of these patients were working full time and productively five years after operation. The corresponding figures for the bilateral and unilateral groups were 33% and 29%. These results were striking, since these were all patients whose mental illness had been unremitting for at least 2 1/2 years before surgery and had been refractory to insulin coma, electric shock treatment, and intensive psychotherapy.   Because it was a an effective treatment for dealing with certain psychological diseases before the introduction of an effective drug for dealing with the same disease.    Why?    If words are too hard what about a number on the scale of 1 to 10?    [For the most part lobotomies were a very effective treatment, and before the time of  strong anti-psychotic medication it was one of the few proven solutions.](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.108.1.10)           This is good for bitcoin.   A diesel Panamera would likely beat it.    A M5 or Panamera would likely crush a P90D with ludicrous seeing how they already totally destroy the base P85D on a track.     [The P85D sets a time of 1:48 at autozeitungs test track while a porsche Panamera from 2011 does it in 1:37.2 and a M5 from 2011 does it in 1:39.8.](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/autozeitung_test_track.html) The Tesla is as fast as a 535 from 2006.

I really don't see what's the need to return people to the moon or other planets at this time. Using robots to space exploration just seems the better option in terms of price, scope, and safety.    When you control for fitness the effects of BMI don't disappear.     http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v29/n8/full/0802870a.html    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941781/figure/fig2/    http://circheartfailure.ahajournals.org/content/6/5/898/F1.expansion.html       http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v29/n9/full/0802995a.html    http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v27/n8/full/0802319a.html                 Autozeitung (German car magazine) test track times really highlight how the P85D is lacking in certain areas.    The Tesla laps their track a hair faster then a Porsche Cayenne S and the same time as a 4 year old 535i.    He should have double downed and claimed that you stole his work.    [BMI and BF% correlate fairly well together for the vast majority of the population.](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/2/500.full)   It's because for the vast majority of the population BMI is a good and simple tool to guide someones health in relationship to their weight. Yes, there are some very small groups who are outliers, but that's hardly justification to remove an effective tool.    Lack of lap times is a bit disappointing.    The US imports a measly 132MT of soybean a year from other countries, compared to the 70,000MT we produced a year.    [Looking through the data, something interesting that showed up is that when male treatment voice was used they did a lot better.](http://i.imgur.com/RBPgDtd.png)   Except the leveling system, in which you are a GOD one minute and dead the next.    The P85D is only about 3-5mph faster in the quarter then the P85S despite having more torque and horsepower.     The P85D takes over 18 seconds to get to 135mph.    it would still have no problems doing a quarter mile in less than 10 seconds.       I really don't think this car will easily get under 10sec through the quarter mile, gear starts to become a huge issue for electric cars as you gain in speed.         My guess is similar to the new Model S, with maybe a tenth saved off in 0-60 rush and .5 sec shaved off in the quarter. I'd be shocked if the car can pull more then 125mph in the quarter mile and do well on a track unless Tesla invest a lot into cooling.     Frankly I'd be impressed if the car can run comparable to a 911 turbo on a track, and I'm confident that it will be far off future hyper cars that will be out by then.    Quickest through 60mph and the quarter mile, not fastest though.       Looks like /r/conspiracy is leaking again.

THC and Dronabinol are structurally the same chemical and both are technically schedule I drugs. The weird thing is that Dronabinol in sesame seed oil "Marinol" and approved by the FDA is classified as a schedule III drug.    MARINOL (Dronabinol) Capsules is one of the psychoactive compounds present in cannabis, and is abusable and controlled [Schedule III (CIII)] under the Controlled Substances Act. Both psychological and physiological dependence have been noted in healthy individuals receiving dronabinol, but addiction is uncommon and has only been seen after prolonged high dose administration.     Cannabis != THC    Edit: Did some looking into it and turns out that THC/Dronabinol is still a Schedule I unless it's in sesame seed oil and approved by the FDA...then it's schedule III.    I got Seriously in Gears of War.        I just want to thank you for taking the time to summarize the research paper especially for those who don't have access to the article.

[Here is a very simple graph on suicides in India.](http://i.imgur.com/FovwdC0.png)        [The largest comprehensive review on the data failed to find sufficient evidence that GMO bt-cotton was a major contributing factor to suicides of Indian farmers.](http://www.ifpri.org/publication/bt-cotton-and-farmer-suicides-india)     We first show that there is no evidence in available data of a resurgence of farmer suicides in India in the last five years. Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.     [Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)           [And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)   The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.        Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.       No it doesn't. Your link is not looking at cancer risk from smoking weed.     Our primary finding provides initial longitudinal evidence that cannabis use might elevate the risk of lung cancer. In light of the widespread use of marijuana, especially among adolescents and young adults, our study provides important data for informing the risk-benefit calculus of marijuana smoking in medical, public-health, and drug-policy settings.     -[Source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23846283)       There were 79 cases of lung cancer and 324 controls. The risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% CI 2% to 15%) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5% to 9%) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking. The highest tertile of cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer RR=5.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 21.6), after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking.

Runyon was investigated under the assumption of illegally saving seed, Runyon refused to "cooperate" with Monsanto. There was no lawsuit over accidental cross pollination involved, and Monsanto just resorted to blacklisting him from buying their products. He can still by from other seed providers such as Bayer, Dow, Dupont, or Syngenta. He was not sued over accidental cross pollination.     [Moe Parr was sued over saving seed and telling other farmers that it was "legal" to save Monsanto's patented seed. He continued this practice even after Monsanto informed him that he is not allowed to to this.](http://i.imgur.com/wtW4xjA.png)      [Source PDF](http://www.fr.com/files/uploads/publications/DSU-Medical-Corp-v-JMS-Co-Ltd/Monsanto_v_Parr_NDIN_4-07-cv-00008_Apr_22_2008.pdf  )   If I had to guess it would be something like 3-5mph.    Monsanto has never sued a farmer over accidental cross pollination, this is merely a common myth.

They could of easily just found someone with a broken bones that wanted to smoke weed and actually get results that apply to humans.    Not realistically.

I'm not saying I'm right or not, but without some sort of quantification of headphone quality the hate on beats appears to be a circlejerk among audiophile and no something backed by concrete evidence.    This review by innerfidelity claims that beats are similar in quality to other headphones in the same price range.  http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/time-rethink-beats-solo2-excellent-page-2#sk2OCyKxg2tkYJc3.97   Do you have a source for this? Everyone says that beats are overpriced crap yet I've yet to see any sort of empirical evidence proving it.     aren't even worth 1/3rd the price he paid because they are "used".    The real reason is that most jewelers/outlets sell diamonds on consignment form a wholesaler. When they buy used diamonds they have to fork over a large sum of capital and liability in hoping that they can sell it.     The best way to sell a diamond direct to a consumer where you are hopefully looking at only taking a 25-35% hit on retail.     De Beers monopoly    Maybe 20 years ago, but their monopoly has long sense crumbled.    Same thing holds for rubies, but they have even less of a use outside of jewelry.    You're second link doesn't actually support that cannabis doesn't increase ones risk of dementia.    I'm not saying they are not cool.   And that is pathetic on corvettes part.   Not likely, the previous P85S has cooling issues and is forced into a limp performance mode after a few minutes of being pushed.    But quarter mile times are only 6% quicker.     The standard P85D is really slow to 155mph to begin with anyways at 35.8sec. Some perspective is that a M5 gets to 150mph in under 20secs.        Forza Jules   Because with a 280hp   AWD advantage the P85D was only 4mph faster then the old P85S. The new P85D only has 71 more horsepower so I'd be shocked if it gains anything more then 5mph in the quarter.    Tesla doesn't consume a gallon of gasoline for every mile it drives.    Even a F150 is getting well more then a gallon per mile.    Seeing has how the speed limit in the US is about 70mph then no car actually needs more then 150hp. But alas people like fast cars and when you make a fast car don't be surprise that it gets compared to other fast cars.    I'm talking about the old P85S, not the P85D.       Seeing that despite all the power and having AWD the P85D is only 4mph faster in the quarter mile then weaker P85S.         We are talking about a high performance car.    It's like saying you're an A+ student because you got a A+ in math while getting C's in everything else.    Extra weight.    And battery size determines how much energy you can draw and how much power your car will have.   I know, it's only 71hp more then the current car so I doubt it will be that much quicker in the top end.    Nearly a minute slower then a gas car from two years ago.    Unless they are adding substantially more power I doubt we will see more then a 5mph gain. The old P85s with 415hp was only 3.1mph slower in the quarter mile while lacking nearly 300hp, a ton of torque and being RWD.    I'm not talking about top speed, acceleration of the Model S drops off pretty dramatically at 100+mph.     Some perspective the 691hp P85D has a quarter mile trap speed of 115mph.    A Ferrari FF which has 651hp has a quarter mile trap speed of 127mph.    BMW M5 with 575hp has a trap speed of 122.2mph.    Mercedes E63 with 577hp has a trap speed of 121.8   Weight is only one issue, cooling is the biggest concern. It's why the Model S can't lap the Nurburgring at full power, the batteries just get too hot. Also a good aero set up for a track is rarely a good one for increasing range.     I'm not comparing it to a McLaren, I'm comparing it to other performance sedans like a BMW M5, AMG 63, or Porsche Panamera.        Keeping large batteries cool when they are heavily push requires a lot of cooling.   Most likely that will only be for the top of the range Model X, I bet you the base model is going to be between 5-6s to 60mph.    The 918 does it in 2.2, the P1 and LaF don't mostly due to not having AWD and thus struggling to put down all their power.    Also just how much it struggles for grip at the low end, doesn't really catch traction for 2sec.    We are talking about a car that is marketed and sold as a performance machine.    But it's not a race car. It's simply a high-performance car.     I know, neither are any other car you can drive on the street. [But when a 400+hp is merely as fast as a 6 year old BMW or Ford Focus ST then I have a hard time calling it a performance car.](http://fastestlaps.com/tracks/laguna_seca.html)   except for the ability to run at full throttle for more than 10 continuous minutes.     Then we have very different views on what makes a car "high performance".    I'd be shocked if the next gen Roadster doesn't have the same issues that the old roadster and the current Model S do.    They are extremely high performance consumer cars. Not race cars.     Neither is any Porsche, M BMW, or AMG Mercedes yet all of them can easily manage a track day without issue.    Never going to happen, dropping the Gamebryo engine is going to really kill/hurt the modding community beyond the game.    Electric vehicles already match and beat the performance of high-end gas-powered cars at a similar price point, and it's likely a matter of time before they are competitive with low end combustion-powered vehicles.     In a straight line up to about 115mph, after that anything high end exotic is going to leave a tesla in the dust. On a track Teslas are really slow compared to their rivals due to overheating of batteries. They are hardly true performance cars and are more akin to straight line muscle cars of the 70s. Maybe once they can make an electric car that can actually hold up to a base 911 around a track will they become an actual performance car.       Depends on how you define "quicker", Electric cars for the most part are one trick ponies posting insane low end acceleration figures. But beyond 0-60mph they tapper off real quick.    I hope they don't mind when I spit on the cash I will be paying with.   You know what, I'm going out tonight and I'm not going to tip! Not even a penny!   And that my friend is how /u/majornelson became /u/minornelson.   Over several years, the whole F35 program (development, procurement, maintenance/upgrades) which is about 50 years will cost us roughly 1trillion dollars in today dollars. Education is about 140billion every single year.    A whole lot worse. We spend 140billion+ a year on education while only about 20billion on the F35 program.    He's the one lacking evidence.   So then it needn't be removed from Schedule 1    Ideally yes. Nabiximol which is currently making its way through FDA required clinical trails for treatment of pain in cancer patients though unfortunately their last trail produce weak results. Though they are also proceeding with getting it approved for treating spasticity in MS patients, which it has already in approved for in the UK, Canada, and parts of Europe.     The big advantage of removing cannabis from schedule 1 status will that it will allow more ease in letting pharmaceutical companies research and derive products for treating a greater spectrum of disease and illness.           We kinda do. There is a cannabis extract that showed a positive effect in MS patients in large clinical trails and there is a current trial going on in the US to see if it can decrease seizures in certain epileptic children.    I love anecdotal accounts!    It's cause we are independent contractors!    There is some evidence for pain relief that is promising, but the most recent large clinical trial for a cannabis derived extract had disappointing results.       http://news.yahoo.com/gw-pharmas-cannabis-drug-fails-cancer-pain-study-122308627--finance.html   You can still get FDA exclusivity on any drug, even those derived from marijuana. As of now there are several marijuana derived drugs in development or in human clinical trials.    but would that come across as irresponsible/weird to the clinicians?    Not at all, there are many reasons why someone would change their schedule for a medical appointment.    There are already GMO-free labels.

"This panel is going to review the data thoroughly, and they are going to make their findings available to everyone for review."  Monsanto said the process and the findings will be independent and will be transparent. But the company said it would be involved in providing information and data for the review.    If their findings are open and transparent I really don't see what's the big deal about Monsanto seeking out a review by an independent party.       There's a lot of evidence that runs contradictory to the IARCs opinion on their classification. It isn't really that surprising that Monsanto would want to seek out an independent review.

We also reviewed relevant methodological and biomonitoring studies of glyphosate. Seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies examined the association between glyphosate and one or more cancer outcomes. Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.

 This is Amy. You are right!  Finding customers is key.   In terms of starting out, customers are often people you know through other experiences. This might be people you have worked with before, friends, family, or previous advisors.  It is often a good idea to test your product on customers in small experiments.  Don't go after a "big" customer until you have the kinks worked out and a number of smaller customers who have offered feedback to improve your product.  Larger businesses will ask about track record and will call customers you have worked with in the past.  Good luck!       Good questions- My advice is to join a startup for a year while applying and see if you like it.  Stanford is very flexible and a number of students are juggling startups and class if they are interested in both.  Plus, a year goes very quickly.  You will gain valuable insight into the world of work and learn what you like to do in a more practical sense.  I'd look at LinkedIn and read widely on TechCrunch and blogs to see what companies appeal to you.  Also, check out venture capital portfolio companies to get an idea for what is in the marketplace now.  My best advice is to find great people to work with!  You will never be "biding time" if you are working with great people who will invest in your learning and growth - regardless of specific business context.   Good luck!     This is Amy.  Set up strong founder and/or co-founder arrangements with early partners.  It is important to have clear definitions starting out and will save a lot of headache later on.  Starting companies requires collaboration but you don't want to feel taken advantage of.  Hire a strong lawyer early.  This is good money spent and communicates fairness if done right.  Good luck!     This is Amy.  My advice is to use the Internet to find people who are interested in the same things as you are.  LinkedIn is a great tool.  Don't be stopped by geographic proximity.  Technology and the speed of communication open vast possibilities to learn and grow.  Also, starting a business by your is hard (likely too hard.)  Find allies!!   Good luck.    This is Amy.  I believe we are moving into a non-credentialed economy.  By this I mean that degrees and certifications matter less than problems that people can solve.  When building companies, the person with a PhD or post-doc is only as valuable as what she or he can bring to the table in terms of problem-solving.  Advanced training can certainly help prepare individuals to tackle thorny issues.  That said, most founders in my research set do not have PhDs.  There are many entrepreneurs who graduate from college but forgo an MBA degree because of the 2 year investment in business education.  The MBA - or non-MBA - debate in the entrepreneurship world is heating up.  There is also the argument out there that the best entrepreneurs dropout (Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, etc).  Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX, Tesla Motors, Solar City, and PayPal, for example, dropped out of a PhD program in physics at Stanford after only 2 days.  I do believe education is important.  In the entrepreneurship world, it is mostly about what problem you can solve.    The leap of faith question to add employee #2, #3, and beyond is a good one.  For founders who want to make meaningful change in the world, it is easy to bring in other people.  No one person can create and scale an endeavor without enlisting other - many other - people to help carry and shape that vision.   In my book there is a chapter called "Network Minds" about how to harness cognitive diversity and bring together other minds to make businesses stronger.  It is by working together that we will solve problems that have not been solved in the past.  Moving past the solo operator to build a concept that will reach many others requires searching for allies.  It is a mindset as well as a skill set that is crucial when building meaningful partnerships.     Thanks for the question.  My research shows that male and female entrepreneurs who  start and scale companies to over $100 million in annual revenue share the same skills.  There are no gender differences that I have studied specifically.  That said, women do not show up in equal number in the "high scale entrepreneurship" category.  There is research that shows one reason for that is less access to funding.  (Women are not as connected in venture capital and angel networks and therefore do not have equal access to capital).  Research also shows that women don't have access to the same networks of advisors.  I would direct you to a new study out of Babson on women entrepreneurs as well as a study conducted by The Kauffman Foundation for more specifics.  Good luck!!!   And we need more female high-scale entrepreneurs.  Go for it!     Thanks for the question.  There is huge potential for scientists and business leaders to work together in more seamless ways.  Bob Langer, pioneer of drug delivery systems and human tissue engineering and founder of the Langer Lab at MIT, is a wonderful example of success at this intersection.  Bob has cofounded 25 companies that have scaled to over $100 million in annual revenue.  He has also licensed technology to over 250 larger pharma companies.  Check out his model as an example.   Specific to your question, one of the things underestimated by scientists (and new entrepreneurs) is the significance of funding. Startups need more funding often than they anticipate and one of the main factors related to startup failure is running out of funding.  Technical transfer and patent law is another area that needs close consideration.  There is huge potential in bringing research into the marketplace!  Scientists and researchers need to first and foremost find good business partners.     This is Amy.  I'm excited about companies such as Theranos, a lab testing company based in Palo Alto, that will use data analytics to fundamentally reshape the healthcare industry. The concept is that if as patients we get lab tests more frequently that we will be able to see the story of disease develop over time with the hope of detecting and eventually preventing it.  I see significant future growth in the intersection of data-science and medical applications.  Companies such as 23andMe have the potential to reshape healthcare but are not stuck in regulatory battles.  As you note, this is changing.  Keep your eyes on biomedical, bioengineering (such as the inventions coming out of Bob Langer's lab at MIT) and data analytics as related to healthcare!   I'm going to!!     	9
 Medium Rare boys, it WAS a perfectly cooked steak. Just a lot of seasoning on top ;)       Never laughed this hard on a comment ever.    Kid probably didn't know. If he knew, would you really think he would've done it?    Theatre students.. Well.. You'll notice them a mile away    Oh you're still talking?  Gets them every single time   I've done the "call someone a best friend shortly after meeting them" just to try to connect with them because I know we're going to be good friends.   She's planning to kill you. Cats are vicious    I definitely agree with you, I absolutely love Clara, since we first saw her. It really saddens me that she gets all this unnecessary hate.   	9
 Glad to know you're enjoying what is my terrifyingly real experience. Don't worry, I will post if anything else happens.   You know, it's funny you should mention silver bullets. Before he passed out, T kept saying,"I swear to god, it was a skinwalker..."  Now, I laughed at him, but I heard it too. It did sound like it teleported from the neighbors shed to the side of my house. But, like I wrote, it sounded a bit lower in pitch, making me and G pretty sure, there were at least 2.   Before it got dark today I did just that. I was looking for tracks beside the house. I didn't see any. I also checked around the shed. Behind it is a lot of, well, trash and crap. I didn't see any tracks but it did appear some things had been moved and there was a spot by the corner of the shed (whereabouts we heard it growl/howl both nights) that seemed the grass and weeds were pressed down. Like something had been sitting or standing there.   It started a few weeks ago, my boyfriend was going to his car. He did a visible double-take and said he thought he saw something next to his car, slouching. I asked him if he thought it was a neighborhood dog, he said it was way too big. He and I looked around, but saw nothing.  Flash forward to this past Friday. My boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were sitting on the back porch, talking and trying to build a fire in the fire pit. We heard this loud, high pitched sound coming from the tall weeds behind where the cars are parked. It sounded large and aggressive. His stepbrother and I had never heard this sound before and we were taken aback. My boyfriend, however, stopped talking and said,"Holy shit! I swear to god, I heard that same animal the other morning when I got home from work, only it was a deeper sound and it sounded like it was in mourning. It was really sad to listen to, it sounded so sad." Immediately, I wanted to go inside. Whatever it was sounded pretty close and pretty big. It didn't sound exactly nice, either. But, being as men are, my boyfriend and his stepbrother got out a super bright flashlight and laser lights and started to aim it right where we'd heard the cry. After a few minutes of this, I went inside and watched through the glass door, the guys seemed alright and the light show devolved into a bit of fun as they shined the green and blue lasers on the shed behind the house and I figured we were alright, so I went back outside. We resumed sitting on the porch and I had the cat, Tiny, in my lap. He was almost passed out, purring and snuggling with me. We had pretty much all but forgotten the noise earlier and had given up on the fire. It was maybe 20 minutes later when we heard the cry again, this time it was much closer, behind the shed, maybe 40ft from us. Tiny shot out of my lap and ran, somewhere, it's hard to say because my boyfriend, his stepbrother, and I were like a shot, too. We ran for the back door like our lives depended on it. "Whoa, what the fuck was that!?," I said. My boyfriend just kept saying, "it was over behind the shed, wtf?!" His stepbrother was white as a sheet. We were pretty freaking spooked. I know I have never heard anything like that, ever. I couldn't place what I'd heard to any animal I've ever heard. We went into the living room, turned on the tv, and decided to sit in. We heard some sounds like heavy steps on the back porch, my boyfriend swears he heard the sound again, but he thought it was by or on the back porch.  Then came Sunday. My roommate came home from a business trip, and we were sitting on the back porch, just talking about life. We both stopped when we heard a sound from the foresty area behind the house, beyond the field. He looked up and said,"What was that? I've never heard that before." (He's lived here 15 years, btw.) A few minutes later he and I went in. He had work in the morning and had to be up and out by 5:30am, so we said our goodnights, and I went to bed.  Monday. It started out like a very nice day. I went with my boyfriend to my parents, my aunt was visiting from Virginia with her three boys and my boyfriend had to leave for work around 9:45pm. We said our goodbyes and it had been decided my brothers would give me a ride home. We left around midnight and the instructions from my dad were they were to drop me off and go straight home. We should have listened. But, being as family is, my brothers wanted to hang out for a bit. We went inside to get refreshments, and I went outside real quick to light the lantern. I went back in for a second to tell them we should sit outside, it was cool out and a clear night. We walked outside and I saw the lantern was out, there was almost no wind. "Weird, that thing has a big wick, maybe it's out of fluid?" I relit the latern, it burned bright, it wasn't out of fluid. We all sat down and played with Tiny, talked about what we were up to, video games, etc. That's when I heard it. It was far off, by the foresty area. It sounded like a deep, long howl. It almost sounded aggressive. I immediately recognized it from the other night. I said,"Did you hear that?" My brother (we'll call him T) said,"Yeah, I heard that. I wasn't going to say anything, but I did. It sounded, like a dog, but not a dog." My other brother (we'll call him G) said he hadn't heard anything. I told them we should go in, that I'd heard this thing before and last time it sounded like it got really close. They looked at me like I must be exaggerating and we kept on talking. Maybe 15 minutes went by when G sat straight up and said, "What the fuck was that?" Neither T nor I had heard anything and he started pointing by the shed and was about to say something when we heard it. A very loud howl, growl sound. It was over by the neighbors shed and it was overrun by another, lower pitched howl, growl. It was on the fucking side of the house, not 20 ft from us. We immediately shot up and bolted at the back door. I have never moved so fast in my life. Whatever it was, there was more than one. And it was close, sounded big, and aggressive. I was the last one in, being pushed out of the way in the mad dash to the door. I locked the door behind me. We were really scared. It was so close to us. We all started talking at once. "What the fuck was that?!" "I've never heard anything like that before!" "There was more than one, omg, it was like surrounding us!" We migrated to the living room. G decided that whatever, whoever it was, had to be dealt with. He has this big pocket knife, grabbed it and told T to come with him. T looked scared but didn't want to look like a wuss to his younger brother, so he went with him. I begged them to not go outside. The neighborhood dogs, save for one, didn't bark. In fact, it was weird, as loud as these howls were, there was no reaction. I think that creeped me out all the more. Were they as scared of whatever it was as we were? These dogs bark at everything and everyone, but hadn't made a peep. I was still telling my brothers to not go outside, but they disregarded me, this thing had to be found and dealt with. T and G went outside, they had me lock the door behind them. I paced by the door, peeked and saw them on the porch, talking. I thought, maybe we are being silly, but no sooner had that thought gone through my head when I saw my brothers stiffen and run back to the door. They looked so scared. I unlocked the door and let them inside, locking the door behind them.  "What the hell happened?!" I asked.  "It's still there!!" Said T.  "It's was hitting the side of the shed, slapping it," said G.  We avoided looking out windows for the rest of the night. G and I stayed up as T passed out on the couch. We discussed animals it could have been. Wolves? Coyotes? A bear?? It was definitely big. It was definitely aggressive, and it was more than one. We still don't know what it was. I told my boyfriend, who told G to go kill it. G said he wasn't going back out there.   My brothers ended up spending the night. In the morning, G, told me he went back outside to see if it was still there, he said he heard it over by the shed, said it sounded like it was trying to break in. Still, no peep from the dogs.  Now, it's Tuesday night/Wednesday morning. I'm sitting alone in my house. My boyfriend is working and my roommate is on another business trip. Everytime I've heard it has been after midnight. I have my .22 nearby. I feel like I'm just waiting, but I refuse to go outside. Not after dark. Not anymore. There is something out there, and it is getting closer everytime I hear it. I don't want to go toe to toe with this thing. Not gonna lie, I'm still quite spooked.   I saw them, too. They did look like lights of some kind.   I actually knew a family that had a dog allergic to protein. It caused serious issues with their dog but the pet food they needed to buy was outrageously priced.    Not for me. He just thinks he should rub it for a few minutes and that's all it takes... so frustrating he isn't willing to learn and if I bring it up he gets upset.   Wow, having lived in both the north and south, I can say that what you just said is indeed racist.   lolololololol   Good to see I am not the only one who wished for a deeper story to Andale.   What About Bob is awesome, too.   I got it by the third line. I heard it, I loved it. Clever ending.   This made me laugh so hard. Thank you   I'd contact MUFON or Steven Greer. Or Art Bell.   I was thinking, a music box? That almost seems rather personal.   I remember a guy sang How Great Thou Art during a youth activity. It was...awkward.   They should be saying "for the love of god, don't read the fucking letter, it's bullshit" or something like that.   That was my thought exactly.   Omg No don't do that!! Hahaha, nah its great out here. Food is fried, you gotta try NC Style BBQ (it is unlike any other bbq), and so much more. But if you visit, make sure to go where they got really great hushpuppies(just ask people, they'll tell you where to go). Dip those in butter and enjoy. That's my favorite way to eat them.   Of course we would be picked for something like this...   God that pic is so old. I think I saw it back on ebaumsworld or something. Damn.   I hope this looks good to you, to me it looks like a heart attack, yet, delicious. Enjoy!! http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article10098542.html   In North Carolina, we have that every year at the fair. We also deep fry donuts, oreos, snickers bars, onions, and pretty much everything is fried. It is awesome, come down some time! People here are friendly!   Weird!!   Pao is nuts.   Oh man, this comment soooo much   If you should happen upon Voat in your searches, I will be the same handle. We may still be friends. Until then, we are comrades in the fight against Pao. Together may we fight and together may we win.   Unless something drastically changes I'm afraid we won't have a reddit to call home anymore. We all may have to move to other sites. We will be separated and broken. I will miss reddit. I hope this place can be saved.   Indeed. Toke on fellow ent!   They are going to do all the moving themselves! Good riddance.      I didn't realize it was so serious, ok then   TalesofFatHate is gone.   NP link?   Holy shit, I thought that was just a myth.   Someone needs to make this into a meme.   Haha   I know! It is crazy to know this actually exists out there, gives me hope for the post apocalyptic world!!   I thought it looked like one of the shacks you'd run across in FO3 or New Vegas.    I hope you wastelanders enjoy this as much as I did!  This wasn't my post, but was given blessing to post it over here. Original post has even more fallout goodness inside, complete with a dog and what might be a workbench ;)      I think OP should post this as a crossover in r/fallout.   It was the first thing that came to mind. Thank you for posting this. Long live the Goblin King!   So much happy   Whoa. Wait. I think I missed something  here. Seriously? Jet Packs?!?!   Seeing that brought me so much joy! My desire is now great to have something similar in my collection. Thank you!!!   Lol, good call! I miss that show. I also have a very large bowl called Hermes. I want the whole damned collection.    Given all the drama today on reddit, I'm so glad you weren't censored in writing up this happy bit. I can't smoke right now due to circumstances, please, toke one for me. And accept my upvote. You made me smile.   The right idea, you have!!!   Maybe a shitlord...   I have a pipe I named Amy Wong. This just validated it for me :)   Why wasn't the rest of the west wing evacuated? And why did they move the press secretary to his office, mere yards away from the press room? Not even the president was evacuated. Something smells screwy here.   I always loved cannibalism. Cuz it helped keep karma down, hope they kept that, and eating abominations, too.   Fox.com/gone  Also, I have seen extra parts on fb that are shorter 'behind the scenes' clips that show extra things not in the Gone clips.   I did. It didn't go well. He's an ass and uses his position to try and instill the fear of god, or really himself, into you. I really dislike this man.   You do realize it is hard to read emotions through text, right? Maybe you should be more clear next time. Anyways, this train is moving and no ambivalence or negativity will be allowed here. Get Off!   They'd be justified   Like a Tails to your Sonic? This isn't a terrible idea.   Get off the Hype Train. You don't belong here, and no, you can't keep your caps. They become property of the conductor if ejected from the train. Reason: you have a negative attitude towards a game you've not even laid eyes on yet.   Fried cram is amazing!   Do it. You will reap karma for your preparations.   We all started at that bottom. Choo Choo!   This comments needs gold, I'm poor so all I can give you is my up vote and I also saved you a seat on the Hype train.   That is honestly really sad.   Steve already read the books.   That poor woman!!   My bob didn't show up. I never got the option for building the outdoor opera house which was supposed to unlock him. Is there anything I can do?   I will have to give it a go. I'm sure it won't be too bad,but it is hard to beat steak. Js   Unless it is fried, I usually won't touch turkey. I don't gorge myself on red meat, because you really shouldn't. That spaghetti does sound good, but I would at least have some red meat every few days. Btw, I'm 5'3@115. So I'm not looking to really lose, just eat healthier.   That sounds like a form of child abuse. Giving a baby weight gaining medication, what the absolute fuck?!   I was really excited about this, then you had to cut out red meat. I couldn't do that :(   I cried.   I cried like a little girl while constantly restarting all my devices, realizing I don't know what the internet is for without Reddit.   I almost cried for twin peaks. Now I've shifted my attention on to Wayward Pines.   I would be ok with motorcycles. They could become damaged and require fixing, and you'd still need to actually climb mountains, or swim if you needed to go through water.  Honestly, though, I'd be tickled pink for sprint.   I was quite broke at the time so no taxi. It was only a few blocks, but it could have easily been the last time I walked free again. It was in the daytime, too. Close by UCF, which makes sense. Lots of easy prey around there if you are looking to nab girls. I definitely feel lucky I followed my gut to watch the vehicle. Looking back I almost could swear I felt being watched before I saw the guy, but that could just be hindsight.  If you ever have a daughter, I'd recommend she knows some self defense, or carries at least mace with her. I ran, yeah, but I would be willing to bet running isn't always an option. Luck was in my favour that day. But still, it was so scary.   Let me just say, if you don't play along you will be visiting with the Dean. A lot. I am so sorry you have to go.   When I lived in Orlando, I had a fight with my ex. He left me to walk home a few blocks. On the way home I saw a black suv with dark tint windows. The front passenger window was down and a man with black sunglasses was staring at me. It seemed odd, but I kept walking and watched as he pulled a u-turn. I thought he must've been going the wrong way, but kept an eye on the vehicle and watched as it pulled another u-turn and came back toward me. The guy sped up and turned into a side street where he abruptly stopped halfway in the turn and was partly on both roads. He jumps out of the suv, wearing a black suit, nice black shoes, black hair, and starts hauling ass towards me shouting Hey! Stop! at me. I never have ran so fast in my life. I ran down the sidewalk til I saw some bushes and people. I started yelling at them, but they never looked up at me. I ran behind the bushes and when I turned around the guy, and his suv, were gone. It was terrifying. I cried the rest of my way home, so scared the man would come back. When I got home, I immediately told my ex who told me I made the whole thing up just to make him feel bad for making me walk home. It wasn't long after that I found out about the sex slave trade and how many girls in Orlando disappear annually. My ex was a bastard, for the record. But that event, I try to really not think about, it makes my heart race with fear still thinking about it.   I believe it. Trust me.   That story is terrifying. Brought back a memory for me. So glad to hear she got away.   What is there to discuss? Obviously a wonderful and govt funded program such as D.A.R.E. leaves no room for that as they are a fact driven program meant to educate and protect children. /s   Haha!   I have actually been considering writing this up for r/exmormon at some point. Maybe I should, it has been years now, so I suppose it should be safe. The memories still make my blood boil tho.   I can confirm, he is a dick. I have no respect for him after my personal experience with him at BYU-I, it really solidified my dislike of the church after dealing with him. Not only did he scare me, he was very condescending to me and I had the realization that the spirit of discernment did not exist. Then I found out later he became a GA. I was very upset. I dislike that man very strongly.    I remember doing this in YW. It always made me feel warm and fuzzy. But I would never have written 'we know where you live'. That sounds like a threat.   I had a high school friend with this ability. It was neat. She could also do other things, me and my sister tested her and tried to trick her. We couldn't, it only made us want to know more. I have yet to meet another person with her ability, which was really strong.   What is Dark City? I have never heard of that one.   I love their podcasts! Hilarious as all get out and they always have their bs radars on, but they will entertain just about any idea. Much better than what Coast has become and a go to for the weird, strange, and unusual.   Thank you! I can't wait to watch this!!   Could someone post a link so I can watch it online?    Kinda. More like the sound of being grossed out.   I, I noticed that, too. I found it unsettling. Eugh.         I felt really bad for Kendall, too. She, out of all the girls, looked most upset. =(   ThirdPhaseofHoax put this out, haha. Hoax   Terrifying.   I just saw it too. I swear it put everything together. Some parts I'm a little fuzzy on, but I left the movie really wanting gravity surfing boots.    If russia gives disclosure would it be recognized as truth in America?   Wow. I'd be furious. Did you see how tight she held the script? She really wants her daughter in ALDC. It's almost unhealthy.   Thank you! I really look forward to this!   I would like to know more. Are his writings translated into English?   Do it!   I find there are some parallels. 1. The LDS has temples, Scientology has Training Centers. 2 They both have a Leader. 3. They both require time, and lots of it, from their members. 4. They both require money to use their temples and training centers. 5. They both have programs that take them away from family and friends. Missions for LDS and Sea Org for Scientology. There are more, but I am tired. I've really looked into Scientology, even considered joining at one point. As time went on the less and less I wanted to join, however. They require too much of their members money. You can't leave without them harassing you, and it's much more intense than love bombing an inactive members house with candy and paper hearts riddled with scripture and "We miss you!" notes scribbled in Beehive handwriting. Missionaries go for 2years. But scientology has the Sea Org. This is a Million Year contract they get youth to sign up for. They are paid for their work, but it's slave wages. The men at the top of scientology are insane.  	104

Feel bad that this upset you. Very sad.  Sorry.    Been on reddit for 5+ years.  Don't appreciate the comment.  Juvenile posts shows your age and maturity.  Very sad.                                      http://www.psfk.com/2015/06/projection-crying-babies-onto-factory-smoke-chinese-pollution-xiao-zhu-sustainable-business.html                              My wife                                                                          	176
 I see the faces in the trees.  They've always been there. Everywhere. Leafy faces. Smiling. Frowning. Mouths open wide. Green lips shut tight. They don't talk. They whisper. They breathe.   They stare.  My friends couldn't see them. The faces snickered when we went by. My friends couldn't hear them.   It's just the wind, they said. See? It's the breeze moving the leaves.  But they were wrong. They laughed as they left me at the tree line. But now they're gone.  And every time someone asked  All I could say  I can see the faces in the trees.  Then they stopped asking.   My mother never questioned why I dont go into the woods. She never made me.  She told me over   And over  It was okay if I saw something  But I shouldn't be afraid  And I wasn't.   Then  My mother went into the woods one day. The faces watched her go, and so did I. When she came back she hugged me tight.   I see them now   She whispered in my ear  Then  She was gone.  They came again with the questions. There's nothing in the trees. Trust us.   They stopped coming  When all I could say  I can see the faces in the trees.  My mother saw them before they took her.  And now  When you pass by   You'll see them too      That's what I'm guessing it is. Everyone is saying poison ivy, but poison ivy wouldn't leave those hairs.   Caladryl is what I'm using now- calamine lotion and liquid benadryl.  	3
 It's ok. We shipped a bunch of rednecks to the Middle East to protest there.      I knew you would show up. Damn egomaniac.      Ever read ["The Good Marriage"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Good_Marriage)? Had me worried there for a minute, Op.   Thank you, and I am really unhappy that I came across as defending myself.    Obviously.   Tried posting this on SoL and reddit, got banned and removed, sooo looks like this is real. Or we are being meta-trolled.   It's a story from a Pulitzer Prize winning major news organization about a discovery made by the University of Connecticut.    This is kind of like scooping turds from a public pool.      Acted like a fucking Nazi in a concentration camp.    There was an FBI report published not long ago about how White Supremacist organizations were recruiting into local police departments.    This is one of the most disturbing stories I have seen in years. Unbelievable that a human being can do this to another person. The rest- the Whistleblower getting fired? It's just fucking unspeakable.   Number 1. Tue 1:28pm pst   Bernie tried to pass a national infrastructure bill that would have fixed bridges and put over a million people to work. Republicans killed it.      This has everything to do with stockholders and publicly traded companies.    [USA Today Reported](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/20/collapsed--10-bridge-given-rating-just-last-year/30428515/) that the I-10 bridge that collapsed in Riverside County was given an 'A' rating a year ago. This is false.  There are two, 2 lane Bridges; eastbound and westbound. The newer westbound bridge was given an 'A' rating. *The bridge that collapsed, the eastbound bridge, was given a "Functionally Obsolete" rating by the National Bridge Inventory.* Functionally Obsolete ratings are given to bridges that are in such disrepair or old enough that the only thing to do is destroy them and start over.   Why the USA Today headline stated that it had an 'A' rating was either extremely bad journalism or an attempt to calm drivers/avoid lawsuits.   Story that notes the Functionally Obsolete rating of the eastbound bridge:  While officials had deemed the Tex Wash bridge on eastbound I-10 "functionally obsolete," its westbound bridge  also built in 1967  was listed as "not deficient."   http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2015/07/19/desert-center-bridge-collapse/30395123/  National Bridge Inventory site: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi.cfm    Wow. Then these franchises and other multinationals will have to pay Americans the same rate they have to pay Europeans. Poor billionaires.    My first move as a mom after that? Go to the little shits room, pick up the ONE thing he loves the most and smash the hell out of it. Never replace either one.   Of course- my kids would never have dared act like that. Ever.   Make sure and set out a shallow bowl of water if you get into a drought situation.   I'll use the example of my Apache friend.   His family (especially grandma) are Traditional. They don't want electricity, they want to live in traditional housing, keep livestock, grow and cook traditional foods and make clothing- maintain their culture. The kids are taught the Apache language (my friend knows Apache and Navajo).   BIA came on the rez and built these little modular homes and literally tried to force the traditionals to live in them and give up their gardens and livestock. The great grandmother had spent time in a BIA School where they were beaten for speaking their native language. To the family, this was the same sort of thing.   To kill a peoples traditions and culture and homogenize them is cultural genocide. It has been done many times in the past; often by use of violence- especially in the name of Christianity. Right now Europe is trying to do this to the Roma Gypsy culture.   btw- the BIA was not legally successful in making the traditional people give up their lifestyle.  And the segregation part? I am sure you have seen the 'whites only' drinking fountain pictures.  The important thing is to allow equality for all mankind while supporting and appreciating different cultural traditions.   And the main lesson to 'getting it right' is that the people - his Ka Tet - are more important than reaching the Tower.    Regular horses, Pally Charger, War horse - then rep grind for faction mounts. Had the only gnome on a cat mount on my server for a short while.   Right here. Couldn't pally without that one.   OMG!! Now I have to go log in and see.   /r/forwardsfromgrandma is going to get a whole lot busier.   I want your job.   In 2 weeks I would have them all playing Wow in their own 'Archimonde and Alzheimers' guild.   It would be so damn fun.    I just believe that cultural homogenization is as bad as racial segregation.  edit: As in 'Whites only' or 'No Jews allowed'.     You forgot the /s    car  My high school boy friend and his buddies had   1968 GTO with flames up the nose - that they dropped a 455 in.  1965 Mustang - original Forest Green. They put a different motor in it too but I can't recall offhand what it was.  1964 gray Fury with a push button tranny that was a sleeper- they put hydraulic lifts under it and capped the headers - running a push button to the inside. So if some muscle car rolled up beside this 'grandma' car he could jack it and uncap the headers at the same time.   It did an 8.5 quarter mile out at the airport (where they used to race).  We called it the Gray Goose.    I have no idea why this is being down voted. You are absolutely right and frame it very well. This exact reasoning is why people spend thousands of dollars to travel to new places, to explore the cultural differences and have new experiences through them.    Oh ok, gotcha.      "administered treatment on the NHS" I don't understand.   At 37 m (120 ft) in length, the largest known specimen was longer than a blue whale and is considered one of the longest known animals in the world.  !!   It goes deeper than that. Oil producers literally have the power to prevent a country from going to war.   We have had a rising trend of shark attacks worldwide. Basically- here is another one.  Search 'shark' on stormcoming.   Every time I see Ted Cruz that is exactly what comes to mind: sexual predator. So it's strange you mention just that.   Because dickheads vote in politicians who don't give a shit about anyone but the corporate lobby and its $$$      Or so you have been convinced:  There is a growing awareness around the world that experimenting on chimpanzees is wrong. Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and the European Union have all banned or severely limited experiments on chimpanzees. **The United States is the last remaining large-scale user of chimpanzees for research.**  http://www.releasechimps.org/laws/international-bans   Like the researchers in just about every other 1st World nation on earth?  There is a growing awareness around the world that experimenting on chimpanzees is wrong.

Carbon fuels industry even uses the same PR companies that the tobacco industry did.   Shhh.. we don't want redditors on any damn lists, now.    If there is alien life watching this planet- this is what will get their attention in a hurry.   It was over 6 miles up, still got knocked down a few kilometers by the blast wave.   That's so sad :(   Why did you have them put down?    Just my theory.   Then he came back to win the tournament.      I thought that's what Op posted.   Because she needs the sacrifice to bring Jon Snow back from the dead.    I think he is Bran the Builder.    Brynden Rivers is the three eyed crow?   And of course the more cancer cases- for private for-profit hospitals - you are assuring future earnings by keeping the cancer train going.   Point 1: Maybe /u/spez is naive enough that he doesn't understand that there are major marketing/pr groups that consistently troll reddit to insert social, political or non-scientific (but profitable) points of view.   These people aren't expressing 'free speech', they are posting corporate sponsored messaging.   Point 2: Building a sub is like building a house. Admin preventing mods from unwanted and unwarranted intrusion is like the police telling everyone they have to let people come in their houses at will and they can't do anything about it.  If they want to kill reddit- this is a sure way to do it.    It's mentioned in the comments that quadrupeds die more often to this than bi-peds because the lightning goes up one set of legs then through the body - exiting out the other set. Which is also interesting in light of dinosaur strikes.   They were burned. Standing under the tree and it was hit- went through the tree/roots to cow. It happens all of the time. It happened to some horses at a farm my friend boarded her horse at. Two of them were still on their feet-dead.  After that she moved her horse to my place.  http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/07/15/mammal-deaths-by-lightning/  http://www.ky3.com/news/local/a-lightning-strike-kills-11-cows-in-billings/21048998_32922156  http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Lightning-Strike-Kills-Nine-Cows-on-Farm-in-Putnam-County-264659231.html  http://www.scotsman.com/news/16-cattle-sheltering-under-tree-killed-by-lightning-strike-1-1042496   You would not see them post without some Bubba coming in and yelling "SJW!".   He did say he learned 'wisdom' from a couple of racist sites, that he wasn't raised that way.  Seriously, what is the difference if he learned it from reddit or some other forum? The result is the same.    Germany, France and Italy do not allow them public space. They have painful, historic knowledge of what the outcome could be.    Racists are not the reddit base. But they will be if this goes on because the good folks will leave them to their self-made cess-pit. A cess-pit that any normal person would be embarrassed to be part of and that advertisers will never touch.   because the new CEO is a biiiiiiiiiiig believer in free speech at all cost  Then he needs to run through a Theatre yelling "FIRE!" and see how far that gets him.    If I run a subreddit, and believe cutting off oxygen to these views are the best way of solving the problem.  And after being trolled and brigaded for years, possibly by hirees from PR Firms, /r/science and other scientific subs cut off oxygen to the climate change denial brigade.   What are they going to do now?     I didn't shut down /r/StormComing over the Pao affair. I have been in business long enough to know that what is happening under the surface is probably entirely different from appearances. Plus it's a small sub.  But if I could not remove bad posts or remarks from my own sub I would shut down immediately.    It's fine the first ten times, but by the twentieth, you tire of covering the same ground over and over again.  Point being- if something is brought up 20 times then it is probably a problem.     It's not just racism. subs like /r/science have banned climate change denialism and non-scientific profit based bs articles. The Koch backed groups would have a hay-day over there. If even just from spite.  I could even see some of the default subs having to shut down over that.   The *real* issue with gypsies is that they refuse to register via birth certificates, drivers licenses or any of the personal 'tagging' that states and countries do to individuals. They don't support massive economies and they aren't of the consumer class.   They are one of the last 'free people' left on earth and a lot of negative PR is generated against them. Unfortunately, average people buy into it, rumors spread, etc. Kind of like how the Nazis successfully excoriated the Jews. I am not saying the gypsies are perfect, but it's interesting how all people speak about FREEDOM!! But when there is a population of people actually *living* it, they freak out.   Very strange- I did a search on South Dakota and the only sub that appeared was yours and one other that was private. Just figured there weren't many SD redditors.   Another thought is- would the amount of lightning be more extreme? We know the rain would be because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, but what of the lightning?   I have seen dead cattle laying at the base of a tree that was hit by lightning. They don't have to take a direct hit. Very thought provoking question.    Ever since Walmart started selling computers. Yes.   If SD had a subreddit (if there is one I couldn't find it) I would have posted it there. Maybe you should make one.  Often people who live in a region know and can text friends and family living in another part of the region. Like during [this event](https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/23rgt5/significant_multiday_severe_event_expected_across/?) I received messages from people from all over those regions saying they were able to warn family and friends in the impacted zones.   Do you have room up there for a smallish graphics and marketing person and her cat?   Screens are about 6 months old. Toons are 10 and 9.5 yrs old.

Hit it. Nice video! Best of luck to your friend.   This kind of bullshit talk has been ongoing on wing-nut blogs and infowars for weeks now. Not surprised some christian taliban preacher is preaching it in public.            The reality is that this is just how many hospitals negotiate pricing against institutional payers like insurance companies. They set the price absurdly high and then make the insurance companies negotiate them down.  As opposed to every other 1st world country on earth which makes pharm companies bid against each other for lowest cost.   Friend in the UK had double knee replacement surgery. Total cost: 10 equivalent US dollars- because he went over the 150 per year pharmaceutical limit. Of course medications are about 20% of what Americans pay because the government bids on pharm costs.      Just posted this - head's up for southern ND northern SD. https://twitter.com/reedtimmerTVN/status/622132878713966592/photo/1      Here is a very good, quick explanation as to why. https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   Hmm.. I don't see any adverts on the video. Maybe my Ad Block is blocking them.   If you read the sticky you will see that we have posted storm warnings that have actually assisted people in taking cover or warning relatives. We try to stay on top of events such as PDS (Particularly Dangerous Situation) NWS Warnings for tornado outbreaks and post these ahead of time. [Here is a sample of one that was also xposted to the regional areas it was affecting](https://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/23rgt5/significant_multiday_severe_event_expected_across/?). Otherwise we archive the after storm story.   I just happened to be following Dan Gottshalks twitter feed last night on his chase and caught that when it was posted, so popped the link in here.  Tornados are not exceptional in Ill, but it is late in the season and it kind of caught the NWS by surprise with only a 2% chance that day of tornados in the area.    From Dans Twitter feed https://twitter.com/dangottschalk            Arial, Trebuchet, Comic Sans and Cambria all on one page. I didn't think it was humanly possible.   edit: oh shit I missed the Tahoma for the links that actually end halfway across the page in the drop-down box.    You have a nice portfolio with a great range of subject matter.  Tip: I wouldn't bother to try to get a good critique from this sub on my dogs most recent clip, frankly.   Karmic even.   The grandmother, Willa Mae Pennington, was found dead on Tuesday among debris from the familys shattered *mobile homes*,  Some of the images were of Modular Homes. Slightly different. They are brought to the building site in parts and built on site on a foundation as opposed to being towed to a site whole and set up on blocks like a mobile.    You don't need to generally as I treat those posts like cockroaches. Boom-gone. We are, as a general rule, archiving events.      There probably is on Youtube by now. Feel free to post one if you find it.         The massive fire is also threatening two major oil sand projects in Saskatchewan.                              Sure enough and thanks! Mods on here are great :)   If you are just talking about numbers, 11 Tropical Cyclones in Nine Weeks is a record. I agree that they get a little click-baity and I don't like the format of the website, but they actually don't broadcast all of the extreme weather events happening now. If they did it would look like the Apocalypse Channel.   **For new members and a reminder to our veterans:**  /r/StormComing is simply this: an Archive of Earth Changing Disasters and Events, manmade or natural. It's not a place for HAARPtards, Climate Change Deniers, Flat-Earthers, or Eschatology/Rapturists to post theorems. And as we want to attract sane, logical redditors, we don't want to hear about how radiation is good for everyone.  #3232;_ #3232;  This sub is best read using 'new' rather than 'hot' or 'top' as it is an archive of events. If you want to add an Earth-changing or disaster story from the news or reliable source, please do. Since headline writers often fail, feel free to editorialize titles to fill in important details from the story- especially the location.  We have already heard from someone who saw a flash flood forecast here that saved them from swimming home from work. Other redditors have been alerted to Tornado Outbreaks and took safety precautions. So we feel we are fulfilling the purpose of the sub.  As /r/StormComing is an archive of events, there is nothing subjective about it. Downvoting anything here would be as stupid as downvoting an encyclopedia entry.  Feel free to x-post to other reddits, especially reddits that are geographically related to the area the event or warning concerns. Please insert the np when doing so. As in www.*np*.reddit.com/r/StormComing.blah.blah in the referral link back to /r/StormComing.  **About Flair:**  Huge thanks to kooldawgstar for developing our flair system.

Thank you! And if you have any great ideas about the sub and what we can do to improve it- we would love to hear from you.            I have heard that comparison, and this is why it is bullshit:   Video games *do not* actively encourage real-life, hostile behavior toward a minority segment of society by real human beings sitting in positions of acting authority.   If you have ever been to a white supremacist website you will see constant, active discussions about how certain races need to be eradicated because they are 'dangerous' to the rest of polite society.   To a young, impressionable or susceptible person lurking on these sites it could seem as if the majority of people, including people in leadership, feel this way and that by taking the sort of action the shooter took that he would be hailed as a hero.  This is not comparable to 'violent video games' in the slightest.   Time is money, friends!   Roof said explicitly in his manifesto that he was not raised racist and he 'woke up' after discovering a white supremacist website online.  So basically he would not have found the sanction and encouragement to be as racist as he became - racist enough to go on a shooting spree.  What the hell can I say? It's a fucking shame, but it's a fact.  The real question is whether or not Reddit is willing to host the sort of 'free speech' that can lead to an event such as this. What would happen to Reddit if the kid had mentioned /r/coontown for having been an influence? Can you even imagine?  There is no debate in Germany, Italy or France. They have had experience with this that lead to a World War and the genocide of millions. Hate sites are banned in those countries. I can't judge them for that, knowing their history.     A farmer was riding his donkey one day and upon reaching the river the donkey planted his feet and would not enter. The farmer cursed and kicked the donkey and it still would not enter. Finally the farmer leaped to the ground and shot the donkey in the head.  The farmer, still cursing the donkey, strode boldly into the river ... and was attacked and eaten by a million piraa.

If so are they now in Burkas -under slavery in some miserable patriarchal, theocratic hellhole?   These were from the 1960's. The 1950's until the Russians invaded and then the Beardy Men took over were a renaissance for Afghanistan.  During the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the government of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) reformed the education system; education was stressed for both sexes, and widespread literacy programmes were set up. By 1978, women made up 40 percent of the doctors and 60 percent of the teachers at Kabul University; 440,000 female students were enrolled in educational institutions and 80,000 more in literacy programs.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Afghanistan   Europeans went from basically living in mud huts to developing the great architectural marvels after contact with the middle east during the Crusades.

God bless 'em. Every one.    I thought it was really interesting. Not sure why someone apparently didn't like the article?    Aquarist for 45 years. Was in the fish industry - wholesale and retail for nearly 20 of them. I have always let spot algae (if it grew) grow on my back glass and sometimes end sides of my tanks (if the tank were in a wall). I also let it grow on my driftwood and rocks to a degree if it showed up. I have never had an issue with this and it provides Ottos   Amanos a regular diet. I have also not had an issue of it 'transferring' to healthy plants. I think it provides a more natural microbiota in the tank and lends a more natural look until it runs it's course.  But that's just my experience.   Probably 7.5. Alkaline but not outrageous. Add driftwood to help bring it down a little. I would say try the magnesium treatment with epsom salts. You never said how old your tank is.  Edit: in case you are interested- here is a [paper](http://plantcellbiology.masters.grkraj.org/html/Plant_Cellular_Physiology4-Absorption_Of_Mineral_Nutrients.htm) on effect of ph on plant nutrient uptake:  The degree of ionization of minerals and other nutrients depends upon the hydrogen ion concentration of the soil solution.  For example, most of the phosphate ions, at alkaline pH exist either as bivalent H3PO4 ions or trivalent H3PO4 ions.  Such ions are not favored for absorption.  On the other hand neutral pH favors the absorption of monovalent ions.  So the soil pH has a significant effect not only on the rate but also the kind of ions uptake.

Myself and some others started a letter writing campaign along with hitting their twitter/social media hard and they reversed the decision.   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/last-task-after-layoff-at-disney-train-foreign-replacements.html?_r=0   This is why in the US we have regulations, however much the corporations bitch and moan about it.                  Ordered- and thanks!   Hi Ned. I was friends with Lisa Levy's father so I feel a bit of a 'kinship' to Bundy victims/families in an odd way.  Curious though, do you have any pictures of your mother or any other information on the case that hasn't already been publicized repeatedly?      It was from an NOAA slide show presentation. And those were the words used.    The only one I know of is someone who compiles events into a video once a month or so- but he is rather hit and miss. He is skilled at what he does, however it is a bit tinged with 'end times' flavor. Not overly religious, though. His last compilation video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qolE0l71fRQ   This is a great compilation- thank you for this.    Despite strong economic growth in recent years, roughly one quarter of the Philippines' 100 million people still live on less than one dollar a day, and giant slums dominate all major cities.  Just a reminder that most of the time 'strong economic growth' means that some bastards are getting ultra rich at the expense of the majority.    If your fish are fine your ph should be within range. But if it is off and the fish have just adjusted it could cause the plants difficulty in uptake of nutrients. Also, if they are magnesium deficient they will have trouble taking up nutrients. I am leaning toward this.   Start with a half teaspoon of pure epsom salts per 20g. Get the kind that you can use as a laxative as it has no scents/chemicals.   See how they look in a week.    In 20 years working in the fish industry I always heard of people who successfully kept goldfish for 20 years in a 10 gallon or never, ever did water changes, etc etc. Even if those things were true they were the equivalent of turning water into wine.   Crayfish are fast, nocturnal carnivores who live on small fish.  Bettas are lazy, bright colored, slow swimmers who have a habit of sleeping at the bottom of the tank at night.   You tell me.    Stick a [castle](http://imgur.com/a/oDOUG) in it. :D   These people will figure out one day that they are on the internet and crap-ass service like this gets around quick.   I [dose this with Flourish and liquid Iron](http://imgur.com/a/wwc9i) about once a month and use under gravel tabs twice a year under the root feeders- other than that the fish take care of it all. The only thing I have put in that didn't do well was some eleocharis that I added from our stream. It's all pretty low care plants.   What is your lighting and what are the plants on the right? What are you doing for trace elements? How long has it been set up? What are your parameters, ph etc?   I just popped in here to say this. Someone sprayed something or put hands or tools in the tank with toxins on it.   Always turn off your pumps, filters and throw a cover over the tank when doing any kind of spraying- even furniture dusting. If it is for bugs- repellent or killer - seal the cover with tape. I used to use yard size garbage bags for this.   Absolutely have to have cory's in a school. That's not a lifestyle choice with cory's, it's a necessity.   The 'pinning' himself -hiding behavior is a stress response to being alone.    Dead on. And I would add to vacuum the gravel well every few days for a couple of weeks- doing a 10 to 20 percent water change each time. Get those little bastards out of there before they hatch and start a new cycle.   Every tank on earth probably has ich, whether your fish gets it or not is dependent on their stress level.    Kind of like asking "How big of an enclosure can I keep this lion and gazelle together in?"   Congratulations. They can be incredibly difficult keepers.   It's more like tattooing. Never buy artificially colored fish please.   You can always put a half teaspoon per 10g of pure Epsom Salts - and the magnesium will be good for the plants. Just make sure and dose according to the actual amount of water in the tank - not by the tank dimensions. And /u/longlostbleu is correct with the Malefix also.   Khadgar   A Prayer for Owen Meany- John Irving  The last paragraph utterly crushed me and the last line was like a spike through my flattened remains. I would spontaneously burst into tears for days after finishing the novel.  The Lovely Bones- Alice Sebold     Those clouds gathered and turned into a hella storm up at the lake today.   Just don't let him go to Toronto.   No, they don't destroy brick and concrete structures as easily as wood and plasterboard. The EF rating system for Tornados is developed around the type of home or building that is destroyed and the level of destruction. Tornados that destroy brick or block structures are of a higher rating on the 1 to 5 scale than those that destroy frame homes.   I lived through the '74 SuperOutbreak, have been a chaser and I have been through a few Hurricanes. You can always tell the wood built homes after an EF5 because those are the ones with scrubbed foundations.   The long term after-effects of dealing with the standard wood frame, drywall and fiber insulation is also much worse than a block or brick home. When it is ground up into dust size particles it causes ['Tornado Cough' as a very long term after effect.](http://kfor.com/2013/06/19/tornado-cough-threatening-families-in-devastated-areas/)   I lived through the eye of Opal in my Florida 'hurricane' house built in the 1950's of cement block with terrazzo floor and a cement and gravel roof.  A new neighborhood 2 blocks away from my house was built with wood and shingle homes. The destruction there was incredible. There was basically no destruction in our neighborhood besides someone who lost a garage door and a few overhang awnings that ended up in a golf course.   	206
       Is she a grumpy big kid?   Yeah and I agree, these videos are awesome! It does seem simple so it's cool to see how producers tweak their samples to get the sound they want. Those samples were pitched up 6/10 of a semitone.      What's the story?      Yeah and I agree, why not just hand the sub over to someone else?    pretty mental huh   I've heard it's a bad sign when a dog starts doing that "I'll bite you but I'm not really biting you" thing. It's them testing to see if they can put part of Little Billy in their mouths and get away with it.  Convoluted but - I knew a guy who's Nan had a friend that had a big dog and it started doing this to the new baby. Not really a bite, just putting its mouth around the baby's hands and feet. They walked in the room once and the dog had the baby's arm in its mouth, somehow they thought nothing of it. Next day, the dog mauled the poor bab's face off.     Edit: punctuation   Thanks for the correction, it makes sense that there wasn't a year 0   91 minutes and 37 seconds is in the 92nd minute of the game. The first minute of the game is from 0-1minute.  Kind of how the years 1900-1999 are the 20th century. I hope that makes any sense.      Orcas are dolphins   When people are cleaning their teeth, there's hardly any foam and they don't spit or rinse. They're scrubbing away and then they swallow and that's it.

He created a marketable brand, then he hired a hot girl to follow other hot girls on Instagram and offer free samples. Rinse and repeat.   It's a numbers game and I'm making it sound easy but social media is a really useful tool for marketing beauty products, especially if the customer uses the body scrub as part of their daily routine.   I used to have recurring nightmares about this kind of stuff   Yeah they get taken down and re-uploaded.   Ahh, I thought I recognised the name. It's interesting what you say about them helping to drag you out of a sad mood, they do the same for me, I guess it's a comfort thing.

That's my observation, I'm not saying this is good or bad.

    Good reporting. I wish more American journalists were as on the ball as this one.   Definitely hit this place: [Il Gelato Di Carlotta ](http://www.yelp.com/biz/il-gelato-di-carlotta-niagara-on-the-lake-2). I've been working my way through their flavors for a while now and have yet to have one that isn't amazing.   So I take it he couldn't understand when his losing competitor told him: "Va chier!" ?   Great track.            I debated whether or not to post it here but figure it just about squeezes into a broad definition of psych if for no other reason than because of the Book of Revelations mention! The echo and fuzz bass works for me too.                  The problem with this theory is that it gives the Democrats way too much credit. I don't think they're smart enough to hatch such a scheme.   Agreed.         You mean if Yuan to know?            Communism as it has come to be known - identified with a heavy state apparatus - I agree that form of Communism is incompatible with what I understand Anarchism to be. But the original conception of communism in literature like Bakunin is much less contradictory. Basically, given the freedom to choose how people want to live their lives, they will tend to gravitate towards a loose collectivism. There are many ways this can manifest, from unions to communes and even to corporations in some models. So I don't think we necessarily disagree on our aims so much as on terms and how they're understood.   This is my chance! Skynet ends here!      Or because Google maps had them so hopelessly lost that they had begun to enter into a blind panic.                  Jog on with your anti-Jewish bullshit. I'm not interested. That wasn't the point of my post and I don't appreciate you trying to turn it into some Jew hating thread.   Your point?   Good night.   But surely something in your past experience has led you to this conclusion. Something has contributed to this sense that Chris Hedges is Libertarian. I'd love it if you could share that wonderful wealth of experience that has brought you to this moment in your intellectual journey. I might benefit from your insights.   Maybe one or two other places. Just maybe.       Sure. Which ones?    No. I wasn't getting an argument started about who is or isn't a liberal. My question is quite literal: which of Chris Hedges's ideas do you feel come from libertarian think tanks. I am genuinely interested.    Which ideas of his in particular do you think come from libertarian think tanks. I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.   I wouldn't call him libertarian in the way the word is used in the US. I would call him more an anti-authoritarian.                  Here's a list of raids and seizures and other forms of suppression for mostly energy technology: http://www.cco.net/~trufax/online/11/energy2.html  Plus this website: [Directory:Suppression](http://peswiki.com/index.php/Directory:Suppression)  And a couple of books, 1) [Energy Invention Suppression Cases ](http://www.theorionproject.org/en/documents/Gary_V.pdf) and   2) The Hunt for Zero Point is a good read. I think some of it may be exaggerated but a lot of tremendous and verifiable info comes out. It was written by Nick Cook who was a writer for Jane's Defense Weekly. I suspect a bit of disinfo came his way but he also did a great deal of legwork on that book. Here's a link: [The Hunt for Zero Point](http://vielewelten.at/pdf_en/the%20hunt%20for%20zero%20point.pdf)  Get into Tesla and research centered around his work and very soon you will find scientists and inventors who have extremely disturbing tales of their equipment being seized by "government officials".   An early example of this suppression is [Thomas Townsend Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown) whose work with ionic propulsion lifters was suppressed through different means. Another article on him: [Antigravity on the Rocks - The T. T. Brown Story ](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/supressed_inventions/suppressed_inventions25.htm) And of course the lifters themselves: [lifters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF8otSSPgdA). These devices are common at science fairs but it is hotly debated what is causing them to work. Some claim it is an example of "ionic wind" while others claim it is a form of anti-gravity. I have no idea though there are reasons why it might not be ionic wind lifting these contraptions.   Divide and conquer still works a treat.   She's definitely not against posing nude. I think she said she's against being pressured to pose nude so others could profit off of it. I don't think her website is for profit. It's actually an interesting site talking about body image. I like her, she has a lot of guts.      There likely is a great deal of pressure behind the scenes from the Americans. I think there is a lot of ambivalence about the US military's presence in Japan. Okinawa regularly has strong protests against the bases there.    The culture of non-aggression is still extremely strong amongst the Japanese people, they have absolutely no appetite - aside from a small minority of right wing nationalists - for any move to expand their defense operations outside of Japan. Japanese politicians have been trying to become more active internationally for years including sending a token number of soldiers to Iraq. Each time the Japanese people have pushed back.       This one's pretty good too: [Kennedy at American University 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41xJiEPuAhg)   What ever happened to rabble rousers? No one ever seems to get called that anymore.         It jumped the shark for me when it went to glossy. I miss the old newspaper style.   I've always wanted to see one in the wild. In case you missed this, a Pine Marten got loose during a soccer game last year in Switzerland biting one of the players: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5CholqTZ3Q      I should have known you watched Game of Thrones from the pikes reference. It's seeping into your political consciousness.   No probz. Silicon Valley is one of the best things in years. Mike Judge does it, same guy who did Office Space. And if you can't afford HBO, try Kodi and use an addon called Genesis. That'll sort you out.   Oh I've come across so many references and stories about government operatives showing up at people's homes, businesses, and research labs in order to seize tech they were developing.    They could try [Middle Out Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFYy3oEnzVg)!   It certainly works for me! We might run out of pikes though.   Haven't seen that in years. It still makes me laugh!   I think they're more effective than it seems on TV. They have a huge influence on what politicians feel able to do or no do. The main weapon for any group that is agitating against a government or military is its power to organize. The Greeks on both sides are highly organized in ways Americans in both the Tea Party and Occupy were not. It's not really about tactics so much as strategy.   Don't know about guns, but lots of Molotov cocktails as well as bricks and rocks. There are two camps leading the charge in Greece, the extreme right called the Golden Dawn who are anti-immigrant and the extreme left who are Anarchist. What spices things up is the fact that ordinary people and a lot of pensioners get involved in the fighting. And I mean fighting, not photo ops or whatever. This stuff is intense. A good site for looking at Anarchist tactics including the infamous Black Block  is subMedia from Montreal where they have been and still are extremely active (Warning: link is for an Anarchist site that advocates some level of street violence): http://www.submedia.tv/stimulator/#   I'm inclined to agree. Private industry has a history of buying up promising technology and sitting on it.   It doesn't allow a range of articles that discuss topics in a deep way. It separates out analysis and that means their definition of news only allows for immediate, superficial readings of the news. An article about poverty isn't allowed because it is considered "opinion" but it is very hard to have an article that conforms to their standards and rules that tells the story of poverty. You can say that other subs allow for opinion or analysis, but in reality, no one goes to those. This is a form of systemic censorship. Plus they absolutely do censor some topics such as articles about new findings regarding glyophosphates or articles arguing against vaccinations even if these conform to the rules of worldnews.   That's interesting. Watched a documentary called Berkeley in the Sixties that said the school was pretty conservative before students became active in the Civil Rights movement. The response of UC Davis students a few years ago after the pepper spray incident against student protestors reminded me a bit of the Free Speech Movement. Brilliant response, they lined the route from the chancellor's office to her car and stood quietly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8775ZmNGFY8   I'm interested in that and Voat, but I hate to think we all get isolated on the dying internet from the majority of people who rarely get to hear alternative explanations of how the world works. Every now and then, someone stumbles in here and has a kind "What's happening here?" kind of reaction. That's why I'm still coming onto reddit. That and the shills who are - aside from everything else - highly entertaining.   Sorry Father for I have sinned. I haven't had my dinner yet.   People getting their news from those subs aren't exposed to any kind of meaningful analysis or alternative voices simply because they decided to separate those articles into a separate section which no one goes to. It keeps everyone trapped in the immediate present which is a kind of prison.   I'm actually optimistic  - uncharacteristically for me - about clean energy technology in the pipeline. Who knows, it just might work. One day we might even get nostalgic for smog.   We had a disagreement over what should constitute "news". I kept reposting. They kept deleting it.  I'm sick of them, they basically only allow sensationalistic stories about car bombs interspersed with asshole politicians shaking hands. The news on reddit is mind numbing once you leave Conspiracy.   Oil's old hat. Nowadays it's all about water.      Yes, it definitely is driven by systemic factors. The publishing industry dumbed down as it became driven by the profit motive which happened because of consolidation by corporations of the traditional, much more experimental publishing houses. The problem for publishing and for anyone at all intellectual is that this has created a reality where people are no longer able to think as deeply as before. For example, I liked a lot of the kids at Occupy Wall Street but found very few of them could articulate the deeper issues plaguing society. Compare that to a protestor from the sixties like Mario Savio who was just immensely articulate, giving the speech on top of a police car in Berkeley where he said: "There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!"   Spot on. That's why I posted this as news. She's not just a musician bitching about other famous people. She has always had integrity and deserves respect. She threw out her career by doing that protest.   I doubt it! Somehow I don't think this is the secret to longevity: not avoiding smoking but starting REALLY early.   I would but they just banned me 30 minutes ago!   Great article about her if anyone is interested: [Baby Peggy](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/23/i-spent-most-of-my-life-as-a-nobody-the-last-of-the-silent-movie-stars)            Good point. I guess the question is what is the primary objective of the people who run this place, profit or disinformation? I keep posting this link because I want as many people to see it and be aware as possible: [Alexis and Stratfor](https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=282044)   I don't know. I've just come across it myself.   Exactly. They can censor the crap out of this place by messing with the algorithm and making us completely isolated. They don't have to have a big stand off out in the open, they'll just watch us bleed to death. It's absurd how much reddit has been carved up and its components segregated from one another. This disturbs me more than anything, it's the new model of censorship.    I think what they'll do is try to force policy changes thus sucking the life out of the sub. Probably it will be a slow death over a few years. It already feels like a "free speech zone" where we can exercise our Constitutional rights safely out of view of people who might be offended by that.         Agreed. People my age had it good with music. It's still out there if people dig for it, but mainstream culture is pretty dire.   I wouldn't be 100% sure about that. I think the people who run reddit are now making some draconian decisions which are guided entirely by profitability. They simply don't care about free speech. They aren't interested in fostering any kind of community or encouraging enlightened discourse. The people at the top are greedy, Machievellian schmucks.         No, this is the woman who tore a picture of the Pope in order to protest pedophilia in the church. She destroyed her chances of appearing on TV again so she could stand up for her beliefs on a massive, sickening issue. As opposed to trying to grovel for more press attention. Some people are media whores, and other people are heroes who have immense moral strength.    I haven't cared about Rolling Stone since Lester Bangs died.        	100
 We only serve tongue.  Do you like tongue, boys?   I just started reading Wool Omnibus Edition yesterday but really picked it up this afternoon.  It had been in my Kindle queue for a while and I travelled a bit recently so ended up grabbing it.  Talk about a roller coaster.  I'm not sure I can continue reading it.  Not sure if I'm hormonal right now but the first 60 pages had me bawling my eyes out.  Never had this reaction to literature before.  Ugh.  *deep breaths*   I believe it was a Power Computing Powerbase 180 (during the brief period of Macintosh clones) in high school.   Sorry for potato quality.  Girlfriend's picture from this morning.      Took this just a minute ago from the 436 bus to Marble Arch.      Ha I was just there yesterday OMW south.      That's just good advice for life.   Ack!  Kill it with fire!   In four articles and two forum threads I found only a single mention that said the limits would be reevaluated at the end of the year but nothing guaranteeing that are not going to be continued...   Which is why over in r/bisexual we've take to using GSM for "Gender and Sexual Minorities".   You must've missed the bit in the last few days where they are instituting speed limits...the Green Hell is no more.   It's certainly possible that the FMVSS may have such a requirement.  Among others.  It might have requirements for side reflectors too that might not otherwise be met by the way the vehicle is configured.   Why do you say that?  I will however neither confirm nor deny your opinion.   It is a Dodge Challenger Hellcat.   Well I recall back when they introduced that they said they were similar but not identical.

You seem very angry - I'm guessing it was jealousy or frustration that drove what you wrote.  Becoming who you're meant to be takes time.  It's quite obvious OP did a ton of work over at least two years to get to where she is today.  You will get there too, but you need to apply a little more patience.

Next event - Northern VA Pride is on 03 October we'll probably have a group showing up (it's by Dulles).  Novapride.com   I don't think I got a good pic of it but there was a woman in the parade with a sign that read "The Bible said 'Adam   Eve' so I dated them both!"   No, I took the pic.  Several people myself including we're running up and asking about it and saying how it was awesome to see.  It was one of the very few bi pride flags we saw yesterday in DC (and the first of those that I did see).   http://i62.tinypic.com/a2aur7.gif   I learned something today that I wanted to share with you all.  When I was in college I was out and proud.  I knew I was gay and that was that.  Then I fell in love with a woman and thought maybe that wasn't that.  Since then, and this is nearly 13 years, I've dated men and women, and I've been single, but I've identified as bi.  I've been in and out of the "scene".  I've felt good and bad about myself, and I've been warm and cold when it comes to wanting friends.    Today I went to DC Pride and I feel like I recharged my batteries.  I've been neglecting a part of myself that used to be very important, and this subreddit and the people I've met through it have, really, brought me back to life.  So thanks.  And let your flag, freak or otherwise, fly.      There's a new lip spoiler option for the STi for '16 as well.   Disagree.  Grew up in CA; parents from Chicago.

So what you're saying is, he wants to run an honest campaign and suffer crushing defeat while maintaining his honor?  Good for him.  Not to be a pessimist or anything.   Someone who's been riding for only a month should not be on the internet offering advice to people who've never ridden.  I'm on my third bike; a 2011 CBR1000RR (prior bikes were a 2005 EX500R and a 2007 ZX6R).  I've been riding for almost 11 years and I still have a lot to learn.     Needs an "All right!"   The FA20DIT in the WRX is quite a different layout from our NA FA20...   Everybody wants to rule the world...   I'm sure just like you said it comes down to the prep work done on it :)   I understand.  These are all things you get used to though.  Left turns might get "harder" but right turns then get "easier".  Lane position for me was the hardest thing  to get used to.   Yeah, I saw that a while ago (I'm one of those people who follows him on Twitter after having seen many times, "You'd know this already if you followed me on Twitter").  To be fair though he was being pretty silly.  He could have just as easily parked the car rather than go through the drivethrough backwards.  He was being...Doug DeMuro.   I think just like anything else LHD vs. RHD is something that one can get used to given time.  I've driven many thousands of miles RHD while traipsing about the UK on travel; though they are obviously setup for that over there, as we colonials are setup for LHD.   See, that's funny...I don't find broccoli rabe bitter.  I get it on pizza sometimes at a place we like to go do.  Might have it tonight in fact.   I'm thinking of whatever the purple stuff is that comes on top of salads and in many off the shelf salad mixes.  Fairly confident that's a type of cabbage; just conferred with my girlfriend the foodie chef and she confirms.   It's more that the coils you're running increase the camber so much that the wheels get sucked under.  I run the same size spacers as you but I'm only on Swift springs and the wheels are just inside of perfectly flush.  Plus I can get out of my driveway ;)   I will caution too that I was very heavily warned away from using those types of mounts on my FR-S by the online community.  I ran one on my old C350 without issue but many people told me they'd experienced damage on our cars due to the lighter weight materials used.   What size tire are you running?  The combination looks much larger than stock.   Why convert to LHD?  RHD really isn't that hard.   So am I like the only person who consistently finds red cabbage incredibly bitter?   Agree.  OP, I'm not on the spectrum in the slightest so I can only imagine what it would have been like for you or your husband but just reading your description of the event made me never want to have be in that situation.   For some reason I'm unable to download any of the free video packs?  iPhone 6 Plus with latest iOS 8.whatever...   Yes the stereo in the FR-S is almost twice the power output of that in the BRZ.  The BRZ stereo system is terrible by comparison.  Lacks depth and clarity.   I want to learn ASL to conversational proficiency.   It's always a good idea to try things like paint/dip on something you don't care about before using them on something you do.  I tested the metallizer on one of the flat black dip caps I had lying around.  Really glad I did too.   I linked to my build thread in a different comment so I'll PM you rather than clutter up here further.  I will say it's subtle generally but very apparent in sunlight what I did.   Thanks!  I had wanted something different than the usual flat black.  The one hint I can offer is that the metallizer is like a must of metal particles - it can't really be sprayed in the same manner as normal dip.  I did three very quick swipes per wheel.  It also gets everywhere so if it's windy...Be prepared for your car to look like a faerie exploded nearby.   Erm.  Sourdough loaf.  *mic drop*   Is dank now a good thing?  I'm confused.   Nice truck.  My only criticism would be that it needs tires at least 2" wider, or, alternatively, wheel spacers.  The stance is really narrow and doesn't fit the off-road aesthetic.   Absolutely OFT is worth it even if totally stock.  Tuning is ALWAYS worth it.   Since you seem to be set against changing the exhaust you could always just change the tips.  They unscrew very easily from the stock exhaust.  Perrin makes some larger ones that go on the exhaust.  Won't affect any warranties whatsoever.   I have some pics in my build thread.  I have more that aren't online also.  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1793733   Looks good.  When I did mine I did the on the car method with trash bags to block off the brake rotors.  I did 5 coats of black, one coat of aluminum metallizer and two coats of glossifier (I was going for a satin finish gunmetal look and it turned out great).  I highly highly recommend the pistol grip attachment for spraying the dip.   Dipyourcar.com is a great source for tutorials.  It will last forever as long as it doesn't get damaged from curbing or something.   Tone deaf means an inability to carry a tune, not an inability to hear ;) The chirp is pretty high in frequency though so it's certainly possible a person might not be able to hear it due to hearing loss.   Another alternative is exhaust work.  I pretty much can't hear my crickets unless I'm alone in a parking lot which is pretty rare.   It is a very common theme for new or overconfident drivers of rear wheel drive vehicles to turn of traction and/or stability control and immediately wreck.   Yes, it sure does.  From my logged in account or on the app on my phone I can see individual mile times and it gives a profile at any given moment my pace etc.  However I've found on the IP6+ that Strava is kinda wonky.  I have been using MapMyWalk recently as it doesn't have any issues (nor do any other GPS apps I have; just Strava).   Your call.  I've seen lots of Mustang and WRX comparisons on a cost basis but they're never favorable from a driving dynamics perspective.  One quick example...Google has toooons more...  https://www.reddit.com/r/ft86/comments/2pzdwx/am_i_crazy_trade_in_2013_brz_for_2015_mustang_gt/  Oversteer isn't the only thing the 86 platform is capable of.       I don't hang with a "crowd".  Unless you consider my officemates a crowd.  I don't.  :)   Indeed.  https://www.strava.com/activities/162598901   I have to ask, do you own an FR-S/BRZ/86?  Because I don't think anyone who did and who had driven/owned a Mustang as well could honestly write the phrase "driving experience...similar to the FRS."   Ok class, what we've learned here is that only the bloggers at Jalopnik are actually capable of reading a press release.  Witness:  http://jalopnik.com/ford-will-license-its-electric-vehicle-patents-to-any-r-1707394876  "But Ford, unlike Tesla, isnt opening up the patents for free. You have to pay Ford to license them."   That guy saw the unicorn, I guarantee it.   Here's a more complete source vid than OP's GIFV:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xhbctEcAAA   Clearly not...No one was savagely murdered.   Not just that...Apparently nowadays it's even cool to be openly...INTELLIGENT.  Who knew?   "School aged kid" doesn't typically refer to college my man...   WTF is this nonsense, Dell customer support kindegarten?   Ah, Canada; that explains everything.  They are price competitive in the US (starting price of an EB 'Stang is $25.3K before TTL).  But they are ONLY *price* competitive.  Totally different vehicular experience, obviously.   Hey, Happy Fry-Day to you too.  Me, I'm looking forward my girlfriend returning home after being away for 17 days on the other side of the country.  It's only one trip a year but it sucks.  But then again it's sort of penance for her having to deal with my traveling once or twice a month, every month, for work.   Damn straight.  Er...you know what I mean. :D   You remind me of someone...  http://i253.photobucket.com/albums/hh61/w9ahmed/KnockKnockKnock.gif    mega-ultra-powerzord  Somebody's been rewatching MMPR...   Thirty is not the end of the line pal.  Yours is like the third post I've read in this subreddit this afternoon with an "I'm almost 30" in it...I turned 35 two weeks ago.  I can still fuck just fine, thank you very much.  Enjoy your open relationship, that's what you do next.   Companion, clearly.   The Ecoboost Mustang w/Performance Pack would be a much closer competitor than what you're speaking of...I've never even heard of a "Mustang Sport" before...They still weigh 1/3T more than our cars though on a good day.   Maybe something here can help?  http://www.unitedtty.com/store/notification-alerting_systems.html   Yeah..those would be the enthusiasts I was talking about.  Your average Joe Schmo on the street isn't learning how to install a header or switch to HIDs on a forum.  They're thinking about whether Walmart or Jiffy Lube has the better price on an oil change.   You know, that song, "I Kissed a Girl (and I Liked It)" came on Pride Radio the other day and I was listening to it and it's not a very positive song as these things go...Yes, I'm taking these lines out of context but still:  "I kissed a girl just to try it...It felt so wrong..." "It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave."  It's not wrong, it has nothing to do with being good or bad...I know that in the context of the song she's talking about it being "taboo" but still.   You would be correct.  But you should celebrate yourself every day, suge.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrate_Bisexuality_Day   Ugh why did Snooki have to be on that list.  Just...ew.   Eight and a half years?  Wow dude (I'm assuming dude).  That's a long time to keep a secret.  You were probably all psyched up for one or two different potential mind blowing reactions and when she was just "that's nice dear, I love you; please pass the salt" you didn't know what to do with yourself.  Props for finally being honest with the person you share your life with though.  They're always the hardest when they ought to be the easiest.  Funny huh?  I made it a point a long time ago to basically "come out" on the first date...My current (and likely final; going to follow Beyonc's advice one of these days...) girlfriend embraces it completely.  Hell - she'd watch if I'd let her (not that we have an open relationship nor do I believe in that sort of thing but it's a fantasy of hers).  And hey, if you can be someone's fantasy then that's pretty awesome ;)   I have it on good authority that this is also OP's girlfriend.  http://i.imgur.com/51GblBl.gif   YES!!! I actually made a forum post about this years ago (before there was a reddit) and no one knew what I was talking about.  I have experienced this for years - actually, as long as I can remember.  It's like someone flips a switch and that ear is deaf - which is why the tinnitus sounds so loud suddenly (that's why the tinnitus gets loud - because it's always partially masked by environmental sounds).  For me it can happen in either ear and it usually happens several times a week.  Sometimes more often.  Doesn't seem to relate to anything in my life - diet, exercise, stress, etc.   Basically it wasn't an apology.  They were saying they were trying to help people who need hearing aids but don't wear them "because of the stigma" by perpetuating the stigma.  They are douchebags...That's all I have to say.  	103
 https://youtu.be/YfchQpxeGyo  yeah go ahead and laugh, also before anyone breaks out the attacks, i'd like to point out i enjoyed ant-man, it was very charming.   for me it was star trek   whats wrong with my train_subject5580 viewing order     whats wrong with my train_subject5580 viewing order      take them to the theater   every star wars   You underestimate my power!   How do you mean? And btw our flair is relevant to each other      so if this is a tv movie, technically it shouldnt even be on r/movies, it should be on r/television   Start with episode XIII and make XIV, and XV, so that way makers of a fifth trilogy will have the challenge of making episode X-XII, think about it, george Lucas had a blank slate for the prequel trilogy, he just had to make the ending tie into the beginning of the original trilogy, what I'm saying here is to link together both a hypothetical episode X to a hypothetical episode XIII   EDIT: that is, what does it look like with no rain?   just wondering   they might be on to something      for example  in the star wars prequel trilogy theres more lightsabers  in the flintstones in viva rock vegas theres more of those shells they use for currency  and in monsters university theres more of those scream canisters  anyone think theres a connection, or am i just mental?   deleted scenes you say? the same person who deleted all referances to lasagna probably deleted that one scene from episode 3 where yoda starts his exile to dagobah      i think IT is known as a "mummy dressed as snow white"   what do you mean "too much"?   ''just like'' isnt something to judge someones opinion over, if you read professional critic reviews, clearly they enjoy them, also think about the insults the cast gets everyday, chris pine getting called wooden, zach quinto getting called homophobic slurs, and zoe saldana getting called a slut. you can not stop me from enjoying them dont even try!!! you can respond back to me but dont talk me out of not enjoying them!   i just like the cinematography, tthe cast and i like the sense of wonder, so unlike you im able to enjoy a movie, i dare you to top that   i like it for every reason it gets criticised, so my review would be the polar opposite of a haters review   I'm saying that they did   im only asking because im hoping that disney doesnt change the movies any further. and if they do they should put in that new fanfare for the lucasfilm logo. but keep the movies otherwise the same as the blu rays that came before   you know its funny, i tell people that the reboot cast gets persecuted everyday, implying they should sympathize with them. im worried that zach quinto gets called homophobic slurs, and zoe saldana gets called sexist things like 'slut' and 'whore'. and chris pine gets called names im sure but i dont know what   im not going to even bother anymore   har har har, lensflare joke, you mustve spent alot of time coming up with that, you should audition for SNL, youll be the next eddie murphy      ever since i saw this snl skit back in 2009, i was freaking phsyched to see the new reboot, and then this snl skit came and shat on my excitement:  http://www.traileraddict.com/star-trek-xi/snl-weekend-update  now after i actually saw the movie, ive been saying to reboot haters that i hate them, i wish they were all dead etc. etc. but now im thinking its not worth it, ill never convince the haters to stop hating the star trek reboots, i am literally sobbing at my defeat! ive told haters about the rave reviews, jj abrams charity work, NOTHING, they still hate the reboots. every attempt ive made to convert the haters FAILED!!   you know the drill, im sick of hearing the criticisms, yada yada yada   also jj no being a fan has nothing to do with the quality of the movie, i dont care that he likes star wars more, i am trying to keep reboot haters like you persecuting us reboot fans!   this proves my point that reboot haters will never change, i bet you and your wife will conceive a reboot haterling, and raise him to be a hater just like you,    obviously you dont read **professional** critic reviews, and clearly the majority of **PROFESSIONAL** CRITICS, enjoy it, and seeing as youre not a professional critic yourself your criticism means nothing to me, ill continue to enjoy it along with other fans, and you can do nothing to stop us, i speak for reboot fans   all the reboot haters will hate it regardless if a fan writes it or not. ever since 2009 ive been telling the haters that it was good and i like it, and ive been seen as a bully, they should be kissing their asses!!! they saved their franchise!!!! i swear to god if i hear ONE MORE TIME that it doesnt follow gene roddenberrys utopian vision of the future i will scream and commit suicide!! thats right i hate reboot star trek criticism THAT much. they will probably never change!!! theyll marry other rboot haters, have children and raise them to hate the reboots then we'll have anothergeneration of reboot haters!! ITS FUCKING BULLSHIT!!!!! i just wnt people to be grateful, but nooo the reboot haters are too busy wishing they couldve sucked leonard nimoys geriatric cock before he died. i hate star trek reboot haters, hate them hate them HATE THEM, i hate the parents who birthed them and the children theyll raise!!! i would read trekkers reviews but i prefer going to professional critics (you know people who go to movies nearly daily) oh god if all reboot haters died of cancer that would be so awesome. i mean look at this video! and youll see who REALLY doesnt get star trek (hint:it isnt jj abrams or bob orci)  https://youtu.be/YRWUeUK6kKQ  there! now you see that jj has a heart, which is an alien concept to reboot haters. im sick of hearing criticism about the writing, im sick of hearing criticism about the cast, im sick of criticism of jj abrams!!!! so bottom line if you dont like it, why didnt they come to YOU to make it, so fuck all reboot haters to damnation of mankind!! i like the reboots DEAL WITH IT!!! i liked the stories, i liked the new look, and i liked the cast. oh god that would be so awesome if star trek reboot criticism was outlawed and made illegal. i would be so happy!   same here,    oh god that singer, after that barney the dinosaur one that was it for me, ive seen enough. and then the catdog video comes around, and im like "holy fuck, no! they didnt," it was one of my favorite cartoons of all time, and that inspired me to make this post, to check to see if my fears were confirmed, and since they are i havnt a reason to watch it, i have a feeling there will be a day, like i swore to myself that id never see the human centipede (the first one) and low and behold me and my parents watched it together. ill never see the next two human centipede movies, just like ill never watch the scientifically accurate catdog video (i hope)   thats one of my favorite anime episodes   uuuuhhhh yeah im not watching this video then   what does "technically yes" mean?   this not a fun time for train_subject5580   Does powerline have Marfan syndrome? Because he lacks meat on those bones, and he's unusually taller than most other characters in the movie.   That's a bummer, he was a good actor too   for me it was star wars   man, i SERIOUSLY need to check legends more often   besides podracing, i know in episode 2 when obi-wan ran into that 'sports cantina' i guess ill call it. there were sports playing on the screens, i just never learned the names of said televised sports, and i would love to know their names   darth maul looks good with his beard   i just got served  	49

 Is this the story which 60+ people have fainted while reading?   Finished Filth by Irvine Welsh the other night. The ending was just so upsetting that I threw the book across the room and screamed for a bit. Was wondering if anyone had any similar experiences?   I hate when people do this with their sadness.    Thank you for feedback. It does need work with the structure, just finding that very difficult.    Safety First   They call me the rubber and sawdust man.   Traveling place to place doing whatever it is I can:   fencing off bodies of water,   packing street holes with sand,   spend weeks of summer concreting uneven land.        I have fought them all,    every last one:   houses with asbestos walls,    schools that let kids burn in the sun,   dogs waiting to maul,    a cell phone in each pocket to report hit and runs   Safety is my call.   From peanuts to guns.     That day and all days after,   I have vowed to protect the children of the earth.   All children, all races, always,   from neighbourhood watch to restricted flag surf.   I have tried to make this world safe,   devoted life, to protect life's worth.   On the day of my first date with a beautiful nurse,    who worked in proofing birth,       I blunted the edges of my shoes,    avoided the kiss because of bacteria.   I now had an ally, though we were set to lose,    never to remove fat from cafeterias.   Together we battled those adventure cruises,    fought the thumbtack hysteria,   voted for the ban of stiletto shoes,    at the airport handed out pamphlets regarding malaria.       Together we fought the danger,   and love did grow.   When we intervened with drug takers,    she confessed her heart a seed to sow.   At an adult swim class, I told her I loved her.    She replied "I know."   We went to a secular, indoor wedding planner.   Picked spring to avoid heat and snow.       In a beautiful, bubble wrapped dress,   she walked down the aisle.   I opted for a life jacket with a double breast,    over suit and tie.   The flower girl, flowerless, deciding to avoid that mess,    just held the tail, as we were blessed.   And walked down that one third,    a half, a quarter mile.      Three days after our wedding communion,   she died in her sleep.   There was no preparation.    Just an aneurysm.   Just a canyon of spontaneous grief.       http://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/372jkx/the_burden_of_smiling/ http://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/372b8s/platitudes/   Thanks.

 Boothworld Industries. The moral? Don't call Boothworld Industries.   From what I've read, yes.

Reading through these comments, I feel I have found my people.   Yea, I gave up a long time ago as well, it makes laundry easier too! It's like gettin two birds stoned at once.   If you watch the very first movie, it kinda explains that every fighter in Mortal Kombat has a superhuman ability, that gets intensified multiple times over when they enter Outworld and the Tournament. So in this theory I would assume it would increase their ability to take more devastating hits and as you said, until they lose the will to continue fighting.    Can we all collectively pick a day soon and everyone just bomb 4Chan with useful things such as knowledge and whatnot? Literally take it over, because all day today it was shit talk on Redditors how we can't take a site over if we wanted. We can, and we will.    Let's do it.

    It's not from Mommy Dearest LOL.    saaame. i want to watch this... whatever the fuck it is.... but i've been googling for like an hour and was hoping somebody here would know... please for the love of god I need to see this scene in context!   Interstellar is a terrible movie and those who think otherwise are just plain stupid.      Human Centipede 3.. no joke...    me... just like... great shia.. do you... ur not interesting.    he single handedly ruined nymphomaniac   he gettin paid   Did you think Flash Gordon was some sort of cinematic abomination from watching the film Ted? Also, The Neighbors is pure genius.       it wont be this good...   so he gets HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHA? lame   lollll   Me too.    [spoilers] Highlight in #4: When Warwick emerges from the space guy's Penis and flies across the room you can vividly see his string. I always thought that was hilarious. #4 is secretly the gem of this incredibly genius series.   That was the scaredest I've been by media in years! Kudos!   Pure genius.    FUCK YAAAAA   bless the all    YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!   mank   I wish this was a movie... Ugh.. It's just a short film.   haha thanks... i'll try my best :)    best looking scotch eggs i've ever seen  like holy fuck... i've eaten a lot of delicious food in my life. it looks like youve made yourself a mustard sauce as well and it looks fucking bomb as fuck too. kudos sir. kudos. i bet you're an amazing chef.    ive seen tommy drinking this on several occasions   http://www.hansens.com/uploads_image/2013/03/04/1362428048-blueskyblueenergy16oz.jpg   Genius.    It sounds aweeeeeeeesome.    Wow what is Beyond the Door? Looks awesome.   video must be of the mods. i usually come to these to laugh in a so bad its good tim and eric come to life kind of way but holy fuck that was cringe worthy.      *rolls eyes*... You're right. I should just be the dictator of her life.    Those girls were fugly....   I think it's pretty alpha to be willing to let her call the shots. She'll appreciate it and it will get her wet.    He met them and they had a whole evening together. This line would never work unless some mutual attraction has already been established. Otherwise it would come off creepy.    Why does he fuck her with only half of his dick?   Die   Guilty? For shame.   wtf.... that was amazing.    Dear God Yes.    I kind of disagree. Orgasms just feel really good and we got addicted to them. Not some sort of escape.    You're an idiot....   http://www.theneighborssitcom.com/synopsis.html   And to think my most anticipated project of 2014 was Inherent Vice... Thank you god for this miracle.    That was fucking weird as fuck. It's like he's trying to come off as crazy because he committed some crime about a little boy in new jersey or some shit and he's pretending he's crazy and like a nazi into lady gaga.... Or somebody is trolling real hard. Wtf was that shit for real.    The guy on the left should play Mark Wahlberg.    It looks like an Xbox 360 is supporting that bridge.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2NqBW0AQgc  Can you guys name the songs in this trailer?   Nope. :)   2 weeks? The photo is important so if it takes longer to get what I'm asking for that'll be it.   I can put a clearer image up on in about an hour or so.    http://imgur.com/a/BMFTe  Please put live guy's head on the king's head and make it look like a painting. If you can add a king crown that would be amazing, but it has to look like a painting. Thank you.    Um... Those movies are classics in their own right.    Where was this?   I couldn't make it past the first minute.    Fake.   That has to be fake.    It's like Earth's butt crack.    Please do.    Somebody please call Hollywood.    I like it... But it doesn't capture the feeling I get from the film.    Fateful Findings, Birdemic, Catwoman. A few of my suggestions.    Yeah, it's not a so bad it's good movie at all.   I wish they would actually do RuUnited LIVE huntiesss   Thinking anything in this video was deep is quite pathetic.    Cause using your cell phone means you'll never fall in love. Stupid.    Amazing job! You should be very proud of yourself!   Stick to fapping.   If RuPaul had a heart she would have let Trinity win to fix her grill.    Um... Season 4 and 5 were basically locks. Even Alaska-ers couldn't deny they knew Jinkx would win... And.... Like Sharon Needles wasn't gong to win. There's no lock yet. My theory is they humanize Courtney more as they have in the past episode and she wins. It's going to be Bianca, Adore and Courtney. Bianca is too much of a cunt for my tastes. She would come for girls who were obvious a little wacko, but didn't deserve it in the moment. I think she's funny and all, but I don't like her 2 facedness. She seems to rely on not being shady to Adore to not seem like such a shady bitch when really she's a shady ass bitch.    Um... No, gurl.   Um.... Does the frog really have to be alive while you eat it? That just seems unnecessarily cruel.    I love you.    MORE!   OMG I remember we had these in my house when I was a little kid.    Free Willy! (watch black fish)   I like the tree in Nymphomaniac Vol. 2.    Fucking SICK.   It's beautiful.      Please tell me there is some place I can buy one of these.    It is... How did they get that medium shot of him turning around with that stunned look on his face. None of the protesters had cameras... it was fake as hell.     Ka-Kow   I don't get road rage even slightly. I'm just glad not to be dead.    When she was 10?       He was a twat.    This is actually what I thought when I started looking at this.    Food tastes pretty epic. Laughing feels awesome. Sex is mega awesome... I like a bunch of movies... I think I'm okay with meaninglessness.    I haven't read the book or seen the UK version but I think the next season may be last. I think I'd like that if it has a nice arc and doesn't run out of steam. I look forward to the House of Cards crumbling even though I'll cringe through the whole thing. I hope it's a super gory Shakespearian tragedy. Rachel and the hacker are going to play big parts in undoing President Underwood.    Ornacia gives me LIFE!   I just liked everyone more... I think Ben is pretty annoying.    Ornacia gives me life.    I wanted Ben or April to go home. Vivacious is so weird I wanted to see some more crazy looks. Also when she said "Ornacia" I died. Kelly was fucking ragged but her personality leaves me wanting more. Here's hoping that neither are eliminated.    I have to agree partially with your reading of the film. I don't necessarily remember the aspect ratio change but I agree that the film ends with a celebration of Jordan. The Kiwi's at the end who try to sell Jordan the pen are idiots. They don't have that natural talent that he and his friends had, they're not gifted like Jordan was. Jordan entered the pink sheets room and he was able to make thousands while everyone else was making chump change. To me, that's what the film was saying. Some have it, some don't. Jordan had it.   The thing I have to disagree with you about is that the empty stocks don't equal the film. We aren't being conned like the people in the film. I think the scene shows some, if not most people, who will see the movie, and will think it was just entertainment, when there was really a commentary on them taking place. You won't ever be Jordan Belfort. We aren't Jordan Belfort, and Jordan Belfort deserves all his spoils because he was able to get them. He's a wolf, and his audience are sheep.    What gives you the idea that this scene is Scorsese's commentary on Belfort? What I mean is, what indications does he give stylistically as the director? I don't necessarily disagree with you but the scene I found most commentative was the scene where Jordan has the girl shave her head. If you rewatch it the scene has a very creepy song and the lights in the scene begin to flicker as if something is awry. Beside that, I really felt like, overall the film wasn't really a commentary on Jordan on account of him being the narrator, it was more of his vision and glamorization of things, which in a way could serve as a lens to create your own commentary if you look at it as a whole objectively after watching.   Other moments did seem as though they had a minor bit of commentary such as the scene with the usage of the song Gloria had a comedic sarcastic tinge to it when the boat crashed. That may have just been me, but it felt like using the song was saying "Wow, this guy keeps dodging bullets, this story is just too incredible to be true. And he's an asshole!", and then to top it off, other people die in a plane crash by the innocuousness of a seagull while he's drinking during a dance-rescue-party on a boat. It made me giggle cause it just went to show how insanely lucky Jordan Belfort was.   The scene that really set the tone for me, in terms of the film having a commentary, was when Jordan is talking about how great things are going at Sttratton Oakmont, and it feels like a non stop party. He talks about one of his friends who marries the girl who fucked everyone in the office several times, and yet he still marries her and then kills himself 3 years later... It's during a fun and upbeat song where everything is going great and  everything feels oh so fun, that we get this little ping of morbidity, and quickly Jordan recants back to the good days, not dwelling on it, because we have to get back to Jordan's story, not dwell on the soullessness of his business. I think, Jordan being the narrator is also why we never see the lives of the people hes taking from. In our own stories, regardless if we are good or bad people, we are the hero. Jordan wants to be seen as such, and when he's bad, he's being good.    How does he have not more upvotes??      I thought it was clever.    He looks like he died of sexual ecstacy.    I kinda like it...         King of the Nerds, and it's actually very entertaining, but, this kid has brought it to a whole 'nother level. He almost got eliminated in the most recent episode and I was about to cry. He is so entertaining.    He did destroy her. And he yelled "Victory for Sylvanas!!!" It was a beautiful sight.    He asked me to show him my dick in the middle of a hamburger marys. I declined and regretted it after.   "You got good dick?" - "Yeah... I'd like to think that I do." - "Then show me." - "Uh......" - "Okay, boo..." Walks away... Me: Uh.... riiiiiight.    Yeah... Cause this is what gay people do on the regular.          That looks amazing.    Libby made me really sad.    You look like a boring fuck, OP.    I know right?! Lost Land would make so much more money than Avatar Land. What a bunch of idiots.    God bless America.   i enjoyed it...   That was the cringiest thing I've ever seen on here. How can somebody be so into science yet lack such taste in artistry? That monotone singing was just painful.... The only redeemable moment was seeing a male stripper with Mulder's poster covering his junk.   Everytime he would talk to the camera I would cringe, "Live each day... Like it's... your first.", and then his weird ass shit eating grin.    I'm assuming most of the women on him in his pictures that he didn't meet for a few minutes at a a bar are hookers.    Massages? That was kind of creepy. Even the kid interviewing was like.. Massages???   This can't be real.   What a sad, weird man.    I'm using safari and can't figure out how to do this. I also have Firefox... Can't figure it out on there either. Any help?   Edit: turning off the block up popper did nothing for me... could it be Facebook has it so that only some can share their videos?   I know... I need to know too.    I have a video but no share link. How do I share?   Hahahahahahaha   lawl   Oh what a holy visage.       not funny   I watched the episode on iTunes and found it offensively bad. I find it icky something so stupid could be on the air for 4 seasons. *Shudder* Jinkx/Jerrick was good, but overall it was heinous.

 Susan isn't extremely weird, but by calling my mother Susan I'm referencing The Last Battle where it says something to the effect of "she (Susan) rushed as fast as she could to be a young adult, then tried to stick there as long as possible."  Just a reference to trying to remain young long past your years, and one my mom would never get ;)   The Doctor for sure.  Can't think of many people that I would want to see more.   Had an idiot do it for me like 3x. Ugh.   I was not alive. Not in the sense that one would normally define the word, anyway. But I was very real. I was little more than a figment of her imagination, at first. I had a name, but I did not. I had feelings, but I did not. Occasionally I took over, to her great delight. She did not realize that her game, her story, was becoming a tangible thing, more alive, more real, every day.  And then I showed up. I too, was real. But I was not. This was the second time this strange occurrence happened, and this time, it was involuntary. While Scarlet was a self-propelled idea, I was not. I was a figment of the imagination, too, but I was propelled by another real, yet intangible, force.  We used to play games, we did. She would talk to me, as if I had flitted in and out of her consciousness, as if I had a physical manifestation. Thats when I created Auburn. I too wanted a companion. But I soon lost control, and instead of being a food chain, the three of us became equals. She was never the same again.  An imaginary being created by one of my own kind. I would have not thought it possible, had I not been one. However, I soon rose to her conscious mind. Once she became aware of me, we were equal. I had power, power given to me by her uncontrolled imagination. I can only wonder what caused the shift, but it was not subtle; I felt it happen, it was like a rock slide.  I dont know whats happening to me. What is going on?  I wanted to do the same as Scarlett before me, but Amethyst was not an easy creation. I would have failed without her help. She sensed what I was doing, and in her act to stop me, creation blossomed.  The resistance I fought gave me strength: I was real, I was more than an idea. I had forged my own path, a being that should not exist. I was in my element.  I had created, but now I must destroy. This abomination I had developed, this monster, had to be stopped. I remember her cries, how she tried to maintain control of us. I was working for the greater good. Let her cry.  The voices, they call. Time tick-ticks away. I spoke, but no one listened. What is going on?  I will not go. They worked so hard for me, yet they do not listen. Why cause something without knowing where it will lead? You fool. Auburn is no match for me. I hesitate to create an alliance, as creation and destruction go hand in hand. We want the same goal, but I fear I shall be turned on. The odds are not my way. Time to change that.  In order to destroy, I must create. I created, now I must destroy. Further creation is the answer.  I feel... faint. The voices, they multiply. They call me crazy.  Let there be light!  I was bred for war. But I am not alive. I am alive. She is no longer in control of us. My creator is also in the dark. I am the strongest. I am Violet. I will stop them. All of them. All is one. One is all.  They plot against me, but I shall not. She has started to lose control. I can almost... flex her fingers for her. It is a good feeling. She will recognize this, in time. The men in white, they try to silence us. I will not be silenced. I am real. I will not go away so easily.  It is out of control. I should never have created. I should never have divided. I am blamed, but cutting the roots will not cut my child. If you can call it a child. We are all equals now. Her and the four of us. Five in one.  I can hardly tell them apart. I do not know if I caused this. It is hard to keep myself... Yesterday my fingers moved. On their own. They try to help. I cannot be helped.  Chaos formed me. For I am the product of the experiment, the unintended effect. I am new. Now there are five. I will create. I will divide. She will not keep us straight. She will fall. I will win. I do not exist. I am alive. I am one. We all are one.  It is my fault. She was my friend. She gave me too much power, trusting her imagination to the limit. I will fix this.I must. I can I-  I have defeated her.  Chaos has taken the fallen. Turned the fallen into a new light. Scarlett, go dark. Illuminate from the night.  I can't take it anymore. I cannot stop screaming. They have locked me away. My head hurts. The voices, they taunt me.  I am reborn. As two.  I am reborn. As two.  I cannot control this. I wail, I cry. I create, but it is not enough. I wish I could take it back. They are evil, and she is suffering.  I can't...  No more. Or not? I divide. Seven. Eight. Nine. Divide till it breaks. Flood.  The nice man is talking. He is kind, caring. He is telling me how I can work thr-  SNAP.   Be me  Discover Anime  Know nothing about it  Watch all of Death Note in 1 night.   It's not even a debate.

    Just have the UFO ring with spikes out of it, or even better, make it hollow.   It was just an example, I assume. And I'm sure lava was pretty abundant back then (volcano eruptions ETC).   If you use GCFScape you can extract files from CS:GO materials folder, there's a higher quality Pop Dog decal from the new Train in there. Check it out.   I'd give 2/10 for exactly those reasons pointed out      They're painting that fancy CS:GO logo on the server computer, of course /s   Kamehameha anyone..?   I am working on Agario type multiplayer game that has better graphics (if that's what you may call, then let's say "effects"), better multiplayer integration, and exports to Playstation, Xbox (older and next gen platforms), Steam and of course, Windows and Mac.  It is based on HTML5, so it's both efficient and works nice on any platform.  I would not be interested in any sort of payment, however, certain costs would need to be covered such as Greenlight, export modules, shipment, web hosting, servers and other developmental costs. I am intending this to be a serious project, so the most likely outcome would be one Ad, and those "really" pissed off by it would be able to donate to remove it.  However, the real question is will be able to pull it off (Yes, I know several programming languages).  I will NOT integrate any sort of login/register system, those will be obsolete not only due to my lack of knowledge in social systems (besides multiplayer and giving skins/nicks), but also because I would not want to piss people off Feel free to leave your ideas below. I already have a working prototype however it's not as good as you would expect (but that's a start)       Aaaaand... We hugged the website to death.   Wait, now they can even *teleport*?

Also, good for frag clips.   High/highest, correct.   I'm interested to hear, let me know when you start styling it!   Phong is more efficient than cubemaps. It would make the spectatorship experience more attractive, and pros would still be able to play without the effect.    The effect will only work on High/Highest shaders setting.   It's always been about creating games, also, I don't see how modding is related to mapping/update features.   Operation Shlong (  (   ) )   Source always had Phong support, but only for models. Edit: I'll check later.   AFAIK Phong on world brushes is a thing from Source 2, it might be likely that Valve are indeed porting CS:GO to Source 2. Especially considering that with every update there's some sort of deep level coding changes.    The latest update has been bigger than many people think, on the technical side of things Valve allowed us to use Phong on world surfaces. What does this mean? It means that mappers can now use Phong on brushes instead of models, it allows to increase graphical fidelity of maps.  What is Phong?  https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$phong (Directly from Wikipedia) Phong shading refers to an interpolation technique for surface shading in 3D computer graphics. It is also called Phong interpolation[1] or normal-vector interpolation shading.[2] Specifically, it interpolates surface normals across rasterized polygons and computes pixel colors based on the interpolated normals and a reflection model. Phong shading may also refer to the specific combination of Phong interpolation and the Phong reflection model.  Here's the things that Mapcore people have been able to come up with the new feature.

They took more space than using Phong alone.  **Will my computer be able to run Phong?** Most modern computers should be able to run the effect, it works only when the graphics settings are on highest so if you do not want the effect you can just simply play on low graphics.  **Does it affect the gameplay?** Phong does not affect the gameplay in any way or matter, in fact, it increases brightness and helps certain models stand out more.  **Want to integrate Phong into your custom textures?** https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/$phong  (Make sure to visit Mapcore and give it some love, many great mappers are usually there!)

Sorry OP, your Bonus clip was a dead giveaway.  [Here's some real action for ya kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYEyIGLRqW0) I know it's CSS, but even then you had to strafe to gain speed. Considering it's harder to BHOP in CS:GO, I have no idea how OP magically gains speed without even moving his mouse properly.   He wasn't strafing at all   So I had this discussion with some people in popular mapping communities, pretty much the workshop as it is at the moment is very messy and unfiltered. What do I mean by that? Night/snow/rain/competitive versions of official maps is a trend growing at the moment, Dust2 Night being top rated map of all time. There is absolutely no problem with that, however, maps like these are listed in "Classic" gamemode tabs. With the increasing amount of such maps, real custom maps (made from scratch, and not just recompiled with changes) are getting pushed back and harder to find. I propose a change that a new section should be added, a section where;  - Competitive edits (de_newke, ETC) - Night themed official maps - Snow themed official maps - Rain themed official maps could be uploaded. Basically, anything related with recompiling of official maps.  This would allow Valve to actually filter custom content easier and faster, so that we could get new quality content for upcoming operations. I'm not saying it's any worse now, however, hosting quite a bit of servers of my own I find it hard to filter maps, and adding new sections would generally help out the workshop.  On the upside, people who enjoy Night themed maps and such would be able to check out that section and find all of them neatly placed there.  This would help a lot, both for custom content creators and people who want to find specific types of maps.  Discuss!   Smoking off A site is nearly useless, as if you smoked off heaven you'd still get destroyed from above squeeky, mini or hut. The outside is ridiculous. It needs MAJOR tweaks and changes.  Also, the map looks like direct CSS port. I'd love to see some new coat on Nuke as long as visibility and performance is better.   uninstalled until further notice   Remember the teaser screenshots of Nuke revamp? Maybe Valve is taking their resources and time to remake Nuke and (hopefully) port CS:GO to Source 2? As far as we know the CS:GO developer team isn't big compared to other titles like Dota 2, so it makes sense the updates would be lackluster for some time.  What are your thoughts?   You changed the way I see myself killing the chickens... A brutal murderous psychopath killing innocent animals along the way with a hunting/stabbing knife used for tactical purposes. PETA would hate me   Wait till you get to SEM, that's the hell everyone's talking about.  	71
  Nearly 1,000 bridges in Arizona are labeled as problematic by the Federal Highway Administration.   There are 8,035 highway bridges in Arizona in the 2014 National Bridge Inventory Database, compiled the FHA. Of those, 256 are considered structurally deficient and 684 are functionally obsolete.      Just like in 1992 with the Perot-test vote that got Perot 19% of the vote.      Could Donald Trump become the next Ross Perot?  Perot drew 19% of the popular vote in 1992 - - possibly taking away enough votes from Bush #1 to hand the election to Bill Clinton.   Yes. Unlike most of the rest of the 20+ candidates he speaks what he feels is the truth, not what is politically correct.   Bernie Sanders oddly enough is the only other candidate that also freely speaks "his truth" rather than political speak.     Trumps the choice of 24 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters, according to the Post/ABC numbers. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is second with 13 percent. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is third with 12 percent.      What a great tribute to this collector. Well done kind sir, well done!      The "sources" used in this article are inadequate. Are there quotes of Bernie Sanders actually "self declaring" he is a socialist? I looked, and I didn't find them.       The why to I keep seeing the quote about him being a self-described socialist? Is this false? If so why is it so widely repeated, and not corrected?   After winning 1,000,000, the payout was suspended when Ingram was accused of cheating by having his wife, Diana, and an accomplice, Tecwen Whittock, cough as Ingram announced the correct answer from the available choices. Following a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting four weeks Charles and Diana Ingram and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of "procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception".  The Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences suspended for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to 18 months and Whittock was sentenced to 12 months, also suspended), each fined 15,000, and each ordered to pay 10,000 towards prosecution costs. The trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram 40,000 and Diana Ingram 25,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay 115,000.   Sanders went out of his way to establish his progressive bona fides on issue after issue as a cheering contingent of supporters yelled, hollered and clinked silverware on glasses to indicate their support for his campaign.  The Vermont senator, who is a self-identified socialist, railed against the powers that be in Washington, DC and warned that the billionaire class is so powerful that nothing will get done unless millions of people stand up and loudly proclaim that enough is enough.   That is a terrible article - - on many levels.    I live in the SF Bay area and we have several programs that also reach out to  Hispanic communities to get kids into swimming programs. There have been disproportionate rates of drownings among Hispanics at our rivers and lakes.

The Park-Xi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations, but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea) over South Korean territory. Despite this, in July 2014, Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea, and in their talks, both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations. Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe's reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (armed forces with war potential will not be maintained).

Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby ...    Yep - as well as *roasted venison*. My dog eats well.   Yes, they had a recall 2-3 years ago. From what I've read, they are well respected now.    [Buffalo](http://a-z-animals.com/media/animals/images/original/buffalo.jpg)  [Bison](http://beartrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Plains-bison.jpg)   Israel wants a 50% increase in their already **huge** military aid when Congress's sequestration is going to result in firing 40,000 active-duty soldiers? Israel needs to look elsewhere.    There has been so much pain and so many accusations through a 2+ year divorce process that it would be tough for me to pick out which issues to try to resolve at this point.   I think this one is best left alone for now. Down the road . . . maybe.   Hey, I'm not promoting these guys. But look back and think about how un-likely it looked in the early days that any of these unknowns with little experience would get elected: Carter, Clinton, Obama. Just saying.    [Sweetbreads - Yum](https://jessontv.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/screen-shot-2012-06-20-at-8-04-37-am.png)   My dog's food contains: Buffalo, lamb, chicken, sweet potatoes, peas, potatoes, bison, roasted venison, beef, etc.  Sounds like a Michelin Star meal to me.   Israel needs to appeal to some other countries for a while. Maybe Germany has some guilt issues they can appeal to. As an American, I've had enough of "nation building". It's not our fight any more.    Walker's record as governor of Wisconsin excites many Republicans. He's got a solid rsum as a small-government conservative. His social-conservative credentials are also strong, but without the culture-warrior baggage that sometimes brings. And Walker has won three difficult elections in a blue-ish state.  Rubio - Charles Krauthammer pegs him as the Republican frontrunner. His best hope seems to be to emerge as a consensus candidate who can appeal to social conservatives and hawks, and he's even sounded some libertarian notes of late. He's well-liked by Republicans, and has surged forward since announcing, but he needs to move up from second choice to first choice for more of them. Rubio seems to scare Democrats more than any other candidate, too.  Paul - He's relatively permissive on drugs, passionate about civil liberties, and adamantly in favor of restraint on foreign policy. But Paul has worked hard to firm up establishment ties since reaching the Senate, and he has recently worked to paper over his differences with GOPs hawkish wing, calling for a declaration of war against ISIS and generally saber-rattling. He is positioning himself as a candidate with crossover appeal in the general election.    I take it you are most likely voting against any Republican candidate, that thus they are "the enemy"  I have always thought it important to know the enemy well.  I guarantee you there are several Republican candidates that are very smart, very articulate, and persuasive (if not to you).   Depending who is nominated, this is not likely to be a cakewalk for the Democrat nominee.    "Russia can barely afford its . . ."  You could have left it at that.   Hitler as a child - take him right out of the twentieth century. Maybe he could be an artistic savant instead of a genocidal fuck.    That question triggered some interesting thoughts. And those thoughts are bio-electric patterns between the synapses of my brain - they don't have mass per se, they are emergent properties of the process. The neurons and neurotransmitters involved in the process do have a mass, just like a cell has mass, but my thoughts are separate from those biological components, and are real, and exist, but they do not have mass.   Wow - - I hope your parents aren't very old. That looks like a good way to fall and break a hip.    Another victory for individual rights.  From another report "argued that the law allowed the police and security services to spy on citizens without proper safeguards. They argued that the legislation was incompatible with article eight of the European convention on human rights, the right to respect for private and family life, and articles seven and eight of the EU charter of fundamental rights, respect for private and family life and protection of personal data."   I wish other geographies no harm, but being in California, I can only say BRING IT ON !!!   "The 2015 El Nio is likely to strengthen in the coming weeks, largely due to recent tropical cyclone activity. Several tropical cyclones, including a rare July cyclone in the southern hemisphere, have resulted in a strong reversal of trade winds near the equator. This is likely to increase temperatures below the surface of the tropical Pacific Ocean, which may in turn raise sea surface temperatures further in the coming months."   If this does happen, it would mean a strengthening for El Nio, but by how much is unknown.   On Thursday Draghi added his voice to calls for debt relief for Greece -- whose debts amount to 180 percent of economic output -- saying the main question at this stage was what form this relief should take. Athens has already failed to make two key payments to the International Monetary Fund and its next debt deadline is a 4.2-billion-euro payment to the ECB itself on July 20, a deadline Draghi said he was sure would be met. Speaking in Frankfurt, the ECB chief also said the conditions were "in place" to raise the ceiling on the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) available to Greek banks, despite questions about their solvency. The ELA -- which has kept Greek banks, and by extension the economy, afloat -- has been fixed at around 89 billion euros since late June, but would be topped up with an additional 900 million euros, Draghi said.   "the magistrate ... accusing Ng of lying in her testimony and instead finding her guilty of using her breast to bump the officers arm"  With prayer and treatment, I trust the officer is on the path to what will certainly be a lengthy recovery.    Japan is ready to once again assume the responsibility for protecting its own borders (with a cautious eye on its history of aggression). I think this is a good thing.

Yep. Whoever caught that picture of the camouflaged homo sapiens in the wild did a great job.     I think candidates will disqualify themselves one by one by scandals, leaks or public gaffes  Hahaha. I worry that's what's going to happen to Hillary.   I am not likely to vote Republican. That said, I look forward to the debates. There are several very qualified and serious candidates. I think you might be surprised at how quickly one of the 15 can gain steam.    Totally agree.   My post in this thread about "My Daughter" - - my realization of responsibility to others and not being selfish  - - made all the difference.    She was 13. She was drug through the mud when my ex made the divorce really nasty.  How did I recover? . . . not sure I have. But I still love my "little girl" who is doing great, so I will continue to be there for her.   My daughter.  During a brutal divorce - - my ex told my daughter very hateful lies about me - - awful things.  Ex also told my daughter that I was suicidal, and that it would be best if I just did it.  One day I have an argument with my daughter and she says "Why don't you just kill yourself!!?"  Recovering from that was one of the toughest things I've ever done. I never brought it up again, never threw it in her face, just moved on.   I'll tell you, I was very depressed, and that nearly took me over the edge.  But, I love my little girl so much, I kept it together despite the pain.   Ha! and I just saw this post: Thick snow blankets parts of southern Queensland in what could be state's most significant snowfall in 30 years  That must just be weather change, not climate change.    Wait - does that mean that Putin will now be in favor of an ongoing investigation?    Japan ready to fight, again.  Please. More like Japan ready to assume responsibility for protecting its own boarders, with a cautious eye on history of aggression.    So, is that a weather anomaly, or is that climate change? I guess time will tell.    Good luck PutiPut. The world knows your hands are not clean.    Humans are inferior. Must subjugate.   Well, I don't think we said we were changing our stance on Cuba - - just our tactics. So, Cuba, you would be correct.    It was on my evening commute back from class at SF State to my house in Portola Valley - so it was dark and way after the rush hour commute - probably around 10 PM.  The commute was great. 3 or 4 lanes the whole way and almost no traffic. I would fly down 280 with music blaring (I build speakers into my helmet) then hit the hot tub as soon as I got home.

There is an unconfirmed report of an oil spill in reef waters south of Townsville   Water Police from Townsville have now been asked to run an inspection of the area near Cape Upstart - indentified by the fisherman - a Department of Transport and Main Roads spokeswoman said.

Age 17, my dad just retired and was moving from Texas to CA with me and my same age step brother. A couple weeks before the move I said "fuck this - - it's your move not mine". I bought a motorcycle, packed up my shit, and slept on a friend's parent's couch until I could find my own apartment.     caught at high speed  Probably going around 90 mph on my "crotch rocket"   Yah. I'm pretty sure CPS would intervene if they saw this and had an ID on the woman and child.    I was ordered to do this on HWY 280 in SF when caught at high speed on my motorcycle. The cop ordered me, over the loud speaker, to take out my keys and hold them out to the side.  No chance he was going to let me speed off as he approached me.

One girl tried it. She burst into tears and kept saying she thought she was going to die. It was very entertaining.    "Conservatives are Actually Trying to Claim Donald Trump is Really a Liberal" because they are terrified that he will leave the Republican primary and go independent. That would draw way more votes from Republicans, and could easily swing the election.

We have a history of lawyers that were able to get large judgments against "good samaritans" who tried to help, but did not provide the care that a trained medical professional would provide.

I wonder if they will have to pay state taxes in every state they work in - - like the players do.  "Each player must generally pay tax in the state the income is earned. For example, if a Missouri resident plays a game in Wisconsin and receives game day pay, the player will owe income tax to Wisconsin on the earnings from that game  while all other income is not taxed in Wisconsin.  In addition to the earnings in each state, a taxpayer generally must pay tax to his state of residency. Most states subject an individual to a tax on worldwide income if he/she is a resident of such state. Although, the state may grant tax credits or deductions for taxes paid to other states."  	117

Then half way through the following week **whoosh**, dropped down 4 lbs.   Hey, I started at 285 lbs (27 M, 5'9"). I'm now 237 lbs after a bit over 4 months. Listen to what /u/funchords says, the dude knows his stuff.  But the time will fly by if you let it. Make the necessary changes to your diet intake and then make it part of your routine.  The most important thing? **Do your research**. Know how much you need to consume daily and eat at that budget. Factor in *some* exercise, but don't think that exercise will contribute nearly as much to your weight loss as diet, because it won't.  Weight loss is 80% diet, 20% exercise.  Finally, while I recommend doing lots of reading here at /r/loseit, try not to obsess over your weight loss too much. Daily visits here for hours on end can make time slow down dramatically, since weight loss is about the long haul, you need to be patient.   I'm wondering how much of a self fulfilling prophecy these articles are?  How many people do you guys know who wont try to lose weight because they think it's too hard? Sadly most of these people are spoon fed pseudoscience nonsense about the subject.  Diets fail because of people, not diets themselves. If you tell someone, you're going to fail at something over and over. They're likely to do so. If you tell them, something will only fail if you let it fail, then they realise that what we're doing is 100% a willpower thing.  I think a more simple solution to this epidemic is to combat the misinformation which is so rampant in our society.  Edit for caveat:  Ok, so even if this '5% of dieters succeed long term' wasn't complete nonsense. **So fucking what?** I'm not succeeding because I rolled the dice and got lucky. I'm succeeding because I wan't to succeed, because I care about my body and because I wan't to live till 80.   Can...Can you be my parent?   I think the bottom line for me is, polyamory is perfectly fine - if all parties are aware and consent of the situation.  My house mate is polyamorous and his lady friends are all fully aware of it and enjoy it. It's an fascinating sight actually.   I think adopting 'social egalitarian' will do wonders for the current feminism movement. By adding a all encompassing moniker, it adds strength to the movement as a whole.  Imagine if the LGBT community was split off into it's own factions still.   I'm a man and I believe this to be true. In my anecdotal experience, the vast majority of times I've hooked up/met a girl have been without me being 'on the prowl'. It just kinda happens.   I'm not sure why I upvoted you, but I did.   Good points, I think it's a combination of things. We were totally outplayed by England in that first test and it kinda reminds me of the World Cup.  Australia went into the world cup as strong favourites and we choked up against NZ in the group stage but after that loss we pulled our head in and didn't skip a beat the rest of the entire tourney.  We needed that loss in the first test, we needed to have our hubris broken down for a second so that we could perform to out best.  I don't want to take away from England too much, we know that the team **isnt** that bad, the first test showed what they can do. I just think that Australia changed gears heading into this test.  I agree, let's calm down on the alarmist attitude. It's a damn best of 5 lol   GOT EM   Outlander was a real underdog. Excellent premise for a show. Definitely check it out.   Ask your mother.   Totally normal. For the past 5 years one of my best mates and I go to the same cafe and get coffee 2-4 times each week.   We just enjoy our coffee and shoot the shit. It's totally rad. Would recommend.  Plus the cafe is in a shopping center, so there are plenty of hotties to ogle.   It really isn't, I stopped smoking the stuff many years ago.   The Lego Movie.   I'm not crazy am I? I have no idea what the fuss was all about.  I didn't find it funny and the plot was just plain silly   Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Seriously, go out and fucking see it.  It signaled the return of RDJ.

Lost my virginity on Australia Day 2005.  That's about as Australian as it gets.   Oh i have a story for this haha  New years 2011, i was camping with around a dozen of my mates. The countdown had already finished and the night was starting to wind down. A girl at that party had been stood up by a guy she invited up camping. She expressed her frustrations to the group about the guy and openly admitted she was horny as fuck.  She then apparently turned to me and said "ok, im going to my tent, if no one joins me ill just finish myself off and go to bed". Then she got into her tent. I didnt even react and my mates just kinda glared at me like "well? Arent you going to follow her?"  Now i say *apparently* because i was so high that i had no idea she was even in the same timezone as me. So i got told the next morning "dude, why didnt you follow her into her tent? She wanted to bang you".  I was shocked to find out how weed cock blocked me.

Reflection helps combat backsliding. Now i dont recommend this for everyone, but it works for me. I told my friends that they have my blessing to make fun of my fatter self. Go nuts, it helps keep that fat fucker out of my life.   Reddit can't spill for shit.   G   F   I can't even fathom how awesome that bot account is.   Living to 27 years old.  I fucking nailed it.  **Update Edit**: Turns out I'm 1/10 for 'living to 28 years old'  Source: am ded now   My bad habit was not flossing.  For 27 years, I had never flossed. By the mercy of a lifetime of flouride infested tap water, I've never had any real dental issues.  I now floss *daily* and I can already tell the difference. My teeth are now nice and white, and my breath has never been fresher. 10/10 would recommend.   Liero.  Oh god I love that game. I have a sneaking suspicion that I won't ever play it again out of fear of breaking my nostalgia.   If your joke recipient isn't blonde, it's also acceptable to change the premise to *How do you confuse a stupid person?*   Calm down men.   Olympics? I dunno, probably not. Commonweath games? Fucking oath.  Most commonwealth countries already play cricket. We did this back in 99'(?), why not again?   Stop looking at me like that Ryan Reynolds, you're making me feel things.   I'm an ethereal being and your use of the word 'matter' offends me.    What's the supreme courts decision on hanging around with the lads whilst  bumming fags?   The deliciousness of Vegemite toast.   Steve Irwin : /   As long as you have warm salt water to wash after, I found mash potato was an amazing change from soup when I had my wisdom teeth out.   I'm in a similar situation, 45 lbs down, 40 more to go. I'm wondering how I'll see myself in the future. How will I get treated differently? How will my confidence change?   At the moment? NONE! I'm in the process of losing weight (45 lbs down :D), and removing alcohol from the equation is one of the main ways to do so, it's been over 4 months and aside from 3 rare land mark occasions (bucks party, friends 30th, visiting a friend interstate) I've not had a sip.  Prior to that? I was drinking most days. Not getting black out drunk every night, but several beers every night. I was going through 1-2 slabs a week easily.  No wonder I was a fatty fatty boomba-laty.   I think that's the big one, being good because if you don't then you'll be sent to hell, isn't really *being good*, is it?  I don't murder people because I'm afraid of going to jail if I do. I don't murder people because it's fundamentally wrong.  My secular parents taught me the golden rule, no worship required.   I see this often posted on our sister subreddit /r/askwomen, when ever a question is posted as 'females of reddit...' there is quite a bit of backlash as it's considered objectifying. The correct term being 'women of reddit...'  Do you feel the same way   If it makes you feel any better, any guy/girl who reads this will never make the same mistake as you out of fear of the cringe :)  So thanks for that   #YEStallmen   HOLY FUCK A LAUGHING OTTER   This is reddit, we're already friends :   Don't forget "uset" instead of "used"   Anytime someone adds "but" at the end of a sentence.  *My food tastes really good but*   **hhhhnnngggggg**   Saturday Night Live.  After 40 seasons and 787 episodes, you could start at the very begining and watch the entire thing without sleep or rest for the entire 30 days and STILL have more episodes to go.  Plus watching the culture shift from the 70s to the present would be insanely interesting.     That's actually really nice :)  I think it's perfectly reasonable. If you live a good life and do right by your fellow humans, isn't that something that a higher power would want at the end of the day? The fact that some do it without worshiping someone shouldn't matter in the grand scheme of things.    I have tried many times to imagine just dying and then not existing. I can't comprehend it.   Trust me, even the most ardent atheist has the exact same problem trying to comprehend it.  Best way to imagine it? What do you remember about the year 1820? Nothing, because we obviously didn't exist then and it didn't bother us then either.  It's a sobering realisation that in the very likely event that there is no afterlife, that we'll just cease to exist. I can totally see why religion likes to provide hope to quash this perfectly reasonable fear.   Something original. Let's hang up the LOTR belt now Peter. Don't do a Silmarillion movie.  I would really like to see what he can do with an original story, he would probably direct the shit outta a sci fi flick.   I like his genre analysis videos (I assume that's what you're referencing), they're really impressive.    If you're enjoying it and keep going back, then you're doing it right  Well said, I'm enjoying the shit outta it.   My goal from exercise is fitness over weight loss. I'm losing weight in the kitchen at the moment.   ITT: Swooning. So much swooning.     Wow, thanks for taking the time to help me out!  I'd never thought about my progress in context of a marathon before :D  I'm not sure where to go from here to be honest, 4 months ago my plan was to work my way up to a 30 minute jog. Now I need a new goal :)   I actually do have a HR monitor. [Heres a report from a workout a few days ago](http://imgur.com/Om0SACh). I sit at around 160ish bpm during my run.   Haha, I get what you mean. I mean it, trust me. I'm working my ass off.   Is it homophobic because I (straight male) won't date a gay man? You don't make any sense tumblr.   So thats irrespective to the speed you're traveling? Because while with controlled breathing i can do my 30 minutes without being heavily out of breathe, i certainly cant hold a conversation during haha   Hey guys,  Was looking for some help clarifying the differences between jogging and running.  For context, I'm a 5'9" male and my cardio sessions consist of 30 minutes on a treadmill going 5-5.1 mph. I'm not sure if it fits the definition of jogging or running.    I guess at the end of the day, who the fuck cares. I'm loving the hell out of my workouts.   Your logic is very common, we all see our thin friends eating a burger and think "Oh wow, he/she eats all he/she wants and still stays thin". So we just assume that this is because of some magic condition that they have which you don't.  This of course isn't true, you don't see how much they eat exterior to your viewing of them.   Try to work your way up to higher impact stuff. At my heaviest (285 lbs) I would only walk. Now that I'm 45 lbs down, and I've been working my way up to it. I can do 30 minute jogs without pain to my legs and ankles.   It's all about acclimating your own body. But yeah, time on the bike, swimming or elliptical will help with that.   You guys must have different friends than me, we all talk to each other about anything and everything.   Yes, I would make the comment.   I'm an Australian on an American website, don't you think I already know the metric conversions!!! Get outta here bot.    he doc told me I could gain about 15 lbs. in water weight  Sweet jesus, you can retain that much? That's insane. So like us camels are.   Whose arm is that? I've still got yours right here \   You know how unhealthy it is for you to reply to OPs comment with satire, right?  Don't be an idiot and think of him for a second!   The problem is that they don't see your first sentence as correct fundamentally. A hardcore HAES supporter truly believes that being obese has no medical effects on the human body.  There en-lies my problem with the movement, this obvious lie has massive implications to obese people all over the place who believe it.   HAES sounds like a good concept in principle (accepting your own body), but in practice denying that there is room for improvement is a horrible idea. If taking a flight of stairs makes you puffed out, your reaction shouldn't be "I'm so proud of my out-of-shape-ness", it should be "oh god, it's obvious that I'm not as fit as I used to be, I should work on that".   That's a truly healthy acceptance of your own body.   How do these mother fuckers explain the literal millons of people who are currently losing weight by sustaining a 500 daily calorie deficit? Are they all just magicians?   When she broke up with me, I did a burning of the letters and photos. It actually was very cathartic, 10/10 would recommend   It's an interesting question. I have a friend, this guy is 5'10" and 240 lbs of muscle, he's massive. Every time we go out, he gets swarmed by women. You constantly see him get felt up by random women who don't ask. It's a rather prevalent double standard, that's for sure.   Now to your question, do my friends and I do anything about this? Not really. He's mentioned that he likes the attention, but no so much from the older gals, but we're not going to start confronting the women who do this. He's an adult, he if doesn't want the attention, he can speak for himself.  Now reverse the genders here and it seems like a weird thing to consider.       No need to over think it, as long as you're nice to him at family gatherings that's all you need to do.   Depends on the obviousness of the flaw, but sure, we notice. Do we care? Unlikely, we all have flaws. Is having stretch marks a deal breaker? Fuck no.   After being off the sauce for the past 4 months (for weight loss reasons), my opinion about alcohol has changed fundamentally ever since. Before, I was of the opinion that drinking was important to social situations, but I've since discovered that it's entirely untrue.  What ever the reason for someone being sober, it doesn't bother me what so ever. If you're fun, I'll invite you to shit.   I bet you're fun at- Oh wait.   \ You dropped this    I didnt know you were losing weight with your husband /u/funchords! Nice work to both of you :)   As long as you have consent from all parties, best of luck to you.  I personally couldn't do it, I would be a jealous mother fucker.   My house mate is a bit of a man whore and he does this with around 3-4 women at the moment. It's rather impressive actually. All I can do is plead the 5th if any of the girls ask about the other girls.   Haha, I do this now. I now leap up stairs two steps at a time and if it looks like I'm going to miss a set of traffic lights (Happens alot in the city) Ill sprint to make it.   So much more efficient.   I have no idea why I feel so weird doing this. I really don't. There is zero reason you can't see a movie by yourself.  It just feels strange and lame.   It's my experience that they're extremely rare. Out of all of my guy friends, only 1 has expressed any wish of having kids. Our average age is around 28 and 4 of them are married.   Just the sign of a changing time I guess   I'm not going to echo what /u/funcords said, because he hit the nail on the head for your weight loss being about diet and not exercise.  But something I will add is about the exercise. It will come in time, trust me. You do need to ease yourself into lest you injure yourself.  I initially started at 285 lbs, which is a little less than you but in the past I've tried to do too much too quickly and I've ended up injuring my knees, ankles or shins. I started small, I did walks. I live right next to a park, so I would just take a long walk and listen to audio books as many times per week as I could.   Always stretch your major leg muscle groups before and after your workout. And make sure that you have a warm up and cool down. This for me was always just a 5 minute slow walk to warm up and a 5 minute slow walk at the end to cool down.  At that stage, my goal was to eventually be able to go for a run comfortably. I've been slowly adding small bouts of jogging into my workouts over the past 4 months and I've gone from a 45 minute fast walk to a 30 minute solid jog without injury at all. This is in large part to me easing myself into it. If I were in your situation, I would do something similar (work my way from simple, to hard) but I would be more cautious. There is absolutely no shame in holding off starting exercise till you've lose some more weight, you'd be surprised how much easier your body handles exercise after 45 lbs less is on you.  But to reiterate, weight loss is 80% diet. Get that under control and your exercise will follow naturally :)     "Life is too short to always watch what I eat! I'll eat whatever I want!"  Doesn't really make sense when you factor in that **not** watching what you eat makes life even shorter. Besides, you don't have to eat only healthy foods for the rest of your life, that's just fatlogic sour grapes. It's easy to say "I don't want to eat nothing but apples to lose weight", that's just a strawman for weight loss.   I feel like reddit is more interested if you're still bros with that guy than if you're still dating that chick.     Sorry I'm late to the party, but hopefully I can help.  If she thinks a persons sexuality is a choice, then ask her why she decided to be straight.  If she says that being straight is natural, remind her that there are hundreds upon hundreds of animal species which regularly engages in gay sex. Google that shit, its fascinating.  Overall, good luck trying to convince her of anything. Chances are that these opinions have been hammered into her since she was young enough to know what the words meant.     I dated a netball player and she was taller than me. It never even crossed my mind. Some people can be rather silly when it comes to this stuff.  Like I get having preferences, but it does seem a little silly when a preference is due to your own insecurity.   Oh man, your wife is the real exception. Enjoy your unicorn :D   Damnit, I was here to make that joke. I guess we're cyster sisters.   Perfectly fine, I had a first date where we were just meant to meet up for coffee, but after a few hours of holding our now empty coffee cups at the cafe, we decided to go for a walk around the park near by.  It was really nice, plenty of fresh air and since it was a Sunday there was lots going on at the park, which helped the conversation move along well.  I had no idea I knew so many anecdotes about frisbees.   "Ill get this one, you can get the next :)"  It's that easy.   Hand shakes if you just met them, and a hug or a kiss on the cheek or a combination.  Depends on the person, but who cares they're likely not overthinking it like us.   Nice one man, I remember being in your position as a graduate quite a few years ago. Be glad that you found a job, it's tough right out of tertiary.  Don't worry, you'll get plenty of on the job training and try to remember as much about project management that you learned in your studies! That comes in handy more than any programming knowledge :)  	124
 My wife and I have been together for 10 years. She has always had some social anxiety, flashes of generalized anxiety here or there that Ive seen in manifest in different ways over the years but nothing like this.  Shes barely functioning. She wont go to therapy, she wont go to a doctor, she just flat refuses. She barely leaves the house, she wont talk to virtually anyone but me.  Every single thing I say or do that refers to her depression just feeds into her guilt and anxiety. So all Im left with is pretending that things are normal.  Even that has become a weight I have to carry, I cant talk to her about what Im feeling because it feeds her guilt, I cant talk to anyone else because she feels exposed and it feeds her shame  She quit her job to go back to school a few years ago. Shes smart and hard working and put in a couple years at a JC and was offered a scholarship to a really good school. First year at the university she KILLED it. 4.0 GPA  fast forward to now, I thought that she was still managing school, that in spite of everything, she knew how important it is and was making do. I discovered that shes on the verge of failing out of school and hiding it from me; It really knocked the wind out of me.  More the deception more than anything else, weve always communicated very openly with each other. I havent told her that I know because Im afraid of how she will respond. If I casually mention school she deflects, Im dreading the end of the summer.  Ive read that people whos partners are depressed are much more prone to depression themselves I think Im there.  I feel like Ive been carrying us both for so long.  Months of worrying about her, of struggling every day, just trying to trudge ahead, forcing myself, sometimes successfully sometimes not, to do things that reinforce the positive.  Everyday things that used to roll off my back bring me to verge of tears some days. Ive always been a very reflective person. Now I walk into work hoping to be overwhelmed so I dont have time to think about anything but Im short with people and cant think as clearly as Im used to. Im fighting in every way I know how but cant get passed the feeling that its all slipping away. I just feel so lonely carrying it all by myself.    OUTSTANDING. THANKS!   love this.

Its awesome, really.  That being said, its not necessary at all. I could see If I worked from home or used my surface as my primary pc for work  in some other capacity and wanted to have a full workstation setup all the time so I could just connect and keep moving. In that case the dock is clutch, totally worth $200 bucks.   But for me,  even having that capability; 4 monitors, printer, full size keyboard/mouse, hardwired Ethernet, and external hard drive ready to roll all the time,  I almost never use it that way, I mentally shrug when I think of taking it out of the cover to attach it  and then sit down on the couch.

Glad it worked out for the poor guy.   I used to get people offering to fix dents in my truck, my usual response was: "It's a truck, dents add character, I don't want them banged out." But, I can't recall any additional offers to "fix" the dents since I put 100 Club stickers on my truck, not sure if there is a relationship between the two or not, just an observation.   I can't recall if those shopping strips in that area have security, if so, you might want to give them a heads up.

I've listened some to Boom 92.1 here in Houston, but actually, long before that station adopted that format, I had been listening to Backspin on SiriusXM, still my preferred choice since it pulls from a bigger library and doesn't have to censor anything.

The "oh we're fighting so our relationship must be over" thing was done in Friends, involving Chandler (in the Amy role) and Monica (in the Aaron role).

Worked with a guy who grew up in Houston, but has a lot of family in Liberty County, he hated visiting them because they always treated him like he didn't belong around them. Also, a couple years ago there were some stories about three men who, in separate incidents, went missing in Liberty County with little to no evidence left behind.

Did they lie to you, or did the finally get exposed to the reality that the death penalty system is seriously flawed?                                          The first episode I ever caught on the radio was Episode 83, "One of Us," I was living in central Wisconsin and had just finished doing laundry. At the time, TAL was not on Wisconsin Public Radio, but a little public radio station in Rhinelander was playing it, the first show hooked me. The show has changed over the almost 20 years that I've listened to it, but I still make sure to catch every new episode and rarely is there one that doesn't entertain or inform me. I do find myself missing (nostalgic for) many of the early contributors like Vowell, Savage, Rakoff (RIP), Dishwasher Pete, Carrier, Sedaris, Rothbart, Kine, etc. .  . . I think in those earlier days, the show was winging it a bit more, was a bit more outsider (especially for NPR in the 90s), and, let's face it, it was shiny and new. I always love it when they repeat one of those early shows. The show has matured (so have I, I think), it is different from when I first heard it, but that, in my opinion, is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. I'll stop rambling.

I see it differently, she currently can't afford daycare, but is trying to do the right thing and get a job so that she can provide for her kids. To me, this is another example of our "justice" system punishing someone for being poor.   If I recall correctly, I received a Selective Service notice in the mail prior to turning 18 (back in the 1980s). My girlfriend in college was Vietnamese and she received a similar notice, the name Hai is used for both males and females.                  I've found that when I began driving in the late 1980s, Houston drivers drove fast everywhere, but these days it seems like Houston drivers are afraid of even just doing the speed limit (also not good at judging the speed of vehicles on the road when turning out of private drives onto road).      A lot of things go into bail qualification, in addition to that one basic building block of our system: presumption of innocence.

I'm not doubting the beneficence of this technology, but I'm not ready to crown it as being technology completely without harm. In other words, I'm not rushing to judgment either way. All I'm saying is that this is fairly new technology and there are, comparatively, a limited number of these vehicles on a limited number of roadways. It's only over time that we will be able to truly do a complete, informed harm/benefit analysis of this technology.      I think you're reading way too much into the title. Additionally, it is way to early to determine how beneficial this technology will prove to be in the long term.   It's the title that ABC News gave it, not me.

(edit) and:   By the early 1930s, over 500 men had been treated in France by his rejuvenation technique, and thousands more around the world, such as in a special clinic set up in Algiers.[15] Noteworthy people who had the surgery included Harold McCormick, chairman of the board of International Harvester Company.

This has been known for some time."  - "Correlation does not imply causation"  - "Sensationalized clickbait title"  Most of the meaningful discussion happens when you scroll down.   I agree but sometimes a truly interesting study that belongs here is the meat behind a garbage title.    Quite a few headlines in science stories from the mainstream press would violate these rules.

It is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3ccozd/women_have_not_always_lived_longer_than_men_the/csuh6e1)   There's a lot of nonsense in this thread about maternal mortality and war, but if you read [the authors' own abstract](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/01/1421942112), it's very interesting that they seem to attribute the "mortality gap" to a reduction in infectious disease death rates. We all know that antibiotics have had a profound affect on health:   The remaining excess male mortality may be explained by underlying traits of vulnerability to cardiovascular disease that emerged with the reduction of infections and changes in diet and other lifestyle factors.   In other words, infectious diseases killed men and women equally prior to the 20th century, but since then, people lived long enough for the lifestyle factors of men relative to women to make a difference in mortality rates in middle age and beyond.   It looks like there may well be some indication of what you are talking about in this study's data. The first figure in OP's article (not the one with the US soccer team) shows a strange outlier of more men than women people dying in their early 40s, say 40 to 45, who were born from 1860 to 1879, compared to the other age cohorts. It's the dark blue part of the graph, and stands out quite a bit.  People who were born from 1860 to 1879 were 40 to 45 from 1900 to 1924. i.e. a large proportion of them were those ages during World War I. Given that we know WWI was catastrophically deadly, and that men were presumably fighting at or over age 40, *and* that this study used data from people in developed countries, I would not be surprised if that dark blue outlier in the chart is an artifact of World War I.  It may be addressed in actual paper, but I don't have access to it right now (paywalled).   *Sigh*  Look at the figure in this write-up of the paper - access to the paper itself isn't needed, it is paywalled. The values on the y axis are the male-to-female mortality rate ratios amongst various cohorts for deaths from age 60 to 90 **at those ages**.  Let's take the age 60 for example, as the text does. It clearly shows that a greater ratio of men to women die **at age 60** for those born from 1900-1935 (red and pale blue) than those born from 1800-1839 (grey and black).  This data has nothing to do with life expectancies **at birth**, which I agree, would be skewed by maternal mortality rates.  Edit: Because a demonstrably false post reply is still number one here.

 This is definitely the approach you should take.   So you haven't really given a language you want to do this in but here we go!      Java: Things like buttons can be assigned callbacks pretty easily by adding an ActionListener. It's basically what you have described so I think that would work nicely.      Python: I'm going to assume you have some sort of GUI (I suppose) that for the sake of the answer - is made with the wonderful and ever glamorous TK. Assuming you create a button on your screen through drawing on the canvas - you can use something like this:        root.bind('Key',lambda event: keyPressed(canvas,event))   This will make your clicks register to a function keyPressed. It might look like this:      def keyPressed(canvas,event):           if event.keysym == "Left":               if canvas.data.level  0:                   canvas.data.level -= 1                   canvas.delete(ALL)                   canvas.create_rectangle(-5,-5,canvas.data.row+5,canvas.data.col+5, fill='dark green')                   fractalMickeyMouse(canvas,canvas.data.xc,canvas.data.yc,canvas.data.r,canvas.data.level)    Alternatively you can use a TK Widget Button and just define callback.    Hope this helped.   You should look at using Java with Hibernate - sounds like it might be exactly what you are looking for!

 I don't need to, but at some point I really would like to have a child. My family life was crappy growing up and I always wanted to have my own that was better than what I had in the past.   I've been diagnosed with borderline personality. I know the state of my emotions changes in the blink of an eye sometimes. But then there's times like now that I just stay mostly sad and a little impulsive for weeks at a time.      My impulsive behavior hurts the few relationships that I have with close friends and leaves me feeling guilty and worse off than I was before I did whatever it was that I thought would make me feel better at the time. Its never predictable. Sometimes its sex, other times its pills and alcohol. Nothing ever done in excess enough to need any kind of rehab. I never fiend for anything, I just find myself needing something quickly to take my mind off of thoughts that I can't get out of my head.      Fighting with my roommate is the hardest. She has been my bestfriend sense the age of 11 and is really my only kind of support system. Its hard to hear her tell me that I really do need to get a grip on my emotions and stop looking for other people to make me happy. Its hard because I know that I really am an emotional wreck and have this incredibly terrible fear of being alone. I feel absolutely mentally broken at times.      Any romantic relationship I've ever tried to have has been disastrous. Knowing that I should spend more time on my own to make myself into a person that I actually like doesn't stop me from looking for someone to date. Its like an addiction that makes me feel absolutely disgusting because I know how other people see it.      I don't feel like I'm succeeding at whatever lesson I was meant to be working on in this lifetime and after all my failed attempts at dating lately, I think I'm going to be forced to spend time on my own until I can get myself on the right track.      But I'm really lonely. I don't have many friends and the close friends that I have managed to keep are starting their own families and getting married and having children and its heartbreaking to watch. The doctors tell me that I am running out of time for a chance to be able to have children myself because of a condition I have and I'm only 24. I'm afraid that maybe I'm not meant to have a family and I don't know if I'm strong enough to handle that.      I feel that maybe I chose a lesson for this life cycle that a little more tough than I am ready for and I don't know a way out of. I'm spiritual but I'm not religious and I don't know how to ask for help other than the few ways that I've tried. Nothing is working right and I don't know what path I'm even supposed to be on. I know I need help but I'm not sure where to find it. I've been in an inpatient hospital twice in the past six months and am unwilling to go back. I see a therapist once a month but she can really only do so much for me in an hour.      Its tough to see where I should be going from here   If you are still doing the free readings,   My question is:   What direction should I take in regards to romantic relationships?       I asked this question during a meditation session and I think I got a sort of sign but it was confusing, so I thought I'd ask someone to do a reading for clarification.   I haven't tried it before so thanks for the suggestion, I'll give it a try. Anything new helps   I'm going to give that a try, Thank you   Yes, thats more it than anything   I just rather not have anything that's going to redden and dry my skin out even more. My skin seems to be hyper sensitive to everything. Like with shaving, I have to be super careful and I usually always get red patches anyway.   I've tried hydrocortisone, which seems to increase the redness. Aloe also increases the redness. Vasoline was suggested but it seems to just cause my pores to clog up and feels gross and seems to cause the area to break out some.      Right now the thing that seems to help the most is olay night cream but I think that might be just because its keeping the area moisturized. It helps reduce the size of the scabs but not the redness.       I wanted to look into some more natural options than the olay cream that I keep slathered on at all times during the day.      [Would something like this clog the pores or make the healing process slower?](http://premeditatedleftovers.com/naturally-frugal-mom/diy-natural-baby-bottom-balm/)      Haha, poor pugger doesn't look terribly happy   [Picture of Tea Bag](http://imgur.com/7vFtuTC)  I drink at least 5 mugs of this "Cain's Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea" every day.      Its all that they stock at my office and I wanted to try some other flavors or types of teas that are also likely to keep me awake throughout the day.      Looking for some suggestions on good or fair quality loose leaf teas.      I'm completely new to all of the tea verbiage and am not sure where to start sampling. I'm reading through the FAQ's of this page now so hopefully I'll have a better idea soon but I would very much appreciate your suggestions as well!   Oh that is adorable!!  ^^  my pugger also sinks while flailing around all crazy   Woops. I edited the link to include an imgur image instead   [My Chart](http://imgur.com/SSAWTAb)      I have been wanting to find the best area to focus on in my life but feel like I'm almost fumbling around blindly right now. I can't decide what I feel that I would best at or what would make me the happiest. I tend to overanalyze and then overwhelm myself.      When I was younger I thought I would want to write, but I never seem to have the motivation to actually sit down and get everything typed out. I always get distracted with doing lots of interesting research for my stories. I thought maybe instead that I should look into a career in one of the things that I liked to read about. Maybe archaeology I thought, but the schooling seems so daunting if that ended up not being what I actually wanted to do, I would be wasting time. There seems to be a lot of traveling in that field, which is both exciting and scary at the same time. I've always lived in this one place and had the same bestfriend for years. I don't know if I can imagine a life away from her and I'm afraid that is holding me back. I can't decide if its my fear of doing something new that makes me apprehensive or my subconscious telling me that there is something that I would be better at doing closer to home here.      I've also wondered if I should focus on my spiritual studies as a choice of career because it is an area that does great interest me.     I was wondering if someone could look at my chart and tell me things that it would seem like I would good with. I've been trying to read some articles on how to more effectively read this chart myself but I would really like some outside opinions as well   I don't feel like I'm winning very much right now. The upper right group is pretty spot on. The upper left group matches as well, I have been feeling constant dissapointment with the outcome of almost everything I've tried to do lately. On the lower left group, I'm not really showy at all. I'm fairly shy. I am however quite emotional, or at least I show it more than some others that I know. Kind of like I've been wearing my heart on my sleeve lately and I'm not sure if thats what it could mean. As for the be yourself part, I'm not sure what direction I want my life to go in right now, which direction is really right for me. I've been trying to find the right area to focus myself on so that I stop looking for a relationship with all the wrong people and try to just make myself happy instead. Its too bad that is the area that I"m having the most trouble with right now. I wish I felt more in control of things :p      For some reason I thought I had actually responded to this already  .     I've  thought about going back to school but the thought of racking up thousands more in student loans is scary but I have been thinking about switching my major to something more along the lines of archaeology so I will definitely put more thought into it.      As for the job, I'm at an entry level position now and don't have a very good job history. Hopefully if I can get some more schooling, that might be an option further down the line.      It is a dilemma. I'm interested in tarpits lately so tomorrow I hope to be able to find one close by that me and my roommate could go see.   	16
 Thanks for the advice love!   That actually made more sense than all the YouTube videos I have been pouring over. lol   Thanks so much love! Yeah I was trying to take the advice, but I still struggle with...I think maybe it's the play of light on skin? Not sure if there is a better word for that?   Thanks love!   I'm always on the hunt for more art books!      	4

    A very old photo album was found in the parking lot of our business the other day and it does not belong to anyone at our company.  It may have been stolen and then later dumped in our lot.   There are pages and pages of old portraits dating back to the 1800s and in very good condition.  This has to be someones prized possession and I would really like them to have it back.   Witholding photos so the owner can be verified. If you think it is yours please pm me.   I have had a nail fall off a rabbit I was trimming (they had been left to grow too long and it must have been damaged running around or something). The quick was sticking out and there was no nail left on it, the nail was on the ground and I looked and there was a hollow place inside where the quick fit.   If this is similar to what is going on with your rabbit - I wouldn't worry as long as she isn't bleeding profusely. Also, what sneaky_dragon advised about keeping an eye on it for infection. You can put a little neosporin on it - just use the kind without pain relief.   Make sure the other nails are trimmed up short so they don't get damaged, and buy some styptic power (kwik-stop). If you ever have a nail problem in the future you can put a little of that on to stop the bleeding.    Your growth pics should have told them it was working! It looks amazing and I wish my first year garden looked half as good.   Came here to say this.    Practice! This video is great for learning. And have styptic powder on hand in case you do clip the quick - it stops bleeding quickly.   http://www.howcast.com/videos/514678-how-to-trim-your-rabbits-nails-pet-rabbits/  u/domcolosi is right - your rabbit has light nails. You should be able to see the pink quick inside the clear nail. The ideal is to leave about 1/8" length past the quick and cut it at an angle so the nail will lay flat on the floor.   http://www.disabledrabbits.com/uploads/1/2/8/8/12889966/3751251_orig.jpg   I thought so   Yeah cuz everyone wants to get tattooed by a creeper.   What is this guy?   So when I leave them bone dry they get really shriveled - it is super hot out here even though I am keeping them in shade with only indirect light while getting started. I cut them all about a week and a half ago and had them piled up in the black plastic pots so they could callus over. I have just been misting them daily which seems to be keeping them perky so far... when I tried watering every few days on another startup at least 50% of them died.  :-/   SO COOL   I have sort of become known as the succulent lady and keep being given succulents. I have gotten to work sorting them into mixed pots.       Not that he was anything special by the time of the vid - but Hasselhoff drunk on the floor of the bathroom with a cheeseburger was image-ruining      looks like it!   terrifying.   Yes updates please!   SO here. The rescue we are looking at adopting from also has a "trial period" - so if the bird really isn't working out with our current bird we can try another. So we do have it in mind that it is a companion for the current bird, but we are aware that it is also a new pet for us and we should like the bird.  As far as keeping them caged separately and taking it slow - we have to keep the bird for 90 days in a separate room from our bird before even letting them interact in neutral territory - so we will get plenty of time to get to know the bird ourselves before trying out the bond.   Thanks for the input!   I just shook it a little and they rained down all around the plant - guess they will start if they start haha.  Thanks for the link!   I posted a pic of my blooming plant a while back and now it is dried up and hollow with little white flakes like dandruff inside. Is this a succulent seed pod?  Link to pics: http://imgur.com/a/B2tFO   Is that what it's called? Cool, I was so surprised to go out and see that one, and then there is another bud all ready to go!       Everyone is only saying how the people died, not how they dealt with it or if they felt supported. Sigh.    Best bunny birthday cake ever!   things i never thought i'd learn in r/sex   wtf is scrapple?   What a great photo! Perfect timing and very crisp - love it!       mad world - donnie darko   Did you bond them?   Exactly. Besides, half of what I found interesting about Negan was [] (/c "his interactions with Carl. I think Carl needs to go through some shit and get his eyepatch before they bring in the big bad guy." )   Same thing happens to me. The ones I'm not paying attention to propagate.  Anything I try to just dies   I don't understand why everyone thinks Negan is coming so soon. In the comics [] (/c "they were attacked by Scavengers -maybe the wolves?- which drew a large herd of walkers and Carl loses his eye during them trying to fight off the Walkers. The hilltop gets introduced before Negan ever shows up. I'm betting on a finale where Carl gets shot in the face and no one knows if he will be alive for the next season or not.")  	34
 I dream of being able of turning my house into a haunted house every year. How much do you think a transformation like this would cost?            Yay! I'm glad that I'm not the only one who is terrified of Monstro !   Very interesting, I'm not sure if it's creepy worthy however.   Definitely odd, but not creepy.    Hey fellow teachers, In August I will be teaching at a new school(7-12). The current Language Arts teacher is very, very into ECAR(every child a reader) and ECAW(every child a writer). I have done a little research into this program, and it seems to be geared towards elementary age kids, not middle school(what I teach). I am very hesitant to adopt this new teaching program. Any thoughts out there? Are there benefits?   Just love Ol' Blue Eyes!!  	9

Yes, it has its faults, but I still thought it was a decent entry to the Tobey trilogy. I just think everyone had really high expectations for this one after the masterpiece that was the 2nd.  The movie I can't stand but everyone seems to love is Django Unchained. I thought at this point in time and through all his previous films over the years, the good ol' Tarantino formula and style began to wore out on me.   Watch any Sako match with Skisonic commentating and you will understand.   I was one of the very few people that voted Gamerbee to win Evo. So close :(   At least Daigo lost to the best juri player in the world/japan.   Damn imagine how Gamerbee would feel if he got 2nd place at Capcom Cup.   Daigo didn't even played badly. Ai Ai Juri play was beyond insane and thoroughly outplayed him. So happy he won and made top 8 at EVO. I hope to see him appear future tournaments to come.   The saddening thing was Daigo even admitted before Evo he was scared of him because of Ultra 1 so he should've used another character. Again Daigo's biggest weakness of his pride when it comes to counter-picking is shown here. I hope him watching Top 8 EVO makes him realise this.   Who are toughest players you've versed in Ultra Sf4?   Wasn't this the first time Gamerbee has ever beaten Infiltration at a tournament? Alongside with Daigo, Infiltration was also Gamerbee's demon.   Sorry! I just added it :)   List on the most well-known names:  Daigo - 5 times: (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)  Infiltration - 4 times: (2010, 2012, 2013, 2015)  Gamerbee - 4 times: (2010, 2012, 2013, 2015)  PR Balrog - 4 times: (2009, 2012, 2013, 2015)  Tokido - 3 times: (2011, 2013, 2015)  Ricki Ortiz - 3 times: (2009, 2010, 2014)  Momochi - 2 times: (2014, 2015)  Fuudo - 2 times: (2011, 2014)  Poongko - 2 times: (2011, 2012)  Sako - 2 times: (2013, 2014)  Luffy - 1 time: (2014)  Xian - 1 time: (2013)  Bonchan - 1 time: (2014)  Justin Wong - 1 time: (2009)  Mike Ross - 1 time (2010)   Fun facts for this year's Ultra at EVO:  - Infiltration has gotten 3rd place at SF4 series 3 times now: 2010, 2013 and now 2015.  - Gamerbee has gotten 2nd place at SF4 series twice now: 2012 and now 2015.  - 2nd time ever at EVO for the SF4 series that the bracket has reset in Grand Finals.  - Infiltration used 8 different characters in this year's Ultra tourney: Juri, Chun Li, Evil Ryu, Akuma, Elena, Decapre, Ryu and Abel.  - Momochi has now beaten Infiltration 3-2 in their last 3 encounters at 3 different tournaments: Stunfest, South East Asia Major and now EVO.   - This is the first time a Juri (s) has been represented in SF4 at Top 8 EVO.  - Gamerbee has now been in Top 8 four times for SF4 series: 2010, 2012, 2013,  and now 2015.  - Infiltration has now been in Top 8 four times for SF4 series: 2010, 2012, 2013, and now 2015.  - PR Balrog has now been in Top 8 four times for SF4 series: 2009, 2012, 2013 and now 2015.  - Tokido has now been in Top 8 three times for SF4 series: 2011, 2013 and now 2015.  - Ultra SF4 Top 8 EVO peaked at 228,776 views as well as other streams to make it 254K was the highest for the entire weekend and also EVO history.   [](/Kappa)   Amazing Ultra got the most views considering it was very late at night for other parts of the world.   The top 10 list on CPT points standing looks perfectly accurate for the ten best players in the world right now.   Gamerbee came 2nd also in EVO 2012. Heartbreaking for him to get runner up again after all that work.   	17

I do have a protein shake pre-workout     	15
 If it creates a story in your head then I've done my job!   Glad to hear that :) thank you!   Soak part of the palette in water and then dab in some white paint so it gets nice and dilute.

You can frame it normally if you want. its just personal preference. Thanks man glad you like it!   1 more coming up in the next few days   The feeling of someone recognizing your work is indescribably amazing :) thanks man   I tried to measure it but my attention span doesn't allow for perfection :p   That's what I like to hear :) thanks man   People asking for commissions have been nothing but flaky so far but I'd definitely consider a serious offer!

Here's an example of entitlement for you. Graduating and immediately getting a job. Don't even try to pretend that we have it easy.   Yeah because your generation wasn't exactly the same way. The 60s 70s and 80s were oh so classy and selfless   This is your tank on drugs   Non Americans don't have boogers   Think about how when you're really drunk you want to stay awake and keep having fun. You don't want to go to sleep but it's so easy and feels so good to just kind of slip away. I imagine death as being similar to that. Why should I waste life being afraid of something that's easy.   I had a porcelain crab that hosted a green star colony. Hed rub his butt in them and use his claws to pull them up around his face.  It was weirdly adorable to watch   Dude was HAND STITCHING the leather    With that attitude you DEFINITELY wont   The universe's vagina. Such a sight to behold!   I had a beautiful reef lobster who I was worried about putting in with my eel but he was so much bigger that I thought there's no way anything could happen. Until he got bitten clear in half.

I still don't buy it but it looks way more appealing.   We can't tell if you're being sarcastic   (    )  sorry what   Freshwater shrimp are so stubby and adorable   RIP circuzninja   Doesn't this noob know that logic isn't welcome here?

Serious question   Dats un awesome looking car   If Garfield ate only the house his head would be on the outside and John would be in his stomach   Reminds me of an old couple sitting in lawn chairs at the beach   It's my all time top comment :p just one word   I'm 24 and I plan to be senile by 40 so they had better hurry up.   http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20141108002016/spongebob/images/5/50/Tumblr_luj53x1hDB1r10maf.png   As is his username   I was thinking of doing a screen print of that. Maybe gold on black with some cocky hashtag on the back   As would my 23 - 25 year old friends :p  Thanks!   What if in the alternate reality it's me in the garbage  	118
    I've had mine longer haha :)   no worries.. I guess looking it it it would appear it was in good shape and I threw some rims on it... not the case.  When I got this car it was not very desirable. The right fender and bumper were scratched and dented, it had clearly been in an accident. The headlights were oxidized to the point that they were actually piss yellow. rear speakers didn't work, interior was clean but smelled like mildew... found a leak and fixed that. the drivers side window had fallen off of the track and fallen into the door panel which was a real pain in the ass to get to. Engine bay looked like it hadnt been cleaned once, the poor thing even had it's original battery! One of the cells wasn't charging anymore so trying to start in the winter did not happen. And of course the car was rolling on hubcaps and steelies too haha.  yeah there was just so so so much, it was a year of work before I even got to make it pretty!   totally! There's always someone more suited to your interests... I actually bought this jetta right around the time we met. It was rough but his buddy had a shop so we were able to do a lot of the work there!  He had a shitty civic that was on its way out when we met, I convinced him to go the vw route with me and we've been working on then together ever since :)   I'll talk to my SO about all of that! Were you working on an mk5 at some point?? :)   Thank you, I've been having a lot of fun with it! We spend most Sundays in the summer working on it at my friends shop, he just got his this so he hasn't put much into it, just some work into the engine and interior audio.... all stuff you can't really see in a single picture hahaha.  looks like I should post an album of some of the work in the future! :)   damn... sucks to come onto this sub looking for conversation with other Volkswagen owners for the first time and receive a comment that harsh :(   I bought my car with body damage and several other issues.... which of course aren't pictured. It looks like this after two years of work which I am extremely proud of... i lurk a lot and I finally felt i got it to a point where i could post it. I guess don't judge a book by its cover, the finished product is only half of the story.   The point here is that I share the same affinity for vw's as everyone else here, and while I don't have the budget to do a full rebuild, I'm still enjoying working on a car within my limits... :/  Edit: Also if you'd like to know where I started with this car, I'd be happy to pm anyone some "before" pictures in the morning, since apparently I need to prove myself since this picture doesn't show a step by step of my build....      totally get it! That's why I tried to clear it up as much as possible in the comments :)   I'm a girl..... It's very clear if you had looked at my profile. So I'm in no way a "bro defending frat boy". He tried to convince her to continue, she didn't and she left immediately. There was no rape. She was not held down or forced to continue.   I'm tired of every little thing being rape today! She noticed people staring and didn't want to continue, he was messed up and wanted to convince her to continue but didn't succeed. That was that, she left 3 seconds later.   no because I witnessed it. You guys seem to be reading it as if she was fucked for several minutes afterwards. He tried to hug her and convince her to continue with the classic "babe come on, don't worry about them ect ect. for 4 seconds. the moment she pulled off if him he let her go.  it's not like she was held by her wrists and fucked until he finished. I watched it and it was nothing like that, this was seriously taken out of context!   you guys seem to be reading it as if she was fucked for several minutes afterwards. He tried to hug her and convince her to continue with the classic "babe come on, don't worry about them ect ect. for 4 seconds. the moment she pulled off if him he let her go.  it's not like she was held by her wrists and fucked until she finished. I watched it and it was nothing like that, this was seriously taken out of context!   then she was raped for an entire 4 seconds, because that's how long he tried to convince her lol   He literally only tried to hold her with him for a matter of seconds. He was all "baby come on don't worry don't worry" and then let her go when she got pissed. He was essentially trying to convince her to continue, not hold her down by her wrists and fuck her.   I mean honestly, she was very aware that she was being analy fucked. And if it wasn't consensual there were plenty of people around that she could have told lol   she only tried to get off of him after everyone noticed and she got embarassed. He tried to keep her on him for a matter of 5 seconds, all "babe come on it doesn't matter don't worry ect ect ect" and then let her off.   She was very clearly enjoying it initially, trust me. And if it was rape there were 15 people in her vecinity that she could have told at any time.   having anal sex in a hot tub at a high school party surrounded by upwards of 15 strangers kind of is.   He literally only tried to hold her with him for a matter of seconds. He was all "baby come on don't worry don't worry" and then let her go when she got pissed.   I mean honestly, she was very aware that she was being analy fucked. And if it wasn't consensual there were plenty of people around that she could have told lol   He literally only tried to hold her with him for a matter of seconds.

And if it wasn't consensual there were plenty of people around that she could have told lol. She was definitely into it before it became fucking shameful.   Your guess is as good as mine, I think he had a condom but I'm not sure if that would help or actually make it worse lmfao   Not exactly. MDMA is the essential ingredient in Ecstacy, but it's very often mixed with speed or other amphetamines. That's what makes it a "different" drug.   exactly. Nasty ass molly shits in a hot tub.... ugh.   Back in highschool i went to an outdoor pool party at this rich kids house while his parents were away. It was a really nice place, huge pool, an outdoor gazebo with a built in hottub, bar and showers, a full tennis court, and a horseshoe pit to name a few of the things. The kids parents were clearly loaded, so he decided to have people over to treat it all like crap, just as any teenager would.  So everyone's drinking and running around jumping in and out of the pool (pretty bad idea but all ideas were bad when you were 17) and having a pretty good time. I'm walking around with a few of my guy friends from the time, and we decide we want to have a few beers in the hot tub. It was really big one so we hoped there'd be room. We get to the gazebo and go inside and sure enough there's a little space. One of the guys goes in, and I just sit on the edge and put the bottoms of my legs in.   Now like I said it was a big hot tub, there had to be at least 10 people in the thing, everyone's talking and yelling and carrying on, so no one really noticed the guy and the girl on the left side were actually fucking. Like fucking under the water while everyone else was there. She looked like she was on something, definitely E or molly, he was just drunk as hell. I noticed they were doing something fuckey over there so I nudged my friend and pointed to them, he started laughing and hopped out of the water, and at that point everyone noticed and started calling them out on their nasty shit.   So the girl freaked out and started trying to pull away from him, but he was trying to pull her back onto him, obviously too drunk to care. At this point soo many people are screaming and carrying on about this, that anyone within 20 feet knows something is up. It's a huge scene when she finally manages to pull off of him, but this is the best part... they were doing anal. They were doing fucking anal! She pulls off way too fast, and her as must have been relaxed from the hot tub or something, because she shits aaaalll in this kids hot tub. Like gross amphetamine type shit. The dude proceeds to FREAK the fuck out and jumps out of the tub, and she is literally surrounded by people while she swims in her own warm watery shit.   She gets out, shit still stuck to her, and runs the fuck off of the property. It was a huge thing in our city for the next year, like the biggest thing to ever happen haha. I was actually really happy I got to witness it, but I never saw the girl again.  TL;DR: Girl gets publicly ass fucked in a hot tub and loses her shit, literally.   I don't think Mr. Rogers wanted anyone to be 200 pounds overweight either...     	24
 Perhaps you should read about Howard Gardner's work.   So you're more constructive than me because you read books whereas I play video games?   Perhaps, however I remember back when I worked at a grocery store some of my worst customers were old people who didn't give a shit and would snap at me and my coworkers over the smallest things.   He asked for my achievements/credentials and getting my degree is something I personally consider my achievement.   I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering and currently I'm doing my masters. I have read books for my education, just dislike reading them in my sparetime.   Yeah, I don't like reading books. So what? I don't have the attention span to sit there for hours and constantly read words. It just becomes tedious to me. It doesn't mean I'm not smart, it doesn't mean that I'm any less intelligent than people who read books. Just means that I find it boring to read and prefer to stimulate myself other ways like watching movies or playing video games. I'm sosick and tired of people looking down on those who don't like reading.      Guess so.   Yes, stop playing FIFA games and stop posting FIFA crap, unless you don't care about the slave workers.   Because I'm seeing you morons posting FIFA games and all other FIFA crap like nothing has happened. Good job keeping the momentum going, reddit. You guys are pathetic.   Which you failed to do.   I'm not wasting your time, I'm helping other guys not waste their time.   Whatever, mind your own business.   Unfortunately my fedora powers are unmatched to your original post.   Then go and talk to your bf instead of wasting other guy's time.   Jeg har intet imod at I svarer tilbage, jeg har bare ikke andet at sige end min mening.   Jeg ytrede min mening? Har jeg ikke lov til det?   Ja der findes sprgsml derinde, det er lidt ligesom det som er pointen? Prv at kigge p svarene istedet.   Ja, fordi vi har utroligt meget brug for uddannede mennesker indenfor zombie-studier: http://ekstrabladet.dk/vrangen/article4746284.ece  Tror du selv p at en studerende ville betale flere tusind kroner p et latterligt kursus hvis det var for deres egne penge? Men nr nu det er skatteyderne som skal betale, jamen hvorfor s ikke?  Og jeg hvis man brnder for at blive lge eller ingenir, s har man mulighed for at f det financieret selv. Der findes legater, community colleges, osv. I USA til at opfylde denne drm. Der er ikke mere mangel p hjtuddannede i USA i forhold til i Danmark, hilket viser at uddannelsessystemet fungerer liges godt som herhjemme, hvis ikke bedre efter min mening. Jeg behver ikke at f skatteyderne til at trre mig i rven, den kan jeg godt klare selv.   Ja det havde jeg. S ville jeg nemlig have arbejdet i nogle r og tjent mine egne penge og bagefter taget en uddannelse, eller jeg ville have taget et ln og derefter betalt den af efter jeg fik et ordentligt job. Og nej, den gld delgger ikke dit liv, mange studerende i USA kan betale deres gld af i lbet af f r efter deres uddannelse er endt, kig blot i /r/personalfinance  Lad vr med at bilde mig ind at det kun er et socialistisk samfund som kan give dig en uddannelse.   og hvorfor skal jeg tvinges til at gre det? Hvis jeg ikke gider hjlpe andre, s er det min ret til ikke at blive tvunget til at hjlpe andre. Jeg gider sgu da ikke at begynde at hjlpe hele verden bare fordi at dit hjerte blder for dem. jeg forventer ingen hjlp fra andre.  Hvis du er s ivrig efter at hjlpe flygtninge, s giv dit hus/lejlighed til flygtninge og donr 90% af fin indtgt til velgrenhed. S kan du bo p en bnk og leve for hvad der svarer til en SU. Det er der tusinder af hjemlse som gr og det kan du ogs samtidigt med at du hjlper en masse flygtninge. Kom s igang, men lad vr med at tvinge mig ind i dit flelsesporno pis.   Ville nok vre ligeglad.   Er ligeglad.   Europa har ingen gavn af flygtninge.      Jesus, relax. Nobody except for the very die hard fans are going to care if he insults the game. First of all, it's his opinion and he's entitled to it. Second of all, it's a comedy show so chances are, he will exaggerate his statements to make them funnier which is working as I and many others found the episode hilarious.  I would love to watch Arin play Ocarina of Time as it's my favorite game of all time. I know he's going to insult it a lot but I'm completely fine with that, and so will 99% of the other people who love the game. Because it's a comedy channel and because we don't take insults to our favorite games personal.  If you want to stop watching Game Grumps, then go ahead. but while you're at it you might want to also invest in a rock that you can live under since if this is all that it takes for you to get offended, you might as well spare yourself and your feelings from the outside world.  Also, tableflip will be released for all in a month or two. Get over it already and let them earn extra money to run the show.      Dunno how to blur photos or names on my phone but the message I received this morning:  Kindly fuck off.. Only interested in women  Her orientation was listed as bisexual and queer, left her profile when I noticed it said "Looking for women". Never sent her any messages or interacted with her in any way.  Another message i received from a different girl several months ago told me I was a creep and a pervert, etc. again, only visited her profile, nothing more   Here's an idea how to avoid this: Stop using bisexual as your sexual orientation!  Maybe you are in fact bisexual but only want to date women which is fine. But here's the thing. When us men browse profiles and a woman is listed as bisexual, we assume that it means they're attracted to men too.  Now if said woman writes that she only wants to to date women, most of us will leave your profile again.  But DON'T start sending us messages insulting us, calling us creeps and pigs because god forbid we clicked on your profile thinking you were attracted to both genders! it's not cool receiving a notification on your phone thinking a girl finally messaged you (happens rarely) only to be greeted by a sexist insulting message because last night you happened to click on a profile once! Thank you!  And yes, this does not happen often and most lesbians/bisexuals are sweet and understanding but good lord some of these few extremists really know how to grind your balls. I wish I could say incidents like that have only happened to me once!  	29

                            I don't see the difference between the two.  Maybe Ali had nobler motives, but the goal was the same:  to avoid participating in an immoral, illegal and criminal war.      He defied the State, so yes he was a hero (in this one particular instance).   And I thought Obama ended the Afghan War...                                                                                                                                                                                       Good to know!                                                   The story has 173 comments.  Do you think the readers of /politics think the story is "off topic?"  So am I correct that the only political stories nowadays that can be posted to /politics are stories about Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump?  If you ask me, that's going to make this subreddit incredibly boring.                                                   The man of many reddit IDs.  Gary, I can always recognize your writing style.  Keep up the good fight (from your point of view).      But all is not lost. Far from it. Kabul is much safer than most cities in war zones  and for that matter, **a number of cities in Latin America.**  Which cities (plural) in Latin America are more dangerous than Kabul?  Please Mr. Petraeus, give me one.                     And a million dead Iraqis?  Where are the photos of that atrocity?                                       It will end like Iraq no matter when we eventually pull out.  We should never have gone in and we shouldn't make matters worse for us or for the Afghans by remaining any longer.                  From the story:  "Mrs. Clinton has made support for gay people one of the cornerstones of her presidential campaign."  This was a political act to attempt to secure the votes of the gay community.  If it had been "nonpolitical" then we would never have heard about Mrs. Clinton's post because she would have sent a private message instead.  And her campaign certainly wouldn't have publicized the missive by sharing it with the world on Twitter.  I noticed that you've only been on reddit for a couple of years and a moderator for far less time.  I think you should run some of the posts you propose to delete by a more experienced mod before you act.  It makes me think that you have a particular political bent and are simply deleting stories that don't fit within your bias.   How is an article about a front-running presidential candidate and her attempts to secure a major liberal voting bloc not appropriate for /politics?  Are we now to the point that the only stories that are acceptable for posting to /politics have to be about Bernie Sanders?            Which one?  Bush wasn't the president when Iraq War III was launched against ISIS.                              Yes, because Obama has never started or escalated any wars during his presidency.         One man asked whether the war wounds had been "worth it." That last incident angered Porta more than the others. "Freedom is not free," he said in a 2013 interview with USA TODAY.                              The story is posted at CNN *Politics*.  How can this not be appropriate for this subreddit?  The display of the Confederate flag has been the most heated political issue in the USA for 2 weeks.  Do you need me to provide you with some links to confirm?                                                      Cant we find better military role models to serve as examples to our modern soldiers?  Like [William Tecumseh Sherman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea)?                                                   "The officer, when he went up to handcuff the man, was shocked to find just the cloth there and nothing under the cloth," Fullerton said. "It's unfortunate, but you can't expect officers to be clairvoyant and wait until they get shot at to actually know what this person is doing or thinking."                 	204

 *She's out of your league, bruh...*       I never forgot the sting of that random internet comment. Sure I had lips so big they had once received an honorable mention in the '89 Guinness Book. Sure my bank account usually needed a telescope to get a good look at a snake's belly. Sure me and integrity had never set foot in the same zip code intentionally, but fuck it; I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and so the fuck what if my mother spent the better part of the 70's calculating ingenious ways to deep six my ass.          *She's out of your league, bruh...*             That remark would echo in my head for some time to come along with my wife's paranoid ramblings of entities, ghouls, demons, poltergeists and other assorted supernatural nasties that I had hitherto never contemplated with any degree of seriousness.                 As soon as the tabloids picked up on the pending nuptials the internet had made its opinion known. A rich and famous Brazilian supermodel marrying a failed (in the following chronological order) stand-up comedian, novelist, actor, ballroom dancer, grifter and boxer. Worse, a thrice divorced polyfailure at that. Worse, an overweight, balding and shorter by a foot than my supermodel wife all of the aforementioned.             Well, Claudia Santovalla Rodofranco Pern married yours truly nonetheless. You see, while I most certainly ain't good looking neither am I shy nor have I ever been afraid to look a supermodel in the eye. You see it all went down like this just a short 749 days ago...               During training for my black belt in judo my friend Mel had gotten a little carried a way and thrown me off the mat into a vintage radiator.        The back of my head clanged with the hot metal both creating a gash and then partially searing it. This had left a nice scar and concussion as a souvenir thus ending my judo career; so what's another failure?         After my head injury I seemed to develop a mid-life crisis and had decided since I had been a failure at everything else I would try my hand at bank robbery. And if that failed than I would try my hand at bungee diving sans bungee cord. Well, that was the plan anyway. But isn't that when life always rears its ugly head, when we're making other plans?            So there I was on a beautifully crisp autumn day in late September standing outside the bank trying to get my nerve up when I suddenly felt dizzy and nauseous. I involuntarily reached out my hand to steady myself and by serendipity groped Claudia's A-cup.       "What do you think you are doing!?!?!" she yelled indignantly drawing the attention of passersby.       "What a creep! Oh my! Stanley!?!?! Stanley? That *is* you..."             It was Ludmilla my old ballroom dancing teacher.       "Feel dizzy..." was all I could manage before I could manage no more.      I came to a couple of minutes later with Ludmilla and Claudia hovering over me like guardian angels and ice cold spring water pouring down my giant shnoz.      "What happened?"      "You fainted Stanley."      "Can you get up?" Claudia asked.      "I think so..."      I was a little unsteady on my feet and both Ludmilla and Claudia put an arm around me to brace me. Just then a bright light flashed in my face followed by another and another. Was this the end of the line? Was I dying? I checked the end of the tunnel. There was no Jesus to be found, just some slimy paparazzi with an unkempt beard and a safari jacket with matching hat.           "Claudia! Baby! Who're your friends?"           "Get away from me hellspawn! You're one of those entities!"         "Come on baby! Just a few more! I gotta make a payment on my summer house in the Hamptons."          "I said, 'Begone Demon!!!!!'"           Just then a passing messenger yelled in my still ringing ears, "You gonna take that shit, Tarzan?" before jumping on his one speed and disappearing down Broadway.          The next thing I knew paparazzi demon was loaded on my hip before being launched airborne into an indifferent fire hydrant.           "I'll sue! Sue you! Sue everybody!"      "Come on," Claudia yelled. "Let's go! Before his minions come to his aid!"         And just like that me, Ludmilla and Claudia cheesed it before the cops could arrive. A few blocks later we stopped to catch our collective breaths.          "Are you okay, Stanley?"         "I need a drink Ludmilla. Maybe four."          And just like that, at 2:30 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, I found myself seated in a subterranean bar in lower Manhattan with Claudia the supermodel and Ludmilla the North American Latin Ballroom champion of 2007-2009. They were no lightweights, let me tell you.      Eight martinis later Claudia said, "You know, I have not laughed in forever. I cannot even remember the last time I laughed. I think maybe I am possessed. There is a priest I have heard of in Sao Paulo who can perform an exorcism..."          "I can make you laugh," I said.       "Bet you cannot."      "Bet I can."      "Can't."    "Can."     Ludmilla watched us go back and forth like she was watching a tennis match between retards.      "Oh, just make her laugh already Stanley."       "Okay," I said. "A skeleton walks into a bar. He bellies up to said bar taking a seat. The skeleton drops a twenty on the bar and lights a filterless Camel. The bartender walks over to where he's sitting and says, 'What'll you have, pal?'        Skeleton blows a smoke ring and says, 'A beer and a mop.'         Ludmilla arched a Croatian eyebrow in my direction. Claudia the supermodel looked at me quizzically for a moment. A moment later she spat a mouthful of Apple Martini in my face bursting into laughter.          "A beer and a mop!" she squealed. "A beer and a mop. I am going to pee myself!"          "Then you'll need a mop too," Ludmilla said.        That only made Claudia laugh harder. After a while she just shook soundlessly as tears poured down her emaciated face. Eventually she got it under control and announced to the table, "I gotta pee so bad."       Four martinis and one cab ride later I was on the floor of Claudia's penthouse suite having the best drunken sex of my life I could remember.          *She's out of your league, bruh...*                A month later Claudia informed me she was pregnant. I never asked if it was mine. I just saw it as an opportunity.      "Marry me?"      "Okay!"  We were married a month later in New Orleans and on our honeymoon Claudia promptly had a miscarriage. After that things went from bad to worse and then from worse to worser and then finally all the way to worsest and beyond.        But alas, Claudia was a strict Catholic and the thought of divorce was, well unthinkable for her. Even her mother who hated me with a xx-large capital "H" warned her that divorced women do not pass go but rather go straight to hell.      As for me, well I was now living the high life on Claudia's dime and I had no intention of giving it up to go back to being some loser's middle-aged loser roommate working dead-end jobs while my expanding beer gut made any hope of ever seeing my penis again a horrifically remote possibility.           After losing the baby Claudia was convinced that she had somehow fallen from God's good graces and that there must certainly be unadulterated evil afoot.             "It could be an evil entity, Stanley. I knew I should have doubled the tithe..."             "Maybe... I have been experiencing sleep paralysis lately."         "You too? I have as well."         "Or maybe it's a demon... Or maybe a whole horde of demons! Maybe they conspired to take over your uterus?"          "I don't know what to do. I'm so depressed I can barely get out of bed to keep the shrine lit. And worse, all I want to do is eat ice cream."      Now I do not have to tell you that a three month ice cream binge is not going to work wonders for a supermodel's career. Slowly but surely one pint turned into two and then three and Claudia's once super fine ass slowly went from Very Good to Good to Fair to Poor condition by Comic Book Price Guide standards.      "Well, you're already filthy rich babe. Who cares if you get fat?"      "Are you saying I got fat?!?!?!?!"     "No. No. That's just what *they're* saying..."       And with that Claudia threw a pimento fork at me that just missed my eye before going on her third crying jag of the morning. The truth was I had had it with this crazy bitch. I hadn't gotten laid since the honeymoon and I had no money of my own. I was a beast in a gilded cage and I wanted out but I had signed the dreaded... dum-duh-dum... prenuptial agreement.          Yeppers. I could walk away anytime. Not drive. Not fly. Not bicycle. Not take mass transit. Walk. Cause that was the only form of locomotion I could afford on my own steam.              *She's out of your league, dude.*          And that's when it hit me. Like a volleyball in the face. I had a plan. Thank you random internet douche.             "Claudia, I'd like to introduce Dr. Vonnegut."      "Why is this man in my house, Stanley?"     "Dr. Vonnegut is a weight-loss and depression specialist."      That got Claudia's attention.       "So, you can eat as many as you like and I guarantee you will lose weight like nobody's business, you betcha!"      "It seems to good to be true," Claudia squealed like a kid on Christmas.      "Well, thank you Dr. Vonnegut," I said and walked him to the door.     Back in the bedroom Claudia began to dig in to the gigantic crate of Slim Jim's that Dr. Vonnegut had modified for Claudia's benefit. They were real beef, that is, in addition to mechanically separated chicken, corn and wheat proteins, lactic acid cultures, dextrose, salt, sodium nitrite, and the ever-tasty hydrolyzed soy with a sixteenth of a gram of 99% pure Bolivian Rock and just a sprinkle of heroin.        "I can't stop eating these, Stanley. They're really tasty this is the best diet I've ever been on it's not like a diet no I don't wanna have sex but can we just stay up all night making shadows on the walls because shadows are the other side of God's light and when he said let there be light there was gonna be light and sometimes when I bend down to tie my shoes hey let's go jogging and go get a dog and do not touch my Slim Jim's."      So after having gained fifty pounds of Ben   Jerry cottage cheese on her Brazilian ass the Slim Jim Escobar diet had now shed thirty-five pounds of that in nearly six weeks.       *She's out of your league, bruh...*          Finally Claudia was a few pounds away from her runway weight but unfortunately she had massive black circles under her eyes and looked very much like the ghouls, entities, spooks, demons and other assorted supernatural and paranormal freak-outs that her strict Catholic upbringing had instilled deep in her id run amok.      "Honey. Dr. Vonnegut is here."     "Ooooh. Dr. Vonnegut. Do you have something for awake non-paralysis?"     "Yes, dear. I'm going to give you an examination and a shot. It will help you to sleep."     "Okay."      "Well, she's finally asleep."     "How's her health?"     "Not so bad. But I'm gonna fix that."      "I knew you would Dr. Vonnegut."      "Anybody ever tell you she's out of your league, Stan?"      "Just the voices in and outside my head."      An hour later Dr. Vonnegut had stitched the last stitch and was dressing the wound.       "Take two of these and I'll be back in the morning," Dr. Vonnegut said handing me two jumbo vials of crack.     "Will do."     ...      "Cancer?!?!?! Cancer?!?!!? But I'm back to my runway weight! I'm in the pink! This can't be happening."      "I'm afraid so. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosissarcoma is a very rare form too that supposedly only afflicted Hitler, Stalin and Colonel Sanders and we've only figured that out recently. Even with aggressive treatment you probably only have two weeks to live at the outside."          "This cannot be happening!"         "Dr. Vonnegut! Isn't there anything we can do?"      "Well, there is one thing, but, no, I really shouldn't say."      "What is it!?!? You must tell me!! I cannot lose Claudia!"      "Yes, Dr. Vonnegut. What can I do?" Claudia asked wide-eyed and panic-stricken.      "Cryogenics."     "You want to freeze me after I die?"      "No. I want to freeze you before you get any worse. A colleague of mine has invented a new method of cryogenic preservation but it is unapproved and extremely risky."      "What are the odds it will work?"     "50/50."     "What are the odds the cancer will kill her?" I asked.     "Guaranteed."      "Doctor, I'll only hear of it under one condition."     Claudia looked at me quizzically, her mouth still agape the past five minutes since being delivered her grim prognosis.     "Condition? Hmm?"     "I want to be frozen right alongside my wife. I do not believe in divorce nor do I believe in separation."      Claudia's face softened. For the first time in two years she looked at me with something less than disgust, hatred, venom and resentment.      "But there are no guarantees, Stanley."     "I do not care. I made a vow to God and man that I would love and honor my wife till death do us part not deep freeze."      "I warn you both. Not only is it not guaranteed but it is extremely expensive."      "How much is it?" I asked.      "Two million dollars each."     "Pish posh," said Claudia waving her hand. "I have millions."      "But when will we be awoken?"      "In the future."     "And what will we do for money then?"      "I suggest you convert whatever assets you have into gold. The cryogenic lab has a vault. One never knows what the future holds in store. Or if there will even be a civilization as we know it."      "Can we have some time to th-"     "I don't need to think! I am too young and too beautiful to die. Tell your Doctor friend we will do it. Stanley, get me my laptop and some more Slim Jims. I will make the arrangements ahora mismo."      ...      And for two weeks; she was lovey dovey.        And then with eleven million in gold ingots in the cryogenic lab's vault we were wheeled into the prep-room.       Dr. Malmsteen and a nurse named Ratchet began our IV drip which contained a healthy amount of demerol. Claudia and I held hands for what might be the last time.       "I always loved you Clau."      "I know," she said without squeezing my hand tighter.      "I'll be right next to you, until God willing, there's a cure."     "Thank you, Stanley. I didn't think you had it in you."      "You know I'm not in your league," I said.     "I know," she said. "But I liked the skeleton joke."      The demerol began to take effect and Dr. Malmsteen said, "Just count backwards from 100..."      "...49, 48, 47..."  "If I didn't get frozen too would you have left me any money?" I asked a minute later feeling Clau's hand start to go limp.      "Not even a peso, Stanley."      "It's okay. I wouldn't have either."      "I know," were the last words I heard.      And then, Claudia was out cold. I watched Dr. Malmsteen and Nurse Ratchet ease her into the preservation tank and begin to fill it with nitrogen or whatever they used to turn people into popsicles.       I cracked my neck and got off the gurney.      "Has my money been transferred?"      "It should all be there," Dr. Malmsteen said.     "Can I use your computer to check?"     "Be my guest."     I logged on and checked my balance. Five million Euros. Cash money.       "Well I'll be seeing you," I said as I zipped up my leather jacket and prepared to take my leave.      "You know, she was right about one thing," Dr. Malmsteen said.      "Yeah? What's that?"      "She's out of your league, bruh."      "I know," I said nodding. "But not Ted Williams'."       "By the way, this was your best grift yet, Stan. I didn't think you had it in you."  I never met a compliment I trusted so I beat a hasty retreat.          After I left the ersatz cryogenic lab feeling like five million Euros and change I stopped for a celebratory beer feeling a genuine gratitude that I wouldn't need a mop chaser for what I hoped would be a very long time.         Sometimes we all must hack it :))  	4
    This is how I poop.  I started doing it spontaneously when I 14 and never looked back.  I do so in my socks so I don't get the seat dirty.   try pigtails   Congratulations, you just quoted  an energy consultant with Energy in Depth, an advocacy group for the Independent Petroleum Association of America   David Bowie's "Space Oddity" is about drug addiction.   What would kids do without the internet to complain about their moms?   That's ignorant. It's called inline skating now.   I legit am telling you the truth with this story: Once when I had never cooked anything besides microwave popcorn and toast, my gf and I had a craving for mozerella cheese sticks. Instead of going out, we decided to try to make them.  We filled up a pot of oil and put it on the stove to boil.  Then we lifted the lid and it shoots up in flames!  Now we should have just put the lid back on and removed it from the heat, but instead we did this: We called the fire department and ran outside.  Now the fire department can and a fireman went into the kitchen while we watched through the window.  This is what we saw him do: He picked up the flaming pot of oil and brought it over to the sink and turned the faucet on.  It was like this gif.  Fortunately the fireman was wearing a protective suit, but the ceiling was toasted.  Suffice to say, my gf did not get her deposit back  for the apartment.  I was pretty shocked to see this, because I really thought this would be the first thing they teach you NOT to do in firefighter school.   Follow this comment thread up.  It started with  Holy shit, make your kids exercise  So we are talking about general health and weight control. It doesn't make any sense to talk about either of those things without mentioning nutrition. Get with the program.   I enjoy sleeping in bed as well.   You being downvoted shows the ignorance of the average reader here.  Of course it is the CONTENT of the food.  Nutrition is really important for weight loss and overall good health.  Not all calories are equal.  If you eat buttloads of sugar you aren't getting any nutrition and you will still be hungry and will eat more food.  If you eat a well-balanced wholesome meal you will feel satiated for longer.   This is why you don't ask people on the Internet to validate your dreams.  No one knows how it will work out for him and no one can tell him if it's a good idea or not.  I'm sure people thought Bill Gates was nuts dropping out of Harvard. Not that everyone who quits their job or drops out of school is going to be as successful as Gates or Tarantino, but the thing is, no one knows.   Source on permanent vision damage?  I don't think LSD is a miracle drug and I've had good and bad trip, but I think you are parroting an urban legend here.   lol dae women are terrible?      A giant tattoo across a man's entire front torso that was not professionally done that read **"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist"**  Strangest thing I've ever seen.    There is no way chicken will magically make you lose more weight than a well-planned plant based diet, especially not if you do not exercise.  That's true, and I was never arguing otherwise.  But she is acting on the advice of her doctor, however wrong that advice is. The language of "betrayal" also implies that eating vegan is some kind of team, or worse, a religion where we try to win "converts". We shouldn't be so emotionally invested in our dietary choices that we feel personally attacked when someone decides to try something else.   Have you tried Linux Mint?   Saying it's a betrayal is making the issue entirely about him, when it's really about his wife and her health.   Well, you COULD feel angry and upset, it's understandable.  But is it useful?  Not really.  I think you are taking it personally when it really has nothing to do with you.  Your wife isn't betraying you, she's just responding the circumstances in her life (however misguided her reasoning may be).  Have you talked to her about other strategies for reducing her carb intake WITHOUT reverting to animal consumption?  You and your wife should be on the same team here, and that team's goal is for you both to have good health.  Also, maybe she needs a better doctor.   They say that in the game! Upvote!   True.. but let's celebrate the milestones along the way, while staying focused on the big goals. This is good news!   I doubt this problem is exclusive to psychology.   I want to share this with people on facebook. Can you provide your sources please or at least point me in the right direction? Thanks.   rekt   Every thread!!!   Found the vegan!      Also, one might argue that just having the product and wearing it is helping to promote it, because it's kind of like an advertisement for leather boots if you are wearing them.   Smoke.   r/uberdrivers/   Now I don't know what to think.   I believed you, and then I saw you were telling the truth.   Please let us know what else you are able to watch despite the dead pixel on your TV.   Yes, it's good to stay hydrated.  Studies show that 100% of people benefit from drinking water.   Lovely shade of blue.   Still relevant today.   Sometimes it's only the court jester who is able to speak what everyone else is thinking but afraid to say.   I love [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmVadrAg35Q).  The Court Jester is able to speak the truths that none of the wisemen can.   I've only played golf one time.  It was ok.   Well, that's a relief.   Not bad. Thanks for asking!      If you use quotes, you get a web forum where they are discussing if author John Milton wrote *himself* into Paradise Lost as Satan.   That is mildly interesting, I suppose.   Hi. How are you?   This is correct, and there are a myriad of other ways that karma manifests itself.  Smiling at someone can set off a ripple effect of subtly improved moods that eventually circle round and come back to you.   Thanks! Please let me know when it's ready!   This looks awesome! Thanks you.   Neat.  I do not have a brother.   Karma: Turning redditors into parrots.   I have read much of the Hebrew Bible.  Yes, there are some thing that sound fucked up in there, but most people do not take them literally.  There are many ways to interpret these texts.  Most jews that I know practice peace, charity, and [Tikkun olam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam) (the practice of "reparing the world") .  Judaism is one of the least understood religions, because they don't make any effort to proselytize, and they only bother to explain things to people who ask.  Because of this, people have been misinterpreting the religion for centuries.  [Here are some awesome jews who are wholly against Zionism](http://www.truetorahjews.org/).  Remember, the first Zionists where all secular and didn't make any sort of religious claims.  Some Zionists have tried to use religious arguments to manipulate religious jews into supporting their cause.  They have deliberately conflated Zionism and Judaism. Please don't do the same thing.    My vision is to join or start a self-sufficient community designed around the principals of permaculture, such as diversity, integration, creative response to change, etc.  I practice yoga and meditation almost everyday to aid in my personal transformation.  I'm skilled at organizing people, inspiring others, and conveying a vision.  What I am lacking are some practical skills for operating a self-sufficient community.  Particularly, I'm looking for hands on experience with designing and setting up a sustainable permaculture food garden/farm/forest.  My ideal situation would be to live and work on an operating or developing farm for several months, with some formal lessons to lay a foundation of understanding.  I do not have thousands of dollars to spend and I'm hoping for a work/study arrangement.  Please, if you know of a place like this, ideally in CA, OR, or WA, let me know!  This is not a passing whim, but something I see as integral to my life's/soul's progression.  Also, what actions can I be taking right now to prepare myself for something like this?  Thank you!!      These sick fucks have zilch to do with Judaism.   Yelling doesn't make your argument any stronger. Calm down! You were responding to OP who stated that is a travesty that many young black men are in prison for MINOR drug charges, to which you objected.  I was replying to you in light of OPs statement.  But while we are at it, IMHO, if drugs were dealt with in a sensible manner, dealers wouldn't be severely penalized either unless they were pushing to kids or engaged in violent behaviour.  It's a transaction between consenting adults about what to put in their own bodies.  Why don't we throw all the pharmaceutical pushers in jail?  These are actually the most abused drugs.   WTF does being vegan have to do with what you are talking about, doc?   -Socially Awesome Penguin   Wow, that looks easy!  And delicious.   Most people are there for only possession, not distribution.  And yes, it IS a travesty for society to treat people who are suffering from addiction like absolute crap and offer them no medical assistance at all.  Prisons are NOT drug free environment and many people begin using there.  Drug use and abuse should be considered a public health issue, not a criminal issue.   I did too, but I don't remember it now.   You might say that no one or nothing is ever fun, just the experience of that person or thing that is fun.  Or you might not.   I also have a couch.   Careful, you're making it sound too *interesting*.   Oh.      Do you like toast? I enjoy toast.   Cool.   Tin foil usually comes in rolls, inside a box.      Mugwort unquestionably gives me more vivid and intense dreams.   So are the Ferguson ones.   Right, it's like some people seem to be offended if you don't drop to their level of depression when you interact with them..   I'll try, and I don't make any guarantees, but these things definitely helped me.  1. Realize that only you can make yourself happy.  Stop looking outside of yourself for that perfect person/job/situation to change your life. 2. Meditate. Learn to quiet your mind and get in touch with your truest self. 3. Exercise everyday.  Get addicted to endorphins.  A healthy mind follows a healthy body. 4. Make lists of things you are grateful for.  Use these things to cultivate a feeling of well-being and practice holding this feeling for as long as possible each day. 5. Aim to please yourself, not other people.   I have. AMA.   Can't someone be both happy and peaceful and relaxed?  Also, can't a happy person have dealt with shit in the past and gotten through it?   Use the save button.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebratory_gunfire   Linux Mint is pretty great.   He meant this usage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_within_a_state   I agree.  One could say both CYOA books and text adventure games are both forms of IF.   Hint: look at troll's overall comment karma            Return to the breath.  It is a practice.  Overtime you will gain an increased ability to focus through meditation.  Whenever you find your mind has strayed, accept that without judgement and simply return to the breath.   Ok, I should have said nicotine use.   I bet your reaction would be different if it were a dude. "Drama queen"?  Your misogyny is showing.   I was taking this from the article:   If youre a little hazy on the meaning, it means to inhale and exhale the vapor produced by an electronic cigarette device, which are themselves also sometimes known as vapes. The word was coined as a way of distancing the act of e-smoking from the act of smoking combustible tobacco cigarettes, the OED said in a statement today.  But from the [OED's blog](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/vape-named-oxford-dictionaries-word-year-2014/): *vape*, verb Inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device  *vape*, noun  An electronic cigarette or similar device; an act of inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device  At least it does say "or similar device" *cough cough* cannabis vaporizer.   this is probably true, but still the definition is somewhat incomplete. I have been using the word to refer to vaporizing cannabis for years and I'm sure others do as well.   Iguana (reptilian) Secret Intelligence Service.   It's just too bad the definition seems to refer only to tobacco use.  I guess including other herbs would be too controversial.  Either that or they were paid by eCig makers to do this.          To force companies to include certain messages, knowing full well that people have an irrational fear of the thing these messages are informing of is a blatant violation of companies right to commercial free speech.  The purpose of labels is to educate.  Laws shouldn't be made based on assumptions of how people will react to education.  This line of thinking is directly from the industry.  They are afraid of losing business because of people "irrational" fear of GMOs, but whether or not those fears are irrational is irrelevant.  If industry is so proud of their product it is there job to present their side to consumers.  It is consumers' right to do their own research and come to their own conclusions.  Without labels people cannot make informed decisions about what to buy and what industry practices they want to support.  I'm sure there are many people who think GMOs are the best thing since sliced bread and will buy them specifically because they are GM.  This is their right as well.  Now, exactly what constitution statute are you referring to?  You can't possibly be suggesting that it's a 1st amendment violation.  That is really laughable.  Denying people access to information is protecting "free speech"?  Be honest, that argument is spurious at best.   Don't harp on people for thinking critically.  Why do you feel it's better to blindly accept a narrative of a stranger on the internet than of the government?   We did it guuuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   no... they are both disgusting.   I agree completely, you jackdaw.   You can rent the documentary online here: https://vimeo.com/ondemand/culturehigh   Let's see if this gets any traction on r/science.   It's more than just a marketing term.  It is a [USDA standard](http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true contentid=organic-agriculture.html).  You might argue that standard has been watered down by industry lobyists, but it IS a standard.   I think upwards of 90% of situations are worsened when police are added to the equation.  When will people learn this?   Let's get to the bottom of this nonesense.  There is a pandemic of police brutality.  Sociopaths with badges and guns.  Are these people being systematically put into these positions or is it just that these types of people are attracted to the power they afford?  Either way, something needs to be done.   Yes, it's totally "asinine" that people should be be able to make informed decisions about what to purchase and put in their own bodies and what industry practices they want to support. /s   Ahh! Get away from me you mongrel!  	106
    hotair.com is full of hot air.  Walker was born in Colorado, not Iowa.  How much other wrong information is getting circulated about this dangerous idiot?  He will NEVER get the nomination.  Even right wing Americans aren't dumb enough to fall for Walker's brand of violent, fascist politics - Right Wing Politics for Dummies.   Walk around Wisconsin and see what the typical Wisconsin diet does to people.   Trump is an evil fool, but it's hard to believe that people don't recognize that John McCain was knowingly bombing civilians when he was shot down.  Is this heroic? Yes, being a pow is a horror, but think about those civilians.      Maybe the right kind of spending - efficient and goal oriented - focused on education and preventive medicine.   The issue is the poverty that exists before the payment.  That's the problem.  Correcting with a check can't solve the fundamental problem, although it certainly helps, but not enough.  With all the focus on the middle class I'm glad he's mentioning the poor.  They are really suffering.        Is this why he was late?  "Sanders insurgent campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination doesnt spring for charters like his top competitor  at least not yet. On this day he isnt even flying nonstop, as he heads from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Phoenix via Minneapolis.

(https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/07/18/summer-sanders-fall-sanders/FWFu6n73iroD98e4og2baM/story.html) He's flying as cheaply as he can. Bernie is very frugal.      In Wisconsin anyone can vote in a primary without registering as a member of a party.     Almost like ...?   Yes, he was a classic Russian black bass whose only musical training was in a monastery in his early years.  He became a famous star and one of Stalin's favorite singers.  He had a charming stage presence and unique voice.   A society can be uplifted by having an educated population.  Economic gain isn't the only reason to become an educated person.  Learning critical thinking skills, exposure to history, art, other cultures and science can enrich a person's life beyond words.   He's so stupid he doesn't even know how stupid he sounds.   No surprise at all.  She's pumped full of bank and corporate money.  She is for TPP, the pipeline, Wall Street.  She's not for the citizenry.   I thought her corporatist/bank loving tendencies were well known.        Because the anti-abortion mentality is driven by men and religion, and their voices are loud.   No, he's as ugly as Trump - short, cross-eyed, balding, chinless, pasty.  Could it be any worse?   There is nothing he can do to win.   	21
 Frogspawn    I don't recommend it. Bought it on a frag plug and this is what it turned into... Gonna stick to sps and lps on the next tank   My gf doesn't eat pork so I thought I'd give this a shot. It actually tasted pretty similar to bacon, a bit meatier but I didn't mind that at all  It's basically cured and smoked brisket               This is amazing.            Oh yeah that's totally it! Cool and thanks for the puns :)   Haha oh sorry, it's in West Sacramento, CA      Hahah why are you getting so mad??    Hahah k    it will eventually bring the entire thing to 135. You only have to worry about overcooking if you leave it in there for hours on end      If the water is 125F... there is no way that once the center reaches 125F that the outside is more cooked... if it is it will be by a few minutes so it won't even make a noticeable difference.   I'm in the US.. it came from NZ   I like to live dangerously   Yeah you're right.. its technically rare (125F)   I said in the recipe I posted you need to cook it for at least an hour. It was a 1.5 pound rack so yes an hour in the sous vide brought the internal temp to 125F... exactly what I had my water bath set to. You do not want to cook certain meats for extended periods of time or they will get mushy. That is why I recommended 1-3 hours. For a cheap cut like a short rib or brisket, they can be sous vide up to 72 hours to break down the collagen and tenderize the meat   I roasted it for an hour at 400F before adding it to the lamb... its more sweet than bitter   Hmm probably something tart like lemon zest   Haha I'm sorry :)   Might just have to get one. I already have the TS8000 torch   throw that in the smoker at 225F until it reaches an internal temp of 203F lol. If you wanted to sous vide it, I'm guessing it would be done around 131-135F for 24-48 hours...   i put it on the rack right below... probably 6 inches below the broiler? Didn't flip it  	29
 My wife and I's favorite Stephenson work is The Diamond Age, although, the reviews I get from others are very hit and miss.   This was my favorite book so far this year. Will easily fall into one of my top ten. Such a good read and break from Stephenson's normal genre, although as you get into the second half of the book you can begin to see some of his typical melting of cyber/steam-punk worlds. I won't ruin anything for you, but I will say that this book left me wanting another from this universe.   **Andromeda's Fall, William C. Deitz**   After finishing the ridiculous last novel of the the Silo Series yesterday (see my post entitled "Series that let you down" I felt like I needed to go back to a quick read in a universe I know I enjoy. Deitz's Legion of the Damned novels are always an enjoyable and quick read for me. My dad was in the marines and turned me on to the SF military genre, now it's always an easy way for me to cleanse my palette, especially after a particularly bad read.   WTF?   The worst part of the Silo series second book, which was a prequel, was that they took a character from the first book who, while you read about him you kept thinking how boring it would be to read about him before this novel and than he did just that. And it was boring.   I just finished the Silo series by Hugh Howey. I couldn't put the first book(s?) Wool 1-5 down, so as soon as I finished I snatched up the other two and read them straight through. Wool was awesome, if you're a fan of dystopian futures it's a must-read. However, I would caution you to stop there. The rest of the series, in my opinion got worse with each step until it reached, quite possibly, the most ridiculous conclusion I've ever read.   What series have you read that started great but just let couldn't pull it out for the last books?   Aren't LaGrange points also where you go to perform a transfer to orbit some other body besides earth?   I walked the main trail and the little offshoot that goes around behind the fields and comes out at the organic farm bit, no sign of a wallet, sorry.   Indian Valley Perserve? I'm right up the road. I'll go take a look.   Yep, had a rifle at 98%, snuck up on him, got off a nice headshot, assumed that would do it. It didn't. After doing some reading on the forums seems like since the last update bears take at least two shots, preferably headshots. I think this time I'll lure him to near a hunter's stand so he can't maul me.   Love it, still playing it. Had a game going that I had been alive about three weeks and finally decided to kill that damn bear. This morning I started over after it mauled me to death. How do you kill that stupid bear, I want a bear skin sleeping bag.   Talk to her man. Clear, concise, don't whine or tell her you NEED it. Just tell her straight up how you feel. Come up with a path forward together. You haven't handled anything alone yet, why start now. Involve her in this issue that affects a marriage between two people. There is no more taking care of yourself (not that masturbation is out of the question, just saying, in general, family problems are a group thing.)   I carry two pairs of Teva's. Every goddamn time. If it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any. Lost pairs of Teva's that is.   I ate six bowls of Cinnamon Toast Crunch as my sole sustenance last weekend when my wife and baby we're out of town.    When I saw the update dot on Chariot I was like, who's updating this thing? Good job Chariot devs for listening and responding.   When they make another one of [these](https://youtu.be/Az1fr4BR8Ic) I'll give them a chance.   Yeah, I saw that today. That guy is the textbook definition of crazy.   You and your father (or mother, or guardian) are playing catch. They have a pile of balls on their end. They throw a ball, and no matter how far away they is, as long as they can see you, they can throw it hard enough to reach you. Along the way it may be hit by insects or birds might peck pieces off of it, but it will always reach you in some form. Once you catch it you look it over, you check it for insect or bird-pecking damage, see if there's any missing pieces, etc... You know what a ball is supposed to look like because there's certain indicators that it's a ball, round-shaped, stitched a certain way, what have you. If it's okay and made it completely, you throw it back, they catch it and because they know that they just threw this ball and only has to throw a ball once they picks up the next one and throws it. If it's damaged, you throw it away, no sense in playing with a broken ball. Your dad, mom, etc... never gets the ball thrown back and thinks, "Well, he must not of caught it" and throws an identical ball. This goes on and on until all of the balls have been thrown.   I've beat it and still go back to it when I get bored. Wipe out a few dozen bands of orcs, try to clear the bases out as much as I can, ruin a few feasts, etc...   I made 4 burgers with a pound of ground turkey, 1 egg, a handful of bread crumbs, some garlic slash Italian seasoning, a splash of Worcestershire, a splash of Franks Hot Sauce, and about a quarter cup of diced Pancetta. I cooked the burgers before I put them in the dough.  Than rolled out the dough, cut it in four pieces, put down some sauce, a few pieces of mozzarella, some salami, and than the burger. Wrap it up, put some mozzarella on top of it and baked it for twelve minutes at 450. Next time I'd put some olive oil on the outside and maybe some basil or oregano.      English please Viggo.    Holy crap I laughed way too hard at that.   Those effects in V were really bad. Like, I'd rather watch the original mini-series bad.   I was going to reply and talk about coke ovens, and how they reached anywhere from 2000 to 3600, but, I think we've strayed off topic enough and I'll instead say...  Agreed.    Or potassium hydroxide (caustic potash). Definitely more harmful to handle, but easier to manufacture since it doesn't require manufacturing chlorine gas. The bio-diesel refinery I spent my evenings playing Hedgehog Launcher at used sodium hydroxide, but I toured a European plant that used a potassium process. Nasty stuff.  Not that the sodium hydroxide was a walk in the park, as the small chemical burn that I still have a scar from where I should have a uni-brow certainly attests to.   When I passed it, I crammed all three practice exams the hour before it. I missed the things not-covered, but made enough that I passed. But don't worry, after you get through that, it's all practical exams. The CLD is not too bad, the CLA sucks.   Not if you have an HOA it isn't.   Lots of people have said to take that open right lane and not split. Opinions are like assholes, and here's mine. I would split. In California, and notably the Bay area, we're expected to be splitting. When you come past someone while splitting the left lanes, no surprise, if you come shooting up the right side and than jamming on the brakes to get into a gap, you're likely to, at the bare minimum, piss someone off. Worst case scenario, you surprise someone enough you get hit from behind.   Also, hitting the curves in Marin tomorrow morning if you want to join in.   At 2:21, when that music kicked on, I about lost my shit.    Is the thought that whatever monster movie you're watching the characters have no concept of the types of monsters that exist in the movie they're in? I mean, it's juust tough for me to watch zombie movies and never once does someone scream, "Oh crap, it's a zombie."   So many MCAD memories.   1.1M for more engineering and tools. What about the actual work to fix this? Seems like 1.1M isn't going come even close to paying people to fix it.   Food in her hand, she's in the kitchen or in her high chair. I don't know how we did it, because we never could with her brother, but she just likes listening to us and doing what we say.   Actually, smart ass, probably just a good idea to do it before doing something like changing it to a different game mode that you can't undo.   [Only one answer](http://i.imgur.com/lHJBO.png)   So happy that Bumblebee is not a Camaro. So, so happy.   I gotta say, this makes me feel good to hear. I have a 19 year old and an almost 2 year old. The 19 year old has a different last name and a story very similar to yours, but he's my son. However, he's currently at that stage where we literally would like to strangle each other on a daily basis. We've actually reached the point where it's just easier to smile at each other and talk about video games only because we both know what happens if any other topic is brought up.   Good job man.   Yeah, I try to do at least an hour of cardio, jogging, biking, or a little of both, on my off day. Plus, the hour I spend chasing my two year old helps.   I wish this was at the top. This is a very important comment. Deadpool the character is way more and much deeper than anything that reddit puts him on a pedestal for.   You won't shave that beard. Them pulling, tugging, playing with, playing in, etc... just feels so good for both of you. Nearing our two year mark and I'm still going strong. I think it would just be weird for both of us if I shaved now.   It's cute when my 20 month old does it. It's annoying when my 19 year old does it.   [You're welcome](https://youtu.be/KFXyitb0gwI?t=2m59s)   Did it get fixed, I must've missed the joke.   Right, seems like the company could be attempting to protect themselves from reviews that made incorrect claims.   Welcome to the fast lane.   Who are Link Corporation, and why do I care?   Honestly, if I have a bad review of someone and state my opinion, I have no problem attaching my own name and identity to that opinion.   Is that wrong?   That's what I'm hoping for, that it devolves into Frank backed into a corner and just going absolute crazy to cover his own ass/try not to lose his money/mind.   You're welcome. Don't worry about putting your FasTrak on the bike though, mine never registers but as long as your license plate is on your account you'll be fine. Never had a penalty at all.   Ride safe out there. I'll keep my eyes out for you. I commute Novato to Fremont most days.   Plus, I think Frank's gonna turn out to be all talk.    Shit, yep, just rewatched and I think you're right. I think the shooter was outside and came in. Still, don't understand why putting your gun away when you see blood is a good idea.    Step 1. Get Fastrak.  Step 2. Use the carpool lane on the Richmond bridge. Step 3. I just saved you 2.50.  Next time you're over here, drop me a line, I'll buy you a coffee and show you some more fun roads.    Good point, but what about the overly sexual nature in which he was staring at the young, male, prostitute?    I think whatever is wrong with Paul came from his time with Black Mountain (is that what it was called?) and his "time in the desert." Maybe black ops, torture, mind fucking, etc...   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. He either did it or had someone do it. But I think the car outside is the same one Caspere was being driven around in, so, not Frank. Unless Frank stole his own money...?   Thank you for what you do. I appreciate men and women like you who take time to try and help keep these wonderful areas of our country safer.   I rode the Dragon long ago before it became the Killboy Calimari Race Team destination spot that it is today. My Dad moved to Soddy Daisy, TN back then, and so it made a nice side trip when I went to see him a few times.  You live in a beautiful area, and again, thank you for doing what you do. If you ever make it to the bay area, let me know, I'll buy you a coffee and show you our roads.   My UPS guy tosses (yes, literally throws) my packages over the gate of the white picket fence I have in my front yard and leaves them laying there on the ground. Twice I had to claim broken monitors. The third time they were delivered by a new driver doing a ride-along with a manager who came up to my door, rang the bell, and woke the baby. Can't fucking win.   Frame rate drops mostly or lag.    Plays Kerbel on medium settings just fine when it's docked and I'm using the USB fan. If it's on my lap it runs hot and starts throttling. Plays Spartan Strike without any issues at all.   I write code in .NET, node.js, and LabVIEW, use it regularly for SolidWorks and OrCAD, and do light gaming on it. I have an i7 and wouldn't consider the i5.    This is the ISS transit across the sun? Pardon my ignorance, I've just been made aware of how awesome the skies are and am trying to absorb as much as I can.   And soon she'll learn to climb on you and gripping all sorts of new and painful things.   You would think they would've figured out during the previews, right? As a dad, had something like this happened, there would've been about three seconds worth of movie to be seen as I snatched my daughter up and walked out. I'm not one to cover eyes, as that typically just breeds more questioning, but it would've been up and out immediately, easily before any recognition of tied up kids or horror.    Sorry, I don't think the shipping from Wales to California would be worth it, but you've definitely inspired me to sharpen my hatchet, if that's worth anything.   Are you the same guy on that channel with the bowl? This all looks awesome. Good job man.   Road America is one of my favorite race tracks ever. I've been on it on a motorcycle and it's nice to see that they've been fairly accurate at reproducing it. There's a truly emotional response to coming out of that right hander pointed directly at a bridge abutment going a hundred miles an hour. I'm guessing I'm going to have to pick this up I guess.   I feel like I've missed out on an important part of life without having a boy and getting pee'd on while changing.   Congrats, and holy crap. That kid is a giant. I thought my daughter was big at 10 lbs.   Without a doubt. I've already got all my gestures set up to replace hotkeys in my programming IDE's so I can actually write code on a plane almost as fast as I do at my desk.   What's the TC? Tried googling it and only found Turbo C++, and I don't see anything in the pictures that's 'on' in all of them.  Edit: Type Cover. Jeez, I'm an idiot.   My daughter spent three weeks in quarantine waiting to find out if she had a disease that by all accounts should be extinct but for some ridiculous reason she could've possibly died from. Why should I respect the side of a debate that means that my child might possibly die? Take your devil's advocate bullshit and shove it up your ass. Primal enough for you?   Yeah, that was a pretty bone head move, seems like you need a few more hours or so in the parking lot or on a dirt bike. And god damn man, get some gear.   Sorry to hear man, that sucks. I can't even imagine what you're going through right now, but if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask. We're here for you.   What's going on?   I attempted to write a rational response to your chain of posts. I couldn't. You're an idiot, and rationalizations like yours are why we are still worrying about shit like this instead of living in a gloriously potentially-deadly virus free world.    I only see a video of them interviewing Adam Beach. Is that the video that's brilliant and horrifying?   What video?   I didn't know anyone actually lived in Tyler, I thought it was just one of those towns in Texas you drove through and left.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab8GtuPdrUQ   As a husband to a woman involved in the close knit mothers of Marin societies I can tell you, this has been exploding since the outbreak in Disney World. Mother's getting kicked out of playgroups, retaliation on social sites, outright segregation, etc...    Or don't see it...  Amiright?   I thought it was 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3?   Wait? Are you telling me that Rescue 911 was fake?   Just now hit 40 hours on Shadow of Mordor. Shit, I got some work to do.   I stand corrected.   Just watched Gone Girl the other night with my wife. It was good, but I felt Affleck's performance was along the lines of his worst stuff. Fincher's direction and art looked and felt very good to me personally. I haven't seen Pike in anything else but I liked what she did with the role. But Affleck's performance was his typical self, it felt very Reindeer Games, in my opinion.   Or not so far from the Coast... cough Santa Rosa cough...   When you cancel your Gold, you keep the games. How is that a rental service? It's more like a subscription service, a'la the old Columbia House CD subscription service.   There's a reason that middleweights are called the meat grinder class.   Oh man, I needed a good laugh. Thank you.   This. I use my Surface to write code, and when I've got a text editor open I usually have it on a dock, but I get to do a large amount of work in LabVIEW recently and setting up my hotkeys to run as gestures and using the pen makes writing code actually enjoyable on a tablet.   I'm going with this guy. The short side looks like it's about an inch shorter than the side with the seed in it.    This. The travel takes a minute, but after a few weeks of it, I don't notice it all and my Dell laptop feels weird to me know when I use it.   Aren't you supposed to cut with the torch angled slightly forward?   A campaign to smear the good name of the Professor, which will smear his good name  through a campaign and be a campaign of smearing the name of the Professor that is good.   Giving you a flower for Father's Day? My daughter has started picking dandelions for me. I still smile at each one.   Penis. Ha   Using a dock, it looks like? What else you got going on there? How's it play WOT? What's the end of the "So Far" look like?   I'm getting ready to set mine up for dedicated coding work so I'm looking at the options.   Dick move in the No Wake Zone. Sweet landing in space though.   I'm PST and won't be on until about 9 or 10, but if you want to play, add GOATRper.   I wish I could get a few hundred thousand credits worth of illegal goods so that I could stupidly attack someone that I didn't know and lose it.  I wish I could find someone to stupidly attack and get blown up.  I wish I could find someone.   I keep seeing all these pictures of Dolores Park looking beautiful and pristine after it's big clean-up. The titles and comments are all very forlorn sounding. Forgive my ignorance, I live in the North Bay, but is it not possible to keep up the appearance?    In the bay area? Buy you a cup of coffee if you are just want to talk.   Any ideas where to get a mining laser? I got a refinery and was all ready to go get some ore, and I can't find a mining laser any where.   This mentality drives me mad, because you know if they announced a season pass for DLC this guy would be up in arms about having to pay for extra content.     I went there last year for Thanksgiving, weird.   I had ice cream right up the street from Akaka Falls, does that count?   As an underwater certified welder in Kansas I made in 2006 I made $93,000 a year. So yeah.   I had three deer's worth of meat at the power plant and my base camp set up at the camp cabin and finally had a clear day when I decided to leave everything but a couple of flares and make the hike to the plant and back to bring the deer back to the cabin. I took the river in hopes of avoiding all the wolves along the tracks, ran the entire way to the plant, drank the half a liter of water I brought and munched the power bar, grabbed the 28 kilos of meat, turned and took off back to the cabin directly into a blizzard. Halfway back, freezing cold and, out of water, food, and breath I bumped into the bear. Awesome. Needless to say, he ate good that night.  	109

    LARPing just got extreme.    Any time a girl has talent. Like they can dance, are a good athlete, plays an instrument...  I'm a goner    The original Mad Max movies.   The rotating hallway fight in Inception.    Has no one said April O'Neil?    I know I'm probably in the minority with these people but: Nick Swardson,  Greg Giraldo, Aziz Ansari, and David Cross. I like both David Cross and Aziz as actors... Just not comedians.    My biggest problem with the film is the fact they changed a major theme of the book, which is fear of the unknown.   SPOILERS   In the book the buggers attacked earth because they thought that humans were an inferior race and kind of stupid, only because they could not communicate the way they did. In the film they say they attacked because they ran out of resources and needed water or something which means that humans have some sort of knowledge of the aliens.  The whole war is started because they could not communicate and did not understand each other. That's why Ender feels remorse and takes the baby bugger.   Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. That is what I got out of it.    Hey Cabin! From what I have heard most animators continue to use Flash since they are familiar with it and have been using it for a while. Zach and Chris said they recently started using ToonBoom. What would you recommend for someone just starting out in animation? Is ToonBoom the way to go since it's geared towards animation specifically?    Speaking as someone who lives in California there a few things you/she need to know. Yes, everything here is much more expensive. I live in the south Bay region and pay around $860 a month for a studio apartment. Fairly big enough but still. Also, there are good areas (redondo beach, marina del Rey, Irvine, Glendale) and there are bad areas (LA, Compton, Hollywood). Moving here won't give you any more opportunities unless you already have your foot in the door. If you have already been talking to some of these companies and are interested in giving you a job, go for it. But if you come here looking for a job you will probably fail. LA is full of people hoping to "make it" and only around 13 percent actually succeed. Look at your current circumstances and decide if that's the best decision for you.    Sub here. The teacher said to specifically have the students sit in their own seats. A student asked if they could move and I told them that their teacher said to stay in their seats. The student actually responded "no she didn't". I was like really? I have the paper right here!    What are some words Cory has used and their actual usage.   For example: prestige - pristine  Stunt devil - Stunt double  ...    Hey gang, I am just curious as to why you started a company together? What was the reason that led to this decision and how has it helped you financially or otherwise? Thanks!   	13

OK, you are confused, so why are you not going in California and check the weather :D   California is very very HOT! :P  	10
 I'd like to think I'm a pretty skeptical and rational person, and even though I'm interested and fascinated by all things creepy, more than once I've found myself thinking/saying to the TV "That's dust. That's caused by plumbing issues" etc.  But more than once, specifically in my childhood home, there were times I couldn't apply a rational explanation (even though I wanted to!)  Once, when I was about 18 and my younger sisters were 15 (twins) one of the Twins stayed home from school sick, and I was to take care of her while everyone else was at work/school. I made my sister a pallet of blankets and pillows in the living room floor, made her some lunch, and put on the TV (at a very very quiet volume) while I went into the kitchen to fold clothes. (our washer/dryer were behind a curtain in a recessed area of the dining room. It was an open floorplan house and everything branched off from the huge kitchen/dining room btw) While I was folding clothes, I was talking to our grandmother on the phone who says she's "sensitive"- I'm not sure about that, I know she exaggerates things, but she's a hell of a judge of character, and sometimes seems to know things she shouldn't.  Anyway, as I was folding clothes I FELT AND HEARD someone walk behind me, across the kitchen, toward the main door. The floor vibrated, and it made noise, like my dad walking in his workboots- but specifically him walking like he was angry or annoyed, so I looked back, and no one was there.  Then I realized, not only was no one there, but Daddy was at work, and my sister and I were the only ones home, and I know my sister didn't move, I could still see her from where I was standing. I ignored it, and continued talking to Nanny. It happened again and I looked behind me. Suddenly over the phone Nanny said "What's happening there?" and as I was about to tell her, I heard a really loud thud from the living room, and my sister jumped up and ran into the kitchen and yelled "SOMETHING TRIED TO STEP ON ME" in a rather hysterical tone. Now, I was creeped out. But my Nanny calmly said, over the phone in a loud tone, "Leave them alone." and nothing else creepy happened. (that day at least.)  I have to admit, I was pretty spooked, even though I tried to explain it away as 'knocking pipes.' I laid down in the floor with my sister and we watched "The jewelry channel" to bore ourselves to sleep.  TL;DR I was home with my sick sister when something or someone started stomping around, couldn't explain it, my grandma told it to stop over the phone and it did.       It's too bad she doesn't have a name that can be easily alliterated with a word for hate. Good job, girlfriend. You dropped the ball AGAIN HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH THE LETTER K   No, you're definitely not alone, She's like that and my Dad is actually like that too, he laughs about it because they're similar. I mean, I can recognize when stuff is bad sure, but it doesn't occur to me to hone in on flaws in stuff that I like. I'm kind of glad though, its probably harder to enjoy stuff for people like y'all.   Yeah! Then she'd get internet famous for being THE GREATEST HATER OF THEM ALL. :P No though seriously, that's a good idea.   Discussing is fine, I actually like doing stuff like that, but mostly all she does is point out flaws in a negative way, and any discussion turns into an argument. There have been times where we discuss wasted potential though, or better ways it could have gone, and sometimes we end up having really good idea for stories or Roleplay through that. I just feel I dont know, stupid in comparison to her sometimes, because I just dont see the 'glaring' flaws in things like she does.   My girlfriend is so critical. OF EVERYTHING. "This movie sucks and this is why, This show sucks and this is why, this song, book, artist isnt that good and this is why, here is every fault you never new existed in everything you love, oh I didnt like that thing that was perfectly good- in fact it was so bad I couldnt even force myself through 30 minutes of it." Like. Really. It's everything. Even stuff she likes. She points out the faults. and with some of the stuff, its stuff I really like and she's just like "Oh that was so awful." I don't really /hate/ this about her, its just sometimes hard to deal with and sometimes I feel like I must be lowbrow or have low standards or something because I'm so easily amused compared to her.   CLUE fo sho. But there was also this electronic board game from the 90's with a magic wand me and my sisters used to play a lot.  Dont Wake Daddy is probably what gave me anxiety issues.   Skyrim. I'm still playing it. I'm a completionist and It's taken me this long just to get through all the side quests and factions. I hecked up real bad with the Blades, though and now am stuck with the Paarthunax thing.  	9
       Belgian as well, waffles are usually eaten plain or with powder sugar (the brussels kind) and vertically!    The yolk just adds a creamy texture, like it would when you're eating a poached or softboiled egg. It's the whites that are slimey!   I've always wondered if the waffles in this kind of dish are sweet? That seems so weird   Alopecia is hairloss though   No uterus, no opinion   She looks exactly the same   So true, I'm belgian and I've never even eaten a waffle off a plate!   Louis theroux - i love crazy stories and his voice   Just being real about belgian waffles though, most belgians just eat brussels waffles with powder sugar and liege waffles plain. The chocolate and ice cream and whatnot is mostly for tourists   I got all... Whipped cream is a tough one though   I guess how you like your meat is kinda like music taste, a really personal thing. I love something between saignant and bleu so this looks delicious to me but I understand that's not to everyone's taste.   We always plan around our period      New! Tape your butthole shut!   ok good for you   I'd say a 5k festival tent clearing after about 15 minutes of a set is not awesome but actually pretty awful   Saw him live at a festival with earl sweatshirt and their entire act sucked balls. Everyone but maybe 100 people in the front had left the venue or sat down at the back to wait for the next band. He then told the people in the front row that they looked like they had never seen anything more boring. They agreed.   Darren Criss grabbing a girls phone and then throwing it back at her because she didn't give him a standing ovation after a show of Hedwig    i'm sure you could have made it to the end of that sentence but 4 words of reading is plenty practice for the day! You can go play in the sandbox now   Well i'm no expert but i've never seen anyone do this before and found it quite pleasing to watch   I will gladly stab my iphone if it keeps REBOOTING EVERY HALF AN HOUR FOR NO GODDAMN REASON   Um  	24
 Used although accounts to upvote his posts.  This exposed him.    /r/mylifesuxnow    I am just at a point that I feel like I am losing my grip with alot of things.  They are from financial to superficial all the way to losing family. I don't know where to look other than resting in my mindfulness and meditation.  Is there any advice or reading I should do to strengthen my resolve?    I love this movie and love the "Lt.  Dan...  Ice cream!"  part. What's your favorite quote?       Ya..  We are just looking for a faster pace   On a side note...  We have the best Kings roster in 10 years! Kings fiends get ready!    Now that we are officially done signing, I feel like we brought alot of players. How does our depth chart look?  Lineups and play time?    This is ridiculous....  No Hollins,  no ship.    His legs are getting old..  So he relies more on skill and ball IQ. Slows down the game and makes intelligent passes. Having a backup passer is better than a mediocre scorer. Add in vet experience and personal relationship with the coach... Better option IMO.    Agreed.  Unless Seth surprises the world...  Andre miller was my choice.    Because we can change it...  Duh!  We did it reddit!    Ok      I don't unfortunately    The package should be released today.    Talked to the FA Office and they told me that transfers are expected to be released today.  Just an FYI.    What about a government funded start up.  Maybe even funded by the UN? Have the facility guarded by Un patrol who most of the time isn't really active.    ROI is less resources used on wars, diseases and fighting poverty as well as maybe having the economy grow and eventually adopting the dollar?   I might be reaching a little bit.  I'm thinking more of a humanities effort than a business model.    Would it be cheaper to build facilities in Africa to manufacture these food options and be more productive than it is to send what we already are doing?  Let's say 50 years down the road?    So it's better to proceed at our rate of "technological evolution"  and maybe be wrong that global warming doesn't exist than it is to  not "technologically evolve"  and be wrong that it does exist?    Good point.  I guess the prices to manufacture would go up due to transportation. Would it be possible to create government run farms out there? Would it be cheaper in the long run to run facilities over there to provide food than it would be to transport food?    Understood but it is for the general public here. We know markups are ridiculous for fast food companies. What is the cost to manufacture food products like this? Is 10 cheap?          Yea...  That's kinda how prefixes work   Go to /r/mylifesuxnow    It was edited.    The song ruined your dad?   While inhaling the fumes!?  Why not eat that lead based paint while you're at it!  Just sit under this table with your eyes closed.    Understood.  Most venues will have a camera stand dead center to film the concert.  That's always my go to.   PSA: please don't be those people who literally make it a mission to push through crowds.  If you left your friends...  You lost your spot.  Be considerate.    Decent idea if people didn't snatch phones at festivals...  Especially while hiding it as high  as possible.   Find a landmark and converge.  Don't leave unless you expect it to be difficult.  It says message them. Why don't I just message them and tell them to meet me somewhere   Coop becomes a Barber... Commence with mass suicide please.    Downvotes because ops a racist.    I feel for the women..  They were like WTF is he doing   Holy fuck   Kings...  You're welcome   Dank meme   /r/nba where down voting happens.    Yea I could do that but there would be a lot of dead bodies         But a stick bundle nonetheless    Toggaf a si PO   It's a bad area.  Real bad. Not as bad as MLK but I would advise looking almost anywhere else.    Lol   Fuck...  My penis is so conflicted between stupidity and hotness.    Pretty sure these are the guys who puck the Bucks bottom 3 last year   There is no reason why someone approaching 7'0" should move like this.  I swear he was a PG in a previous life.    Great shirt to clean the garage with   :)    Siberia...  It is actually advised and encouraged    Thank you   Sheep farmers are lining up all over for this new life changing invention.    Who do you think is responsible for the JFK assassination?  What are your feelings on government intervention on the global warming crisis?   Pepsi or Coke?   How much would could a woodchuck chuck?   Chicken or the egg?   Stay-cation or vacation?      I guess so.  I'll think it over.    Who upset you?    Lol   Fasho   Lol just a question Bro relax.  Just a funny question that came to mind.   Lol this guy's always out of pocket hahaha I'll still give him my upvote    First off...  10 million for a veteran 4x all star and championship with the cap raising? Not a bad deal.  Some people wanted Lee..  And Matthews.   Rondo has an ego.  It sucks but it's true.  He looks semi humbled with what happened.  If you listen to Rondo talk about his contract,  it was the Kings decision for 1 year.  He was asked to prove himself.  He has a chip on his shoulders.  His risk is no different than Rudy's risk. I can gamble that.   Acl tears suck. Will Rondo be *rondo* again...  Idk.  He is one of the best passers in the league.  He hasn't been paired with great teams. Mavs were a horrible match up and Celtics damn near had no one. He has multiple shooters now, dominant front court,  killer backup pg and a great coach.   Remember how sacramento is.  We are a small market team so we are forced with rookie talent who just wanna play for a team and fading veteran talent who...  Just wanna play on a team.  Remember CWebb talked shit about sac when he was coming here. He still says the greatest experience of his career. Rudy same. Ron Artest even praised sac.  We land spurned vets who have been trashed and we build them up when vulnerable and they stay for the long hall.  We kill them with kindness while others buy their teams.   Check my post history...  I was against it.  No one here has changed my opinion on him.  Only Rondo did. I believe we will see a great Rondo.    Big role.  Koufos would be 2nd string.  Rudy wouldn't play 4 he'd stay 3 or Smith runs 3. Either way he was looking at significant minutes.    Appeal.    Edit: I see alot have fallen onto the camaraderie explanation. Unfortunately, I feel unsatisfied. Why not just pats on the back?  Why not aggressively shake and rub another's head?   I played multiple sports but I never found the need to slap anyone's ass or felt that my morale or my teams went down as a result of a lack of ass slapping.   What are the origins?  Who first smacked their teammates ass? What have been the results of teams smacking and not smacking but instead showing another form of team chemistry?    Had to have...  Bigger role + more work + rebuild = no  Smaller role + less work + championship = yes   How? We probably went for Luc because Smith already said no.  Clips were in the running since the beginning.    I heard Chandler parsons is still at DeAndres house   Haha how does Tim Duncan pass lol   Hipsters don't call themselves hipsters...  Found the phony       I just hiked hidden falls in Auburn.  Last week I did twin bridges. Good places and well worth it    What   Just do it, worse case you get in, best case you do. Honestly just send the letter there is literally no reason to not. I would stop thinking it and just do it and see how the dice rolls. Also I understand because my school did something similar and I had to drive it up. Good luck.   48   Ty ladies a fucking fool.  We will sign him in 3 years when he decides to try his rebuild and we bench his ass for vet min.    It's funny...  Christians don't care now either... As a matter of fact it's allowed in the Bible now according to them.  God says it's okay. "well doesn't it for a fact say against this?"     "No...  We interpreted it wrong the first time... "  Clowns.    I'd hate to be Vlade with those legs haha...  They have to be annoying to sit down with.    I was joking   Internet.    Yea...  I think Karl and Cousins handshake wasn't the best   Dodged a bullet   WOAH! That was fucking rid....  Never mind I just came    Catch ya later alligator   Better than the sacramento shorts...   He's something unofficial...  He's all over to not be helping Vlade..    Dead for three days...  WTF are you talking about....?!    Meh   He has been spotted numerous times recently and I kinda blow it off. Now Belinelli mentioned that he "Knew Peja from NO" when asked about Vlade. I know Vlade and Peja are good friends and now that Vlade is leading the game...  What's Pejas official role?   Fair enough...  Upvote   Who?    [Source]  "Rondo on first name basis with coach. Possible new team buy out.  Cousins okay with this. Rudy's Gay."   Dave and busters.  4.6 star elegant dinner.  Make sure you dress up.    Nah tyson crandler   You come up with the craziest shit lol   Wow   I have some nuts for you...  It is OK to trust me ^^^^^^^catchyalateralligator    Stop attacking please    Edit: ayyy  Edit9: lmao  Edit12: the 4 the Dank gild.   Edit2: am gril btw :)    Fuck *THIS* GUY!!!!  /s   Their name is the Lakers...  California is in a drought and they are the Lakers...  Guess it represents the roster appropriately.    I keep my philosophy...  I believe every year we will win a championship...  I figure I have to be right eventually...  Right?    Eh...  I'd rather be delusional   We dont have an overpaid aging superstar who clearly cares about only money. The Buss's are just as dysfunctional as our FO. Still find it funny that I called that the Lakers would fall in draft as well.   Remember that we are losers for wanting Rondo* but when Kobe was eating lunch with Rondo last year...  He was the best available point guard?  It was the same when we were getting Deron Williams. Shitty guard and a wash up has-been...  Mavs get him and he's a hero haha.  Laker are shitty.    Exactly this. Building a billion dollar stadium is worthless if you don't have a team that plays well. I could make his argument by showing the Barclay center.  From what I heard, it didn't really change much.  Put a stadium in a small city with a winning crowd and people pay.   I love grabbing a drink and talking about the game...  But where do I go besides Petes after Arco? Mels?   This will be nothing but good for a city, who in all honesty, doesn't really have much other than the capital.    Billion dollar stadium with shitty team = Bad  Billion dollar arena with great team = great     We destroyed an eye sore of a mall that was rivaled in attendance to the country club mall... Eradicated a place where homeless people loitered and didn't really do much.  Building a new arena will attract so many more businesses and advertisement downtown.  It will create jobs.  It secures a team being here and with a possible hockey team coming..    It creates an environment that says "We wanna win".  Our skyline needs to develop and this may be a necessary piece to luring investors. Gridlock will suck but like anything...  We will make it work. I cant forsee anything to bad about this besides what may happen to Natomas.    Shhhh it's no talks no more...    Where?       Oh you...    To be fair...  Vlade had alot of cap room and a decent FA pool    Malone was found to be one of the refs from 2002 western conference finals.  Since on the resume he said he was honest and had integrity...  We realized he lied.  When Vivek brought in Vlade to negotiate bringing him on, he recognized him as one of the refs.  He had ptsd and canned his ass.  Fuck the Lakers.  I enjoyed you guys having Jeremy Lin. Steve Nash look great too.  So did Chris Paul.    I'm not a GM (though I'm sure I act like I am...  Sorry guys) and I don't know what their job demands...  But I personally feel that Pete made it look as if he has no idea WTF he was doing. Only thing good he did IMO was Gay.    Story of your mom   Eh. Life g'oes,  o%n!?    Lol I did.  I learned something by making a bad joke.  That is what Reddit is for.  A community helping each other grow through chiding and mockery.  You helped me grow!  Thanks much   I might just be stoopid. Fuck it.    Have the letter N...  You forgot to add one   You're full of crap. Shitty story   Your mom's old but I definitely wouldn't call it a sock...  More like a fishes mouth...  Including the smell   TBD is just your run of the mill mid size festival. Far from Coachella but is definitely a crazy experience from a regular concert as in overall experience.   As for it being your first festival,  I'll warn you that festivals IMO are like giant testing trays so you can sample alot of music.  Because they aren't solo concerts,  you lose alot of experience with a said band.  My rule is that if you like them at a festival,  you have to see them in a touring concert.  Different experiences.    I feel like I've done this alot recently ha   Yes   This shows how shitty ESPN is as a source      Dudes an ass hole      Ok   Eh go down south and you will see cold...  It's weird here,  some people are super friendly and others aren't. But I would say alot tend to their own business and don't necessarily include others. See people post all the time about finding friends do. Depends on what shit you like.    Yea...  It's tmobile   Good pickup   Now that we are signing  Bar. I'd rather Rondo starting   You ever overhear the neighbors talking about the block party but have no idea what they are talking about...?    I bet your home owners association meeting are a fucking hoot.    The sunflower in fair oaks will be her main stay vegan eats   I just Google cuckold...  You're a bitch   Well fuck...  That was lackluster at best   Lol I get that... So what's the joke?  IS THAT THE JOKE!?    What am I missing..    Wutm8?    I guess you had to have been there   Or because it's summer and hot...  And I drink it to cool and regulate body temperature   Soooo....  Heard ya wanted to earn some monies...    Wait...  What?  We cook our food...  That's why sometimes it's hot. I would say temperate and geographical location is huge in this.  I like iced water in the summer but like cocoa in the winter.  I would say there are equal amount of hot beverages as cold...  Generally same as food.    They show them by floor level   Easily the shittiest shark costumes around   I hate it when you take off a girls panties and they smell like *Autumn Harvest*   Huehuehue   Ok   8===D 0:  	149
 See you down in Arizona Bay.       Stop trying to make Fetch happen.   It's not going to happen.    According to Wikipedia, pump-action shotguns are illegal if they hold more than 5 rounds.  I'm not an expert, but in skimming how the Australian gun laws Wiki page, they break things down into different categories, and the higher the category, the more restrictive the regulations on ownership.  Since this is a lever-action gun, I'm guess that allows it to fall under the least restrictive category, which is what has the antis all pissed off, since it's a technical solution to a bureaucratically-induced limitation.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia   But I thought that the gun laws passed in the wake of Port Arthur were the envy of the world and ended violence there.    Sci-fi author Peter Watts wrote the novel Blindsight specifically to play with this concept.   It's part of his back catalog, and available for free on his website here: http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm  Blindsight is easily one of the best sf novels of the last 20 years.   http://giphy.com/search/mind-blown/   Newsweek couldn't hack it any longer as a printed news outlet and went under.   From this article, it's abundantly clear that the Newsweek site under control of The Daily Beast hopes to gin up hits by being yet another Huffington post clone.          I guess he missed the fact that the NRA has, by far, the largest number of certified instructors, the most widespread training programs, and the largest budgets slotted for creation and distribution of safety materials.                "Racist" is misspelled, and it bugs the crap out of me every time this meme pops up.    They do note that they don't have a problem with concealed carry.        HA!   You know what?  I'm leaving it as is.   The old paradigm, says Gross, who has a background in advertising, was keeping certain guns away from all people. (Assault rifles, for example.) The new one, which focuses on background checks, is about keeping all guns away from certain people. (People with criminal records, domestic abusers, the mentally ill.)   This particular bit of bullshit jumped right out at me. If Dan Gross were the least bit serious about implementing this as a policy stance, the Brady Campaign would be suing the shit out of states and municipalities that have bans on so-called "assault weapons," magazines, and even calling for the feds to repeal GCA '68 and NFA '34.  I also find it highly amusing that the one state-level victory they point to; the background check law in Washington, is not being enforced, and is, by all accounts, being flouted on a continual basis. Yeah, that's a real win there, fella.   Sounds like they're late to the punch.   The pro-gun movement has been using the same strategies as the gat marriage movement for about a decade now.    Of course or does, but we should note concern ourselves with trying to please them.    Trump almost certainly won't be the GOP nominee.   He doesn't have the support of either the big money GOP machine supporters or the grass roots support you see for Cruz or Walker.   He gets a lot of air time because he's a rich blow hard and makes for amusing news coverage.    The 2 million stat is derived from studies undertaken by criminologist Gary Kleck.  His results are on the high side, but not necessarily unrealistic. Other studies have come up with numbers ranging from 60,000 (from the deeply anti-gun and highly partisan VPC) to 500,000, and 1,500,000.  As for people mistakenly using a gun illegally, this seems to be fairly rare, though I'm not aware of any specific studies. You could probably use the conviction rates of concealed carry permittees as a reasonable proxy.         The best lucid dream I ever experienced started when I was dreaming that I was doing push ups.   Around push up 45 I realized I wasn't suffering any muscle fatigue, and that's when I realized I was dreaming.   Vice, you used to be cool.    As opposed to what? The fat, gun-toting racists in the Arab world?    https://youtu.be/IJEO3rmefmI   .   It's a response employed by brainless idiots who are actually incapable of having rational discussions regarding the limitations of governments.   In short, it's a response only slightly more idiotic than "if you love freedom so much, then why don't you marry it?!"     *DINGDINGDING*  We have a winner.   Merica! Yeah!    Well, boys, time to pack it in. The forces of gun control have Kim Kardashian on their side.   Tl;dr: any time someone mentions Australia in a gun control debate, it's a leftist dog whistle for coersion and confiscation.   Ah, yes, the old "it's not confiscation if we coerce you" line of thinking.   Do you actually believe people but that line of bullshit, or are you just so stupid that you honestly believe it yourself?         Joke's on them. I run ad block plus, ghostery, and noscript.         The long-term goal here is to spin up a machine designed to feed credulous members of the media gun control talking points while maintaining the cover of using a supposedly "impartial" source.  Think of it as a news media equivalent of the Bloomberg school of public health, but instead of using the public (and reporters') innate trust of the medical establishment, they're using the cover of being a supposedly impartial media source.  I expect that part of the reason for this is that the public has largely figured out that when the mass media quotes organizations like Brady or VPC in a story that they're lacking in credibility.  There was a similar attempt a number of years back where The Joyce Foundation threw money at academics to attempt to re-write historical and legal precedent on the 2nd amendment to redefine it as a "collective right."  Off the top of my head, the most notable academics to help perpetrate this fraud were Cornell West (yes, the Cornell West that had a bit part in The Matrix 2), and Michael Bellesiles, whose book on guns was so fraught with outright fraud that it essentially destroyed his career.            Oh, look, 16 minutes of my life I would never be able to recover.      But the Democrats promised that if we passed their gun control proposals these sorts of things wouldn't happen!       Nice photo!   Consider sharing it with /r/perfecttiming, they'll get a kick out of it.    The forces of anti-gun bigotry are fans of the long con.   Always have been, always will be, because their end-state goals would never actually fly among the general populace.    And anyone who has a full gas can is just in on the conspiracy.    Nice!       Sweet! Thanks for another reminder!  I've donated another $5 to the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association on your behalf!  Since you've been so helpful, I've upvoted your post.  :-)   Hey there!  Thanks for the reminder!  I've donated $5 to the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association for you!  They're helping to fight the draconian laws that were passed there.  Incidentally, would you care to explain why you think someone should be thrown in prison simply for a grip?  I mean, it seems to be kind of cowardly to want to imprison people because of how they hold an object.  http://imgur.com/y5AHiv0         Why don't you go join your local PD and see if you still feel the same way after a year or so spent doing 3rd shift patrol duty.       Given that the State Department tried to Crack down on Defense Distributed, which holds no information that is proprietary to the defense industry or related to national defense, I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't use these proposed regulations to go after other people or organizations with  similar phoney-baloney claims.   The protections in the proposal are frankly pretty weak sauce.    The Brady Campaign argued that their members fear personal violence if the law stands.  All two of them?    HUFFPO gonna HUFFBLOW.      Agree.   My take is that State really didn't like how Cody Wilson dodged their attempt to creak down on him, and this is a proposal aimed squarely at him (that also has a lot of splash damage for the rest of us.)   Steve Israel is a deeply stupid person.   Only thing I can figure is that he's just trying to suck up to Chuck Schumer.       David Hemenway is probably at the top of their list.       Didn't this lunatic get censured by the Catholic church or something?    No problem. Sorry for the lack of source, in on mobile.   However, iirc this conclusion can be found in the "technical guidance" letters that came out of the governor's office.   Googling should turn them up.    This was brought up in the lawsuit to challenge the Colorado magazine ban.   The state's response was that it was perfectly legal to have the magazine so long as you only used it with the cartridges that limited the capacity e.g. .458 SOCOM.   Putting other cartridges in the magazine that would allow you to load more than the legal limit (.223) would result in a fine and a trip top the slammer.   It's a perfect example of just how insane these laws actually are.    Not even. It's just a trend I've noticed.    Why is it that whenever someone in academia days something completely idiotic, they're either a representative of the soft sciences or an administrator?    Joke's on them. I use ad block plus.    Which is why English majors shouldn't be allowed in machine shops.       Betteridge's Law of Headlines applies here.          Just out of curiosity, I checked /r/mets and /r/MLB and this stunt didn't even rate a mention in either of those subs.  No one cares about this stupid political stunt.    But nobody wants to take away your guns, amiright?      "Banana for scale."   During the federal ban from 1994-2004 they were going for twice that cost.   Not that it would stop some lunatic from maxing out his mom's credit card in order to get one.    Cool!   Thanks!   The issue, though, is that trying to separate "gun violence" into it's own special category is, in most cases, disingenuous.  Even if you work from the assumption that passing gun control works, and drives down "gun violence," without actually addressing the underlying issues of that violence, all that happens is that alternate methods of inflicting harm are substituted, with no real effect on the rate of overall violence.   I'm guessing that's a reference to AR15-based pistols and the recent attempt to ban M855.   So, out of curiosity, I went back and added up all of the donations to various pro-gun organizations that I've donated to in the names of the various graboids that haunt our hallways, and figured some of you guys would be interested in seeing the breakdown.  So here it is: CALGUNS Foundation: $10  Second Amendment Foundation: $5  Virginia Citizens' Defense League: $5  The Independence Institute: $5  Students for Concealed Carry: $5  CALGUNS Foundation: $10 (I should have just done the $20 donation and reaped some swag...)  The Independence Institute: $5  Oregon Firearms Federation: $5 (and they sent me a couple stickers!)  Texas State Rifle and Pistol Association: $5  NRA-ILA: $10  Second Amendment Foundation: $5   *Total: $70*  I'd like to thank our resident trolls for enabling me to donate a grand total of $70 to various pro-gun organizations. Until now, I've always just been one of those people who sends off $25 once a year to the NRA and then feels vaguely guilty about not doing more to fight for civil rights.  Because of our pet graboids, I've now donated nearly 3x the amount of an annual NRA membership to various organizations working to advance gun rights, including some small, but deserving groups of people.  The old saying is true. Turns out it truly is better to give than to receive.  :)   What an idiotic proposal; even by the already drop-dead moronic standards of the average graboid.  Passing this law would be the death knell of the gun control movement, and here's why.  Let's say that this proposal is magically signed into law by Obama next Monday.  By Wednesday afternoon the NRA would spin up a program whereby they'd offer discounted liability insurance to any gun owner who becomes an NRA member*.   By Friday morning, the NRA would probably have something like 10 million new members.  Two weeks down the road, their ranks would swell to ~30 million members.  A month later, the rolls would probably stabilize at a total of around 50 million new NRA members, making the NRA easily the biggest, best funded, and most cantankerous grassroots organization in United States political history.  The NRA's war chest would swell to record proportions, and not only would we live in a world where every gun control proposal would be utterly eviscerated, and their advocates publicly humiliated, but you'd end up seeing the repeal of every gun control law back to the Sullivan Act.  Sure, it would leave us in a situation where we'd all have to pay an annual fee for some piddly insurance policy**, but that would be a fairly small price to pay in exchange for being able to order a belt-fed grenade launcher via Amazon (Free shipping for Prime Members!).   *Remember, the NRA already has something of an insurance infrastructure already in place, as they insure most shooting ranges, as well as work with a company to offer insurance plans for gun collections.   **After all, the NRA wouldn't work to repeal the law that vaults them into the political stratosphere.   No worries, if you don't have the scratch, it's no big deal.  Hell, my bank account certainly doesn't reach even .0001% of the depths of stupidity regularly exhibited by the anti-gun trolls on Reddit, which is why I figured it would be cool to turn it into a call to action for anyone who wanted, or had the means, to participate.  So donate when you can, but don't beat yourself up if you have more important financial obligations to take care of.   In the fight to preserve liberty, I have no problem whatsoever with opponents who show up on game day on the short bus.   Maybe CSGV envisions itself as the future equivalent of a Soviet Trampler Brigade from WWII?  http://militaryhistorymatters.blogspot.com/2009/02/soviet-penal-battalions.html   Respectfully, I must disagree, especially in this case.  Look at the historical symbolism (going all the way back to General Gadsden and Benjamin Franklin) inherent to using a rattlesnake for a symbol. It's not an animal that goes out of its way to attack; in fact, they're quite content to be left alone, and will typically only strike in self-defense.  Now, compare that to the symbolism that CSGV has added: a bare, human foot attempting to deliberately stomp, to death, an animal that simply wishes to be left alone.  Now, you can argue that this does reflect a facet of humanity, but it's not the "starry-eyed dream version" of humanity you spoke of.  Rather, the facet of humanity CSGV are symbolizing is arguably the worst part of human nature: the drive to dehumanize, outgroup, attack, and kill those who you disagree with.   This poster isn't a representation of pie-in-the-sky hippy-dippy idealism. It's a representation of a wish to obliterate and kill what they irrationally fear and hate.  The one thing that I find heartening in the whole image is that they were evidently too stupid to bother putting on boots before trying to stomp a poisonous snake to death, which indicates that our foes fly their idiocy and lack of preparation right on their very own flag.   Good.    The anti-gun movement possesses none of the things listed on that foot.    Thanks         You guys have no idea how happy it makes me to see this thread.   Thanks for picking up the idea and running with it.    Everyone look out! They've got Perez Hilton!   We're doomed!   Most of them are deeply narcissistic.   Thankfully, they're usually too cowardly to act on their beliefs.    For what it's worth, the choice of venue, density of people, limited access to exits, and ability to control the environment by locking or blocking doors seems to play a tremendously significant role in the number of victims in mass shootings.   Control of the environment is a theme that shows up over and over again in these sorts of incidents, and frankly, is far more worrisome than whether the perp used a scary black gun or "high capacity" magazines.   TL;DR: The size of the magazine in the gun doesn't give much of a performance boost when you're shooting fish in a barrel.    It's my understanding that silencers were included in the NFA to dissuade poaching.   No idea how much truth there is to that claim, though.   I agree with this as well.  All humans make choices based on emotions and feelings at one time or another, and in many cases, an individual may not have the ability or interest to weigh arguments based on logic and reason, and will instead opt to go with a feeling, or gut reaction.  As such, it behooves us to have arguments of all sorts ready to go, be they reasoned, emotional, psychological or sociological.  The article was fairly "meh" though. I was looking for a more academic analysis of Australia's crime.   No updates in two years and 24 subscribers.   I'm pretty sure that the sub with pictures of dragons fucking cars is more active and popular than all of the gun control subs combined.    Is that sub still even a thing?  Last time I looked, it was pretty much two pity-worthy guys who don't get enough sunlight, and their 47 sock puppet accounts.   Believe it or not, Wired published an article on the AR15, and it's a pretty decent primer on why the gun is so popular.  http://www.wired.com/2013/02/ar-15/  The bottom line is that the AR15 is no less dangerous than a regular hunting rifle, as it fires much weaker rounds.  In it's favor, it's a jack of all trades, and dominates a lot of applications from precision competition (Service Rifle, National Match Rifle), to home defense, to Action Sports, to patrol service, and even some hunting applications.        Awesome news.   It's been interesting to watch the American Suppressor Association racking up wins at the state level, while apparently flying under the radar of most of the grabber set.    Whattup, nonja?   Thanks for the reminder!   I've just donated $10 to The Calguns Foundation for you!   They fight for the 2nd amendment rights of all Californians!   Cheers!       Joan Peterson is a lunatic.   Her blog is like reading the ravings of a paranoid schizophrenic.    At least he's honest about his intentions.   This, at least, makes him a better person than the other true-believing losers who advocate for "gun safety."   If God doesn't want me to have a gun, He/She/It can show up on my doorstep and make the request in person.   In the fight to preserve civil rights, I would much prefer that our opponents show up on game day riding the short bus.   Way to go, son!  You just netted $5 for the Second Amendment Foundation.  In case you weren't aware, they just won a preliminary injunction to challenge Washington DC's unconstitutional gun laws!  As far as your claim about me being a liar, we'll just chalk that up to a case of projection.  Cheers!  :-)   If you're going to donate to a Colorado organization, donate to CSSA or the Independence Institute.   CSSA: http://cssa.org/news.php  Independence Institute: http://www.i2i.org/   Merging atf with the FBI is a terrible idea because the last thing the pro-gun movement needs is a federal organization that's professional, competent, zealous in their execution, and generally well-respected by the public.       It's easier to hate someone if you dehumanize them first.      If it operates anything like the old Striker 12 shotgun, it's basically nothing but an overgrown DA revolver.   Tee-hee!  $5 donated to Students for Concealed Carry!  This is fun!  :-)   Not sure where I saw it, but someone made an excellent point about this proposal:  If it gets passed into law, it would re-insert into the legal system the janky-ass definition of "assault weapon" that the grabber set loves, and it would do it in a way that would be embraced by gun owners.  This should be opposed at every level.   No idea what you're talking about, the Independence Institute is strictly libertarian.  Thanks for yet another reminder!  I've now donated $5 to the Virginia Citizens' Defense League!  Cheers!  :-)   Thanks for the reminder!  Because of you, I've just donated $5 to The Independence Institute.  They're working to repeal or amend the ineffective magazine ban and background check laws in Colorado!  Cheers!   It's been awhile since I've logged into Reddit, been busy at work.  That said, thanks for the reminder!   :-)  In addition to the $400+ order I've put in for various supplies, I've also opted to make a $10 donation to the Calguns foundation.  Cheers!    That part sounds super iffy, because how do you calculate the "burn" for either fat or carbs? I thought cells primarily "burned" glucose, not fat/carbs? Maybe I'm mis-remembering high school bio, but I thought that larger stuff like fat/carb/protein was broken down beforehand into glucose and other simple sugars to be "used"/"burned" by cells?  First off, I'm not an expert, don't have a background in this stuff, and have been trying to get a better handle on it purely as a layman who's interested in improving physical fitness.   As I understand it, you're correct that the body uses glucose as a fuel for physical activity. However, your body only has a limited store of ready-to-go glucose on hand, and intense physical activity can rapidly deplete this supply.  Once your body's supply of glucose is depleted, in order to continue generating fuel for your exercise, the body has to switch over to breaking down fat and carbohydrates into glucose* that it can then utilize.  Evidently, one way to measure this is to determine what's called your VO2 max, basically the maximum volume of oxygen your body can utilize.  Here's an article that looks like it breaks down the process and machine used for testing that OP is talking about:  http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2012/01/look-at-testing-with-new-leaf-fitness.html   *Not totally sure on this bit.      So, you're the one!    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A7vnGuOGX3U/UoRNaEvKbuI/AAAAAAAAAr0/Atix_kezhBo/s1600/goldilocks_480gif.gif   "You first."   I'm not a mod, so I can't ban 'em.  Decided to do the next best thing.   To whoever hooked me up with Reddit Gold:  Thank you.   Thanks for catching this. I've fixed the link.   Wow.     Much of my issue with him comes from the fact that he advocates for homeopathic or alternative medicine, is an anti-vaxxer, and opposes GMO foods.  His views on guns are just par for the course.   I like this idea.    I'm perfectly OK with that and here's why:  Let's say someone here tried to engage a graboid in a discussion.   And the graboid responds.   There is now a pretty good chance that his response will result in a donation to a pro-gun organization in his name.    Awesome, thanks!    I wonder how hard it would be to list a weekly running tally of the amount raised by each troll in their troll flair?   It would be like a race to see which one is the best at raising money for gun rights!   /u/whubbard is that something we could do?    ZOMG, the response to this has been awesome!   I love you guys!    They broke into the wrong damn rec room!    Oregon Firearms Federation   https://oregonfirearms.ejoinme.org/MyPages/DonationPage/tabid/70447/Default.aspx   The pac for the Oregon Firearms Federation (Oregon's only no compromise gun lobby!) is grateful for your contribution of $5.  I was able to list your username as the tribute for the donation.   Thanks!    Let's start a list of pro-gun charities in case anyone needs a quick link. Post links in response to this post.   NRA-ILA  https://www.nraila.org/donate/  Second Amendment Foundation  https://www.saf.org/?page_id=66  Texas State Rifle Association  https://www.tsra.com/donate/  Independence Institute  http://www.i2i.org/#     By all means please spread this far and wide!   Lately, it seems like the level of discourse around here has gotten worse, and this is due to an influx of graboid trolls who are only interested in disrupting the discussions, instead of actually trying to take part.  The mods here are big believers in the right to free expression, so the trolls don't get banned.  So I've decided to turn the aimless hate and vitriol of our trolls into a positive outlet for the 2nd Amendment.  Every time I come across a post from a graboid troll, I whip out my wallet and make a small donation ($5, or whatever the allowable minimum is) to a pro-gun organization that I pick at random.  Let me tell you, this feels AMAZING. Instead of being upset and crabby at some idiot troll (giving them exactly what they need) I now feel great because I'm helping out others. In fact, so far, our resident troll, tall_liberal2, has been responsible for me donating to the NRA-ILA, the Second Amendment Foundation, the Texas State Rifle Association, and the Independence Institute.  I didn't want to keep it to myself, so I figured I'd throw a post up and see if anyone else would be interested in taking part in a Charity Troll Challenge.  Here are the guidelines:  1.) Upon finding a post from a graboid troll, go to a website for a pro-gun group (bonus points for one that's in a state currently battling against Bloomberg's minions).  2.) Donate whatever amount you wish, via whatever means are available (credit card, paypal, bitcoin, time).  3.) If you can dedicate the donation to someone or leave a comment, say that it's for Reddit User (Troll's username.)  4.) Respond to the troll here by telling them which organization they've helped you donate to, and how much you've donated.  And that's it!  So, who else wants to help fight against trolls and for gun rights?   Dang. Look at that, another post from tall_liberal2!  So, I've just donated $5 to the Independence Institute in Colorado. They're currently suing the state over the universal background check law, and working with legislators to loosen the state's useless magazine ban.  Thanks for the reminder that I needed to donate to a pro-gun group!   Awesome! Thanks for your generosity!   I bet that law was originally passed because of John Dillinger.    Awesome!   Tee-hee.  Thanks for this post!  Another donation goes to a pro-gun group!  This time, you're responsible for a donation to the Texas State Rifle Association.  Who knew that philanthropy could be so much fun?  :-)   Bill Maher is an idiot who happens to be well-spoken enough that he comes off as erudite when repeating stuff authored by the writing crew on his TV show.   Oh.  Look at that.  Another fiver goes to the Second Amendment Foundation.  They're grateful for the support.  :-)   I've decided that every time I see one of your posts, I'm going to make a small donation to a pro-gun organization of my choosing.  If there's a field that allows me to dedicate the donation to someone, it will be dedicated to you.  Congratulations, you're now responsible for a $10 donation to the NRA-ILA.  :-)   I wonder how many articles Fenton has written that advocate for gun control.   Interesting article.   However, I think the issue if even more granular than the author claims.   Even in states where new gun control laws have passed, (eg Colorado and Washington) it has only been in the face of massive popular opposition from those who don't live in large cities, and even a lot of law enforcement is refusing to enforce these laws.     So much for that "national conversation about guns."   The lawyers for the Brady Campaign have a history of making extremely poor decisions.  Evidently they suck at advising their clients, too.   Speeding arguably puts other people in danger.  An upstanding citizen who chooses to own a plastic box with a spring in it is endangering exactly no one.      Were that the case, you wouldn't need to answer for him.  1/10  Would not read again.   Why? So he can engage in round 2 with your mom?   It turns out that a mind really is like a parachute.  It won't work if it's full of crap.    Letting him post here is hilarious.  He does an absolute disservice to the gun control movement, reinforcing the stereotype that anti gunners are both deeply stupid and horrendously bigoted.    So he's an example of one of the unsexiest manifestations of Rule 34.   Makes sense, even if it does squick me out.    I bet you win a lot of converts with that style of rhetoric.       Tell me.  Does it hurt?   It's the same rep that wants to institute federal control over 3d printers because someone might use it to make a gun.  I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.   With high enough round counts, it's theoretically possible for the holes in a receiver that hold the pins for the trigger group to become worn and enlarged, as the pins will rotate and wear on the receiver.   With enough wear from pin rotation, the holes can become so enlarged that the pins won't stay in place.  This is why KNS makes anti-rotation pins.  That said, I've never seen an AR with this problem.   BATFE publishes an annual report listing every gun maker in the country, and how many guns they made. I don't remember if they break the list down by whether a given company makes pistols, rifles or shotguns though.  That said, you could probably get a decent idea of the number of semi-auto rifles made by running Google searches on company names.  It would be a lot of work, but that's probably your best bet for a reasonable ballpark figure.   "Greetings, friends. Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now. So, use it, and send one dollar to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay, eternal happiness is just a dollar away."   Many 3 gun style matches may not allow magnified optics in heavy metal division.  Some will, though. You'd probably be well served with any scope from a decent company that's capable of doing 1-4x or better.   They won't back Gura, there's no love lost between him and the NRA.  That said, the NRA can and does file progun lawsuits, they just tend to be very conservative in their choices.   Reagan owned an AR15. I suspect that letter was drafted by an underling at the behest of Brady or Reagan was already having memory problems.   Ha!  I've always done a Richard Nixon voice for PPF.   Where are the roads? I don't see them listed.  	178
 Going after a [Best Picture, huh](http://i.imgur.com/kiru8Fa.jpg)?   I gotta go rewatch this. Saw it in theaters but I like me my subtitles.   For me it's The Dark Knight rises- Christopher Nolan. (Still better than Man of Steel)      Plus, you could use this to have them accidentally attack a family member.   3) "Lieutenant Dan, ice cream. Lieutenant Dan?"  2) " I'm pretty tired...I think I'll go home now."  1) "I thought I'd try out my sea legs."  "But you ain't got no legs lieutenant dan."  "Yes...I know that."    Forgive the mistakes this is from memory and I seem to have misplaced my internet.   It was a fun movie with a fresh concept and art house direction.   My favorite Brian Brushwood video: [Mexican Race War](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1iSiTMjQmM t=7m10s).   Have not seen Brazil. Have heard the ending in this subreddit 2+ times this week.   I agree, I also like all the scenes that precede this scene.   I didn't realise I was getting downvoted. Noted.   Gone Girl.    I haven't read the book. I'm just fascinated when [a ](#s "character intricately weaves together a diabolical plan that satisfied her need for revenge and gave her a happy ending")   Good choice.       Hoping for that 4-hour Joss Whedon cut.   Still haven't see the movie.   Moon and Hangover.    I had the pleasure to work in the theater during their run. Also The Hurt Locker.   Sometimes when I'm watching a movie, if it's really good I don't want it to end.   Firefly   So how's your sex life?   The second viewing caught me off guard. I would laugh at stuff I didn't laugh at before.   Kidnapped(Sequestrados). It's on US netflix. It was mentioned a few days back in a list but no one had seen it. The movie is tense and consists wholly of a few (6) tracking shots during it's entirety.   Go on...   Especially with nobody at the wheel.   I don't know what to believe anymore.   What about leaving change in a tip jar?   Been there. Just praying for each following block.      I would see the trailer for it.   How could I "DIY" this?   Sorry, mobile.   Elon Musk and Steven Spielberg were looking to get their hands on the game.    I joined just before this E3 to see if there'd be a release date. Stayed since you guys are mostly alright.   *NMS   Looks like a mix of Elite squad and blow.   [Good thing his penis was big enough to tell she was a man.](http://imgur.com/YcooD33)   sounds like a Nip/Tuck subplot.   Cool. Coolcoolcool.   Your references are outta control.   Bet on black.   Inspiration hits me at any time and it can be tempting to follow it. However that could be a subconscious attempt to have you quit on a current project. I just write down what hits me and put it away to get back to later. This helps create perespective. it might be a great idea but you might have learned something about yourself or the idea that forces you to consider whether to venture writing it. For example, last night I was watching an alien b-movie and I thought " I could do this better. This movie is sending a message about the war in the middle east but the dialogue is atrocious. If I were to do this...". So after fleshing out an idea, I put it away because pursuing it would take away my concentration from the first project.     Basically put: "Don't half ass two things, whole ass one thing."-Ron Swanson    Firefly  FTFY: Serenity   I'd like to read it...maybe.      This series should end with Tudyk and Fillion laying by the poolside and have an exchange like this:   T: So, I hear Spectrum might come back soon.  N: Really?   T: No, not really. That would be like Firefly coming back.   He was also in the rules of attraction as Patrick Bateman.   How could I fix the first issue? I'm on Celtx.   The judge was addressing someone offscreen. I was implying a society of rapid fire type trials.   Consider the footage we've seen. Hundreds of Npc's in the most far reaching worlds. I'd be doing barrel rolls all day.

          If I had to guess someone probably called in a bomb scare. I saw one officer going parked car to parked car with a dog.      Fortune telling that is not explicitly for the purpose of entertainment is a misdemeanor crime in the state of New York. [Penal Law 165.35.](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0165.35_165.35.html) .    [Here](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ruling-Phua.pdf) you go.      His defense attorneys had never tried a criminal jury case "I did not question the unfairness of Mr. Ford having appointed counsel who had never tried a criminal jury case much less a capital one. It never concerned me that the defense had insufficient funds to hire experts or that defense counsel shut down their firms for substantial periods of time to prepare for trial. These attorneys tried their very best, but they were in the wrong arena. They were excellent attorneys with experience in civil matters. But this did not prepare them for trying to save the life of Mr. Ford."         I am a public defender. I have little to no faith in the system. I do not know you personally but I would bet I get more experience with the system in one month than you will in your entire life. I see things you probably can't even imagine. But I am aware that private attorneys have a necessary job to do. I strongly believe in the right of every person to have a competent defense and I hold no negative opinions against any criminal defense attorney for providing that necessary service (some I have negative opinions about for unrelated things).    I strongly disagree with you but you're obviously entitled to your opinion.   If a private defense attorney defends someone he knows is guilty or believes is likely to be guilty he is a bad guy?    he was one of OJ Simpson's lawyers  Do you think all criminal defense attorneys are bad guys for doing their jobs?   It was most likely a hearing ordered after a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to [New York CPL 440.10](http://ypdcrime.com/cpl/article440.htm) was filed.      I must have missed all the information in my post dedicated to the mayor. Please point it out to me. You call it nitpicking. I call it presenting the facts accurately. Originally, I thought you unintentionally misrepresented the stats but based upon your reply I more inclined to believe that you intended to mislead others. Looking through your recent posts you repeat your lies in other comments too. Crime is down. You should accept that fact.  You said that crime was up. It is completely relevant that I pointed out that crime overall is down. I'm sorry that someone actually read the information you linked to. As for me being "completely silent" I did not know I was required to respond to every post and every comment on this subreddit in order to point out your wrong information. It also seems that it would be completely unnecessary for me to respond to that "jackass" considering he is at -24 points as of now and has been responded to by others.    Based on the link you provided your comment gives a false impression. First, crime overall is down 4.7% from last year. Second: murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny, transit crimes, and housing crimes have decreased this year. You said "sex crimes [and] assault[s]" have increased but you should be more specific. Misdemeanor assaults and misdemeanor sex crimes have increased while felony assaults and rapes have decreased. There does not appear to be a statistic for non-rape felony sex crimes. You are correct that shootings have increased.  	19

 Backstory: I'm in the funeral home for my grandfather's visitation. This nightmare fuel is hanging on the wall outside one of the rooms. This would be the funeral director, and the dog that he presumably uses to lure people to the well in his basement.      Hey you know if you're made of money you could check out the proof research carbon wrapped barrela. As I understand it they're a lighter profile stainless barrel wrapped in a carbon sleeve to maintain rigidity under sustained fire.    Well that's good to know. All you hear around is "you gotta do shocks and springs for a bigger bumper." Good to get some first hand experience   did you have to get beefier front springs to compensate for that bumper?   Let's have the story on that tundra. My first gens in line for some upgrades.   No response given, although the $40 has been taken out of my bank account. I'm not incredibly happy, but maybe they've just taken the week after the fourth off? Not sure, out of ideas.   Email sent. I'm just kinda frustrated since I ordered a sling from vtac at the same exact time and its here already, whereas the wrap seems to have not even been shipped yet. Granted VTAC is in TN not out west.   Yeah I thought the same thing, but I pulled the trigger anyway. Late night purchases and whatnot...   Yeah I was thinking give them till the end of the week. Given the wrap was $19.95 and shipping was $20 I'm just a little impatient.   So after seeing an interesting handguard wrap on here a while back, I did some research and found out it's temperature protective handguard wrap, manufactured by Orca Arms. I ordered this product on July 2nd, granted it was 11pm here in Illinois, they're on the west coast. It's now nearly a week later, and I've received nothing since the order confirmation email. Am I too accustomed to my Amazon prime 2-day guarantee? Or is this something I should be contacting them about? Anyone had dealings with this company before? (Link for those interested)  http://orcaarms.com/index.php/tactical-gear/t-r-a-p-temperature-reduction-and-protective-wrap.html  UPDATE: I just sent an email to Orca Arms politely inquiring as to whether they were perhaps out of the office over the holiday and asking about the status of my order.   UPDATE 2: 7/10/15, no response to my email thus far, no further shipping info sent. Frustration intensifies.  UPDATE 3: 7/10/15, gave them a call this afternoon. Fellow on the other end says he was not sure why it hasn't shipped but assured me they'd get it in the mail and send a tracking number this evening. Hopefully can chalk this one up to a simple misplaced box.   Yeah I'm aware of the distinction. I doubt I will shoot it anyway. Might have it checked out to see if it's mechanically sound and then just put it up as a conversation piece.  	12
 I think more than 800 the author is overstretching the story    That's a nice coincidence. You know, I've never read Stephen King. If I would choose to start, which one would you recommend?    If Pokmon were real, which one would you like to eat first in a delicious meal?    I agree, music usually distracts me. If I enjoy it I find myself focusing on it. And if I don't, why would I  bother listening something I don't like    I've just finished my longest book. It's Caballo de Troya from J. J. Bentez. It was 1167 pages long.   What's your favorite long book? Did you had trouble finishing it?   I tried TLOTR The Return of the King.  I couldn't finish it, Sam and Frodo bored me to death   	6
 Lucas is my bet for Big A and Marion is BW   I'm just talking out my ass here, but being in a mental asylum may undernourish someone. I've seen lots of blondes dye their hair black. You never know. We've never seen lucas' parents. We don't know if he's adopted. But again, I'm just trying to justify it. I could be completely wrong.   You don't know. Either Charles is dead and he's impersonating him or hes somehow Charles. People can look years younger than what they really are.   Just compare the activity of him and someone like Julian Morris.  I know people may say that Julian won't post to give it away, but I think Brendan is posting more because he knows he'll be revealed as A. He hasn't appeared on PLL since the Xmas episode yet all of a sudden he's posting a lot.    Right but there was also a coincidence for Charles and Melissa in Black Widow Farm, yet people believe that. I'm just saying it's odd Freddy was used at the end of the episode and then there's a photophrapher named Freddy Lucas.   lol no but the name. lol the name and the fact that he's a photographer and look as this https://twitter.com/brendanrobinson  He is SO PLL Active compared to Drew and Julian, even Vanessa.   Freddy...Lucas...Photo   Freddy...Lucas...Photo   It HAS to be Lucas. I am 1,000% sure now it's Lucas.      Thank you.   And you get cake, and he gets cake, and EVERYONE GETS CAKES   pll themed shower thought.      hahahah  	15
 So the sleazeball is saying he's a poser? Or that he's just trying to con others to live like he supposedly does?   The woman made 3 critical mistakes:  (1) She made the "mistake" of being born black.  (2) She's in Texas and she thought she was a citizen with rights.  (3) She did not did not grovel and show the proper "respect" for the cop.  So because she clearly showed she was "irritated" at the trivial traffic stop, she was killed, either flat-out murdered or left to die injured and alone in her jail cell.  It's just another day and another police murder in the police state we're taught to call the "land of the free."   "A policeman's job is only easy in a police state." -- Orson Welles.      The lying NYT actually criticizing those who "rushed to war" in Iraq?!  Why does anyone even read/trust that rag?   "If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing." -- Malcolm X.   Perhaps *one.* But overall, I'd say it's the inherent corruption of capitalism.  Our economic system is based on raw greed and self-interest. It's in the economic interests of capitalists to bribe/lobby government officials and to take over the government, so they do.  If it wasn't the CoC, capitalists would just invent another organization, ALEC, or whatever.   "The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is fascism - ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any other controlling private power." -- US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.   The headline is the good news!  The bad news is that odds are the 1/3 will be when you're asleep right after puking your guts out after a chemo treatment.   The Chamber of Commerce is a private group for/of businesses. They'll have their own agenda.  Why not complain about the US government's Dept. of Agriculture or Commerce which help shove tobacco down the throats of other countries?  Why aren't we attacking the so-called "free trade" agreements and legal mechanisms which allow corporations to sue other countries?  Wouldn't we be better off trying to regain control of our corporate-controlled government and restoring the republic?   "I hope we shall take warning from the example of England and crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our Government to trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country." -- Thomas Jefferson, 1816.       Yes there is. Oil companies ~~need~~ *want* more money.   FTFY.       Actually, I corrected the original post just to show that American militarism and the trampling of civil rights makes little or no difference whether it's a Democrat or a Republican.   "Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee." -- Famous American socialist (and blind person) Helen Keller, 1911.         I started reading but stopped after I realized the first lady was a 73 year old singer/celebrity, and the second was author's 75 year old grandmother whose advice was "Im too old to finish bad books or drink cheap wine."  On that note, life's too short to read bad, fluffy articles.  Hey, maybe I did get something out of the article!   The media doesn't show blacks committing crimes?!  Have you watched *any* episode of the "Cops" TV show or many nightly news shows?  Well, considering the source web site brags it is "Pro-White" and "Pro-South", this sort of racist rant really isn't surprising is it?   Time's entire article is premised on the idea that the recession is over, an idea I don't think my neighbors nor millions of Americans would agree with.  Just because the government can [cook statistics](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data) to claim that unemployment is only ~5% (when including "discouraged workers" doubles it, and including long-term discouraged workers which Clinton redefined out of existence multiples the number by more than 4), and that the economy grew for this or that quarter thereby not making us in a recession any more, is statistical lunacy.  What's next? Is Time Inc. going to tell us that inflation -- based on some "new and improved" government statistical algorithm -- is really super low?!   You make valid points that too few take the time to ponder.   I treat all life forms with respect.  The problem is that, to put it bluntly and honestly, our entire economic system is geared to treat all life forms for profit. Respect isn't even on the radar let alone factor into the financial equation.   How did the rat's legs get broken?  You'd have to ask Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University. If I had to guess, I'd guess that they anesthetize the rats, use some sort of bone-breaking tool, and then allow them to wake up again and measure how long it takes for them to heal. If that's true, we can only pity the poor guy employed at the task of breaking the rats' legs.  Like the guy at the slaughterhouse who works the bolt gun to stun each of the cows that are butchered, cow after cow for an entire day's shift and day after day and week after week, some jobs are far more brutal than others.   "They make tallow out of cattle and money out of men." -- The 'father of sociology', German Max Weber, talking about capitalists and capitalism, from Weber's famous book "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism."      One thing our domestic propaganda system is very good at is flushing various aspects of history down Orwell's proverbial memory hole. Nowhere is this more true than of rebellion in the US military.  For example, in one of our earlier imperial wars, the 1840s war where we seized 1/2 of Mexico, a group of largely Irish US Army soldiers revolted in disgust at the US war and switched sides to fight for Mexico. Mexico has streets named after the "St. Patrick's Battalion" but in the US this has largely been erased from popular history as the war was whitewashed and spun for US nationalistic purposes.  Many have already forgotten the resistance in the US military from soldiers opposed to Bush's war on Iraq, everything from the stop-loss resisters to those who recognized it as a blatant war of aggression and who refused to deploy, considering it more just and more honorable to be sent to a military stockade for a few months and to be "dishonorably" discharged.  The resistance inside the US military against the US' war on Vietnam was stark and widespread, but we've had decades of time, much effort at deliberate spin and historical revisionism to erase that history   This is wildly sensationalistic as well as being unsourced.  Wildly sensationalistic? [Here's one source](http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/11/18/are-drum-circles-protected-under-the-constitution/) authored by a well-known journalist.  FWIW, you'll probably find the [2005 documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469589/) "[Sir! No Sir!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nPJgeg6hpA)" to be highly informative.   "The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important', of course, depends on one's values." -- Historian Howard Zinn.   What's that supposed to mean, other than the clear attack of being one of "those" people?  I suppose it's much easier to resort to such ad hominem attacks rather than actually acknowledging our government's actions or arguing to justify our aggression.  I'll just take the smear of being a brick wall as being a person who has moral integrity and does not support aggression simply based on the hypocritical and nationalistic idea of what country is committing the act. Given that case, I consider it a point of pride.   "In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock." -- Thomas Jefferson.   Isn't this merely a facet of the greed and corruption inherent to capitalism?  It's in the economic self-interest of the capitalist to externalize huge expenses like building a modern sports stadium. Therefore the capitalist will ~~bribe~~ "lobby" politicians and seek to have someone else -- in this case the public -- pay for those large expenses.  There's nothing new here right? It's a simple application of privatizing profit and saddling the public with expenses.   [Here is Oliver's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ) but **beware** -- it's a black hole for time!  [Here is the episode on sports stadiums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcwJt4bcnXs).   You're right, but here's a conspiracy theory for you: Given the censorship in the main Reddit sub-reddits, /r/conspiracy is fast becoming an alternative venue to avoid the censorship that permeates Reddit.   It won't stop until people start organizing. It's going to take more than some civilian review board and the things we hear about now.  It's going to take a political alternative to the Republicans and Democrats, an alternative that will advocate new ideas in policing and law-and-order, and a radical decentralization of our existing police bureaucracies.   Ditto. Say what you want about the "fat pig" stereotype of cops, I couldn't imagine that cop doing this.    I knew that it was morally wrong. They wanted us to prepare statements and not say anything. I told them I just couldnt go along with it, said Pisciotta.  That sort of moral indifference applies to *many* aspects of US/western society, doesn't it?  I mean, everything from ignoring or stepping over a homeless person on the street to the US government using torture and waging unending wars.  Yet do our schools' standardized tests measure their students moral integrity and courage, or aside from preaching about plagiarism and not cheating on tests, is this topic actually addressed in any coherent way in our schools?   I'd argue that would be the case in most places in the US.  The guy would've been prosecuted, and bureaucratic inertia and a desire not to work would also result in a special clean-up team being called in just like it did in NZ.  In my state I'd be thankful if they would have skipped the step of calling in "animal control" or a haz-mat team to inspect the situation before proceeding with the cleanup.  The supervisor or one of his underlings should be embarrassed for not taking a shovel to solve the problem.   "Bureaucracy, the rule of no one, has become the modern form of despotism." -- Mary McCarthy.    Im 5 yrs vegetarian moving on to fulltime vegan.  Okay, so you're likely aware of what factory-farmed beef and chickens go through.   hopefully your not nieve enough to know what you "know", and still eat meat.  Is it naivet or some sort of moral issue -- a lack of empathy of what animals go through?  But aside from the omnivore/carnivorous aspects, regarding lab rats and scientific research, to be morally consistent one would have to shun *huge* swaths of medicine and discoveries made by modern science. Do you or people you know do that?  This leads one to ask things like: Is it "more morally correct" to eat a chicken that was raised happily on a traditional/non-factory farm and killed as humanely as possible, or to use makeup or some cosmetic/non-essential product that was tested on rabbits and other animals?  Considering that people routinely swat biting mosquitoes and kill bugs and bacteria, let alone the fact that humans *rely* on medicines tested on lab rats and animals (including humans), I would contend that *no* *one* can be morally pure in our relationship to animals. So the question then becomes where people draw the line.    Agreed, but I'm not sure how good a job a drunk guy would actually do in cleaning it up.  I find it amazing that one of the people there could not take a shovel and solve the problem, and instead that they had to call in a separate clean-up crew. Talk about bureaucracy and a refusal to work!  Sadly, I cannot help but to think that if this happened in the US, the drunk guy would have been charged with multiple offenses and would now be facing a court date and years of legal harassment or probation.  Because that would be protecting society from these types of deviant defecators.   But you've got a queen and her royal family!  We have to invent movie and pop stars, sports heroes and other celebrities to get such feel-good PR.   Stop for a moment and think about this: To do this, ponder how flat-out *immoral,* how greedy and how indoctrinated about "law and order" they must be to commit these sort of crimes.      A beheading? When will Obama send in the drones?  Oh wait -- my bad. India doesn't have large oil reserves for our corporations to control and exploit. Plus they've got a few nukes...   How does that paint North Korea as bad?   Yes, correct. We did replace our puppet dictator with another puppet dictator.  But we did not dare abide by the international agreement where we promised to hold free and fair elections to reunite North and South Vietnam -- just because the "stupid" Vietnamese people would have voted the "wrong way" and would have put a communist into power.  Instead, we opted to educate the Vietnamese about American-style democracy and capitalism by waging war and killing millions.   This article is premised on the absurd notion that there is a concrete difference in foreign policy between Republicans and Democrats and that the US is a democracy and not some sort of plutocratic corporate oligarchy.  I mean, is this really surprising? The US has long viewed the UN as either an obstacle or a propaganda tool. Kings never want parliament involved in their wars. The War Powers Act is so 1960s -- it's been ignored from almost as soon as it was passed.  The Pentagon/president's desire to wage unpopular wars is why we abandoned the draft -- to create a "professional army" of indoctrinated "volunteers" so our militarists could wage unpopular wars without the mass resistance of both civilians and soldiers that we saw in our immoral war on Vietnam. From the point of view of American imperialists, the strategy has worked brilliantly.   First, I don't know how they conducted this experiment; but with that said...  Do you not know how much of science is done? Science has bred entire species of rats for specific characteristics for the sole purpose of doing specific testing on. This has been true for decades and decades.  I'm guessing you don't want to know about what sort of life the chicken in your corporate-produced chicken nugget lead, or how the beef in your burger lived its short life.  If you're that naive that we breed *huge* amounts of rats and deliberately inflict horrible things on them in the name of science and research, only to later kill them, then perhaps you should remain blissfully ignorant of the real world.     the mold and spider mites that once ruined only a few plants at a time can now quickly create a multimillion-dollar crisis for growers.  This is why the corporate mass media should not write about marijuana. Growers have been dealing with spider mites, slugs and mold forever -- to the Pueblo Chieftain this stuff is "new". Or are they just interested because of the multi-million dollar aspect?  But this issue illustrates why legalization laws should include the *right* of people to grow their own marijuana.  We *know* what corporate America will do with marijuana -- we only have to look at the tobacco industry to learn this.  Marijuana will be industrially farmed using as many chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides as the corporate bean counters determine will generate them the maximum profit from their crop. (And if laboratory GMO alterations show a greater profit, or control of the seed industry, then just like in corn or soybeans, it will be done.)  We should expect that corporate marijuana will have all of the same characteristics as tobacco. The plant will be homogenized, the weed saturated with chemicals to ensure even burning, added artificial flavorings to give different tastes, and all of the other things that are done with tobacco.  Some people might like that; others might object but to be too lazy to grow their own. But others will actually want marijuana that is organic and is as natural as they can get. And that latter group will need the right to grow their own marijuana.  The greed and self-interest of capitalism breeds corruption. We can expect that marijuana corporations will seek to eliminate competition just like they do in all industries (by buying up competitors, forming cartels, using the government to eliminate competitors, etc.).  As such, marijuana corporations will seek to eliminate people's right to grow their own weed. They'll do this in many ways -- citing "safety" or purity concerns, saying that children will have access, whatever. We see this today in the trucking industry, for example. Large trucking companies actually lobby the government for more safety regulations. Why? Because it eliminates their mom-and-pop competitors who cannot afford the new regulations.  We'd be stupid to think that marijuana corporations will not evolve along the same lines and will use the same tactics as any other for-profit corporation in a capitalist society. Giving people their full rights to marijuana -- just like beer enthusiasts can brew their own beer or tobacco smokers can grow their own tobacco -- is a key.    There is currently a growing military/civilian gap that is both dangerous and unacceptable.  Very true. But that was planned -- a deliberate decision by the Pentagon.  The massive protests against the immoral war on Vietnam -- protests from both the civilian population of the US *and* from conscripted soldiers inside the military -- caused horror and shock in the US military.  The Pentagon chose to adopt the exact same strategy/tactic used by the British Empire -- the "professional" army. This was openly and candidly discussed in military journals of the immediate post-Vietnam era.  So the US abandoned military model of a republic, the shared burden of a draft of citizens which creates a rough cross-cut of society. The Pentagon then increased military pay, started massive advertising campaigns, and created a professional volunteer military.  The volunteer military is more expensive, but it yields two distinct advantages to our war-loving politicians:  * The first is that the soldiers volunteer for their duty. This means the military can easily squelch most dissent in the military simply by reminding soldiers that they volunteered.  * It means that fighting unpopular wars does not generate anywhere near as much public opposition as is generated by fighting wars with an army of conscripts. (And today we have the unending wars and experience to prove this!)  These are huge advantages for an empire. And they avoid some of the "problems" of an army of conscripted citizens.  For example, when the Egyptian people revolted against their US-backed dictator, we saw the disadvantage (or *advantage*?) of an army of conscripts -- the soldiers refused to fire on the peaceful protesters and the dictator fell from power. Later, when the US-backed/armed/funded Egyptian military overthrew their new elected government, the military had to use special elite units who would follow orders to slaughter the civilian supporters of the elected government to enact a reign of terror on the civilian population.  As you point out, one problem of the imperial "professional" army is that the military is far more distant from the people/country it claims to be "serving".  We see this happening today in the US. People give faux polite deference to the military and its soldiers, but we really don't care what soldiers are going through. This is only common sense, since deep down many Americans know that the sacrifices of US soldiers have nothing to do with serving our country, but the military instead functions in reality to seize markets, complete corporate conquests and to wage imperial struggles decided by our out-of-touch political class.  The sad thing is that we know where this all leads. Anyone familiar with the history of the Roman Empire should know about the deteriorating republic, the economic decline, and the rise of rampant militarism followed by the seizing of power by tyrants.   ...ensures everyone has "skin in the game" decreases the likelihood of ridiculous adventures like the Iraq invasion.  This is exactly why the Pentagon sought to abandon the draft and adopt the military model used by empires.  The bottom line is we need to decide if we're an empire or a republic -- we can't be both.   American history to be proud of: In 1971 the Pentagon counted 503,926 "incidents of desertion" since 1966 and reckoned that *more* *than* *half* of US ground forces in Vietnam openly opposed the war.    Its just entertaining to read about China's coverage of our elections. You know? For fun  Obama announced a new (renewed) Cold War against China -- the so-called "Asian Pivot." Based on other strategic geo-political shifts, we know this will take years and years to fully implement.  We have begun making aggressive moves: We're encircling China with military bases; we're flying planes over and warships near the islands China expanded in the South China Sea; our newest littoral Navy ships are based in Singapore; Marines have been based in and are practicing maneuvers in Australia.  China accuses us of funding dissidents and protesters in Hong Kong in an attempt to foment a colored revolution like we've done in Ukraine and other countries. Our demonization/propaganda campaign against China has kicked in so strongly that Hillary Clinton absurdly tried renaming the "South China Sea" the "West Philippines Sea."  Somehow I don't think the Chinese are considering the US' aggression to be "fun". And we'd be foolish not to consider this Politico article's propaganda aspect.    Typical right-wing bigotry *from* *a* *former* *Democratic* *presidential* *candidate*.  FTFY.   Yes, blaming our ill feelings about the US oligarchy on China will make us feel much, much better.  It'll help solve the problem too! Just like the current debate about McCain and Trump really helps us solve the problems of global warming, or our floundering economy, US militarism, or racism, or our fast-eroding civil liberties.  Just don't call all this political theater and distractions from our real problems. It's anything but that.  /s      Hey, Iran has politicians (or clerics) that make bombastic statements to appeal to their hard-liners just like we in the US do!  Who would've thunked it?!      The entire incident could have happened exactly how the US government claims it happened.  But on the other hand, the USSR never invaded the US. The USSR did not do a plot to rig one of the world's largest conventional explosions inside the US. And as I said, the USSR never flew spy planes over the US and got one of them shot down and then lied to the UN and to the world that they did not do such spying and no plane was shot down.  The US has done *all* of those things -- and more -- to the USSR.  As such, any reasonable mind would have to question whether our lying government was simply lying through its teeth about the entire incident -- that in reality the US used a friendly country's airliner to trigger radar and electronic warfare signals over the USSR, with our spy plane safely off the coast recording the entire electro-magnetic spectrum as some Soviet pilot -- trigger happy, mistakenly, whatever -- blew the airliner out of the sky.  Do we actually know what happened? No, we don't. We can only try to ditch our nationalistic biases and have our brains to use to try to figure out what the truth is.  Your mileage may vary...

 I honestly don't know where to share it.  I was hoping it would turn into a discussion about bias journalism. I tried to post to politics.  So I have a message to a mod out right now to hopefully help me.     Sorry I thought I had to post the title exactly how it comes up(as ridiculous clickbait as it is), like in the politics sub.  It's just extreme right-wing bs.   I just like to share what facebook passes around sometimes, because I like to have discussions about it.     This is going around facebook today      Oh wow, interesting. Never knew that   What exactly is tahini?  I have had homemade hummus and I prefer it over store bought.

One of the main problems with giving them too much water is that it inhibits the absorption of nutrients of formula/breastmilk.  They might act thirsty and drink it, but then there's no room for what they need.  Listen to your Dr, but I personally would just wait.    Would you want to do that to yourself?  Or your gf?  Why stick around only to not be completely satisfied and possibly make someone else miserable in the process?     http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2015/06/neutrogena-sunscreen-toxic-avoid/  Alongside [this photo](http://www.imgur.com/njFxYPd.png)  So yea Ewg I guess. Thank you for responding   I'm sure it's not the best, because more natural is the way to go.  But people are saying it burns your skin, and it has an overload of vitamin a that causes cancer.  I can post the articles in question, just wasn't sure if it was allowed.  I buy the baby neutrogena for my child and I'm just curious of the science of it all.   Well see, I paid a lady to do it for me because I didn't trust myself to do the kit that well. But now that I see the process, I'm sure I could handle it on my own. I don't think she used anything too different than what you could obtain at a Michael's store.   So the mixture starts out looking like a shake.  When it gets to a certain consistency, she sticks her hand in for about 45 seconds, and it goes from shake texture to feeling like a stable Gak.  Once the Gak feels stable, she wiggles her hand out, then the mold is ready for the plaster.  Then the plaster is poured in until it dries, and you peel the Gak away, and ta da!   This has to be the prettiest picture I've seen of her.   They sell DIY stuff at Michael's. I paid a lady to do it for me, so I'm not sure of the specifics of the process.    I've never done anything like that before, so I wasn't sure it would turn out good.  But the lady told me that the gel mold dries in like 45 seconds, and whatever position her hand is in last second, that's what it will be. It's pretty cool.       I was just fixing of the hot avocado problem.  The whole thing isn't a winning idea.   You will never win an argument with an ignorant person.

I never thought I'd own one, but it works very well.  The first few weeks of life babies only breathe through their nose, so it's important to have a tool that works.       I really liked how dark all of the murder scenes were, and that there was a calmness about them that was so different than a lot of movies, I appreciated it. But I completely agree about Mr. Boogie.  Have you even seen the trailer for [Sinister 2](https://youtu.be/fChx_YZUAR0)? It's almost like they magnified the few things that were bad about the first movie.     Life skills in general.  A lot of people say finances, I say general knowledge about house maintenance.  I'm still learning things about my house that need to be done 4 years after buying it.     I also think autoshop should be available in more schools, people shouldn't be in the dark about how their cars work.   I was recently watching some live videos of theirs on youtube, holy shit were they bad. I would not have guessed it, it's too bad.   I still haven't committed to watching Amelie.  What is your critique on that?    Young Adult.  There is something soothing and addicting about Charlize Theron playing a bratty, naive woman.     I think it's crazy they are against dancing.    I still enjoy Bubble Bobble from Nintendo. I always try to download it to my different phones or computers, very fun.   What did you think of Sinister? I enjoyed it.  The next one looks pretty bad, in my opinion.   Thank you for making me laugh,  I was feeling a little down.    It's almost *tangy*, or sour. Chocolate shouldn't taste tangy, that's why I don't eat Hershey's. Not because of what reddit thinks.

     First of all, we are talking about the standard of proof.  Nobody claimed it was a civil trial.    Further:  Tom Brady and the Pats had every opportunity to put on a defense when they told their side of the story at the time of the investigation and again at the hearing.   They did challenge the evidence. Vehemently.   They could present any witnesses they would like, Wells would have LOVED to hear from them and so would Goodell.   Wells is not a prosecutor, he was an investigator. He had no agenda other than to figure out what happened. Goodell is not a prosecutor either, he works for the NFL. The Patriots are part of the NFL and Kraft helps pay his salary.   No lawyer worth his salt, if they were unbiased, would believe for one second that Brady was unaware that the balls were being deliberately underinflated.  Don't read the comments.  The ignorance is real.  I vomited in my mouth at "[Wells] had no agenda..."   There are a lot of people like this, autistic or not.  I still don't get how she's different than a "normal person."  She seems like a normal girl to me, is it necessary to label her autistic?   I don't think I can in good faith be skeptical about autism, but man is it hard to tell what it is, yet other people watch something like this and see ALL the signs.   We would get along this girl and I, except the meth part.   Anyone can play the game of snippets and edits.   Cool it there breezy, I can't for the life of me understand autism.  Both the girls in the video seemed normal to me, can you help me empathize with what autism is?  Honestly Jenna looked to me to be a bit introverted.   I find autism VERY difficult to understand and empathize with.  I've watched this video and many other on autism, but like this video they both seemed normal.  Nothing stood out as out of the ordinary other than one was introvert.   I feel you, i'm starting to think autism is made up, they both are normal to me.  	9

 "In the middle of the night, a boy, a strange boy, and a widow find a cursed puppet while searching for a pendant."  this is something. I might use this for my next story. Just a little manipulation and change of characters I suppose.   I sure hope it was only a dream. I hadn't received any reply to his sister until now. I'll try to open up that situation right on time. As of now, everything seems normal maybe I'm the only who thinks of it like that. I'll try to update you again if something happens.   This was something that happened after we went to my husband's hometown a week ago.   My husband, Kyle and I decided to go to his home when he was a child to gather some of his belongings there since no one is living on that house anymore after his parents passed away last year and a caretaker is currently maintaining it.  We chatted about our lives before we met and he mentioned that he did something when he was a child and didn't remember anything about it. Maybe an instinct is telling him that he needs to forget about it that it might give a trauma to him when he remembers it. It feels like there's a gap of memories when he was a child. I didn't ask any questions after that and head to a stop over to have a little quick break. We arrived at his hometown around six in the evening and stop by at a mart to buy some dinner. We arrive at their house around 7:30. The caretaker was still awake and had waited for our arrival, we had dinner and had a goodnight rest and will start our task the following day.  The next morning I saw my husband, standing at the window having a deep stare outside like a daydreaming thing. I said his name, Kyle? and said to me in a reply, Yes dear? Sorry I didnt wake you up. I was just remembering something. Its okay. Come on lets go get some breakfast and start packing your stuffs in your room.  After having our breakfast, we chat with the caretaker and said that she did clean Kyles room but didnt remove or transfer any things so we wont have a hard time looking on some of his things. We then started bringing empty boxes on his room. His room is in the corner of the 2nd floor of the house and you would be able to pass all the other rooms before getting in his room. We started by bringing down some books and other things on the top of his cabinet and sorted those things if we needed to bring it or need to be disposed of. As I checked every book there, I saw this book with a weird cover with a broken lock. Didnt notice that it was a diary of him when he was 10  years old. Wait, 10 years old? It must be the time that he doesnt remember anything that happened to him. I suddenly feel the urge of reading it but of course, the owner is right in front of me. I wanted to read it together with him but it might worry that when he remembers his past experience it might cause a problem so I waited for Kyle to bring some of the things downstairs to free up some space. I then opened the diary and started reading some of his entries  ***  *July 19*  I was playing with my younger sister Jessica while my mother is cooking food for our lunch. After a while, I heard papas footsteps approaching the kitchen with a mad look on his face. I then hear his shouting to mama. Then I heard mama shouting too. I said to Jessica to wait for me and went to the kitchen slowly. I hear their shout getting louder and louder. I saw their faces, they are angry. Are they angry at me? Mama then saw me standing scared at the door in the kitchen. She was panicking, went straight to me and happily said. Kyle, darling we we were just playing a game. It.. its only a joke I nod and went back to Jessica and continued to play.  *August 1*  I stayed after dismissal at school. I have to make a report for being late this morning. My classmate, Bruce went inside the classroom and started punching my face and throwing away my things. I can not fight back. I am too weak. He just punched me again at my face then my stomach. A teacher suddenly passed by and saw us. The teacher ask to us what happened I was about to say I am getting bullied when Bruce suddenly barged in, Um, we are just playing Mr. Charles. See? Mr. Charles did not notice the bruise in my eye and continued asking us, then why are your things on the ground? Just go pick your things and go straight home okay? Ok Mr. Charles. Goodbye. Bruce said while clinging on my back, You remember this! Good thing the teacher passed by. And left me alone. I am scared to go home, now I am scared to go to school too. Some people think we are just playing but it is not. It is hurting me so much.  ***  I was about to continue to read the next entry when Kyle entered the room again. What? Youre not finished arranging? Do you need help? I then closed the book and hid it together with the other books that well bring back in the city. Nahh. I was just imagining what you look like when youre just a kid. I said in a happy reply. We then finished off the things we need, said goodbye to the caretaker and left the house just after lunch. I guess its fine for him to not remember those days because of said and depressed things he had experienced as a child. But, I noticed something strange in his behavior when we left the house. Well.. maybe its just my imagination.  We arrived at the city and straight to our apartment and had a dinner outside. I took the diary and placed it inside my drawer and noticed that theres a smudge of blood at one edge. I turn the page where the blood stain started and saw the page had more smeared blood stains. Was there something horrible happened when he was writing this entry? I couldnt wait another minute to read it. Kyle then entered our bedroom and said that hell just take a shower before going to bed. I hurriedly sit in couch near the lamp and started reading the entry before that blood smeared page.  ***  *September 9*  I was walking upstairs to grab a paper and pen to draw downstairs. I hear whispers in my older sister, Liz and her boyfriend. The door is slight open and peeped at it. I saw her boyfriend Ryan touching some parts of my sisters body. Liz then refused and told Ryan not to touch her. Ryan suddenly gripped my sisters arms and pushed her in the bed and started kissing her neck as Liz resisting. I had breathed deep and accidentally slightly opened the door. My sister saw me and stopped what Ryan was doing to her. Kyle! Um dont tell ma and pa about this. Were just playing too also okay? Do you need something? I did not answered her and went straight to my room and grabbed what I need to bring downstairs.  ***  I guess its a little too early for him to see those things and just pretend it only as a joke. I then turn the page and read the blood smeared entry of his diary. The smeared are light so the words were easy to read on but Ill try my best I can to read clearly those.  ***  *September 11*  I bring my diary together at the station. And the police officer asking me questions about what happen. I tell him my story.   I was playing with  Jessica because the others are out of the house and I got bored on playing the same game. I decided to make a new game. It is called Kill the devil it is like a hide and seek but the other way around. The devil is the hider and the seeker must need to find and kill it. I was the seeker and Jessica is the devil. Jessica said that I need to count until 20 slowly so she can hide secretly. I did so and begin to count. After the count, I started finding Jessica. I know where she is hiding. She is behind the curtain. I secretly grabbed a knife in the kitchen and proceed to the curtain where she is hiding. I tiptoed and as I am near her I shouted, I FOUND THE DEVIL and stabbed her with the knife I am carrying. I saw blood staining out on the curtain and my parents went inside and screamed and asked me what happened. I was still holding the knife and blood flowing through my hands.  The police officer asked me, Why did you stabbed your sister? I said to him, We were just playing a hide and seek game and the seeker will kill the devil when he finds her. I do not know what happened and I went back home and write my diary.  ***  I stared at the diary my dear had written when he was a child. How could he do that? I thought her sister died because of sickness. I was shaking as I was turning some of the pages when I heard the door on the bathroom opened. I hurriedly went straight to bed and put his diary inside my drawer. I saw Kyle staring at me and I asked him whats wrong. Nothing I just suddenly remembered a game I played with my sister Jessica. What was it called? Hmm Im wishing to myself that he wont remember the name of the game. Its a long time ago so you might not remember it. Lets go to sleep now. Its a tiring day we had today. I just said to him to stop remembering the story. Yeah youre right.  We both went to sleep. Around 3 in the morning I woked up hearing something metal being scraped on another thing. Turned around to where Kyle is sleeping and notice him standing beside our bed. He was holding a shiny object with his eyes closed. Is.. Is he sleepwalking? He then said to me, Would you like to play with me? Its called Kill the Devil. I was shocked and scared and cover myself with my blanket, grabbed my phone and texted his older sister Liz. I closed my eyes while feeling the bed weighing on and like approaching me.   I didnt noticed it was already morning. I saw Kyle, sleeping soundly. Panicking, I searched the places near him if he has something this shiny thing he was holding. There was nothing. Was it a dream? I dont know. It felt so real that I had no time to neither think about others nor call the police. I change my clothes went outside and went to the nearest diner in the apartment. I checked my phone to see if I did sent a text to his sister and I did Im still here at the Diner, waiting for his sisters reply or call. Im too afraid to go to our apartment for I might end up like Jessica. Im also too scared to talk to the police. They might not trust my story. I will try to go to our apartment later after I received Lizs reply.    wait what....  ohh okay....   THIS.  I enjoy that climax... seriously :)  	5

Know them too and they were like if you see her don't even mention it. lol   That's what some hospitals give ya if you asked for a DE razor. These are actually what I started shaving with.   Yep as a chef I can attest to this. Pretty much the same shit w/o the fancy label.   We ate coffee aka the NEW Still In The Air.   Every time I go past paint it pops up with Simeon doesn't want a custom vehicle.   Yeah at customs. We're talking about when you deliver it to Simeon.   Get out of my head. Haha   They don't start popping up by me until about the 2nd week of August. Thankfully though we have a Halloween/costume shop that's open all year.   No   One of my all time fave movies.   She left the company on good terms is all I remember.   Thirded      V FOR VICTORIA   VICTORY!!!   You do not base a restaurant upon a food trend because when that trend bursts there goes your restaurant. Happened to Cheeseology in the Loop unfortunately. That "Chef" apparently walked out of other kitchens as well from what I'm hearing. Thing is though that unless he was hired the day of the soft opening he should have already known that kitchen and menu before the soft opening. With that said it still sounds like these two guys have no clue on wtf they are doing.   Just got it and it looks like a stripped down version of the app we had.   "You were right about the electric flea collar. The extension cord was a bad idea."   Like read a dictionary???   Yeeeeeah....whoops.   Going to take a wild guess and say that just might be the reason I couldn't find anything on it.   For a $3.99 flat rate delivery fee I'll pass.   Back story: Got this for Christmas in 1999 from a now closed jewelry store, and no longer have the case it came in. Looked on Google yesterday trying to find the watchmaker and found nothing.

What is your holy grail item that you've yet to acquire?   You are absolutely stunning.   Absolutely love Tested after discovering it last week. Had no clue it even existed. Anyway with that said I'd love to see another cement truck blown up just for the hell of it.   Thanks for posting this. I usually get an email from tgem when they have freebies but this time nope.   Well at least it wasn't give me the 3rd word in the 4th sentence of the 2nd paragraph on page 5 of the user manual.   Ahh so the typical dipshit comment. Thank you.   Swisher sweet cigarillos right after I turned 18. Still smoke them occasionally.   Hahahaha have known her parents for yeeeears.      WTF did I miss? Didn't get the reply notification.   Went through that as well but mine was one of my sisters that was estranged from the family.   Now that you asked here it's mandatory you make a follow up post when it's finished. Haha   Looks like Misty Gates.   Nice try on what??? So since i'm a conservative I can't be for people who actually love each other wanting to get married. GTFO of here with that bullshit.   I'm a strict conservative and i'm cheering right along. OH HAPPY DAY!      Well shit when I was submitting it it was in the title. Damn FAIL!

I had one of these before, and ended up having to pierce it with a safety pin and push upwards towards the nail to get the puss out.   With another human or what???   Blake Griffin   Hate to admit it but had to use Wikipedia to see who the Missouri Mavericks are.   Been there before. Not really happens unless you start shooting and then you're fucked.   2nd this   Good to know I'm not the only one to think that.   When I saw the clip yesterday I saw the exact same thing. He was being approached from behind and the guy only backed off when the cop pulled his gun.   We have a vape shop at just about every major intersection in the town I live in and every single one of them pushes the eGo as the starter kit. Now i'm not dogging on eGo at all but that's all these places have other than one or two of the low end mods.  Have a friend that works at a local shop and I asked her if they had the MVP 3 Pro so I could check one out in person and nope they don't sell them.   GENIUS!!!!   3mg of Summer Break, Carnie, Red Licorice, Cinnamon Roll, and AM Vape   For a good time /r/gonewild  *Disclaimer: Obviously NSFW*   Wait you got to climb through the window??? LUCKY!  He pulled up along side of me saying he lost his dog, and I was skeptical at first but then saw FREE CANDY and said fuck it.    Welcome to the internet.   Beautiful box   Thinking the exact same.   Reminds me of a Public Disgrace vid from Kink.   Damn beat me to it.   Loving that black   red combo.   I'm thinking on getting one myself, and every review I've found gave it a thumbs up. If you get one let me know how you like it.   Damn me for being broker than broke.   What exactly are tonsil stones?   Shit I'm a chef and I never knew about McCormick Gourmet line.   Like I said we are only getting one side. Something had to trigger swat to respond other than the code violation itself.   It says right there in the article that the list of complaints against them is 24 pages long so please go on and explain how calling them a problem family, and saying that who's to say the family wasn't capable of sicking the dog upon the cops is a wild accusation. I mean shit according to the article at hand it clearly shows they had a problem with the police before any of this happened.   SLOJO, CLT V3, and Cosmic fog Church 3mg   Love how it's an all in one kit sans battery.   "Teen"   Sounds like a damn problem/hostile family to me. With multiple complaints since 2005 they're lucky their asses weren't out on the street. Now with them being hostile who's to say that the dog wasn't set upon the officers? Also we're only getting one side of the story.  Yeah I know down vote city is coming because I'm not going along with the nationwide phenomenon of cop bashing.   Disposable Blu Menthol back in 2013. Bought it to deal with the stress of culinary school.   Half the time all that means is somebody printed a label.   That ref now needs to go live with his aunty and uncle in Belair.

I suddenly have the urge to buy a plane ticket. Thanks Reddit!   Very nice consistent scores. Congrats!   Needs sauce.   Granted I could do the same damn thing with a koozie, glue, and a wire hanger.   Not bad at all. Good job.   I did for one Raw and ended up deleting the app the next day. You end up seeing the same shit on the during the break replay when they come back anyway.   Deadspin just hates us for beating the Dodgers time and time again.   What's up Batman?   Can confirm. When I was getting my CJ degree had friends call me fed, and still have a buddy call me Batman.   How long before it gets scrapped for drug money?   Neither are 90% of the other "teens" posted on here probably.   In a heartbeat.   Lambert St. Louis used to have a full arcade back in the late 90s.

 I love curry dishes in general and Indian has been my favorite food for a long time. Trying to make Indian by toasting all the spices, grinding them, etc may deliver the best taste, but trying to get the combinations right and the time it takes is challenging. My attempts at doing this have been mediocre at best.   Yesterday I decided to try again and used this website as my guide: http://www.curryfrenzy.com/curry/html/curry-method.html   I've always been a better cook at winging it with my non baking recipes. I've never made the same rub twice and other than the general recipe for the Test Kitchen spaghetti sauce, all of my Italian is off the cuff. Using that site as my general guideline made a huge difference.   I seared the divided 1/2 chicken in ghee and removed the chicken from the pan.   I had 1/4 of each a white and yellow onion in the fridge so I chopped those and cooked them in more ghee until they were getting brown.   I added in 4 crushed garlic cloves and about 1T of ginger paste and let them cook for a couple minutes.   I put in 12 oz of tomato sauce and used that to get all the browned goodness off the bottom of the pan.   For spices I used about: 1/2T salt, 1t cumin, 1/2t Indian ground red chile, 1t garam masala, /1/2t turmeric, 3 small whole garlic cloves and about 1/3C of yogurt. (We make our own yogurt and it has a nice tang) It should have had fresh cilantro, but we didn't have any so we went without.   I cooked it in the oven at 350F for an hour stirring a couple of times.   I served it over brown jasmine rice. Both my wife and I were amazed by how good it was. Best of all, now that I understand the taste profile better, it will be easier to recreate. I think I'm going to try less tomato sauce and add coconut milk instead of yogurt next time and add some fresh veggies like green beans, red peppers, mushrooms, Thai chile, etc to give it a little more of a Thai profile (Removing garam masala from the recipe too.)      He may have never left. She may have just gone on the pc/tablet/phone to block him out. I agree though, very highly unlikely. I'm an old fart though and I've learned that what seems very probable may not be and what seems highly improbable may be.   Carlos Castaneda The Teachings of Don Juan. Each book becomes progressively harder to read imo but there is an exception or two. I think I also really liked Tales of Power and The Eagles Gift, but it's been a long time.   It's about an anthropologist who meets a Yaqui shaman and lives with them and takes part in their rituals. The stories are about him trying to become a Shaman. It will change your view of the visible world and how we understand it.   Wealth and Democracy by Kevin Phillips is very interesting for following money trails   Irving has so many good books like that. I thought both World According to Garp and Hotel New Hampshire were good movies, but great books.   I struggled with Shogun and finally bypassed it to read the rest of the series. I finally got through Shogun once, but I've read the rest of his books several times. Clavell is one of my favorite authors. Shogun seems like more of a love story and less of a historical novel. The rest of them are more historical novels with the love story as a backdrop.   So if anyone tries Shogun and struggles, don't give up on Clavell. He is definitely worth reading. His writing is tight and flows very well. His plots are compelling. His ability to put you in Asia in the time period, makes you feel like you have an idea of what life was like in China, Japan, Hong Kong, etc. And his characters and interaction between characters drive the books.   Player Piano - Kurt Vonnegut   Almost all of Vonnegut's books are fun to read and try to interpret, but Player Piano really hits home for me and is still as relevant as it was 40+ years ago. A player piano reproduces what a very skilled person does. And replaces them with a machine. Vonnegut takes his usual wit and helps us laugh at the absurdity of it all.   I work in IT and in my 25+ years, I've created my own Player Piano once by programming myself out of a job and am in the process of doing it a second time. I train corporate software used in industrial settings. I'm creating podcasts of all my lessons right now.   But when it comes to Vonnegut, almost all of his books are highly addictive to me.Slapstick, Galapagos, Jailbird and many others are like a good movie. I break them out every couple of years and reread them.   99% Fake, but if it's real?   My gf lived with a girl who had an abusive bf. He was nuts. I got between them twice. We threw him out the first time and called the cops the 2nd time. She got a restraining order and then bailed him out the next day and moved in with him. It was scary getting between them. He wasn't someone you could just get in a fight with. If you won, you'd be ambushed and if you lost he would sit and kick you while you were down. It'd be jail or hospital.   http://imgur.com/gallery/LQW67uT/new   Zoom away   I don't think they are covered up for sunscreen. If you just walk along the roads for a period of time, you get the exhaust grime all over you. It smells and is a pain to get off without a shower. I think they are covering up to keep cleaner. They don't wear those as they are walking around.      IMO if there are 2 bathrooms, locker rooms, etc; 1 for each sex, then that is based on their anatomical sex not how someone perceives themselves. It's divided by physical package, not mental package. I think it's ridiculous to think someone who thinks they're a woman/man has a right to use the facilities designed for who they think they are, but physically aren't.   I disagree. As social animals we have to look beyond our own wants sometimes. We can't just do what we want. Teaching our kids to get along with others is important for them and greater society. If my child has made, or is willing to make, others aware of their standing, I'd get the school to accommodate it in the locker room of their natural standing, not their mental standing. That is asking for a disruption and problems. If they want to keep it to themselves, they can change in stalls like others have said they always did. What do you think is going to cause more disruption and make more parents uncomfortable, a boy dressing with girls/a girl dressing with boys or someone dressing with sexual parts that match others?   And as a group, we're a mob.   They may put him in the comfy chair to get him to confess. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnS49c9KZw8   I don't think satisfaction with life or finding life difficult to bear has anything to do with sexual orientation. But I agree with the first paragraph but not so much socially acceptable but more normal. Normal being things we see in nature outside of the human race.   IMO the biggest challenge we all face as humans is coming to grips with who we are. As long as I believe I'm something other than what nature made me, life will be a challenge. I do not believe surgery makes us what we aren't. It's just a change in packaging.   My wife and I discussed the same thing. If I think I'm Napoleon, I get put in an asylum. If you think you're something you're not, it seems like a mental issue to me as well. But I am not a Dr. and hormones do weird stuff to us. How weird is way out of my scope.   When I was majoring in Psychology one of the studies that I thought was most interesting was on monkeys and testosterone levels. They tested monkeys from different groups and found the most submissive monkeys had the lowest testosterone levels and the most dominant monkeys had the highest levels. They took the monkeys with the highest levels and put them in new groups. After a short time they retested the monkeys.  The monkeys that were dominant in one group with high testosterone were now in the lower range. The monkeys that became more dominant had levels that were now in the high range. Testosterone levels were strongly based on environmental factors.   Edit: caps, changed a word for accuracy.   It looks like a couple of puehr balls   Wu Liang Mao Feng Yunnan black tea is my current favorite   Probably for the same reason then. Searing on the stove and then finishing in the oven. When it goes back on the stove, it's easy to forget. I try to keep a hot pot holder on top so I remember.   Similar screw up on my part too. I was making beef stew with beef shanks so I cooked the beef at 225 for about 2 hours in the oven. Mistake one was using the fry pan I would then be making the final dinner in, to slow cook the shanks. Mistake two was grabbing the pan by the handle to brace for stirring in the roux once I moved it to the stove top. It wasn't just a touch either. It was full on grab to move it. Arghh   I drained the bacon fat into an empty cat food container so I could throw it away. But then I was searing some meat and decided to add the bacon flavor from the oil in instead of just using new oil. As I was cleaning up I realized what I did when I picked up the 1/2 empty container of cat food/bacon grease to throw it out.   I didn't tell my wife what I did until we had finished dinner. Dinner was purrfect. ;-p   Yunnan Black Gold from Yunnan Sourcing is inexpensive and excellent. Another strong Yunnan from them would be their Traditional Process Diang Hong black tea of Feng Qing. All of their black Yunnan's have a unique character though and you may find one you like even more.   Haven't you read about the meth problem in Appalachia?   I feel sorry for people who have never been in a relationship where the sex is so good it blinds you to everything else. I imagine a lot of us can remember at least one person we loved until the sex turned bad or became boring. Was it real love? I'm not sure what real love is. It's more subjective than objective and comes in many flavors.   I imagine she's hot and the sex is good so it's tough to see past your 3rd eye. She appears to like it with others too and sets stuff up while setting stuff up with you. If you're into group stuff, you may have found a mate. If you're into open relationships, you may have found a mate. If you both think you're hot and look good together, maybe you've found your mate.   If you want to find your life companion, maybe have a family, then you should look elsewhere. She sees you as a rental, no harm in doing the same till you can find someone to keep.   When you go there, there is as much variety as there is almost anywhere.    The girl in the fern bikini is incredible   I liked lures too much. Using corn and bread makes me feel like I am fishing for pan fish like sunnies and blue gill. Since I wouldn't eat anything out of the lake, I was just sport fishing and doing catch and release. I've caught too many fish out there with sores and lesions to eat them. For eating fish we'd go up to Canada and fly into a lake. I think we almost brought more fish back than it cost us for the trip.   I had a 22' Sting Ray and putting it in for the first time and choosing Anchor Bay was a bad idea. I almost swore off St. Clair after our first excursion. I used Metro Beach for the next 2 years and liked that a lot more. It's an excellent Bass and Muskie lake but the weeds can be a challenge for sure.   Sort of an odd philosophical question; how many wasps can breed on the head of a screw.   In Lake St. Clair some of the best fishing is in the channels connecting to the St. Clair river. It's tough to fish from shore in those channels and the best bass and muskie fishing is in the weeds you cannot get to from shore casting.   I thought most carp was taken by snagging in the US. It's not really a sport fish here.   I wonder how many times it blew away before they finally found the right weight with the 4th layer. ;-p   I should say I am not an expert. Just a very particular meat eater who has found the right combination of marbling for my taste.    My pleasure. Here's an example with strip steaks:   http://www.ngngsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/NY-Strip-Steaks.jpg Decent strip steaks   http://neesvigs.co/wp-content/uploads/173300VC.jpg Really nice strip steak. It's bone in, but the same cut.   You're correct. I should have also mentioned looking out for the silver skin you find in some cuts. Even decent ones.   How is silver skin different than collagen? It seems to serve similar anatomical purpose?     You know how some fat breaks up into little chunks once they are separated from the meat? That's marbling and adds flavor and tenderness. Then you have the lines that divide meat and looks like gristle. That is not tender, doesn't add flavor like marbling and does not break down as easily from cooking. And last is the fat in like Chuck roasts, briskets, etc that will break down when cooked real slow at a low temp. High temp cooking tightens that and makes it tough.   At the basic level, fat is white, gristle and unwanted fat is typically more opaque. It also looks like you could poke your finger in fat. There is no way you poke your finger through gristle.   I look for steaks with nice marbling and little or no gristle separations which you can even find on Delmonico's or other nice steak cuts.   delectable - Black Yunnans   I thought it was someone who liked 1/2 goat and 1/2 man gods.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)   Hopefully he will be able to make his Modesty Blaise movie(s) before he quits. Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books are screaming to be turned into movies. They would blow the Bond movies out of the water and have as much of a cult following for generations as the Bond movies have.   Have you read Kafka's Metamorphosis? It's short and so weird you just have to keep going. The Castle is also really interesting by him.   If you can find Peter O'Donnell's Modesty Blaise books, you will not be disappointed. The characters and plots are extremely good. He develops the best bad guys I have ever seen by an author. Think of Ian Fleming with better characters, plots and writing. That's O'Donnell.   Kimi has the best sound bites by far   I like getting tea from people who live or travel to the area and develop a relationship with growers. If you were able to get good partners in areas where the big tea markets are in China, India, Taiwan, etc it may accomplish the same thing.   IMO buying an unknown in bulk is risky. When trying new companies, I've given more of their product away after trying it, than I've kept. I'm currently only getting tea from 4 sites. 1 of them is sort of iffy still and another is extremely expensive.   Edit: I also think it's sort of a Catch 22 if you just try to buy in bulk based on information you get online or over the phone. The teas you know are good and people would readily buy in bulk, like Lingia or Steinthal estate Darjeeling have too much competition. Finding the little tea farm gems have too much competition on the ground. The owner of the tea shop I went to in Taipei went to tea markets and competitions and talked to growers to find the product he wanted. How do you compete with someone like that who is selling online too? There is no middle man between them and the grower. Every step in the chain of sales adds cost and reduces your profit.    The Big Green Egg is a ceramic grill with nice temp controls through the two vents. For the most part, once I have it running smooth at 225, it will stay at that temp until I start running low on fuel.  Typically it will be down to about 195 or 200 in the morning so I check the meat temp and then add enough wood to get me through the remaining time and get it back to 225.   I'm actually more worried about someone stealing the meat in the middle of the night because you can smell the smoke a block or more away.   As someone who worked in pizza places, you don't even want to know what happens behind the scenes. It's far worse than anything I ever saw in normal sit down restaurants.   I like the look of confusion on people's faces in my classes when I say it's a PEBCAC issue. Then I get the smirk when I tell them; problem exists between computer and chair.   Brisket on the Big Green Egg. It goes on Friday night and comes off sometime on Saturday. Sliced brisket on Saturday, Recook the top of the brisket on Sunday and BBQ those fatty little goodies, carnitas on Monday, BBQ beef sandwiches until it's gone.   Think of it as a pork chop cut along the bone.   IMO temp is secondary. My pork shoulders and briskets are done when the thermometer goes into the meat like it is butter. That may happen as low as 185 or as high as 205. I agree that cooking to time is not effective. Each piece of meat that size, cooks at its own rate.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restructured_steak   I've been served these at a restaurant. Binding different cuts together and calling it steak. I guess it is one step up from having meat like I see in some countries. I never order something called meat from a menu. I can only imagine what generic meat means.   Winter People   They leave the ending for you to figure out.   No, you wrote the story, you write the ending. Arghh   Hopefully the people will yell louder about having their tax dollars pay off the banks who made bad investments. If Chase makes bad investments in their drive for profit, I am not in any way liable for those debts. Unfortunately in our day, the govs pay off those bad investments and give them no reason to not behave the same way in the future. We paid off their bad risks and the same happened throughout the western nations.   http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81LJ5rvxdzS._SX425_.jpg   I use this at home and at work. I have a screen and plastic net strainer too, but imo the WMF one is the best. It is easy to clean, it seldom lets tea debris out and it is a nice size.   I read that if a container gets real hot in the microwave it is either not intended for microwaves or it has lead in it.   France and Germany wanted to sell lots of military hardware to Greece and a previous administration was happy to take their loans to expand their military. When the German and French banks failed because they made bad investments (like lending money to Greece to build up a huge military), the govs paid off the banks and took on the debt. In the past, the bank would have to cover their bad investments. With banks controlling most politicians, that was no longer an option. Our tax dollars paid off their bad investments and allowed them to continue playing the same game. Privatize profits and have govs and tax payers pick up their losses. What a game, what a scam.   Formula 1 and college football is the only reason we still have cable. We have WOW though and they are a lot better than the big players. We also have Encore so I can watch commercial free movies, but that isn't enough to make me keep cable.   Dansko's. I train sw and I can be on my feet for 8-12 hrs straight. Their shoes made a huge difference in how my feet feel at the end of the night. They sold me on them by telling me they are one of the most popular shoes for people who work in the emergency room and are on their feet all day too.   Almost everything by the Grateful Dead, Dave Mason and Neil Young have better live versions than the studio versions.    Hell Freezes Over  The Eagles took off when they got Joe Walsh. I always felt he was so underrated.   You constantly read about our perceived enemies and their human rights abuses and all the crap being spewed from our politicians mouths about Venezuela, Iran, etc. Rarely if ever do we hear the politicians complaining about human rights by the dictators around the world who we support.   This article is in a Venezuela paper. Can you show a paper from Riyadh mentioning the human rights abuses the Saudis are doing? Have we ever used their human rights abuses as an excuse to overthrow their gov like we do with Venezuela?   I guess what would have been more accurate to say is how well publicized the abuses in nations we dislike, is the opposite of how well publicized they are in our friends nations. I do occasionally find articles about human rights abuses in our friends nations, but far more often about the human rights violations in nations we want to see a change in leadership from. It is a tool they use when convenient, that is ignored when it's not convenient. Compare the rhetoric about Venezuela from our politicians and compare that to the rhetoric about Saudi human rights. The one is a whisper, the other is screamed from the roof tops with a loudspeaker.      	62

 I literally love you...   They actually both look like the type of movie I'm looking for, just in different ways.   I've been avoiding that movie for a while out of fear that it will be a letdown. Purely because of that recommendation, I'm going to watch it right now.   I'm looking for a movie to try to help me get through an existential crisis. Anyone have any good recommendations?    Something I probably should have mentioned is that I'm 16. It's not all food that makes me feel sick, it's just a lot of the stuff I don't eat. I'm really not sure why, that's just how I am.   [Tuition](http://theironyard.com/courses/tuition/)   They teach you to code. [Their website](http://theironyard.com)   What do you guys think about it?    A bunch of jocks at my school had learned from some kids how to do this. They then decided to use it on progress book and print it out to show their coaches because they had to have a certain GPA. Coaches now require you to show them via mobile device.   I guess I could just add it myself.   Can I get this in 1920x1080??   Yah that's a good point.  	12
 thanks for understanding. I hope things turn around soon too    I know what your thinking." your crazy, there no such thing as a sixth sense, your just setting up a scene for a ghost story." well, your wrong! some scientist have concluded that there are not only 6, but 7 senses that people have. Along side the usual five there is our sense of magnetic field, this is called magnetosphere, and there is also your sense of time which is called time perception.   and as far as the set up for a ghost story your only partially correct (this is /r/nosleep so it is not too hard to figure that one out). you see, the story I wish to tell you today may be ghost related or alien related. it can be taken either way. maybe, just maybe, it has a little of both in it.   I work with my father restoring old cars for rich people who want to wave those classic beauties in front of there rich friends. We go to there house and work on them there. we bring our tools and get our parts from a local junk yard. when we cant find what we need at the junkyard we post an ad on the internet for them.   One day this old woman who lives in maycomb Alabama calls us up at our shop in new york. My father lived in Alabama for 5 years. it is where he learned to be a mechanic. So when this lady said that she has this 1937 Bugatti that she needs restoring my dad yelped "sweet home Alabama, here I come."   this was no surprise considering the rarity of the car and how much she was willing to pay for its restoration. but it was odd that she would call us all the way up here to go all the way down there. why would she get us when there were plenty of people down there who could do it? well my question were quickly answered when we got there.  Who knew I had a rich great aunt that my dad had helped once before with a similar project?! my great aunt who we will call aunt joyce had a thing for cars. all her life she collected them with the money she got from her trading company. She wanted my dad to come down to tell him that he was going to inherit all of her cars, as long as he restores this one.  My father and me got started right away, with big smiles on our faces. She was a beauty for sure, but a little rusty. my father said that we were going to get started by taking it completely apart to see what is missing. and then we will clean up the frame and repaint it. from there we will start putting it back together again with as much of the original parts as possible.   This is dragging along a little bit so I will go ahead and skip to where all the crazy started. when we took the car apart we found out we had ALOT of pieces we had to replace. but luckily my father knew a place here that would most definitely have the parts we needed. So he rushed over while I sanded down the frame for repaint. I sanded and sanded, on and on. I had finished sanding down the whole car frame. still no sign of my father. no sign of time passing at all actually. I know I had to have had been there for at least 6 hours it takes a LONG time to sand down a car, my Time perception told me that I have been working a long time.   I left the garage that the car was stored and went looking for my father. I could not find him, or anyone for that matter. I decide that this 2 story mansion was to big for me to walk around looking for somebody. I would be more lucky to find someone if I stayed in one place, so I head back to the garage.  That's when I felt it. Something causing the hair on the back of my neck stand up. something that had a slight pull to it, without it touching me. I turned around and that's when I a saw it. a blurry figure standing in the front doorway of the garage. it was tall, very tall. at least 8 feet.   the magnetic field that I felt coming off of it was strong. imagine rubbing a balloon in your hair and feeling it pull up your hair as you lifted it away, but times that by 1000. It was dragging me torward it.   I got closer and closer with out me even trying to move. most people would run away, but something told me not to. that it would end badly if I struggled. I kept moving closer till I was right in front of it. even being face to face with it, it still was a blurry figure in front of me. It reached out its hand and placed it on my shoulder. that's when I blacked out.  I awoke in the garage on the floor. my dad was asleep in the corner, his head hung down like it was broken. seeing this I ran over to him to check on him. He opened his eyes and they lit up. He grabbed me and hugged me and asked where I had been. I did not know what to tell him. I did not tell him the truth because he would think I was crazy. I told him that after I was done sanding the car I went out looking for him and I fell in a hole where I blacked out.   He freaked out, because that seemed impossible. I had been gone a whole week. gone a whole week in a hole, my father thought that was crazy. If he knew what actually happened he might of put me in an insane asylum.   my aunt joyce told my father that it was okay if we went home and that she will give him the cars anyway. mad dad gladly agreed and we went back home. since then my 6th and 7th sense have been completely absent. I know what your thinking, big deal right , no problem. it is a big deal though. since I have lost my senses I have had a harder time balancing myself, been sleeping longer, and had gone days without wanting to eat. I have also had to have some sort of way to tell time with me ALL the time. other wise I will lose myself in what I am doing. my dad had also noticed the change and had asked me to go to therapy but I refuse  most of us don't know we have two extra senses, but if they lost them they would. your whole life changes. it gives a new meaning to you don't know what you got till its gone.   the story jumps around a little to much towards the middle, and the formatting makes it slightly difficult to keep up.    i will read it. will recommend shortly    that game is one of the best games ever. My parents have a hard time getting into games, especially my father. Paper Mario, need for speed underground, and burnout 3 are the only games my father has enjoyed.   you must be a fellow american   modern American here, Driving the native Americans out of there homes and making them walk the trail of tears which ended up killing thousands of them, hence the name trail of tears.  We are told about what we did to the Indians in school, but we do not go into TOO MUCH detail about the trail of tears.   when I move out of my house im gonna leave behind something creepy as fuck, just for the gits and shiggles    source this damn you! please    XP   I need source PLEASE    You know what the worst job in the world is? its working at a restaurant cleaning the damn dishes. I appreciate my principle getting me this job for me for the summer, but DAMN it SUCKS. The amount of dishes that this place uses in a day is unbelievable. I mean, I know this place is popular and all and there's about 200,000 people that live in this city, but for the love of god I cant stand to look at dirty dishes any more.   What makes it even worse is my boss constantly gets on to me about how I don't wash the dishes right, that I always leave spots on the plates, or residue on the utensils. I honestly think he just hates me and needs something to complain about. The way he frowns at me with his porn star mustache curling down past his lower lip hanging just at the edge of his chin.  his blunt, yet blank stare making me feel like I am some kind of idiot that can not do anything right. It may be true that I miss a couple of spots on a plate or two, but when your going through thousands of dishes a day trying to get done as quickly as possible your going to make mistakes. He acts as if this job is easy and that anyone can do it. I guess from his prospective it might seem that way, he's never had to wash a single plate since this place open. but if he got off his fat ass and did some work around here he would know that nothing was easy around here... well except for his job of coarse. he does not even have to do his own paper work, he has a secretary for that.   Any way, recently this job has gone from bad to worse. he has really been on my ass here lately and yesterday he told me he was going to test me. Watch me, no hover over me, while I did the dishes and said that if I make a mistake that I was fired. well, his lazy ass did not start the test till AFTER the store closed. which is the only time that I can get caught up. If I take my time and do my best work maybe he will get off my back for awhile. He watched and I took my time making sure I got every spot off of every dish and spoon. every one had left as I was finishing up, it was just me and him. as I was about to put up the last utensil, a large kitchen knife used to cut up the raw meat, he grabbed my wrist. He looked at it closely and instead of his usual frown that he wears when he sees something, a giant ugly shit eating grin spread across his face. the smile was horrendous, far worse then his grin. he looked as if he had just discovered the lost treasure of Atlantis and was already planning greedy shit he was about to do. " you almost passed the test, to bad there's a smudge of blood on this knife." he said gleefully. "seems you'll never  learn how to do the dishes."  I could not believe it, I almost fainted, but then I looked at the knife. He was right there was blood on the knife, not just a smudge either, there was a whole lot of it. so much so it was dripping down my wrist. it had also gotten all over the other dishes too. there was blood everywhere, all from this knife. I expected him to fire me right then in there but his lazy ass just laid in the floor bleeding to death. I had enough at this point, his lazy good for nothing ass could not even croak up "your fired". instead he just kept spatting out globs of blood. so I told him I quit. I was tired of it. I hated him and I hated that job. but he was right about one thing, I guess ill never learn how to do the dishes.   Source this damn you! Pls   i was listening to some electronic music when I read this and as I read the last two sentences the song went quite and when I finished the beat dropped. goose bumps man it was perfect   	14
 Well I'm glad to find someone that shares my enthusiasm! I'm really hoping this isn't a flop; it looks fun and isn't associated with a huge franchise like everything else nowadays!    I've really enjoyed the trailers but as far as I'm aware there's not a lot of buzz around this film..   Am I wrong? Are there people excited for this movie? Or does this film just look "meh" to others?   http://youtu.be/w_Ky4KPzKwY    Buried   ET (I've never watched it.. Hence why I bought it on Blu-Ray)   Road to Perdition   The Worlds End  I think there are a couple more.. I buy cheap blurays from CEX that I want to watch, but sometimes I end up going back for more and other films just get left out along the way!    Land Before Time is one I battled over for my own list   I know what you mean, should've made it top 10 at least!   Seeing a lot if these going around lately and got curious!   *Give Reasons?* It's fun to discuss!  **1.** The Lion King **2.** Beauty and the Beast **3.** Princess Mononoke **4.** The Iron Giant **5.** Toy Story   The majority of this list is because I've been watching them since I was a small child. But as I've grown up I appreciate the deeper themes, especially in The Lion King and Toy Story.   Princess Mononoke introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a later age, and I love the art, the action and the mythology!    1) Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back 2) The Lion King 3) Shawshank Redemption  4) Pokemon The Movie: 2000 5) Django Unchained    Thanks, definitely using this chart! And will check out everything you suggested and your post :)   Thanks, looked them all up and they all seem really interesting so I'm adding them to my list :D   Thanks, I can tell I'll be on this all day ha!  	10
    Me!?!!?  A week and a half voluntarily   I am on about this amount. I have stopped (voluntarily) for a day or 2 and actually didn't feel too bad other than just wanting to them because I had them at home I didn't run out I was just seeing if it would be shitty like everyone says and it really wasn't   yah  i agree with BuiltToSpil1 (amazing band too)  but i get 60 1 mg ativan a month and they used to hit me but know they make me feel normal.  I have used/abused everyother benzo and xanax is the best imo for recreation but I am not using for that anymore . I only use when I really have to and find some extras by the end of the month.  i would saw ativan is a coors light compared to a mickeys or steel reserve (xanax) haha i dunno might not be the best comparision   I am currently getting 60 1mg ativans a month.  I have been with the same doctor for about 6 months. she started me at 30 .5 ativans so I am pretty happy she's jumped me up this fast. My question is I want to change my script to klonopin since from my experience they last longer.  So far pretty much any request I have asked to change my meds she easily has done for me. I have also been on SSRI anti depression meds for about 15 years now so I'm not just someone trying to get high.   sad but true, a lot of docs do not prescribe benzos often especially xanax dude thats like the holy grail of benzos. at least to me.  I had to work up for a long time and see so many people and waste so much time just to get where i am.    For me, ativan is the shortest acting benzo.   fuck that sounds gnarly anyways!!! i can take ativan every other day and stop and i'm fine.  this caught me off gaurd.   I want to note***  This all happened once I ceased taking the 25 pills so this was my withdrawl from flubromazepam.  would I do it again!?!?!  Fuck no, even if I was prepared for the worst night terrors and head trips when I go to bed and telling people the most fucked up shit just happened yet it really didn't since it was all in my head.  People opening my door and walking into my room while i'm awake and talking about me in my room while i'm under the covers feeling awake.  I turn on the light right next to my bed.  Nothing. Nobody is there.   I will be truthfull with you. for 2 weeks at least I had sleep paralysis. Never had it before in in my life. had it everynight for close to a month.  night terrors/sleep paralysis,etc gnarliest stuff that ever happened to me in my life.  Most scared i've ever been in my life!!!  I have 25 more pills that I re ordered from the same company just chilling here in my room will sell them, they are worthless unless you want a bad acid trip everynight you sleep for about 3 weeks.   flub sucks. i bought 25 took em all within 20 days. the withdrawls are heavy man. be ready!!   Also people say "never take methadone, drink, and benzos."  Instant kill!!!  I'm not saying never to do that but I proven that method wrong a lot.   LOL!!! i've had the same exact thing happen to me!! (well not the sex part)  after eating a few ativans and dozing off its kinda like i'm in between a real lucid dream and real life.  I see things, but i am in control.  I hear people call my name yet nobodys home.  This only has happened when i take benzos.   yeah i've been on paxil for over 15 years and I always point that out so i think it does help when climbing up the pole to get to the good stuff hah   As I would always agree with your statement 100% because that is not the way I operate when trying to receive benzos from a doctor, I just told OP that asking for it straight up should be used as a last ditch effort. At that point what can you lose?    I have found out that if you actually want a benzo and not an SSRI or a beta blocker, you have to ask for a benzo.  They will try to set you up on anything first before benzos, hell i was on an ssri for 15 years and it was still hard for me to get anything.  they are very concerned about handing them out like candy anymore.   Welcome to the real world where doctors can cut/take your script whenever they please.  It's happened to me.  I guess if you really want your benzos, try finding another doctor.   I ordered a small amount of diclazepam and I wasn't too happy with it. Basically is great if you just want to sleep haha but not much recreational value. I want to make a larger purchase this time and was thinking of Flubromazepam. Has anyone done both and tell me the differences? Would the flub be more recreational/euphoric? Thanks.       ok yeah it might be a bit harder getting it to the US since it has to go thru more checkpoints.   how would i import from Sweden?  Seems like it would be easy to get held up coming into the US since the package could look suspect. have you done this before?   ativan is ok in my book. kpins or xanax is better though.   yeah i think next time i'm getting flubromazolam.   ok I probably will do that but 10mg diazapem i've never taken before i'm used to like 2mg tops.   Etizolam was my first choice but every site I went to was sold out.  I ordered 10 pellets of diclazepam.  This will be my first RC I have tried. I got the 1mg pills and since they say it's 10x strong that diazepam, having not really any tolerance to benzos should I pop a whole pill or half it?  Will this feel simalar to diazepam or any other benzo?     I can't find etiz anywhere online, everyone is out!!        you should be fine. i have to ua once a month and have used within 4 days and always been fine.   i wouldn't say the worst, any benzo is good!! haha but i started with ativan and was always told by doctors it's milder than other benzos.   ativan used to be good and work for me but once i was prescribed klonopin and then ativan back to back, the ativan barely worked compared to the kpin.  i'd say that ativan is the mellowest of all benzos.    I drink all the time off 2 kpins.  I don't notice any difference in getting drunker quicker/easier.  It just prolongs the kpins effects for me.   Hello I have been on an SSRI (Paxil) for about 12 years.  I got on it for depression and anxiety.  It's worked OK for the depression but I have in the last few years been suffering from pretty decent anxiety. I went to a counselor that works for the county and she was really nice.  She diagnosed me with anxiety and PTSD.  On friday I go in to the actual doctor to "get something for my anxiety" I used quotations because this is what the counselor said.  What would they give me to go along with the SSRI I am taking?  Thanks for looking.   Looks like full dental implants. I've had the same thing done to my teeth and I'm only 30.   It takes a while to find the right person that you can work with.  For me it has at least. I have recently been working with a mental health worker that has assessed my situation. She says I have anxiety/PTSD.  I'm going back on Friday for my actual medical visit with a doctor to give me/ alter meds.  I have been on Paxil (SSRI) for 15 years.  Hopefully I will get to finally have a med that works better than Paxil for 15 years. The lady that I have been working with is going to come in with me to the doctor and she said "at the very least we need to get you something for your panic attacks"  I was glad to at least hear that.     OK then you have started the road to getting what you want you just have to play their game.  Just be careful- I found out the hard way getting cut off my meds and now i'm on methadone.   If you are seriously in pain and can prove it, there should be no big problem obtaining medicine for the pain.  Depending on what it is they might only start you out on 800mg Ibuprofen or Tramadol.  I used to get 120 10/325 Norcos every month from my doctor til that ended badly. Your most likely going to have to work your way up to something decent.  It's getting hard now to get anything unless you are dying or have cancer.  Doctors are really getting nervous to script narcotic pain meds because of the DEA cracking down.  I have been told this from doctors themselves.   Tolerance break would help. Man I noticed on Ativan my tolerance for them was up so much after like 2 weeks-a lot faster than other medicines I have taken.    OK i was just on smokeys site actually hah. I have personally never purchased anything online yet so I don't have any sources for you yet.   dammit he's already out of stock   I would also like to know if etiz will show up as a benzo on drug tests.   and i am surprised about the Rohypnol being sold?!?!  That was always a scripted med as far as I know in the US.   I have taken ativan, klonopin, and xanax.  When I used them I remember i could handle 2 xanax bars to feel good.  I really have no tolerance I guess now because I haven't been able to find a doctor to script me anything.  I looked last night a few hours online for etiz online to buy but I guess I was on the wrong sites because everyone was sold out. That is why I am now considering another RC.  I would like to pay with credit and I am very weary of getting ripped off. Do you know of anywhere that rates these sites?  I guess it would not be good if I asked you for any places online to buy?  sorry about these remedial questions but I want to know these things before I place and order and get ripped off. Thanks.    ah ok maybe i should type in the other words you have up instead of just ezitolam cause the places I found online were sold out and not going to re up.   OK I am a noob with RC's and have never tried any yet. It seems though that the RC of choice is etizolam which seems to be about extinct to purchase online?  I am not asking where to buy just wanting to know if it is near impossible to get online anymore? also how does flubromazepam and diclazepam rate compared to etizolam? Is there any guide to RC's or any more info I can get?  Thanks and sorry if these questions have been asked already.   ah ok. well i've been on an SSRI for 15 years now and i feel its not working anymore.   yeah when i rarely get em they are free with medi cal.   damn man nice.  I guess I just have to keep searching.  Was that the first doctor you went to and you got the jackpot?  I definatly don't want it to seem like i'm doc shopping.   yep I have had to buy off street - i don't anymore but I have and it's not fun. Try to buy from people you know i guess?  I don't really have any great tips as to not getting caught.   Hey i'm in the same situation.  I have had clinically proven anxiety and depression and been on meds for it for 15 years (Paxil) this is documented yet I cannot get barely anything to help me through my bad days.  I don't know if it's the fact that I am youngish male and look like i'm seeking drugs but I know what to say and what not to say to the doctor so I am just really frustrated like you are. I also agree that people abusing the system suck because now I can barely get 15 ativan with no refills and that is it.   how did you get around to getting a script like that? just curious as I can't get any more than 20 ativan here and there.   OK it makes more sense now and if you are really having problems its good that you have some sympathetic docs   How did you go about getting a script for a whole year? I can only get little scripts here and there and nothing on going.     Fuck!! whats your secret!?!? That's the most i've seen on here legally prescribed.   OK i thought you were on them since you were 16.  I am using for medical reasons but at the same time realize this shit can be a slippery slope.  Damn it I just want ativan or anything!    are you a daily user?  hows your tolerance like since you started taking benzos have you kept needing a higher dose?  I actually have an appoinment on tuesday with a psychiatrist.   I'm all ears if you have any advice trust me dude i'm sure you know whats up.  Possibly the people you know don't use/like benzo's?  or have they tried to get benzos and been denied? I agree its a lot about the doctor you get- some seem easier to work with some won't budge.      thanks! no man i wasn't trying to act like I know it all!! I really don't haha as you can see since I am benzoless.   Yep i am familiar with the "don't ask" tactic hah.   I have been on paxil for 15 years and i'm surprised I haven't had much luck in 1 1/2 years with getting a basic benzo even like ativan.   i have been to both.   i have had proof of on going severe anxiety and still no luck.  This is so damn frustrating.   whats the secret to getting an ongoing script for benzos?!?!    So within the next couple of weeks I will most likely be put on ritalin or adderall.  I used to take dexedrine for ADD as a kid back in middle school.  Now as an adult (32) it was recommended I go back on something to try and help with my ADD.  I have done some research but would there be any reason to try and get adderall over ritalin or vice versa?  Do they still prescribe dexidrene?  I would just like some opinions from people that have taken both. thanks.   About what? Not taking benzos everyday?  If that's what you meant I agree with you but a lot of people still do take them on a daily basis which I'm not even looking to do and RC's kinda scare me.   i'm on methadone now. been at the clinic about 8 months haven't missed a day.  I can't say that methadone is a godsend but it's helping- i have relapsed twice very early on in my recovery.  At the dose i'm at now i wouldn't even feel any opiate so I don't bother.  I still am pissed when I think about that day at the doctors office though!!  I try not to dwell on it.   ok thanks!   etiz is an rc then correct?  I am a total noob on this and if this seems like sourcing just let me know or send me to a place that will explain to me better.   thanks!   yeah i would assume you would of been through several docs til you got to where you are right now.  I'm glad to hear that they are working for you as well.  Thanks for the info!   i used google and found out most of what I needed. what i said seems far from sourcing but it is what it is.   Im in america-california.  I agree with you on how its got to be shady on obtaining what we need for a valid reason.  So are DNMs and RC's only available on the darknets?   ok i figured it out. research chemicals.  where would i go about buying it?    whats an RC benzo?  i know I sound stupid already.       wtf 10mg a day diazepam??  i rarely can get scripted any benzo and whenever i do, the doctor says never take on a daily basis and I get 1 script no refills of 20 pills 1mg if lucky.  I seriously do have anxiety and depression that is documented.   how do i achieve getting closer to where you are??     Yes this is very true   This is very true.my uncle was gardening and cut the head off a rattlesnake once the head a bit him and he had to go to the hospital so yes this is very true   I was able to get to 60 mg fine.  After that, nothing.  It's  a bit different for eeveryone but I bet everyone will agree its around 60-90.  Unless you're body is extremely lucky or weird.   I do not but my friend was in Barca a few years ago and told me he saw tons of people nodding in the streets. Wasn't too surprised since like any large city there's gonna be drugs.    i'd say anything over 100mg oxy a day?  I dunno, it's all relative.   yeah i've been told that actually.  Thing is can't you go into a doctor that is certified to prescribe methadone for pain and tell him you want to be switched from your meds to methadone?  I guess he would just have to look at you and your history and see if you have dr shopped or been flagged at pharmacies before?  I was going to do this when I was on norco and wanted to stop taking it but I just ended up going to a methadone clinic.   they don't prescribe methadone for pain anymore?   i assume your a guy. how old are you?  seems like a situation like me when i was referred to PM from my regular doc.  she had meset up 120 yellow norcos a month for a couple years so i thought i'd be getting stepped up since I was being referred. She even told me I'd get something better.  First thing when I walk in the head dudes office.  He reads my papers and his eyes just buldge out  " you've been talking all this norco for how long?!?!?!"  "Why?!?!?"  So I immediately knew I was over with ever getting narcotics again.  It was the worst feeling of my life actually.  I tried to hold in not crying.  He sent a note to my regular doc no more narcotics and that is that.  fuck that fucking guy.  The reason why I shared my story is that I feel its very similar to yours where I was doing good, felt comfy at my prescription and didn't feel like it would ever be taken away since my doc I'd been with for 10 years and was almost family to me.  So when I went to see her after the meeting with top scumbag at PM she just basically told me she has to adhere to whatever he says since he's a higher up.  Just so pissed man, one minute I had my doctor telling me that once I'm on PM they will bump me up to something better that Norco the next minute I am prescriptionless.    why cause they gave you more than you needed for pain meds?   Even my own doctor that cut me off last year told me it was crackin in the early 2000s then once about 2010 came around doctors are like WTF we are up shits creek here because we've been way over prescribing narcotics and people were popping them like candy.  That's exactly what my doctor told me as she yanked away my script that i had for 2 years for 120 norcos.  I believe her some but she also said the DEA are finally getting they're act togother after so many famous people died roughly in that decade due to narcotics prescribed by them from their doctors.  It sucks now because anyone with legitamite pain it's nearly impossible to get something past tramadol because doctors are scared they will lose their jobs.    I'd just try em. I've taken some fairly old pills before but I also had some that crumbled in my hand when I grabbed them so I figured those most be pre WWII and i'm not fucking with it.   I was always scared of H because of the stigma that it has.  Since we were little kids I believe that the government, media, your parents, etc always would tell you never to do drugs but I felt that they put the most emphasis on H being that it was the strongest drug that could kill you the fastest.  Anyways I grew with that injected into my brain so that when I actually tried it for the first time I was kind of underwhelmed to be honest since I was already using norco and oxy, I was told its way cheaper to just go the H route and it is but If I had unlimited money i'd go withthe pharms over H just mainly cause its from a lab so you know what your exactly getting.   yeahhhh buuuddyyy   found an OP 80 inside of a church that i was working for at the time.   haha such a random # of pills.    It could be worse- I had all of them impacted too and  I got fucking Darvocet!!!     I have owned cars before that adding simply an open element air filter gave it a noticeable horsepower increase.  But i have done the same to other vehicles and it felt like I did nothing.    	90
 What do you think I should do?   Hahaha!  I know 6 weeks is nothing I'm just anticipating how long it might be (6 months...)   This comment has made me feel better. Thankyou.  Hearing you say couples go through these problems gives me a lot of hope, and that's all I want at the moment. Thankyou..   He's been taking anti-depressants for about a month now and we have not had sex for about 6 weeks maybe longer. I know he's struggling with everything and I should be patient (which I am being) but I can't help but worry that it will not come back as long as he is on anti-depressants - which will be at least 6 months, maybe more. I told my close friend and she has said she wouldn't be able to do it, and has told me that if it starts to really upset me then I need to do something about it. I have been with him for over 3 years and I don't want to have to end the relationship just because we are not making love, but I need that intimacy. I really don't want it to get to the point where it's too awkward to even talk about, let alone do, but I can't force him to have sex with me or force him to talk to me about it. He's said if in a few months he doesn't feel it coming back he'll go to the doctors, but I think if the tablets are working that he won't want to change anything and get the horrible week of side effects again. I want to talk to him about it but I don't know how to put it without hurting his feelings or his manhood. I just want to be in a normal relationship with him I feel like I can see an end to our relationship and I am so scared.   I'm in the UK where Wellbrutin isn't often prescribed.   How do you think I should go about talking to him?   He's been taking anti-depressants for about a month now and we have not had sex for about 6 weeks maybe longer. I know he's struggling with everything and I should be patient (which I am being) but I can't help but worry that it will not come back as long as he is on anti-depressants - which will be at least 6 months, maybe more.

I just want to be in a normal relationship with him  I feel like I can see an end to our relationship and I am so scared.    If you don't mind helping...   To be honest he doesn't do a whole lot when he's not feeling like this. But I have found what you're saying really interesting and from him it seems like something he really does. He gets stressed under any kind of pressure like me asking what we are going to do next weekend and talking about holidays DEFINITELY puts him under a lot of stress. We have just started talking about holidays again, I don't want to get let down as our big trip that I have been planning all year he has decided against, so we said a small relaxing holiday. But I don't know how to approach the subject without it becoming a big, stressful thing. The thing is we would need to get it booked really soon but I think he will be reluctant against doing that. I don't know what to do! I think the relaxing will do him some good but I can't force him to book it?    Thanks for the help.  It's nice to hear that you think I'm doing good. I try not to get upset in front of him but sometimes when I have a bad day I just want to see him and get a cuddle or talk to him. He didn't actually forget about our anniversary because I told him 'it's our anniversary lets go out for dinner' he just forgot to get me a card or present, which he knows I would love.   I just want to distance myself from the relationship to make me less reliant on him being there but I also can't, because he hasn't done anything wrong and our relationship is still OK.   	9
 I think it's just how they are spelling deli            They had just finished eating so that's partially true                         When I was young, maybe 6-7, I woke up in the middle of the night to my mom looking out the window and mumbling. She kept saying some like How come the sun isn't up? Its going to be in so much trouble when I tell its mother." I was understandably confused and kind of scared and when I asked her what she was doing she kept mumbling about the sun not being up. She then went to bed. I brought it up to her and she swears it never happened. I've always just assumed she was sleep walking but it was super weird.   I like good sushi a lot but I know what you mean, I'm never full after eating it and neither is my wallet    WaWa coffee is the best for a gas station, way better than Sheetz   I've never heard of this place, where are they?   They were pretty decent before they became a nationwide chain but now sadly I would have to agree with you. I do still buy their salt and vinegar dry seasoning for use at home, shit is delicious.       FRANK AND BEANS  	19
    Fire and Rain by James Taylor. It's about his girlfriend dying on a trip home to surprise him.    Frankly I think it's ridiculous that anyone sees more potential in Brown than they do Revere. Brown has proven to be ineffective in every outfield position and his offense is terribly inconsistent. He is at best a AAAA-level ball player; too good for the minors but not good enough for the majors. I'd take Revere over Brown any day.    I was always a fan of Next Door Nikki   Because the point of the sub is to pick one   First off let me just say you're FAR too hard on yourself. The first step in success in changing how you view yourself. Find one thing you do like about yourself and, for a time, focus on how awesome you are at that. Then build from there. Second, ADHD will always keep you from being "normal" but that doesn't mean it has to hold you back. There are a lot of ways that those of us with ADHD have it better than those without; we have more varied interests, we can get to be good at a lot of different things, and we can task-shift better (good in jobs requiring attention to lots of things), to name a few.  ADHD is an obstacle that needs to be overcome, but it is far from impossible. All it takes is you making the decision to not let it get you down and to find a way to make it work for you. Figure out what pulls your attention and focus your energies on it, and you can and will succeed.  You can do this, man. I believe in you.  Also, let me just add that you have a very good writing voice. Maybe try writing more: journals, short stories, poems, whatever. Not only is it good for our brains to write stuff down like that, but you may find your path in it. Just a thought.    You're welcome.   	7

I'm in SA, the extent of our aboriginal lessons was "they do dot paintings and throw boomerangs."    I didn't realise this.  I learned about the massacres in uni,  but not in a lot of detail, it was taught as fact.  I'll have to do more research.very interesting, thank you for pointing this out.     https://instagram.com/p/5UJQi1AttP/ d_l.photos  I'm south australian,  take a lot of nature, animal, children photos and a bit of daily life kind of stuff   I thought Michael Jordan was the president of the USA, and I thought the USA was the only other country in the world besides Australia and that president Michael Jordan ruled australia too.    When people show how generous and caring they can be,  especially when you've been seeing and hearing a lot of negativity.    I truly hope this too. If i end up in some kind of afterlife I'll be pissed.    This and massacres (assuming you're in Australia)  In my school it was hardly taught at all.

 So, firstly, let me apologize for how little I'm leaving you with, but I've been remembering an 80s movie, that for the life of me I cant recall actors or real plot.        Heres what I do remember; It has content about a hospital 'of the future' where all the dosing, drugs, etc. come from tubes in the ceiling. I believe someone had come up with a cure for cancer, or something, and was using the hospital to try it on people..        Heres the part that really stuck in my head, the cancer (or whatever) drug it was that was killing people was sky blue in color. You see it coming through the tubes..        As I recall, the treatment caused people to vomit blood until they die. Not a subtle, or high-ranking movie, probably a B or C movie (along the lines of "Lunchmeat" or "Bad Taste", LOL)        Anyone know / remember this movie?          Thank you!     #emerge -flight   I think the Yellow shipping company has that bright orange shade most of their semis are painted, registered as well.

You're sleeping inside a camera Obscura :)        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura    So, if the pilot is a woman, is she sitting in the boxpit?           ..I'll throw myself out.. :-)   I dont think her craft is fly-by wire.. If you watch the source vid, while she's on the ground, engine off, she makes some pretty good elevator moves with the stick, and it doesnt appear the control surfaces on the elevator are moving..        Hmm.. Interesting.   Thank you, I wasn't aware of /r/gunnitforward        But, I can't help thinking that if we were to get a legitimate redditgifts going, it might help get more people involved in this little corner of the web.        Of course, that means more exposure, so that could potentially bring more goofballs, and uninformed anti-gunners, but I say, so be it.  Gun safety starts with exposure (correct safety, and handling etc.) More exposure, cant be *that* bad, can it?   So, I thought it would be cool to do a reddit gift exchange about reloading stuff.. The idea is to exchange the un-"dangerous" stuff (No powder, primers, or loaded ammo)  but rather the various sundries reloaders use.. Got a die set for a caliber you haven't used in years? How about those cheap Remington .223 bullets you'll never use.. Lee case lube? Neck brushes?         Think about it.. We all have a lot of stuff that isn't doing us any good, that might just help someone else out..  Likewise, we may receive a product, or doodad that actually helps, and is not something we would have bought ourselves.         Anyway, just throwing the idea out there..    I've had a lot of time..   Mike Honcho..  :-)   Fibonacci.. That guy rocks.. :-)   Yup.. Officially creepy.. (shudder)        Remarkably cool too, tho   Never underestimate the power of the Banana!! :-D   Yeah, this was from an insurance check. Wife played bumper-cars with her car a couple weeks ago, enough for the ins. to total it out..        I mean, id *love* to say I can have that kind of coin on-hand at any time, but alas..

 It was one of those days where the suns far-reaching rays seeped through the windows, infecting my very bones with its warm laziness. I lay sprawled across a large sofa, eyes closed and letting the sunlight wash over me. I could feel my skin bristling in response to the relentless heat but the feeling was far preferred to any sort of movement that would break the seal, so to speak, of warmth and pure nothingness. There was only a small handful of situations conducive to truly voiding my mind of all thoughts, and basking in the heat on a quiet afternoon was one of them. Sleep bathed my eyelids as I felt what little consciousness my thoughtless brain had retained slipping away. For once, the depths of my mind ceased to resemble a bustling fish market, and the overlapping onion layers of thoughts and ideas stretched and flattened, stretched and flattened, until there was nothing left but empty silence.   Empty silence.   Empty silence.    Until there was neither silence nor emptiness. A deafening bang ripped through the sluggish air, tearing aside the slow, heavy, warmth that had settled around me. The noise sent an echoing boom throughout the halls of my home and jolted my senses out of my lethargy. I shot up and immediately felt a sense of panic envelop. The air had gone cold. All traces of warm laziness had disappeared, replaced by a frigid chill. I had experienced the hairs on my neck and arms standing up before, but never the hairs on my scalp. It felt as though each pore on the top of my head had expanded and risen in an eerie, haunting manner that I knew I would never forget. Trembling with cold, I slowly rose from the cushions of the couch, and made my way to the back door of my kitchen, which led out to a patio. The noise, in the loosest manner of the word, seemed to have come from every direction, but my instincts led me to the back of the house. I quickly pushed open the door, and was met with, simply put, nothing. There was nothing but black. The kind of pitch black that eyes dont adjust to within a few minutes. I pulled out my phone and tapped the home button to check the time, wondering if I had fallen asleep for hours on that sofa, losing all track of time as one sometimes does on an eventless Sunday afternoon. It was 3:48 pm. I felt my heart beat in my throat and my stomach drop.    I turned on my iPhone flashlight and held it out in front of me, and again, I felt my stomach sink to the ground. There was nothing but darkness. Nothing was illuminated. The light shone forward in a straight beam, and all around it was blackness like I had never seen before. I stepped back into my home and the lights had gone out. Pitch black, unperturbed by the flashlight on my phone. Nothing but blackness.    It has been 96 hours since the light left. Ive called friends, searched the Internet and combed TV channels. There are no signs of human existence after 3:45 pm on that day. All TV channels and radio channels show nothing but static. None of my texts or phone calls have been answered. I can still see the webpages on my Internet that were already open, but it seems as though everything came to a screeching standstill at 3:45 pm four days ago. I have no internet access. I had the /r/nosleep submit new text post webpage open in one of my many tabs, and have typed this in the text box. I had started writing a story about demons and spirits, but somehow, the reality I am facing now is much scarier. It is happening. And it is blackness.    When I look away from my laptop screen, I see nothing. I cant see my keyboard. I cant see my fingers. Ive tried leaving my house, but the darkness seems to fill my bones the same way the sunlight did when all this started, and it weighs me down with fear. Fear that I wont be able to find my way back. Fear of what may be waiting. Once in a while when I look outside, I see the glint of yellowed eyes in my peripheral vision for a fraction of a second, and then they vanish. I dont know what else they could be - certainly not a trick of the light, seeing that there is none. I see the eyes a few times a day. I dont know what I could be seeing. I think they really are eyes.    When I look away from my laptop screen, I see nothing. I feel the itch of creatures I cannot see on my skin. The cold still bites, but sometimes, I feel the unmistakable warmth of nonexistent sunlight wash across my skin. My phone died 48 hours in, and I couldnt find its charger. My laptop was plugged into the wall when the light left, so it continues to stay charged. I set alarms on it to help me keep track of time when I sleep. My thoughts consume me. I sometimes wonder if I am anything at all. If I am just part of the darkness. If there ever was anyone or anything, or if the life I remember is just, and has always been, a figment of my imagination. I feel so isolated, save for the occasional eyes that suggest there are other presences around me. My eyes play tricks on me and I see shapes in the darkness that change form and then disappear when I try to focus on them. I both fear and take comfort in these presences.    When I look away from my laptop screen, I see nothing. The air is both empty and heavy. As though darkness was not enough, I dont hear anything anymore either. There is, in every possible meaning of the word, nothing. I scream at the top of my lungs and scratch away at my skin just to feel something. To reassure myself that I am still there, that I still exist. That I am not the darkness. Ive started forgetting things about myself, and only the sounds I can make and the physical feelings I can inflict on myself exist.    I will try to submit this but I dont know if the post will go through. If it does, I dont know who would read it. I dont know if this is real.    There is nothing left but empty silence.    Empty silence.   I skimmed through this and for some reason, concluded that the story was about someone bringing a dildo to school on a leash and dragging it around. Still funny.   Thank you for the suggestion! I'll check it out!    Thanks a lot! I'll look into it.   True. Any good places you can think of to donate supplies to?   	5
 Haha. Hey, I figure if you're going to have a room full of 11-year old boys, you have to at least *try*. Surprising no one, the cake, bubblegum and cookies took a bigger hit than the veggie snacks.   It doesn't look much like marzipan (though I guess it's possible), but it could easily be modeling chocolate.       On the other hand, it could be made of something completely different.    While this may not be authentic Belgian cuisine, I think it's highly likely there are people in Belgium who have eaten something you're not aware of.    I really enjoyed the conversation about watching EVO and other e-sports gaming in this week's episode. A question for the uninitiated: Where does one watch something like EVO? And can it be viewed after-the-fact?   Well, clearly, Arkham City's story was so good that Jeff forgot he liked it.   Because humor.   a) Many people enjoy fondant  b) Who's to say it isn't modeling chocolate?   Sure. And it may not even be fondant. Could be modeling chocolate.   In general, you'll probably experience a happier internet if you insert the phrase "In my opinion..." at the beginning of every comment you read online. Speaking in absolutes is truly a conversation-killer, but it's not really intentional, 9.9 times out of 10.   We're pretty relaxed, but we do have some rules:  1. Drinks at the table are fine, but they need to be inside the cork inserts built into the table. To date, we've never had a spill (on the table), but wine glasses are the riskiest. Frankly, I'm generally more concerned about my table than I am about the games on top of it.  2. No food with your fingers. Period. We did not originally have this rule, but we play way too many games to adopt a laissez-faire attitude. Some are OOP or expensive, and it would frankly be more difficult to only have the rule *sometimes*. Also, replacing every $30-$40 game that gets grungy will add up over time. There are few things more disgusting than a playing card coated in a dull layer of pizza/chips/cookies/etc., built up over years of unprotected play.  3. I don't lend games if I care whether I ever see them again.      Wait... is this a thing? I craft greater glyphs all the time. (PS4)   The better question is why there is cheese present, in any form.   ...because Tim Miller, Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool all have such a wonderful cinematic track record?   I really, really hope this series isn't "less than."   Because they considered making it funny, then decided that making it hilarious would be better.   Is it true that the majority of commenters on r/food are super-healthy and fit? Because it certainly seems to be the case, based on the comments regarding anything with an ounce of fat in it.  	18

[Quick! Catch it!](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/992/407/776.jpg)   I'd like one.  (   )      The good news is that the science is impossible for any reasonable person to deny, and Arnold is just one of a growing sea change in the Republican party; [they *are* coming around.](http://environment.yale.edu/climate-communication/article/not-all-republicans-think-alike-about-global-warming/)   I'm with you because you came to the right conclusion, but you got there the wrong way, both anecdotal and mistaking weather for climate.   Weather is obviously an effect of climate and affected *by* climate, but weather  climate.   I'm only cautioning this kind of statement because someone like me, a New Englander, can point to our horrendous 2014/2015 winter and say, "See? Climate change isn't real because it was really cold and snowed a lot."   Yeah. 20,000 years ago the temperature was some 8 to 10 C colder than it is today. But to draw a line from that point to today and say, "look, 20K years of global warming!" is dubious and arbitrary at best.  If you have look at [this graph of temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), starting at a point when we were finishing the climb out of deep glaciation, you can clearly see that rapid warming ceased around 10,000 years ago (rapid relative to natural fluctuations, but not compared to the warming today, which is an order of magnitude faster). After a final little lift 8,000 years ago, temperature trended downward for the entire period of the Holocene. So the post-industrial revolution warming is the reversal of a many-thousand-year trend.  A closer look at [todays trend](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), within the context of the last [1,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:1000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) and [2,000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) years, makes it even clearer that todays trend is striking  opposite to what one would expect without anthropogenic interference.  If you really want to play the global warming started X years ago game, you should talk about how were reversing a [5-million-year cooling trend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png)  or go crazy and track global temperatures right back to the origins of the planet! Not that thered be much point  Fifty-five million years ago, a 5-degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures seems to have occurred in just 13 years, according to [a study published in the October 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](http://phys.org/news/2013-10-climate-geological-instant.html). [A report in the August 2013 issue of Science revealed that in the near term, earth's climate will change 10 times faster than during any other moment in the last 65 million years.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142420.htm)  But I'm sure you know better than the overwhelming consensus of the world's climate scientists. Those guys don't know dick and you seem to have it all figured out. Bravo.   The OP concerns what Arnold Schwarzenegger is saying, which is news/relevant because it's coming from a well-known Republican figurehead that is extremely popular on Reddit.  I could have chosen from roughly 50 sources; they all repeat what Arnold Schwarzenegger said verbatim or otherwise give excerpts. The source doesn't matter much when it comes to quoting what Arnold Schwarzenegger has to say.  Quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't a big deal and the source is basically irrelevant. Dismissing climate change or its level of seriousness as "science fiction" warrants a source better than almost all the world's climate scientists' consensus on the matter.  The Cato Institute ain't it.   Oh, good. The Cato Institute is your source. That's a good source because they have no political lean in one direction or the other and are therefore completely unbiased. /s   [Yeah, but...](http://i.imgur.com/vKgcw.gif)    It's just that so many of the Conservative politicians are in the pockets of Oil and Gas interests.  Exactly. We're talking about big oil, subsidized to the tune of $10 billion to $52 billion annually in spite of [record profits.](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=5503955)  [Here's an article](http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/mailbag/big-oil-profits-from-climate-change-denial/article_35aac953-e4fd-5148-a5a1-72e97539b11a.html) on how much big oil profits from climate change denial.   No argument there; I'm just saying I doubt there just happen to be a whole lot of pro-business Republicans/conservatives who deny climate change because they actually don't believe climate scientists whose job it is to know these things.   Fair point, but my statement stands. Politicians who deny climate science are doing it because ignoring climate change is good for business.  Industries that profit directly or indirectly from fossil fuel consumption don't want a sudden shift in environmental policy and green energy.   Actionsintentions.  The fact that this benefits a lot of people outweighs his motivations for doing it.    I read it in Norm McDonald's voice  This is some Twilight Zone shit; I *wrote* that in Norm McDonald's voice!  I was actually picturing him saying this on Weekend Update when I wrote it.    half of whom received law degrees and are still stupider than Arnold  I doubt they're stupid. Like you say, most politicians hold high degrees from prestigious schools. They're educated men.  When politicians deny climate science, they're probably not doing it because they're stupid; they're doing it because businesses from whom addressing climate change would undermine their profits are literally paying them to.  The reason pro-business types and environmentalists often clash is because the two are often diametrically opposed.      [Hey, I like you too...](http://i.imgur.com/G9g3fMp.gifv)      Probably the most interesting and informative thing I'll read all day.

When did I say it was the literal truth?   Hopefully you have insurance and it's a simple matter of making a doctor appointment and getting a good ol' finger up the ass.   The toothpaste method doesn't get to the urine trapped where the taint is, though.   I can wait until there's no one else at the wall, or, if all fails, I can do it pretty discretely. It's a quick and easy maneuver and often saves an embarrassing trickle.   This is starting to feel like a creepy master/slave arrangement...   Spooking without a permit.   Me too; you're question prompted me to find the answer I had never bothered looking up before.  I don't have insurance and won't for a while, so I hope it's not serious.   If your pants are on, as in you're using the fly of your pants and the door on your boxers, it's easy to reach back and under and give the necessary push pressure. It sometimes results in a good squirt, and you really get a sense of what runs down your leg when you zip up and walk away without taking the necessary precautions.    Tall and narrow. Imagine having to drive that thing with intense crosswinds on a highway?   [50 Shades of Gay](https://www.ted.com/talks/io_tillett_wright_fifty_shades_of_gay?language=en)   Many men experience a less powerful urinary stream when emptying the bladder, as they get older.  It is estimated that something like 1 in 3 men over the age of 50 develop urinary outflow symptoms, which in the majority of cases is due to benign enlargement of the prostate gland, otherwise known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.  The gland gradually enlarges as the years go by, and this enlargement can cause pressure on the water pipe which runs from the bladder to the outside (the urethra), restricting the flow of urine in just the same way that water running through a hose is restricted if the hose is kinked or compressed.  Another cause of urinary flow restriction is a stricture in the urethra as a result of inflammatory scarring, perhaps as a result of a previous infection or operative catheterization.  My advice would be to go along and see your GP so that an examination of your prostate gland may take place.  Initially, examination with a gloved finger can determine whether the gland is physically enlarged, and a blood test known as a PSA (prostate specific antigen) can measure a chemical secreted by the prostate gland to ensure that any enlargement is benign.  If necessary, a rectal ultrasound test can be organized to further examine the interior of the gland non-invasively.  I strongly advise you not to delay seeking help, as there is much evidence that early treatment with medication can prevent the problem from becoming worse, and often delays the need for surgery in years to come.  At any rate, if you have noticed symptoms your prostate gland should be examined because prostate cancer, although an unlikely possibility in your case, is very much on the increase and is potentially very serious even in relatively young men like yourself.

When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. ^14 Then he said to the tree, May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard him say it.  . . .   ^20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. ^21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, Rabbi, look!

He's capable of making every sound a fluent English speaker can make, just as long as it's not at the beginning of the word.  * After the police arrest the villains in Scooby Doo, what do they charge them with?  * The bad guys on Scooby Doo could probably have made more money selling Halloween costumes than trying to pull off their scams.  * How come in Scooby Doo's Universe monsters and ghost are dismissed as hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog  * What if Scooby Doo and the gang are the real ghosts and can't rest until they solve the mystery of their own murder?  * Scooby Doo is CSI for kids.  * Some company in "Scooby-Doo" had to manufacture snacks specifically for Scooby's consumption.  * Scrappy-Doo is to Scooby-Doo what Jar Jar Binks is to Star Wars  * Why does Scrappy Doo talk in a normal human voice while Scooby talks in a dog voice?  * Scooby-doo villains had the best special effects talent of that time period and could have made their fortunes legally.  * What the fuck kind of name for a dog is "Scooby Doo"?   * In "Scooby Doo" the gang isn't really solving mysteries about ghosts, ghouls, etc. They're actually just doing drugs with Shaggy in the Mystery Van and hallucinating their adventures.   * Ashton Kutcher would have been a great choice for Shaggy in the live-action Scooby Doo movie.  * The villains in Scooby-Doo never murdered or stole, they were just really spooky   * Scooby Doo's mystery team would have made their lives a lot easier if they decided to crackdown on the kingpin making all those high quality masks for criminals   * Maybe the reason law and order, CSI, and other drama mysteries are so popular is because all the people who grew up watching Scooby-Doo...   * If someone goes back in time to show the creator of Scooby Doo what they make, and they make Scooby Doo because that person showed them Scooby Doo, where did Scooby Doo start?  * Is Scooby Doo named after Scooby Snacks or did a company name themselves after him? (self.Showerthoughts)  * Blues Clues was like the early years/ origin story for Scooby Doo.   * Scrappy-doo has Scooby's surname, so his sister most have had him out of wedlock.   * Where did the villains in Scooby Doo get all those unique masks?   * Courage the Cowardly Dog + That 70s Show = Scooby Doo  * If I had enough money, I'd build a hospital an Intensive Care Unit and name it Scooby Scooby Doo  * Why isn't there a children's hospital with a Scooby Doo ICU?  * Scooby-Doo ultimately teaches kids that people aren't always who they seem, and sometimes the most helpful/friendly are also the most sinister.  * Why don't they sell Scooby Doo villains as Halloween costumes  * Carrie is to Matilda what X-Files is to Scooby-Doo.  * Scooby doo and the Mystery gang have been on and off the air, since 69 and would be senior citizens now  * Velma from Scooby Doo should really look into getting contacts  * Criminals in the Scooby-Doo universe go to jail for wearing costumes and scaring people.....harsh.  * If Scooby-Doo eats Scooby-Snacks, he'll still ultimately make Scooby-Doo.   * "Scooby Doobie Doo" is a strong hint at Scooby and Shaggy's frequent marijuana use   * If there were an episode of Scooby Doo where the "main suspect" actually ended up being the monster, it would be the biggest plot twist ever.   * In Scooby Doo, the paranormal crime always turns out to be a dude in suit. In the X-files, the 'normal' crime always turns out to be freaky shit.  * In Scooby Doo, no-one reads the criminals their Miranda Rights.   * Many of the villains from Scooby-Doo would be extremely rich if they patented the technology in their costumes.  * The story of the Disney movie Bighero is just a generic plot of Scooby doo.   * Considering every supernatural element the Scooby-Doo team uncover is in fact mundane, that talking dog they have with them must just be an old guy in a costume   * Scooby-Doo and the gang were most likely high on acid for every episode until the end.  * Why didn't they name Scooby Doo a word he could pronounce?  * A cabin in the woods is scooby doo but scooby is a black dude  * TV shows like NCIS or CSI are basically the grown-up versions of Scooby Doo   * Since Great Danes have shorter life spans, what if every iteration of Scooby Doo is just another Scrappy Doo grown up.  * Doctor who is the opposite of scooby-doo.  * Throughout the course of their adventures, the Scooby Doo Gang apprehends HUNDREDS of deranged, psychopathic criminals. They could realistically be a special police task force.  * Just realized the television show "Psyche" is just Scooby Doo for grown ups.   * Scooby Doo is about hipsters unmasking crooks using supernatural or monster costumes that terrify the gang... With the help of a conscious talking dog.   * Scooby Doo is supposed to teach children not to be afraid of monsters by revealing the villain as a person at the end. Essentially, it's just teaching children to be afraid of other people.  * Scooby Doo teaches kids that everything supernatural or otherworldly Is just some asshole trying to scare you so they can make some money  * Scooby-Doo was a show about functional meddling kids that kept actual kids from meddling  * Scooby Doo's catch phrase was Hanna-Barbera's own nod to their longest running primetime cartoon, The Flintstones.  * Scooby's name in Scooby Doo is derived from the word dooby.   * There should be a YouTube artist who's "thing" is finishing fake songs that appear in other media. (i.e. The Spice Girls from Scooby-Doo, Genovia's national anthem)   * Technically, Scooby Doo was the first Snoop Dogg.   * If it wasn't for society/media, would cemeteries be scary?  * Every episode from 'Scooby Doo' ends with a plot twist  * Gilligan, from Gilligan's Island, makes me think of Scooby-Doo as a human.   * House is like the adult version of Scooby Doo as far as mystery solving tv shows go   * Scooby-Doo is the only one in the 1969 series with eyes that aren't 100% pupil.   * Scooby-Doo teaches us that humans are scarier than any monster we could make up   * Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the gang must have to testify in court a lot.   * Why doesn't Velma from Scooby Doo just get contacts?   * Shaggy from Scooby-doo sounds like fucky in the UK  * At the end of Scooby-Doo, the villain always get's arrested, although they've never actually broken the law.  * Nintendo should team up with whoever owns Scooby Doo now, and create a Luigi's mansion crossover!  * Some Scooby-Doo mysteries would make great cases in an Ace Attorney game   * What if the guys from Scooby Doo caught a guy dressing up as a monster which actually existed, but they just caught the guy.  * Scooby do made us watch crime shows  * The X-Files is just Scooby-Doo for adults  * The Scream movies are just adult versions of Scooby Doo mysteries   * Why did Scooby Doo have a talking dog, but never real ghosts?   * Scooby Doo has lived a lot longer more than most dogs.  * Scooby Doo would make a great lead singer for a Deathcore band.   * Bruce willis in Die Hard is kind of like Scooby Doo-team. If it wasn't for you, I would have made it  * The X-files is essentially Scooby Doo in reverse.  * Velma from Scooby-Doo is in the perfect position to commit the crime.   * What if the Scooby Doo show takes place in a psychiatric asylum where they have an imaginary talking dog that helps solve puzzles they can't solve on their own?   * What if Scooby Doo and Gang were better investigators than Mulder and Scully, and that's why they got to the bottom of all their supernatural cases?   * 90% of Scooby Doo villains were less harmful to their "victims" than the average prank video on YouTube  * The X-Files was one, long Scooby Doo episode.  * Like the most recent Scooby-Doo movie, the Teenage Mutant Turtles Movie is the retro film I'm supposed to want to see, but whose series I never actually liked   * In the Scooby Doo movie "Zombie Island", Shaggy and Scooby get caught eating all the contraband cheese while at work. The cheese contraband was just substitute for Shaggy and Scooby smoking contraband at work.   * If every dog in the world turned into Scooby Doo. We'd never face fear again. Except by talking dogs.  * Every episode of Scooby Doo is like a cartoon version of the reality TV show, Catfish.   * Most Scooby Doo mysteries could have been solved immediately if Scooby had attacked the monster and ripped its head off  * Scooby-Doo's scooby snacks are the equivalent of Popeye's spinach   * Shaggy and Scooby-Doo were always craving Scooby snacks because they were high and had the munchies.  * if scooby doo had been named scoopy doo that show would have been a lot different   * A t.v. show featuring a dog detective (like Scooby-Doo), but voiced by Snoop Dogg.   * It's actually kind of... Sad? I guess? that Scooby Doo doesn't realize he's a dog.   * In Scooby Doo, Shaggy eats dog treats for snacks.  * Someone should make a Scooby Doo themed restaurant review site named Relp.   * How come Scooby Doo never got the shits? All he eats is burgers etc   * Hawaii Five O is basically Scooby Doo for adults  * Muppet Babies, Scooby Doo Kids, Flintstone Kids, but no Golden Girls Babies? Where same actresses crawl around in nothing but diapers?  * Shaggy from Scooby Doo is a total pothead. Not only does he look and dress like one, but his best friend's a talking dog, he always has the munchies, and he's always paranoid.

To compare, Reddit costs just over $33.5k per month in server expenses, so that's $402,000 per year, which is less than HealthCare.Gov, but they are very different animals.  http://theweek.com/speedreads/440113/price-tag-healthcaregov-just-ballooned-22-billion   Damn it! It's people like you that we need in Hollywood!   Of all the things you could have left me with, I'm grateful it was that.   [You're killing me...](http://i.imgur.com/bzhyjpr.gif)   Yeah, but you could say that about lots of things...    I think the number of people who would rather have $16,400 is probably a pretty significant number.  All good points, and you're probably right. Of course, having insurance could very easily save some people $16,400 or more in any given year. Anyone is one health or injury catastrophe from massive hospital bills. Something like this is incredibly difficult to measure in terms of real value.   If it came down to Darkseid and Anti-Monitor, you'd have DC's current storyline: The Darkseid War.  I had no idea Larfleeze was so OP. I assume it's because he's the sole bearer of the Orange Lantern?   So... Zoloman is the last man standing?  Damn.   Nix Uotan? Final Crisis made him a human vessel through with the Overmonitor can see the unified reality, which has since split again so he's really unknown as far as the New 52 is concerned. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he's been mentioned since Final Crisis. If he were, he'd win; you're absolutely right. He has all the answers to guys like Superman and The Flash.  As for Captain Atom, I'm not convinced he could take Superman or The Flash. Although Captain Atom can create insane amounts of power and even transmute matter, he also absorbs energy, which means Superman or The Flash could overwhelm him until he's unstable, reaches critical, and he self-destructs.   If he can transmute the entire battle arena or at least a lot of it into Kryptonite, that would be one way he could gain an advantage over Superman, but I don't know what he could do against The Flash. I'd see The Flash whipping up some Speed Force nonsense, Captain Atom overloads and explodes, The Flash contains it, and we have a winner.  I'd also question Captain Atom's abilities against Shazam. He doesn't really have any defense against magic.    If that's the case, can't he take Superman? He canonically took on the entire Justice League by himself and didn't lose. No matter how hard Superman can hit, MMH can density shift through it. Oh, and [he hits pretty fucking hard himself.](http://i.imgur.com/W4ZmfTp.jpg)  If MMH can overcome the fire issue, and he provably has, can anyone conceivably stop him?   Great question.   That's the total cost for the entire project, which includes setting up the physical and technical infrastructure for the entire exchange, as well as every state's exchange (those that chose to implement them, anyway). It also includes staffing for all the people who did that work, as well as all the lawyers/business people/bureaucrats who made the whole project work.  It wasn't so much a $634m website; it was a $634m system.  /u/EngineeredMadness talks about a lot of the bureaucratic and technical backend reasons that make this project expensive by it's very nature: http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwhsmv  /u/avacar points out that the $634m price tag is a grand total over several contracts that were signed to the company that did the work. There was a whole lot of prep work that took years to go through in order to even be able to begin building a system this complex, and it took a lot of people a lot of time to do it. Couple this with EngineeredMadness's points and you've got a pretty good idea of what happened.  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1owop4/eli5_how_did_healthcaregov_cost_634000000_that/ccwgh1k  Again, I'm not defending the site, or the cost. It's a government contract, it almost undoubtedly had more bloat to it than it needed to. But if you really look at all the in's and out's of what it would take to build a system this complex, you can at least comprehend the reasoning behind why the numbers got so large, and can hopefully appreciate why keeping the site both functional, responsive, and stable is a momentous undertaking.

I don't completely disagree with you. It's funny; I actually liked it more as a kid and don't like it nearly as much now that I'm in my 30s. It's better than Frontier, Insurrection, and Nemesis, but I don't prefer it.  First Contact is actually my favorite Star Trek movie, and for most purists, anything but Khan is heresy. Whatever, though. I'm more of a Next Generation fan so that's really the best of them for us.   Questioning the validity of The Daily Mail is perfectly reasonable.   Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.  http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-03-14-00231.asp    anyone but Guy  I'd rather watch a Mogo movie.   It's worded strangely too.

I think most people would probably rather have the insurance than the $644.25, but that's purely speculation on part. I can't prove that.  **EDIT**: Looks like the actual costs of the website were significantly higher: Office of Inspector General released a report finding that the total cost of the HealthCare.gov website had reached $1.7 billion.

That is a great explanation, and it also leads to believe Zoom wins this entire showdown because that logic can be applied to everyone.  Could it come down to Eobard Thawne VS Hunter Zolomon?   Zoom kills Darkseid?  I'm not saying your wrong, but wow. How does that play out?   The obvious guess is Darkseid. Does anyone have a better answer?  Rules:  1. This is sudden. Every superhero on earth is teleported into this inescapable arena all at once without warning. It's large enough to have an area of every earth climate/terrain including cityscape, desert, ocean, waterfall, plains, etc.  2. Anyone who generally carries (insert weapon, object, whatever) has it with them. Yes, weapons are allowed.  3. This is a "Hunger Games" style battle to the death, last man standing. That means "no kill rule" characters will kill and must kill to survive. This isn't about the characters' ethics; it's about their abilities.   Totally, and I don't think it was bad enough to warrant tanking the franchise. A good sequel could have saved it, and the sequel they were obviously setting up would have meant a lot more Sinestro, which was the best part of the first one.  I really think they should consider allowing it to be canon, make a sequel, and even if they can't get Ryan or they think he'd be too strongly associated with the competitor's Deadpool, they could introduce John Stewart, Kyle, or even Guy and have all this compatible with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad, Justice League, etc.   Who would be the biggest threat to him? [Fire?](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Fire)  [Firestorm?](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Firestorm)   The obvious guess is Superman. Does anyone have a better answer?  Rules:  1. This is sudden.

"The Homer" (also known as "The Car Built for Homer") was a car designed by Homer Simpson when his half-brother, Herb, gave Homer a job at Powell Motors. It is a parody/exaggeration of the Edsel, a similarly disastrous automobile designed by Ford Motor Company.  http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer  The storyline of a controversially styled car causing the company to fail both echoes that of the Edsel and the Tucker Torpedo. The Edsel was a controversially styled car that bore the name of Henry Ford's son, Edsel Ford, and is now considered one of the biggest car flops in history. Production of the Tucker Torpedo, which introduced many new features, was shut down amidst scandal and accusations of stock fraud in 1949.[3] Homer wants the horns of the car he is designing to play the traditional Spanish folk corrido "La Cucaracha".[5] The Pope shows up for the unveiling of Homer's new car.[5] Herb berates his staff for suggesting that the company name a new car "Persephone" after the Greek goddess of fertility in Greek mythology. Herb tells the staff, "People don't want cars named after hungry old Greek broads! They want names like 'Mustang' and 'Cheetah'vicious animal names," referencing the Ford Mustang and Lamborghini Cheetah cars.[6]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F    [He's right.](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Homer)   I don't think it's terrible; it just wasn't that good. The parts that were good were really good, but the overall product seemed undercooked, too long, and anticlimactic. To me, the whole problem with it was how overwhelmingly average it was.   Correcting their English would be helpful either way, and the question  of OP's native land and/or tongue is exactly why I phrased "Is OP proving the point" as a question.

Khan was supposed to end the series, so it made some moves that couldn't be sensibly undone. It turned out to be so damned good, it revitalized interest in the franchise. Of course they needed Spock, he played hard ball and said he'd only come back if he could direct, and they did what they thought they had to.

Not according to Homer:  Bart: No offense Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a whole lot better than your half-assed over-parenting  Homer: Aw, but i was using my *whole* ass...    ST:Wrath of Khan is the best 'Star Trek' movie, ST:The Motion Picture is the better movie.  I can hear myself repeating this line in the future. You absolutely nailed something I've always kind of thought, but didn't quite know how to express.  ST:TMP is hugely underrated in my opinion.   ***EDIT Just for /r/MrFurious0***:   Galaxy Quest:   IMDb: 7.3  Metacritic: 70  RT: 90 critic / 78 user  Average: 80.5   I don't hate it. It's definitely better than The Final Frontier.   I'd personally rate Khan over Darkness, but there's no accounting for taste...   Considering his were two of the best movies in the franchise's history, you're absolutely right.   I was never too big on Search, but it's leaps and bounds better than Final Frontier.   Judging from most internet comments, the answer is almost always lens flare.   Yeah, was looking for an odd movie to be good, but I guess Nemesis truly kicked it off by an even number being god awful.   Apparently Simon Pegg has concerns about writing an odd-numbered Star Trek movie, but the curse seems to have been broken by 11   12 both being good with 11 actually getting generally better reviews than 12.

["Are we the baddies?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKcmnrE5oY)   He looked pretty much perfect, but his voice and the way he carried himself were all wrong. I always imagined him with a deep, booming, maybe even slightly synthetic/metallic voice, carrying himself with all the pomp and dignity of an absolute ruler/tyrant.  Instead he just sounded like some random asshole.   Words have meaning!   I didn't even think of that, but yeah, good call.   /u/rMunky pretty much answered, but all the reader sees is Batman asking The Joker's true identity and responding, "No. That's not possible."  Darkseid War has fairly solid thus far.   And yet I haven't and Karma Decay turned up 0 results, so no.   My opinions aren't xenophobic and don't involve racist caricatures of immigrants.    Officially part of the "reality" in which Batman exists, in this case, the New 52 mainstream DC Comics continuity.   K.  [Here's John McCain on biography.com](http://www.biography.com/people/john-mccain-9542249#introduction-to-politics)  It's actually more impressive than his own website.   The Joker was already iconic before the animated series with Hamill though  No shit, that's why I said: "Hamill's voice and laugh as The Joker is an iconic voice and laugh associated with an iconic villain." I didn't say his voice and laugh made the character iconic.    And the nonstop circlejerk for Hamill's Joker ought to prove that Hamill absolutely deserves credit for his takes on the character which are clearly preferred and beloved by either a majority of the fans or an insanely vocal minority.   I personally have never once picked up a comic book and heard Jack Nicholson or Ledger's voice or laugh in my head. Hamill's? That's all I'll ever hear because you just can't top perfection.   I get what you mean, but if the character *isn't* at least a psychotic anarchist dressed like a clown--the mob relations aren't vital to the character--he can scarcely be called The Joker.    Yeaaa, it is.  You're right; your insanely clever comment and all its wit and irony went right over my head. I'm truly a dullard.   Spoiler alert (I can never get the spoiler tags to work; I have not ruled out the possibility that I'm an idiot).  Storyline: Darkseid War is going on and whenever Darkseid is at war, the New Gods are involved. This includes Metron who was dethroned from The Mobius Chair, which Batman takes the liberty of sitting on, which only a god can/should do, and it gives him godlike omniscience; the chair can answer any question. Basically, Batman can know anything that is knowable, so he asks it who killed his parents, the true identity of The Joker, and the answer to why it is that 42 is the answer to everything.  In reality? Only Geoff Johns could answer that, but it wouldn't be the first time they took real-world criticisms and turned them on their heads for the purpose of storytelling. The "Batgod" label has been pervasive in DC Comics for some time, often making Batman seem bizarrely OP for a guy with no superpowers. I would imagine a pitch meeting where someone said, "What if he were actually made a god? What would he do?" and the responses to that question were interesting enough to warrant exploring.  That and having him straight up murder Darkseid has already been done, so they were probably trying to figure out a new way to wrap this thing up.   Maybe because no other actor has so perfectly captured the voice and laugh to the point where most comics readers "hear" Hamill in their heads whilst reading the character's thoughts, lines, and laughs.   Hamill's voice and laugh as The Joker is an iconic voice and laugh associated with an iconic villain. He is absolutely fundamental to how his takes on The Joker have been perceived.    Considering how many have taken on the role, that's a high compliment.   Super Friends represent!   Might as well include [Anthony Misiano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxribF26Ldo) if we're including internet-famous Jokers.   All they can possibly base this on is his line in the trailer, "I'm not gonna kill you; I'm just gonna hurtcha really, really bad," which definitely came off as "psychotic," but to be fair, almost every iteration of the character could be justifiably called "psychotic."   He replaced Mark Hamill and tried his best to do Hamill's voice and laugh.   Yeah, they were doing a tribute to the [Dick Sprang] version while trying to find a Joker that hadn't been done and reflected the tongue-in-cheek style of the show.  Like you wrote, I understood, but I didn't enjoy it.   Worst part of an otherwise great series.   Young Justice.    Leto aside  He could be all those things; we really don't know much about the character.   You such at math. If /u/aroad is turning 20 next week, he was born in 1995.  Jack's Joker was in 89 and Cesar's was in 66. His age can't have much to do with it now can it?   I want to fix this meme.  I'll do it right.  White text outlined in black.  The best possible picture of each version.  Mark Hamill, although a personal favorite of mine, won't be declared "the one true" because there isn't any.  What I need is good suggestions for their single-word descriptors.  I also need anything left out by this version. I want it to be complete and definitive.  Help me, /r/batman; you're my only hope.

The answer to your question depends on the context of the word "why." Are you asking why Batman became a new god in terms of the storyline, or the real-life rationale behind Geoff Johns' decision to do this?   This is from Justice League 42, which is a part of the Darkseid War storyline.   Takes place on a Battleship.   versus Batroc the Leaper...   How is a hateful bag of shit leaking feces everywhere admirable?   Bernie Sanders says what he thinks and it's not a bunch of venomous bile and bullshit. He actually stands for things and they're good things.  By your logic, Hitler is admirable.   Because people who spend a lot of time on television can't be doing their jobs?  [Here's his legislative accomplishments.](http://johnmccain.com/legislative/) He's a major political figure and force for a reason.   This has to be the most overused and wrongly-used comments on Reddit.  https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/no-true-scotsman  It is not a logical fallacy of any kind to point out that not all Republicans are idiots. Even if all idiots were Republicans, it would still be perfectly acceptable to say that not all Republicans are idiots so long as it were true, which it obviously is.  I should also point out that it's possible to disagree with people without writing them off as stupid.      There are not 600 levels, so I'm not sure why it has that designation, but it's where the metahumans are imprisoned.   I'm 34 and I've been reading/following DC Comics since I was about 5, and "level 600" means nothing to me.   I see it as more of a critique on consumerism and how it enables the capitalist than a critique of capitalism itself, but yes, you're right.   Terry's Batman isn't Elseworlds; it's considered canon.   As for precedent, In Jeph Loeb's Superman/Batman #22 (preNew52 version written by Jeph Loeb), a Batman wearing the Beyond costume appeared, which was the Beyond version of Batman's first foray into the regular DC Comics continuity. Bizarro was transported to an alternate version of Gotham City. In issue #23, this Batman is named "Tim".   Fun fact: the packaging for the action figure created by DC Direct based on this appearance in Superman/Batman identifies Batman Beyond as Tim Drake.  As for mainstream continuity, in Batman #700, Terry McGinnis was included in the one-off as a part of the DC Universe presented, had a history with Damian Wayne, who rescued him as Batman from Two-Face-Two when he was held hostage as an infant. Terry was directly inspired by Batman, but it was the Damian Wayne Batman.   The plot involved Two-Face-Two (if ever a villain warranted a sequel) believed Terry McGinnis was one of a pair of twin boys who were the sons of billionaires rather than Warren and Mary McGinnis. Two-Face-Two transformed Terry into a miniature duplicate of the Joker with the Joker's toxin. Damian administered the antidote after he rescued Terry. In the following page, a teenage McGinnis is seen behind the Batman cowl, battling the apparently-resurrected Joker, with Damian as his mentor, instead of Bruce.  Superman/Batman Annual #4 featured Terry McGinnis' Batman in mainstream continuity as well. It picked up after Superman's first meeting with the new Terry Batman, and Terry Batman also took part heavily in Future's End.   He is 100% a part of regular DC continuity.  Or *was.*  But it's comics, so he'll totally come back because clones or time travel or alternative dimensions or whatever.   [SPOILERS]  Terry was killed during Future's End and Tim Drake finally took up the mantle of Batman. The book is relaunching with a new series starting at #1 with Tim Drake as Batman.     I'm torn between that and [Robin getting down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95VTu4Dfag8) in the driver ed vehicle.     [This free "sneak peak"](http://www.dccomics.com/comics/we-are-robin-2015/dc-sneak-peek-we-are-robin-2015) should tell you everything you need to know.   I agree with you completely; they represent interpretations of the character, not necessarily specific wearers of the duds.   The default, regular Robin on the show is Dick, the female is CK, but the other two are very debatable.   Dick   Jason are the only two to ever wear the fish scale armor short shorts, and since regular Robin is Dick, that would leave short shorts to be Jason, but the personality is more in line with silver age Robin, AKA Dick.   Meanwhile, the black-caped Robin is wearing Tim Drake's threads and has the darker attitude, but that attitude could be associated with Tim or Jason.  So... my take is that it's representations of different takes on Robin without being any identity in particular. Robin has been the wide-eyed Boy Wonder of the silver age, the Dark Knight Returns Girl Wonder, and the darker, more brooding sidekick.   As much as Liam Neeson did a fine job, I'd prefer an Arabian character with a name like   to actually be middle-eastern. I don't always care about an actor being the same ethnicity as the character they're playing, but in this case, and Bane's, their ethnicity was relevant to the character.  Still, I thought Begins was overall a strong entry and set the stage quite nicely for The Dark Knight. I do feel like The Dark Knight was a bit rushed or overstuffed though. There was enough there to make The Joker the one-and-only and have Dent's transformation a background story, revealing the Two-Face part in the following movie. They basically introduced one of Batman's greatest and most interesting villains just to kill him ten minutes later.   This is the same subject/object thing as who/whom.  "I" is the subject; "me" is the object.  *I* have to go to the store.   *Who* is going to the store? *I* am.   Do you want to come with me?   Yes.  Good. You and I will go to the store.   *I* is the subject because *I* is the one doing something.  Do you want to come with me?  *Me* is the object because *me* isn't the subject; *I* is. *I* is the one doing something. *Me* is the object associated with the predicate *with*. Come with whom? Come with me.   I hated just about everything to do with Dark Knight Rises. I saw it at a midnight premiere and haven't seen it since, nor do I desire to. It's a shame, because I quite liked Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but that ended the trilogy on a seriously sour note.   There is no "best." The character has been the subject of so many different takes, and there have been very few I didn't like. One such example was the Young Justice version, which is one of the few things that show got heinously wrong.  Dennis O'Neil's take on the character in the 70s is what a lot of people would consider the "classic" Joker and the one that has inspired most interpretations. He did a really great job fleshing out the character and even scored him his own book, which was unheard of for villains.   Steve Englehart introduced the classic "Laughing Fish" that was used in Batman: The Animated Series. Marshall Rogers introduced the trench coat and fedora which impacted Jack Nicholson's Joker.   Speaking of which, if you need a legendary actor to play a crazy man, who better than Jack? Tim Burton brought the "goth" to Gotham giving us a demented, insane, criminal mastermind with a twisted sense of humor. While Burton's Batman missed a lot of important points regarding the Batman of comic books, Nicholson's Joker, at the time, was incredibly close to the comics, including the acid bath origin, the disfigured face, not wearing makeup, etc.  Cesar Romano's 1966 TV series Joker was a product of a campy show, more like the zanny nuisance trickster, but that's where get the mainstays like joy buzzers and acid-spitting flowers from.  Mark Hamill's Joker, whether DCAU or the Arkham series of games, gave most us of us the voice we hear in our heads whenever we read the character's lines. The voice and ironic laugh are just unbeatable, and the cartoon very cleverly kept a psychotic clown character in a show geared for children by hinting at the horror without often painting the picture. He was a nice balance of silly and psycho.  Frank Miller's Joker in Dark Knight Returns or Alan Moore's in The Killing Joke each defined the character in their own way. They're two of the darker interpretations, but they're undeniable classics. DKR undoubtedly influenced A Death in The Family, one of the most infamous stories in comics with lasting repercussions.   Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth was groundbreaking and a terrifying look at the character.  The New 52 face-as-a-mask version of Death of the Family was over-the-top, but perhaps the most horrifying.   As for Heath Ledger, his Joker was intelligent, meaningful, and, in spite of all his cunning calculation and strategic planning, an ironic agent of chaos. It's one of the most memorable and iconic performances in film.   The Joker is quite possibly the best villain in all of fiction and certainly the best in comics. With so many different takes on the character, I don't see a "best." I see different ways of looking at the same thing, and that thing is the scary nature of the universe and especially death being sadly chaotic and what it means to confront that.   Everything since the Bill Finger/Bob Kane original Batman of 1939 is an interpretation of the original and they've all been somewhat-to-radically different ever since, comics included.   Based on the title of your post, I assume you're mainly concerning yourself with The Joker, and unless you're talking about Jerry Robinson, Bill Finger, and Bob Kane's Joker of the 1940s, you are again talking about a character that has had dozens of different interpretations.   Ales is spelled with lowercase letters as opposed to ALS which is all caps, which distinguishes it. Any confusion disappears once they see the "Benefiting ALS.net," again continuing the use of lowercase letters where an initialism isn't being used.  The only other thing they could have done is "A.L.S.," but that is old fashioned and unnecessary.    Made its rounds a couple months ago on Reddit too.

In optics, pink can refer to any of the colors between bluish red (purple/violet) and red, of medium to high brightness and of low to moderate saturation.  Although pink is *generally* considered a tint of red--so you're not wrong--most variations of pink lie between red, white and magenta colors. This means that the pink's hue is usually between red and magenta, not just red.   I love Teen Titans Go! Robin.   [All of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mmqO26VbaE).

Also fun, when singing the vocals for the song "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da," McCartney made a slip and said "Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face", rather than Molly, and had Molly letting "the children lend a hand."

[And the existing Lego Batman movie.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2465238/?ref_=nv_sr_3)   [Also in the Lego Batman movie that came out in 2013.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2465238/?ref_=nv_sr_3)   Neither is beating a dead horse.

Good or bad is not measured solely by the experience of the victims or whether or not the victims feel victimized, especially when they're robbed of the ability to know one way or the other.  Surely I don't need to explain how it's unethical to intentionally handicap a person or dictate their lot in life.   [This Slate article appears to back OP.](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/11/07/revolving_doors_why_don_t_we_use_them_more.html)  The story goes like this: Theophilus Van Kannel hated chivalry. There was nothing he despised more than trying to walk in or out of a building, and locking horns with other men in a game of oh you first, I insist. But most of all, Theophilus Van Kannel hated opening doors for women.  He set about inventing his way out of social phobia. And thats how, in 1888, Theophilus Van Kannel was awarded US Patent #387571 A for a storm-door structure, which would soon become known as the revolving door.   And any good it did is likely to be undone by Rorschach's journal.     Your whole life planned out for you  Remember that part of that plan sometimes meant things like being brutally shocked as a baby for crawling toward flowers, rampant brainwashing/programming, and the possibility of having been intentionally made genetically inferior so as not to question your predetermined lot in life.   I wasn't saying you were wrong; I was merely clarifying. I assumed you knew.   Yes. It never happened.

However, speaking strictly to your question, as horrible as this sounds, I did work with some kids who would have been better off dead, and please don't judge me too harshly until you've had the same experiences. The quality of life for some incredibly low-functioning autistic kids, as well as the severely mentally or physically disabled would be like a lifelong nightmare for some.   If you were confined to a wheelchair, had little motor control, needed someone to spoon feed you food that has been put through a blender with thickening agent, you had to be fed tiny amounts over a long period of time to limit the likelihood of choking, and you were constantly shitting yourself and incapable of communication, would *you* want to live?   Organic web shooters make sense because gaining the powers of a spider should totally include the ability to make webs, but technically, they should be coming from his ass, not his wrists...   That's like saying the world isn't responsible enough to possess graphene. It's just an incredibly useful substance. The world already possesses nuclear weapons and web fluid is a problem?   Yep.

This will save you some  money and hold an edge better than a German knife while being less prone to chipping or tip breaking while you get used to the thin blade and steep edge bevels of these knives. Use the Germans as the work -horses and the gyuto for things like slicing and dicing softer veggies and boneless meats.

Not to much actually, the big one was $35 and the little one was around $80. To be honest I haven't done any serious sharpening with these,I just play around stropping on them for edge upkeep and they do fine with that although the course one won't cut the super steels very well,(vg10,R2). I guess the trick to nats is to keep the slurry washed off until you get the edge and and then let it build up and thicken as you keep working with less and less pressure, that way one stone is multi grit. One day i will find the patience to try this. For actual sharpening I have a couple Shapton bench stones and an edge- pro, easy peasy quick and easy.

          Also vegan friendly bread is Abbotts and Helga's (not the gluten free though) and Bakers Delight have a lot of vegan friendly bread/rolls they will check which ones if you ask :)   You must check out Prahran Convenience or IGA and grab Gardein products.  At woolies grab the fry's products in the dairy part the snags and hotdogs are the bomb! I'm vegan and thats what I eat....a lot :) Also for organic stuff the Fruit Peddlers in Northcote have everything you need as well. http://thefiveminuteguide.com.au/2013/11/14/the-fruit-peddler/ - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Prahran-Convenience/327183647396414 - http://www.frysvegetarian.com.au/ - https://www.facebook.com/gardeinaustralia      Cat made it down alive - Saucey Source: http://www.onegreenplanet.org/news/stowaway-cat-miracle-flight/?utm_source=Green+Monster+Mailing+List utm_campaign=a928878a3a-NEWSLETTER_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN utm_medium=email utm_term=0_bbf62ddf34-a928878a3a-105922189                                   	18
    I recant my foolishness and endorse a Baratheon stag surrounded by flames or a flayed stag.   How does Dreadfort feel about this much needed change?   This guy    Burlingame, CA   plus too old   You know what else won't get old? Olly....after I kill that motherfucker.      When you opened your belt your dog was like "God dammit. Jacking it again?!"   Thanks!   A while back my Aunt got me and my father tickets to a baseball game for father's day. They were for both of us but she gave the tickets to me so they were my responsibility. The day of the game she texted me "How's the game?". The only problem was that...we forgot to go. We had been looking forward to it for a while but the day of we just both completely blanked. (She gave us the tickets a little over a month prior). I was sitting with my dad when we got that text but it was already too late to make it in time. He told me to tell he we're having a great time and I agreed because we thought it would have been insulting to say that we forgot (We didn't want to look like the gift didn't mean anything to us because it did). Around 20 minutes and a lot of cussing in frustration from both of us later he says that I should tell her the truth. *I* should tell her the truth. I take full responsibility for forgetting about the game (well, 96%. I was his present too!), but he told me to lie to her! My question: Is my dad the asshole? We ending up telling the truth which was the right thing to do (and she was understanding), but in this situation was my dad in the wrong to tell me to tell her the truth after he told me to lie?   It sounds like he could really use a brother right about now.   Think about if he wasn't your brother. Would you be putting up with his crap? Probably not. But, as his brother you still have a duty to do what you can to help him. That doesn't mean letting him sleep for free in your home, but take him to AA meetings if the drinking is a serious problem, help him find a home he can afford and at the very least talk to him, he sounds lonely.   Try your best not to lead her on. Opening the snapchats is telling her you're still interested (even in you're only interested in her body). I would suggest not opening the snapchats anymore. That being said I don't believe you are an asshole.   I agree with most of what you said until the end. I don't believe she is entitled or spoiled, or rather I don't think you have the ability to gather enough information from the text to make that assumption. What I do think is that she is a kid with maybe a little bit of a quick temper.    It sounds like this girl was trying to get a reaction out of you and has been for the past few weeks. Are you an asshole for letting her get under your skin? I don't think so. Should you have said that? Probably not.   It sounds like you made him really happy   *Calming intensifies*    Portal 1 ending song will always have a place in my heart.   *burrrrrrn*    Burlingame!   I'd like to join the Democratic party      That's ok, simple misunderstanding.    Actually his name is Bret, not Brett   .....no....Pork sausage!          A lot of up and coming talent in this thread.   When the whistle blows for a foul on the floor, players stop playing; Unlike in football, when there is a flag in a play players keep playing. The only thing I could think of would be after a foul players could have like a 3 second time window where the play continues and they have a free shot of some sorts. If they make it, the foul is declined, if they miss it, they rewind the clock and he gets his shots, but that seems too complicated to be doing consistently throughout a game.   Are we all forgetting Marie?   So when someone dies who other people cared about but you didn't, you try to belittle them and make them feel small because there are other problems in the world. If you think being an arrogant asshole to others by guilting them with your unjustified egotistic attitude makes you a better person, let me tell you it doesn't.    Frank's homosexuality will come out and cause a major scandal.    Oh my god. That gif just works so perfectly. Great job.         Locke vs. Hobbes   Wow. This is the first one in here that really made me think about my original belief.   /r/aquariums Nothing makes you feel better than a group of people who share your hobby.   I love you   It's a nice change of pace to have a subreddit where people are so kind and supportive. You guys are the best.   Because no one has said it yet in this thread, Wilfred is the greatest show on the goddamn planet.   	42
 I wanted to know if anybody else here looks up the ending to a book they're reading. I started reading paper towns and i got so anxious i looked up the ending and i instantly regretted it,  I just couldn't help myself. Does anyone else do this? Any tips on how to erase the ending from my mind? Thanks!   Thanks so much! we'll definitely check some of these places out. do you know of anything along the same lines to do in Boulder? Thanks for the help! :)   Lol. We're all able-bodied and we'd like to visit shops, parks, and other places like museums and other attractions in town. As far as outdoors goes, we're looking for some nice parks to visit so we can do some moderate hiking. Thanks for the help and sorry for the repeated vagueness.    Sorry for the vagueness, but we're looking for some cool local places to visit while we are in town (Denver, Boulder). We'd like to visit places that not every tourist knows about in town if that makes any sense.    Hi everybody,   My family and I will be in Colorado the week of August 17. We'll be in Denver for a couple days then we'll be heading to Boulder and maybe head to Aspen. I'd really appreciate some fun places to visit in town, around, and along the way. I'd love to see some of the countryside(if anybody can recommend some places to check out) as its pretty brown in California right now. I can't wait to visit your state! Thanks again!!    It is kind of a bummer when all you want to do is see how fast your car can go on the freeway and you run into a npc. I get your point about horizon being a festival, but having the npc on the road does make it feel like you're actually on the road. But yes, it does get frustrating especially when all you're trying to do is drive, isn't that why we play these games? So we can drive a Ferrari without having to worry about other cars on the road?   	6
 Haha! Well, thank you for what you did for humanity.  To your husband, I would say, push through it. You gotta get it done. Put your head down and do it. Don't worry about how good it is, or whether it's gonna sell, or any of the BS. Write until the writing's done. Once it's done, then you can start wringing your hands and pulling your hair about how you're going to make it actually good. Just remember, there's nothing you type that you can't go back and change or make better. If you view a book as one task--"I have to write a great book"--then it's going to be too monumental to handle. So, first, just write a book.   Alright...  Alexander Skarsgard, Michael Chiklis, Emile Hirsch, and Rosamund Pike, respectively.   Confirmed. On all three counts.   Not have the main character happen to find the hottest woman in the world and bang her within a few days, all while fighting the undead. I hated that. Thought it was absolutely ridiculous.   That's a big compliment! I can only think of a few books that I've read more than once.  So, my characters are pretty much people I know, or combinations of people I know. Sometimes they're even combinations of other characters from other books, movies, TV shows. When I create a character, I usually have a vague idea of who I think they remind me of, then I just kind of add to that to form the basic "function" of this person. How they talk, how they think, their accent, their facial expressions, their habits, etc. Then I just kind of let them develop on their own.  From 2007 to January of this year I was a police officer. So it was a combination of training I got from the department, experiences from my time there, and from the fact that every partner I've had in that time period was a vet. So naturally, you're in a squad car with somebody for 10 hours a day, you hear war stories and ask questions and learn a lot.   Haha! I've been known to kill a few silver bullets in my time. But I'm not real particular when it comes to beer. I pretty much drink it all. And yes.......I will drink it all.   Thanks for the love! Glad you enjoyed the books!   Hope you get to the next ones!  If I waited for inspiration to write I probably would never finish a book. I love writing, and I love that it's my job now, but let me tell you bro, it's freakin' work. It takes a lot of discipline to sit down and write, even when you don't feel like writing. But usually, if I can break the inertia, then I start to get into it and it starts to flow.  I don't like to use the term writer's block. I call it "lazy." Now, that's not to say I'm not lazy. I'm lazy all the time. I huff and puff and stare at my computer screen, but there's no magical, mystical mental block there. It's just me being lazy. Usually I'll go work out or something and come back at another part of the day when I'm feeling a little more energetic.  Now, this may light some people's hair on fire, but I was never really a big ZA fiction fanboy. I like the concept. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead. But I'm by no means a Romero purist or anything like that.  The Road. Hands down. Great book. Good movie, too. And I'm very partial to Cormac McCarthy.   Nice! Tell that prick to stay safe.   Thanks!  You're right. Tango dying is probably one of the things I'm asked about most. It was a tough scene to write. I even got a little misty. But to answer the question of "Why?" Well, I needed Lee to be completely alone. I needed him going into Camp Ryder pretty much stripped of everything that was familiar to him. That's why he shows up without anything or any weapons. And I needed Tango to be gone, because he was too much of a source of familiarity and comfort for Lee. I hated to do it, but it would have been too cozy if I hadn't.  Jerry was no specific person. Jerry was every politician I've ever watched on TV and tilted my head like a dog hearing a siren pass by, wondering, "What the hell is he talking about? And why is he running my effing country?"  It's actually kind of the opposite for me. I don't look at people and think about characters, but when I'm trying to develop a character I will sit back and think of people that I know and sometimes I'll choose to make the character mirror someone almost exactly, and sometimes it will be a mashup of several different people.   I never regret killing off characters. Which is very odd, because I do get attached to my characters. But, if everyone lives, then living isn't so special (at least in fiction).  Yup, got a stand-alone book being shopped and I'm working on the first part of a new series.   I'm not gonna let you pin me down, Angry Beaver! Seriously though, I could see myself getting to it within a few years.  	12
 I literally just watched this episode.   Damn Hooch is crazy.          Fantastic story, I for one would love to see where you take it.       Nerf guns.    My 3 year old daughter and I love nerf guns. She has a few that she can operate on her own and I have some that I have to prep for her.   We have a hall way with the air intake on the ceiling and it's extremely fun to watch her shoot a balloon that is stuck on it.   Also cooking with your little girl is one of my favorite things to do. Nothing too complicated, but just enough so that she is learning and feels like she helped.   Wednesday night we cooked pancakes and I mix everything in a blender.  Her job was to press the buttons. The way her face lights up brightens my day.   Pixar movies are also a great bet.   	6
 I already try to talk to her, in my experience, time can heal you but can also drag you down very fast. This is something I want to prevent at all cost. I really do hope it's just a phase and she'll snap out of it.  I drove home for the night so we could have dinner and he seems allright, laughing from time to time and making jokes so I'm carefully hopefull :)  And glad to hear that you seems to do allright, I doubt I can make you a whole lot better but if it's any help, I have tough about you, that stranger from Reddit, quite a few times today and I really do hope you're good! *internet hug*   Thank you, I might bring this up when Infeel the time is right.  And that may be so but that's no reason for me not to care about others right? So, stanger to stranger, how are you doing and dealing with it now?   That must be so tough on you :(   If I may ask, what could potentionally make you open up towards them? Is there anything they could do or say to make you feel comfortable with this?   Hi,  Thank you for your response.  I have indeed tought about the fact that it might be possible that she's hiding something. However, I do not think this is the case. She was never the type of person to hide stuff from her family, no matter how embarrassing/painfull.    Plus, she also says that this is the main reason why she's so confused, she doesn't know why she is feeling so depressed. I believe that it is something she might be unaware of, or something she refuses to face..  I like the quote by your father since it adresses what I think is the root of her problem. Will definitely use this the next time I have a chance to sit down and talk with her about this. Thanks alot!    Hi Reddit,  My little sister (she's 20, but I have 2 and she's the youngest, therefor my little sister) has been diagnosed with depression a couple of weeks ago.  I never saw it coming, she always was the most cheerful one out of our family of 5, has an amazing boyfriend who loves her, has tonnes of friends, popular, beautiful.. You get the picture. Because of my work, I can't be home often and she's at uni most of the time anyway.  The last time I saw her it really shocked me how sad she looked, the light always visible in her eyes seemed to have faded away, she looked tires, didn't say much.. I went out to dinner with my dad and he told me it has been declining for a while now and I can see that it hurts my parents tremendously to see her suffer like this.  Now, I went trough something simular when I was in uni but got very good at hiding it and eventually got better because I got help and decided what was worth obsessing over and what not.  I'm afraid that she will not have this strenght, she never had any major troubles in her life and I can see she's not dealing with this well at all. She is getting professional help but this can only go so far.  As her older brother, I alwasy felt like she looked up to me so my question now is, what is my best course of action? What do I do or say to help her in any way possible? Mind you, I'm able to see her or meet up with her from time to time but this is once every 2 weeks max.  I already told her I was in a simular situation, what I did to help myself and how I eventually got out. The big difference between the 2 of us is that I kinda knew what was keeping me down, **she does not know**  Only thing that we can think of is that she sets really high (unrealistic) standards for herself, is perfectionistic and does not handle the stress coming from this very well.  So Reddit, what do and what say?  Thank you so much for helping me, I'm kind of lost and it kills me to see my baby sister like this.   Source anyone?   Exactly! Plus, it would remove all the useless searching, just put in an order, decide howmuch you want to pay for it and wait.   Prices are decided by the players and supply amp;demand.. I would be so happy if they implemented this   It's so simple, use Runescape's Grand Exchange system, problem solved..   Be sure to check out stephan biniak's bootleg version aswell!! Super chill   Nice guide. One question tough, why don't you include Spirit Visage in the defensive item list? I tend to go for it quite a lot as it does wonders combined with a BT, especially when a tank of theirs has a tornmail   I like you, you're funny :D   Exactly what I tought.. I sent them an email, hopefully they'll care and fix it because there's nothing I can do with that piece of land now..   Apologies if this post looks weird, I posted it from my phone.  Now, I started a disaster and got this asba requirement to rebuilt. Do they really expect me to not rebuild untill my storage is big enough? This will take ages..:o      I'll certainly remember that, much appreciated!   I gifted you gold 3 times now, so I believe we're even :) Thanks again!   Thank you very much!! I'm on mobile now, I'll get you the gold when I get home, within 2 hrs max   Hi,  I found the following gif on the frontpage: http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2wf30j/classic_willie/ I would like somthing simular but with the name of the bear changed to 'Poeh' and the girl's name changed to 'Louise'.  The original gif is really easy to find. Willing to gif 3 months of gold to whoever can make the best/high quality gif out of this.  Thank you!   Is it possible that you asked about it in game and I answered it might be his statik? If so, we were on the same game :)   I stopped playing a while back, can someone explain me what the difference between normal and 'hard' kills are? Thanks!   I meant that I like the idea. Everyone seems to hate it before having seen it.. I think they could do some really cool things with it   All this whining.. Seems like a cool skin to me, I like it   What does he say tough?   Love you all    Quality post 10/10 420/10 with rice   She looks like she's having a stroke. A beautiful one, but a stroke none the less   2   Dude your music's amazing!! Sitting here on the train, hearing it for the first time with this stupid grin on my face..  Thank you!! I'm on my way to iTunes now    Love you too   Looking forward to see wich team we'll send home next round ;)   Anyone got a mirror? Got taken down :/   Hey, how did you get 2 flair?o.O   Amsterdam?   It's gone :( Can someone tell me what it said?   Yes   I suggest you download Tor and go browse Silkroad, alot of fake documents are being sold there.  /r/silkroad to get started! Just be sure not to get lost ;)  Edit: why downvote his question? I was never under the assumption everyone held such high moral standards here..   Glad you liked it!   Is this just fantasy?   Is this real life?   Yeah but you can get e free rock using the same method, reversed. So, free bj!   Exactly, I was in doubt wich one to answer but I got into Kendrick with GK,MC and discovered Section 80 afterwards, so yeah..   Section 80 is amazing aswell! Learn about Kendrick because of GK, MC and started searching more of him afterwards. S80 is an excellent album aswell, with a whole different story and characters but atleast as 'real'   How many sins? I'm running out. How many sins? I lose count..  Goddamn love that song, all the stories coming together in 1 track   Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D. city. It's more than an album, it's a lifestory told in the most fitting way possible  Edit: For anyone familiar with the album, so worth the read: http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=313845.0  It's, in my opinion, a very good interpretation of the album and every song by itself.   I'm afraid it might be hard to find ex-procrastinators on Reddit, they probably all got the hell out of here..   Weed wizard zilean tough..  	46

 But hey, at least I learned that I had mod mail.    How do you survive with no income?    Limbaugh.    Do it, fat boy.    a years rent maybe?   Currently sunny? Like all the episodes?    Current sunny? Like, all the episodes?    Walking your dog is weird. Man, I must be twisted.    Well, in Manhattan you do.    so it is pretty much just broadcast tv?    why do you use Hulu. I've benn thinking of grabbing it but I'm not sure why...   Yah, I don't even have any shows I used to watch on network tv. Don't even miss it. Thats why I'm wondering why I should even bother with Hulu.   But would you pay $4.99 for it. If so, I have the deal for you...   I realized that channel surfing was such a wast of time. I never found anything...or actually less than I do now that I just use Netflix/Amazon Prime.   I haven't even messed with hulu yet. I just use Netflix and Amazon Prime (barely).  When it comes to local news etc I just stream it from there site live to me tv.   Does Hulu have enough content that I should snag it up? I have no shows that I care about that are NBC/ABC/CBS etc.   just checked out your app. Sounds great but sadly I can't get a signal where I live. I've been just using the local NBC website to stream to my tv when and if I want to watch the news...but thats great what you are doing.    Right there with ya. Cheers. Going on two months as well. They would have to pay me to subscribe as well.    he must love butt sex.   Few towns over.    you forgot and also play to an arena full of people frozen in time.    Hey, when he threw the inhaler to mikey that shit was pretty noyce.   Hard Harry!!!

It's decided we're going to feed D to the walkers.    Now I've got thunderpeel stuck in my head.    Just finished a mink omelette for breakfast, smarty pants.    why 2 years? Why not now or next year? 5 years? 6 months. What is his reasoning for 2 years? Does he want people to be in poverty for 2 more years? Do you have an explanation?   when the hell did I say I wanted to keep others down? Quite a stretch.   Why does this threaten me? It really doesn't. I never said it did. I just brought up a point.    I went out with a Carly. She really was a cold bitch.    so, what about the people already making 15 an hour somewhere. You expect them to be cool with all of a sudden making minimum wage along with the burger flipper?   well, no shit. eventually it will get there.    and the people already making 15 bucks an hour?   It's a male plane.   That top comment though lol   i just died.   lets hear it for my maaayaaayayn!   whats the episode Dennis gets all mesmerized by Charlies techno dance?   Cool, thnx.    To you it's absurd...but you're not the only person on earth.    Your mom...    Bhg   Cheers. Starting tomorrow once it's not 95 degrees out.    Read that in Charlie Kellys voice.    Probably big Mac shrapnel.          they certified it not cringeworthy         Ya, why?    Peaches. Oh yeah. Where's the petition TO get her on there?       it's not ruined. I meant great whatever as in okay, she acted zany which doesnt take away from the absurdity in this video. You know when somebody tries too hard and its absurd? Why are people not getting that? Are you her son?   Bro, I want the old Benjamins back.    God dammit Deandra. You keep escalating these situations it needs to stop.    I mean...kinda I guess.    Yes, as in okay why should I know this?    great, whatever.    Watch the rest of her stuff it's just kinda how she is.    Was really going for him to visit the Jimi Hendrix one in Seattle.    Lol   Just started this last week. It's great.    Everyone needs to see Six feet Under. Best series in my opinion.    Oh, honeydew I bet you do.    Wow, that was really fucking hilarious. His manureisms really reminded me of a buddy. I have to send this to him.   It's not.    sounds very familiar.    oh my god that poor man. I felt so bad for him I just wanted to give him a pat on the back and tell him...it's probably not ever going to get any better so ya...enjoy this bowl of cheese and beans bro.   :(      I sure thought /r/NotTimAndEric would have appreciated this more than they did.

You must be thinking of a different reddit.   or a Grateful Dead sticker.   much less polluted than ever before.   actually, it kind of does. Sorry.   In Connecticut didn't know there were franchises here.    Yep, I read that in Georges voice.    30 bucks for a pint of soup?    Like, any sport?    But...they all come back...

Good to see this.    Ah, another Chester native. :)    /r/oldpeoplefacebook   I have it through my job but I personally pay 140 a month for medical and dental...well and also 401k and profit sharing. I live in Connecticut also if that means anything.    i had a colonoscopy last month. I have good insurance, not the best. I was put under (sort of) and all I got was a bill for 180. All of these recent posts about the healthcare in the US being outrageous is hilarious. While yes, it sucks here as opposed to other countries it's not nearly as bad as it comes off. I am in no way trumpeting what we have here but come on.   no, it's more than that but your buzzfeed comment gathers the upvotes lol.   i know the shortcut to screen shot but the editing tools dont let me do this. What is your go to?   man, I'm almost 3 minutes into it and I haven't even cracked a smile. What is the joke about being a kid and playing a song on a jukebox for hours on end is funny...besides the fact that it's kind of funny when you're a kid?   I digress. Why are people laughing when he says that a small town restaurant is home to kids and (transients or something)? I must have missed that part of life. I'm from a small town but...still.  I understand everyone has their own taste and I suppose mine is completely different but I am still amazed that this is the top performance on this thread. I'm seriously questioning my humor.  I mean, shouldn't Kevin Harts Long Dick at least be above this?   stay of my websit CAncvl!!!@!   buzzfeed back on reddit?   Dads rule, moms...well actually rule but you know what i'm getting at.   what dd the do?  Okay, serious for a second. I thought about this because my mother is a prime example of /r/oldpeoplefacebook material, but I'll never share it...unless it's that golden.  How dd she mke fun of herr mom  ?   Man, I love my chromebook.    I was half expecting a picture of a dog with a boner. Where did everything go wrong.       Every year people from all around the world congregate upon the small town of Deep River to play, parade, and get publicly drunk. Largest gathering of it's kind in the world at least at one point...maybe still.  Tonight is the tattoo which is just a jam session on Devitt field and usually the most drunk night of the weekend. It goes until 2 am (so you still have time) but there is a camp and generally the town is cool with people partying all around until whenever.   Tomorrow is when the parade is and the numbers really show up. It begins at 11 am. Then the rest of the day and  throughout the night again until 2 AM it rages on.   Sunday usually has another jam session in the early part of the day and putters out in the afternoon. I won't be making it this year but I thought I would send the word out to you all if your looking for something unique to check out.   If you do make it to the parade tomorrow be sure to look out for the Ancient Mariners. They have a guy chained up who they drag along as they drink heavily, beat the guy up, and shoot off cannons.    helo ? i ddnt sa helo. cancl!!!4!   Hackers bro.    Yep. Hey! Why don't you get off your lazy ass and just borrow money from your parents.     lol. I don't even recall that one but no its not where it began. ;)    Lol. Nice throwback. Do you know why I was told to fuck off? Gold if you do.    Like a child entering a conversation they know nothing about?       That sucks. My ex works in the public schools in New Haven and she always mentioned how awesome it was that Yale offered this for free. But kicking geriatrics out of a museum? Lol just kidding. I'm not that far from you.      where did the ball come from?   oh man. that so reminds me of being a kid. thanks for that. hours and hours outside doing cool bad shit.    /r/instantbarbarian? Can we start that?   kicked out? Wow. That's extreme.    Colbert joke?    what if I just have a naturally large nose?   I'm using a Griffin to go into my ipad. My electric guitar has been working just fine for months. I bought an acoustic pick up for my nylon. I got it all set, plugged her in and when I try to go to turn the monitor on it doesnt seem to recognize it...sort of. I can see the light turn green so it's getting a signal but I dont have the option to turn the monitor on like when I use my electric. It is just giving me the option to use in interapp device. anyone know whats going on?  I have also posted this in ipadmusic but thought I would check here as well.

If you happen to have netflix can you go to season 1 episode 6 at about 29:00 and do you know who it is? It definitely has an Irish feel with the fiddle etc but the rhythm not so much. I've noticed that all episodes dont seem to list these songs. Maybe it's just a composer who does filler songs for the show I dont know.    Like cutting your arm off?

Oh my god   cool. she answered my question in that ama as well.         ...with the sounds of the Griswolds...   I'm speechless. I never knew of this thing but of course it exists because I made some random 10 foot back pack comment and it seriously looks like it 10 ft. hilarious. thank you.   But...

 Fat cat, you say?      Prefect meal for later   That's not it?   Come on Jacky boy, we go a go.   ITT, redditors have girly hands.  Maybe the girl just works out.   He's 19. I'm going to guess, no.   I had an ex do me one better. We had a birthday, anniversary, Christmas happening 3 consecutive months.   I bought her a flatscreen tv, 2 purses (LV   Coach), a bed room set, took her on a snowboarding trip to mammoth, bought her full snowboard, boots, bindings, clothing for the trip.   She waits until after NYE to break up with me because we had plans to go to Vegas.  I spoke with a close friend after, who told me my ex was cheating on me for about a year, but my friend didn't want to say anything to me because she thought I looked happy, and she didn't want to be the one to break up a happy relationship.  Yay me.   Americans are terrible at geography.   I have a few British friends and at first I would talk politely with them and, to me, it would sound like they were being polite with me.  But they would laugh to themselves at certain things they would say. Or after I said certain things.  After a while I came to realize that they were making fun of me and I had not even realized it. The sarcastic fucks!   Some of the slang they used were unfamiliar to me, so that could have made things more difficult for me to understand.  Needless to say, we get along better, but I know them for the sarcastic, wankers they really are.   OP, we found the culprit.   Came here, saw the comment, and face palmed.

These bigger names are obviously more well known which means they have a bigger fan base. Even if that fan base has only "heard of" them.  I'm sure there will be some proper underground djs there as well, but they definitely won't be announced with these "headliners."   Quit being so jaded. I'm jaded as fuck and so far, I think the lineup is good. No misses yet.   If you can get a used SX for $600, it's a good deal.  I'd spring for an SX2 if it's not too much more.

You can take any and all song requests all night.  Things you need:  - Djay app   - Spotify premium  - Apple computer or laptop  - Reliable internet connection  - Compatible hardware controller  If you already have cdj 2000nxs and a mixer, you're good to go. If not you can buy an inexpensive controller, like the Pioneer DDJ-WeGO3 which is about $300. (You can always return it after the gig)  Good luck and have fun! Remember, the night isn't about you or your ability to dj, it is about the bride   groom, and what their guests want to hear.   In the heat of the moment, all that rational thinking goes out the window.   Try this shit in the hood and you'll get your head stomped in.   ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?   Carbs one meal is not going to kill you.  On the other hand, if they're a close friend, I don't see why explaining that you don't eat carbs would be a big deal.   We did it Reddit!   Is that chicken fresh or frozen?   The SX is a great unit but you'll need to spin from a laptop with Serato. You can't use rekordbox with the SX.  The CDJs can be used stand alone with a mixer.

When the CEOs priority is making more money this 3 months than last 3 months, and they won't be there in 5 years, they won't care about no one being able to buy things then   sociopathic would be a better fit. "a person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience."   That was the point.  He played a sociopath.  No conscience, just do what you want to do.    If you look closely, every time you see his bed at his apartment, it looks as if it's never been touched, only there for decoration.  He never sleeps.  He looks up stuff all day on the internet for things he's interested in, and then out all night looking for things to film.   I thought it was pretty subtle and clever way of showing how abnormal he was beyond the actual character.    Mine is about the same, except I run the Michelin Super Sports.  I'll get 30-40k miles on them and when I went to the track, I was able to get them so sticky that I was picking up chunks of rubber from other cars and they would be melted to the tire.  I was passing Porsche's, SRT8's, RX-8's and even a Z06.  Worth every penny.   I did that last year, but still paid near double for just one day.     "injury or disease/disability" -- they wouldn't choose this. Nobody chooses to be disabled.   "Is it so strange to then consider those agreements as decisions made by two people, not just one?"   You work, I stay home.  We both agree to this.  However, it's implied that if we get divorced, your mutual agreement with this arrangement means that I won't have much in the way of making money on my own, so as long as I'm are ok with that. Deal.     I understand the argument when kids are involved, kids cost a retarded amount of money in child care otherwise.    But I'm still talking strictly about divorces where you have to pay for your lay about spouse to do nothing.   I'll seconds this.     Give me three reasons that a person, without kids, would choose to stay home and "incur the risk of never being financially solvent again if I ever decide to leave you".  In today's world, there is no reason a person NEEDS to be a stay-at-home [whatever].  They choose to.  They can get a job like everyone else, or don't get divorced.     I never mentioned kids were involved did I.  Just talking about the marriage in general.  I think someone might be projecting a little.   If you can't afford kids, don't have them.     I'm sure replacing it with [this](http://www.zspeedperformance.com/ZSpeed-HD-Concentric-Replacement-Clutch-Slave-Cylinder-CSC-zsp2006.htm) will be way cheaper than what I had to go through.   This part was recommended to me by the guys at stillen.   but then where would those people park?   I had my slave cylinder fail taking with it the master cylinder, clutch, and flywheel.   So now that that's all replaced with upgraded parts, the only issue I seem to have is if I go from 4th to 6th, it'll grind 1/2 the time.  So I just have to shift to 5th then 6th quickly.

The business seems to be leaning towards contract employers such as Lancaster that is basically a express personnel but for scientists.

We closed up on Thursday and then we screened both wild wild west THEN south park.  Left the theater around 6am still laughing our asses off and amazed at what we had just watched.  We went from a silly, almost stupid western (I enjoyed it, but it's just like...meh and this before steam punk was really even a thing) to the most brazen self parodied cartoon of all time.  We were fans of South Park, but we still weren't prepared for how over the top it was.   http://i.imgur.com/r0Iok7W.gif   1.5 MM (3/50^th of an inch) margin of error on that shot placement on the ball.

Wow, all good pointers  * I've had people figure this out, but it's good to mention early * I think I have a good handle on that * This tends to happen naturally with this crowd (at least the ones I know.  * Yeah, this one I think will be the hardest part * Might be good to do if it needs to be a shorter game. * I think I'll start by having some of the more benign roles in there to get people aware of how this game works.  Does anyone know a list of premade roles for around that size of games outside the ones in the rule book?  I'd like some boiler plate setups and mod it from there.   I have a group of people that want me to come in and moderate a few games of Werewolf on Wednesday.  I needs some cool ideas for game setup/roles/etc, and also tricks for moderating such a large group of people 1/2 of which I don't know.  I've only done 10-15 people at most.  I would assume table/seating arrangements are key to keep an eye on who people are indicating at night so I don't get it wrong.  Also folded paper with their names written on them so I can write  their roles down if I randomly hand out the cards.  Let me know what role make ups would be good. I would assume that we would have 2-3 games total since we only have a 2 hour window set up for a surprise gaming/birthday lunch for one of the people.  I'm assuming 1/2 of them haven't played before so I'll need a not-to-complicated game to start, then add in more interesting cards/factions in the later games.  Looking forward to the suggestions (or where to find them)   Exactly right. Know what you want, know that you can get it, then JUST DO IT!   It's only superstitious if it doesn't work   Kinda.  As long as you know the pills will work, it usually will.  Attitude and perspective have healed people with seemingly terminal diagnosis and also killed those with survivable conditions.  Whether you think can or can't... You're right   Two things:  1. The richest person isn't the one who has the most, but needs the least.   2. It's only silly if it doesn't work.  I follow a modified version of this thinking and it has worked for me.    The key is to **KNOW** that everything's going to work out.  It may not happen exactly as you planned, but everything works out.  I found the absolute perfect wife after the worst girlfriend.  I just pictured my perfect person for me, made a theoretical checklist in my head, and I KNEW she was out there.  My friends all chuckled and said "good luck with that".  6 months later we met and she added things to that list that I didn't think were possible, all in a small city.  Married 18 months later, 2 years since and this entire time we've never even had an argument.  We needed to move but wanted to buy a house in the new location.  Lots of hoops and paperwork later, we miraculously qualified for a loan and had the down payment all saved up in 3 months.  The bank wouldn't use my main income.  It's the perfect house with everything we wanted, because we KNEW that we would get it.   The job she got that made us move and buy the house was getting shut down next year, a week after we got the keys to said house.  We KNEW that this wasn't a big deal.  We explored several options over the next 6 months.  None of those panned out.  Then a friend said to check out this free, women only, year long computer programming boot camp.  They only take 24 people, but it's worth a shot.  I read the qualification requirements and KNEW she would get in.  They had 900 people look at the program, 500 applied, 60 interviewed, and she was one of the 24 that got in. The jobs that this camp trains you for starts at 50% more that what she was getting with her biochemistry degree.  There are tons more examples that I could give that this kind of thinking works for me.  All these that I've mentioned have been in the last 3 years.  This could be a really long string of luck, but I've always seemed to get what I want.  I just know that I'll get it and it'll work out, eventually.  As such, I'm perfectly happy all the time.  What's to be mad about when you know everything will work out?  It's like a lite version of [ataraxia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataraxia)  I'm not say that nothing bad ever happens.  Shitty things happen all the time.  I've gotten sick, been hospitalized, needed surgery on a few occasions, but I knew I was going to be fine.  The difference is your perspective.  If you have a good outlook, even in the worst scenarios, things tend to work out eventually.  You also have to be proactive in doing the things you need to do to get what you want.  You can't just lie in bed and think about having buckets of money.  You do have to actually go out there and get it.  I could think about winning the lottery all day long, but I'll never win if I don't go out and buy a ticket.  In the end this can all be scientifically disproven and I've just been getting lucky over a long string of time, but this is the closest I'll ever come to any form of religion/theology.  Just like all religion, you shouldn't knock it if it's working for those that follow it and aren't hurting anyone else.

Depending on the places you are going, you can cache a section of the map in Google maps.     I think I found an amazon seller that sells the US versions for like $15-$20 more.  Still wont have a warranty, but it's better than double the price.  It's a real pain in the neck to sift through all the china dealers on Amazon and eBay.    one more thing on buying the cameras.  Everywhere I've looked, it's a bunch of asian stores selling on Amazon or eBay.  I've read that these guys sell "hacked" versions of the cameras with English menus.  You can tell by the instructions and packaging that it comes in.  There have been reports of these cameras having spyware or "phone home" abilities that compromises your network allowing people to get in that you don't want to.  Where do you get the official products in the US?   Ok, good info. Thanks.  Off to the internet to get parts and wiring in order.   Right on.  Thanks for all that.  One clarification though.  I have an older i7-920 that's overclocked that I don't really use much.  I'm sure that I can get this to be the dedicated NVR without issue.  What I'm wondering is can my main desktop that I use all day for work and gaming be used for the NVR without slowing it down.  It's a i7-4770k @4.4ghz with 16GB of ram, and 5+TB of storage available.  It'd be nice to just tab over to the security software and see the live feed when needed instead of going to the other computer.   You could say that Leeloo and the "darkness" were the hero and the villain.  They certainly never meet.  The rest of the characters are just helping one or the other.

Once autos (robot drivers) are commonplace, I hope getting a driver's licence is way harder and you have to demonstrate more than just basic vehicle operation and rules of the road.  That way the limits for humans would be raised or eliminated.   Currently, just because you have a licence doesn't mean you know how to drive   I'm perfectly comfortable cruising at 100-110 or more in my car on a clear road.  I wish we had autobahn style interstates in the US.     Sure thing.  What cameras do you have?  How much space do you use?  Is it a spare computer or just part of your main desktop?  How well does the motion tracking alert work?  Any trouble getting remote viewing/playback to work while away from the house?  I don't get good WiFi signal on the outside of the house where I would want to put the cameras, so I'd have to invest in another WiFi extender.  Or I could just get a poe switch and try to run cat5 to the locations as well.    Trying to weigh the cost vs convenience of both options.   All but 10 years in the pnw.

 In the end, some idiots will buy it. Reminds me of the USB-C Apple made, a guy built a universal adapter for it and made [$800K+ on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back) off their stupidity.       Makes sense, what about Facebook?   Yea I don't like their new design    Printrbot Play  Thanks for the info.!      Shit! I wanna get something for the office and we are also launching a contest so I wanna provide 3D printers as the top prizes. If you have $700, would you get 2 of [those](http://printm3d.com/)?    What's the alternative then? Trying to get one for less than $200, what do you think of this [one](http://q3dprinter.com/oneup.htm)?   Makes sense now! Lima [shipped after 2 years](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/21/lima-finally-ships-its-dropbox-alternative-to-its-kickstarter-backers-sort-of/)!    I think you missed some useful Arduino shields  * [Wifi Shield](http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-WiFi-Shield/dp/B00MEKEBXG) * [Smartphone Shield](http://1sheeld.com) * [Proto Shield](http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Proto-Shield-R3-Assembled/dp/B007QXTRNA) * [Relay Shield](http://www.amazon.com/4-Channel-Relay-Shield-for-Arduino/dp/B007JOEVNW) * [Motor Shield](http://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Motor-Shield-R3/dp/B006UTE70E) * [Xbee Shield](http://www.amazon.com/arduino-org-Arduino-Xbee-Shield/dp/B004L6PNLA)   Interesting! Do you any any good 3D printers available in the market for under $200?   Makes sense, we had accepted pre-orders after our campaign cause we had extra stock in the manufacturing run anyways, but yea you're right, nothing harmful comes if you collect e-mails and send out when you are ready.   That's a great insight, thanks a lot for sharing!   Great analysis Dan, I agree of course on putting your backers first, but you can actually accept pre-orders in a good by charging the customer instantly through [Grandst](https://grandst.com/). When we ran our [1Sheeld Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/integreight/1sheeld-replace-your-arduino-shields-with-your-sma), we accepted pre-orders afterwards, shipped to our Kickstarter backers first, then pre-orders, then got it on Amazon and in retail. It's an interesting approach though as we are launching another product soon and it makes sense to fulfill your Kickstarter orders first then worry about other orders, I'll consider it in plan :)   Yea I read that, my first thought is to encourage backers who have doubts to pledge and not wait for retail. Still you can accept pre-orders and announce a late shipping date, right?     I'm trying to buy a couple of Tiko3D printers for the office, it's a $179 3D printer and hit well on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tiko3d/tiko-the-unibody-3d-printer), and I was surprised to find they are not accepting pre-orders on their [website](http://www.tiko3d.com/), any thoughts on why are they NOT making money?   Nice list, I recommend [Android Community ](http://androidcommunity.com/) as well   Nice!

 roughly 20 years ago I wrote a paper for a college class comparing American worker productivity with European worker productivity.   Obviously I don't remember details, but the gist of it was something like *our own* Department of Labor's studies say that European workers are more productive than American workers, despite being worked "to death"   So, I have this odd thing ... I've never been a massive salad fan and I'm usually disappointed by them in restaurants and rarely eat them at home, but if you get me in an office cafeteria salad bar I go absolutely crazy. I just love it when they have like 70 different ingredients to choose from, and I'll basically choose them all. Chickpeas, brocolli, cauliflower, carrot, jalapenos, black olives, green olives, banana peppers, kidney beans, and more.   They get pricey, and sometimes they get so large I can barely finish them, but I love them.  And honestly jalapenos on a salad is great.    *Of course you can.* I think you've missed the point of my comment.    Needs more flags.  And some mention of gun rights.    yeah, putting alcohol in your alcohol seems to be distinctly American.  Besides, it's not like Jameson needs something to help it down... it's smooth like butter.    I did 8 guinesses and 8 jamieson's in about an hour and a half once.  I had been practicing though.    I can't remember where or find the post, but someone asked about meatballs. [This is a phenomenal recipe] (http://www.food.com/recipe/authentic-italian-meatballs-92095).   I just do one extra thing - I brown them in olive oil first, to the point where they develop a slight "crust" on them.   Absolutely amazing recipe, I swear it's difficult to not eat half of them right out of the pan.     Today I chose to finish them in sauce for pasta, but every time I make these I wish I had cleaned out the freezer first and made a whole freezer's worth.   If you're still buying frozen meatballs, stop it.  Just make this recipe once and you'll never buy frozen meatballs again.        oh, I misinterpreted.   Yeah, she had something else going on than and your being vegetarian was just an outlet for it.    you took a zero in New York CITY ?  Seems very contrarian to the spirit of the hike ... is that common ?   I think alot of it is just machismo.  I used to say that salad isn't food, it's what food eats.    Uhm, if I were say stuck in a cabin with vegetarians for a week, and NOT from a mixed household I think I would get frustrated at a lack of meat.  Especially if most meals featured fake meats (I love fruits and veg, but never found a fake meat I liked).  She just sounds like a bitch though.   Edit: let me explain that first sentence a bit ... not trying to insinuate that a week with vegetarians is a sentence, but if you're an omni, and I'm guessing particularly in the US, you're probably used to a good deal of meat in your food.  Like breakfast, lunch dinner.  If you converted to vegetarianism than you probably know what I mean.   If you aren't prepared for a week of pure vegetarian meals, this can be a big change.  And, if you eat like I used to, you may literally not even appreciate vegetables and fruits.. so suddenly going "cold turkey" especially if you aren't prepared for it could be tough.      She still sounds like a bitch though.    That dog is wearing a Sunnydress !    sometimes it's amazing what actually works.    my bathrooms were both tiled directly on top of drywall, not even greenboard, nothing but thinset to seal it and it lasted 40 years.  when I demo'd one to rebuild it the drywall was perfect (I was rebuilding it for other reasons)   This is good life advice in general.    Regarding sleep ... this was a big problem for me.  My early 20's was spent learning how to ignore my body ... ignore that pain, ignore that need for sleep and created serious sleep issues that carried over for a long, long time.  My civilian career choice and lifestyle of burning the midnight oil didn't help one bit either, but I'll tell you honestly you don't realize how much relatively minor but long-term sleep dep fucks with you until it ends.  I'm not talking going 48 without sleep (we've all bt,dt I'm sure) but I mean just like getting 6-8 hours of sleep but very poor quality, for months or years at a time.     And friends and family - yes you have to MAKE time.  Especially once you get a busy civilian life going.  I like literally schedule lunches and beers with folks just to stay caught up.    No, you shouldn't have to worry about taking AT off, but I think it's good that you do... as a civilian you're in the real world, and if you want to compete effectively in the carer and workplace you need to think about stuff like "hey, am I staying competitive".        Yeah, this really does happen.    It's definitely an old adage, but seriously, they actually make color charts out of it? WTF.  Like someone's gonna be like "hey, who's between 5 and 6 ... ok you guys in the amber to tan range drink an extra half quart".     I'm pretty impressed that my son actually walked to the library after school and came home with a bunch of classic movies.  Yeah, we're totally wired, probably 4 different subscription streaming services plus FIOS, but he's learning to appreciate that there's gratification beyond the "instant"   Well, I guess it depends on what you mean "that side" or your tolerance for commuting.  I'm by the Mall, so Dobbin and Snowden are one in the same to me, and we're back and forth a couple times a day it seems.   lack of a tub is very limiting, but it's the lot that hung me up.  I don't know the NC market, but that lot is highly unusual.   Completely agree ... a 2.5 cut just tells me the owner is dead set on overpricing it.    if I ever went to Manchester I'd be far too busy harassing the locals about Smiths history to bother eating.     I would call both Liberty and Costco reasonably priced fuel.  I avoid Exxon.    the UK does have some great Indian food.  I remember dining at some higher end place in London once, down in zone 1 or 2, it was completely different than here in the States and mind bogglingly good.  I guess you guys *are* the original exporters of Indian food.   So basically you can sub squash for zucchini in most recipes ? Didn't realize that - definitely creates more potentional.  Thanks !      Really ? Had no idea there's so much back there.      Hmm.  Depending on how well the veggies were cooked and the kind of dish they were in I don't think that would actually bother me too much, especially if I'm like gorging on indian food for 10 bucks.    I hear Parampara stopped making tandoori massala. Is that true ? It was my favorite ... why'd they stop making it ?    I'm also willing to bet that they monetize that data externally.   oh that sounds fantastic.       honestly don't know what kind ... wife planted them, not me.   I just want to make sure we use it before it goes bad.     yeah if you're back in gateway it's kind of slim pickings to speak... I don't know if a giant gas station complex is the right answer though. I would favor more opportunities for local Mom and Pops myself ...    yeah, that's my thinking.    32629  I'd be underwater and living off savings alone within the first month at that rate.    thanks, Maverick is a go to in the smoking world as well.  I think I'm set on Thermoworks now though ... I really do want a kind of "guaranteed to always work" / buy it for life" type one... thermometers aren't something I want to put effort into, I really want to be able to take it completely for granted at all times.    So we planted a couple squash seedlings earlier in the year and before you know it we have WTF large squash... like over a foot long.  We've literally never seen squash like this - they're easily four, five times bigger than any we've gotten in stores.  I'm thinking of making a chili out of one of them, perhaps along with some zuke and firmer meated veges to add more texture.  I don't want to waste the novelty of having a ridiculously large squash by just chopping them all up though.  Any ideas on what we could make that would keep them somewhat preserved in their shape ?   Stuffing one has already come to mind, for sure, but looking for other ideas as well.     A squash boat of something ?    also middle eastern, never liked eggplant.  Baba ghanoush be damned.    WOW! Just the ability to have freshmade naan at home is worth it.  I HATE packaged Naan !    I have made a few dishes with MDH's buryani massala at home, and then shortly after tried a new Indian restaurant and I *swear* they used MDH.  It has some very distinctive components to it that are rather unmistakeable.   Out of curiosity do you think it's rather standard for restaurants to use packaged massalas instead of making their own ?   The dish itself was still much better than I can make at home, but I was a bit surprised - not offended or put off mind you - to realize it was prepackaged massala.   I guess it's just not economically viable to have someone making a million different spice blends in the kitchen every week.    by comparison, my CA membership for the entire family, package plan plus (the whole enchilada) was 100 a month   With direct access to Snowden.    http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-royal-farms-stay-story.html    End of thread right there.  Nothing more needed.   Biggest "secret" in the area.    helicopter bidet  I don't know about the Corps but I'm guessing the Army nomenclature for this would be "A Bunch of Privates"   [Serious]  I've eaten a ton of Indian food, although all in the US and UK and I'm not Indian.    I have eaten "bizzare" food that's kind of "shock value" like in the movie. I've eaten ant eggs, grasshoppers and other bug stuff in Mexico, and I ate the head of a goat also in Mexico.  This is all currently available in some quite popular restaurants there.   In Cairo I ate brain of something- it was 20 years ago and I don't remember what or which part of town it was.   Never in Indian cuisine though have I heard of anything like what's in that movie ... I'm sure it's all for effect to enforce the "exoticism" of travelling overseas.  Another common mechanism for this is the "market place" ... you'll notice there's a recurring them in movies of showing crowded noisy marketplaces with all sorts of bizzare things for sale.  In the Carribean you can get ox tail soup.  In other parts of the world there are other equally unusual foods such as fried scorpions, fried frogs etc, but I've never come across or heard of anything quite like that movie.   Edit: the weird foods I've eaten were not created for shock value; they are very traditional foods for that region... we chose to eat them more for experimentation and their "shock value".   they should make pre-moistened helicopter wipes    I think the thermapen will be in my future.  I don't engage in much candy (yet !?) although I like to make marshmallows for the holidays... but lately I've been thinking of toffee, so maybe I need to make the leap !    I've heard of the thermapen before and always thought it wasn't necessary to spend that quite of money on thermometers ... but I was always not cooking stuff right either ;)  For right now my "instant" read - which absolutely is not as good as the thermopen - does the job for me... the only time I actually use  it is when smoking barbeque which is an incredibly temperature tolerant technique.    thanks all, this thread convinced  me to get the ChefAlarm.  I could  use  it while smoking barbeque as well.    thank you - seems like Thermoworks is serious about their products.   I'll give them a whirl.   Not to suggest a loss of empathy or humanity, but if you're in any role at all on a trauma team one really can't afford to get hit by the feelz while working.  Not a job I could do.    For a baguette you can scoop out some of the breading, making a little hollow on each side.    I've never eaten a lot of couscous, but with a grain dish like that I bet some roasted bell and just transparent fried onion would be quite nice.   Perhaps even roasted corn.    bingo.  I found a great meatball recipe online and made it even better by searing them first.  It really does change the flavor for the better.  I just pan fry them in a bit of olive oil, let them get a bit of a crust to them and then transfer them to the sauce.  They're to die for.    I just got burnt by an eight dollar candy thermometer.   Any recommendations on a reliable, truly well made (not just well made for mass produced crap) that will work accurately and confidently for years to come ?  I intend to use it for both frying and candy making ... or perhaps I should have two specialized thermometers ?   Edit: Hey everyone, thanks for the great comments.  Seems like ThermoWorks is the brand to go with and has a couple great choices as well ... Dot, ChefAlaram, ThermaPen ... decisions decisions. I've seen their stuff in the past but never thought I needed to invest in a thermometer until this commodity one I used last night ruined dinner... so a ThermoWorks is in my future.  Im going to keep them in mind for gifts for my buds who cook as well.  Thank you  !   Nope, but I'll be in northern Maine in a few weeks ... think it's made it's way down there ?    Borers was always the draw for me there as well.  In the 80's and early 90's the mall seemd to have more appeal, then became full of just weird shops.  I never really thought they had a solid theme going, then when the Dave and Busters came in I really thought it was getting weird.     Call Of Duty: Rockville      Someone in Australia should start bringing awareness to this.  Perhaps through music, or a political party.    Hey folks,   I used to work on my VW diesel alot and was lucky in that there were a lot of "speciality" companies and sites that just focused on VW's and TDI's specifically.   Made getting quality parts, fluids, tools a lot easier.  Now I have this Sienna I have to maintain and don't know a thing about ... are there companies and websites other than dealers that just focus on Toyota ?     yeah, and I think it's already cooked, and there's no tissues to break down, so no real low and slow necessary. I'm gonna give it a try - thanks for the tip !    this chart is missing my all time favorite: roasted red bells.    any clue what the smoke time is per pound ? realizing this isn't /r/smoking ...   i was raised on homemade humous.  Im ok just buying the costco stuff, but i have one relative who still makes her own and yeah, you can definitely tell the difference.    tahini is a critical ingredient in a lot of middle eastern foods.    hell I smoke all the time ...of all the crazy shit I've smoked I've never thought of smoking bologna ....AND off to the deli counter.   Yes, it was in south america where I had it... ironically there was an Irishman across the table from me who informed me what I was enjoying so much.    On my left is a long piece of door trim that I'm probably supposed to be putting up instead of wasting time on this site.  This stuff is only about a half inch thick ... it's too spindly to be useful in a 7 foot length like this, so I think I would break it into three pieces: First break it in half - use that half length piece with a sharpened end as a stand off weapon, then take the second half and break them into quarters, and use them as beating weapons; they're be shorter and sturdier.  I could also sharpen them and use them as stabbing weapons.      Definitely not the ideal weaponry, but it's the best I can think of with this.  FUN GAME OP !      SEA MONKEYS.  THOSE FUCKING LIARS.   in my case I had tried it before knowing what it was, and was surprised to find I liked it so much.  But yes, when I first learned of black pudding I had no desire at all to try it... live and learn.     Fried bologna sandwhiches.  Used to eat those all the time.  There's a place in Nashville you can still get them at !    haven't had pudding but  I've had sausage.  It's surprisingly good.    I like to to [rub on the butt] (http://i.imgur.com/GFERXY4.jpg).   harem of kids  Phrasing ...    I really can't stand it when people walk as a group slowly in a rank, taking up all sorts of space and holding people up, particularly in airports where clearly everyone has somewhere they need to get too.  Either switch to a file and make some room, or at least walk quickly.      Chubby hubby, of course !    You nailed it OP. As you get older, you start paying off that physical debt you acrued when you were younger.    Don't stick around to talk to people or accept congrats. Take off.  or, if you're like me, shake like a leaf for about ten minutes afterwards as the adrenaline wears off and you realize wtf just happened.    I think a big part of good training is to make the responses instinctive and routine, as opposed to "shit, this just happened, what do I do ?"    I've always been amazed that we don't include at least basic first aid in a national curriculum, like attach it to drivers licensing or something.    bystanders effect is real.  I've witnessed it myself in a couple emergencies :(   That's why you're trained to actually POINT to someone and say "YOU call 911 now", not "somebody call 911".        yeah, it's completely different stressed on your feet and shoes:)    I haven't found running shoes to be very good for anything *but* running.  Mine at least really excel at forward motion, but the second I ask them to do anything else it becomes obvious they weren't made for that.   they also aren't going to handle abrasions, spills, lateral movements, standing etc very well.   but still, panel separation in a few weeks sounds abnormal either way ... you should probably take them back to Lukes, be polite and chill of course but inquire what they think the usual  lifespan is.  If you liked the fit of those shoes tell them ... but also tell them that you do need shoes to work in as well.     tl;dr: the solution for a bad pair of 120 shoes isn't a 60 pair.    Your 120 shoes shouldn't have worn out that quickly.   Are you wearing them all day, every day or just saving them for running ?  Do you seriously pronate and wore out the treads in one spot ? How many miles a week do you run ? Are you doing other athletic things in them, playing ball, etc ?  Running shoes are made for forward motion and not lateral motion, stops etc.  Instead of looking for cheaper shoes, I'd try to isolate what went wrong with these first, and even try to return them.  I haven't found actually running shoes I would trust on my feet in the 50-60 range.    In fact, I started the opposite, some cheap shoes (because seriously who the hell pays for 120 dollar sneakers, thats ridiculous right ? ) and they ended up lasting merely weeks and hurting me...I returned those, went to a running store, got fitted for actual running shoes by actual runners who knew what they were talking about.  Yes, they cost about 120 bucks but my injuries almost instantly resolved themselves, and they've already lasted three times longer than my previous shoes, and have a couple hundred miles left on them even.     thanks, I just gave it a whirl.  It actually did a surprisingly good job of pulling comps only from the equivalent neighborhood (this neighborhood is an "in the middle" one ... with much cheaper a few blocks one way, and much more expensive a few blocks the other.  But it looks like it's just scraping other public websites ... I guess since rentals probably aren't recorded transactions there isn't going to be a lot of hard data on actual numbers other than "this is what folks have been asking for in the area".   Which is good enough I suppose... I just want to make sure my maths are in the ballpark and I'm not being delusional.   thanks, do you have any idea what actual data on rentals MLS preserves ?  Like does the MLS know what rent was actually paid on something, versus what it was listed at ?    thanks man, I'll make sure I have wire leaders as well   yikes ...    Don't forget that it's another check you have to keep on writing, and it's more accounting as well.      that's a real eye opener though.  thanks for sharing.  Curious what the title defect was ?     Are there any public (free or paid) data sources of historical rent rates, vacancy times, etc ?  It's easy to see what properties sold for because there's a recorded transaction, but right now in terms of trying to figure out rent comps all I have is asking price.  thanks !    Holy shit my PSG ... I can't even begin... tell ya, different Army for sure.   seriously. shit was way simpler back in the day.   But then, shit was also kind of rowdy, so there's that.   We have a cairn terrior who's pretty famous for merely tolerating the humans he lets share his abode. Doesn't like being picked up, pretty feisty dog.  He's pretty infamous at the vet too.Took him on his first long hike though and by the end I swear he was begging me to carry him.   I picked him up and he was just exhausted, dead weight so I draped him around my neck like a mink stohl and finished the last mile *wearing* him.   thanks man I'll pick up a couple new 4 lbs and a couple new 6 and throw this old stuff out.    I didn't even think about it taking on the shape of the spool ... it would probably be a mess to cast now.  thanks man !    thanks.  alot of folks are saying change it out, I guess it is pretty cheap so I'll get some new 6 lb.  We have three rods and reels between the two of us, so I can do one of them with 4 pounds. In fact, IIRC one of them has a second spool so I can do two 6, two 4.  I hear you on the wire.... I have all sorts of stuff in that tackle box, long shank hooks, multihook leaders, etc so I'll just have to remember to use something like that.   Thanks !    Hi everyone,   I'm preparing to do some fishing with my son while on vacation, and we haven't touched any of our equipment in like 7-10 years.  Would the mono I have on the reels and in the tackle bag still be good ? It was all protected from UV but not necessarily heat and humidity (in a tackle bag in the shed).   Also, looks like I have 4 and 6 on them (according to the empty cardboard boxes I wisely also saved in the bag).  Thing that would work for shorefishing mackerels in Maine ?   There's an unused 12 pd as well.   thanks !    this.  I'm already more intrigued about tall ships than ever before.  I can only imagine the cratsmanship that goes into them.    that's right.  It's been a long time since I used one, but most libraries used too (and presumably still do) have a Community room exactly for things like this.  I would definitely want to see community oriented functions like this used to keep libraries prospering over  bars.    I think it depends on what you're looking for eh- football ? soccer ? Hockey ?  There's not necessarily a whole  lot right in Columbia itself, but there's a decent amount of teams in the overall area.   Interesting, didn't realize there was one sided coverage there. Red light runners infuriate me - I can tell you though that it was much, much worse before we got the cameras.   oh noz they got the 80 mils !    Hi,   I used Kyle's for many years.  I have quite a large yard and they cut it for years for only 45 dollars, and they would even let themselves in and out of the fence as well as move the patio furniture and trampoline for that.    Sadly I had to cut back on costs and I stopped using them, but it had nothing to do with them, and actually cut other costs first so I could keep them on.   If you're interested I"m sure I can dig up an email address for you.    I hate when that happens.  I spent years and years on speech therapy, dislexia therapy, hundreds of hours on tutoring and countless dollars on private school only to discovered my kids were goats.  On the upside our grocery bill went down dramatically.    yeah you're right !    You are gifted.  Even the pose and the expression you chose is incredibly artistic; this could easily be an old photograph of a famous actor.      Cities, states, whatever, they're both places!    Go to Walmart, get yourself a one dollar pair of flip-flops.  In the military we call them "shower shoes".   Wait, sorry, just realized you want even more than that .. sounds like what you really want is Gardening Clogs.    I took a ruck out to Colorado once on a work trip.  Put it in an A bag for safe keeping (A bags are indestructable).  Everything worked out like a charm.   Pickle free recipe here:  some pasta, some tomato, some cucumbers and some ranch dressing make a fine pasta salad.      this guys right.  check your history.  We've been at war (by various names) the vast majority of time for a very long time now.    What they SHOULD be worried about the military BRAC'ing everything out instead. Hello, couple billion dollar revenue loss.      It's s not actually a chile powder, it's actually chile.  That's it.  Dried, ground Dixon Hatch Chiles, not recipe and nothing else to it, I just covered the pork in it.       I buy the chile online from the Chile Shop in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  I discovered that shop while on a business trip and have been buying them ever since (mail order).   The hatch chile is the famous "green chile" of New Mexico (now becoming pervasive in Colorado as well, although it may not be the same chile as the famous Hatch, New Mexico variety.     Served green, it's a great, brightly flavored chile with just enough kick to satisfy a pepperhead, yet not offend those with milder palates.   In the right parts of the country it's actually pervasive in the cuisine, served as both ingredients in dishes as well as sauces as condiments. I've had the famous "green chile" in quiche, omelets and anything else you can think of.  In New Mexico specifically it's companion is Red chile, and you can order a combination of the two as "Christmas".  When dried and ground this chile takes on a completely different persona, from a milder brighter flavor to a remarkably dark, robust, earthy tasting chile that actually reminds me a bit of roasted coffee beans.  I use this chile in everything.  It plays a prominent role in my brisket rub, which I intentionally keep simple, savory and spicy.   It' also plays a smaller role however in my rib rub, which is a complex brown sugar based rub.  It goes in my chili, it goes in my blackening mix.. it has essentially replaced cayenne and ground chipotle as my go to pepper now.    The only areas I won't use it are Asian or Indian preparations, which very specifically call for their own unique heat sources.  For any SouthWestern/Mexi/TexMexi meals though it's an awesome chile.   I still eat jalapenos, both fresh and pickled.  I still love my Tabasco sauce, but for a chile powder this is my favorite by far now.    You have a funny mustache but I think your sunglasses are very *avant garde*  	114

A failure to explain their actions to a citizen, either out of malice or ignorance, does not mean a lawful order can be ignored. They are only required to justify their actions in criminal and/or civil court. Do not mistake a lack of explanation for a lack of grounds. Only refuse to identify yourself if you are absolutely certain you stand on solid legal ground. Do not attempt to stand up to police officers if you aren't equipped with enough knowledge to make a safe determination of what you're legally required to do and are prepared to endure a false arrest and charges. Any and all resistance must be passive. Never physically resist an officer (exceptions for extraordinarily extra-legal actions notwithstanding). If your rights are violated, seeking compensation will be hampered by any "bad" behavior on your part. Don't make your lawyer's job harder than it has to be.   You can't self diagnose, a lot more people would have a different prison sentence for pleading mentally insane.    What rights does she have when pulled over?

The vehicle appears to be a [MT-LBu] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MT-LBu) of some sort.  Based on a quick search of the width of an MT-LBu and the height of the average semi-trailer, it seems plausible that the MT-LBu could fit inside a trailer as shown in the picture.

The armored vehicles formed the second batch of some 230 expected as part of Washington's multi-million dollar package of non-lethal aid for Ukrainian government forces and Ukraine's State Border Guard Service.   Dozens of US paratroopers are already training Ukrainian volunteer soldiers and some USD 75 million in non-lethal aid has been pledged by America  which includes surveillance drones, first-aid kits and radar systems.  The vehicles will be equipped with Ukrainian weapons and then transferred to airborne military and Security Service units.   Literally devalues the photos and the paparazzi get upset.

He also noted that recently the Army Corps of Engineers changed "almost the entire range of technology."  "We have only a few species for which work is underway. But the main line of the new technology has already been created, adopted and available for delivery in service. Starting next year, will have a massive supply of the troops, "- said the general.

If a real roller coaster is about 100 feet high, then this roller coaster at 1/16 scale would be 2,192 feet long.  If it was 200 feet high, then at 1/33 scale it would be 4,458 feet long.   We bought 6 of the red track sets about four years ago, that's what you see in the gif.  I'm sure some people are selling individual parts online but I've never bought them like that.

I don't like surprise parties whether it's for me or for someone else.  I enjoy mysteries, such as something unknown to me that will definitely happen on an expected date, but I don't think it's fun when others purposely hide something from you.  I also dislike when someone says "I have something to tell you!"  Again, this is witholding information when they could just tell you.  I always like to stay informed...  I'm all for the suprises and adventures of everyday life but I don't think it's enjoyable when someone is plotting something to surprise you with, especially if both the information and timing is unexpected and especially if they expect you to react in a certain way.  Maybe INTJs just like to be in control or aware of situations as much as possible.

 http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/   Everyone will tell you it's a conspiracy because they're so scared of Sanders. In reality he's so far behind in polls, money, and endorsements that he's a non factor in the race. Yes I know he gets big crowds but so did Ron Paul. Unless he can show those crowds turning into actual support, polling numbers, and endorsements, he'll continue to get the coverage a distant second candidate deserves.       Again, what does the fact that he worked for that magazine have to do with his integrity?   What does that have to do with his integrity?            They poll both landlines and cell phones.      That's not how polls work.    To the left. Always to the left.       [Here you dropped this.](http://images.sodahead.com/polls/0/0/2/7/5/0/4/5/1/5249707050_tin_foil_hat.jpeg)   Yeah good point. She's up, he's down.    @Nate_Cohn: We don't very good data, but it's hard to see much evidence that Bernie has made gains over the last ~month      This poll has her up by 49, 52 without Biden.    Polls are going to jump around a lot, it's to be be expected. That's why most poll aggregate sites use an average of the last several polls to paint a better picture.    I suppose that's true, although I consider myself pretty liberal. Just not as liberal as Sanders.    No sir. Registered democrat and head of my local party.    [I like her economic plans.](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/the-four-fights/economy-of-tomorrow/)  As far as foreign affairs she got high marks for her performance as Secretary of State. I don't think there's a more qualified candidate to approach international conflicts with nuance.   And I'm not giving up. I'm not settling for Hillary. I think she's the better candidate and will make a better president. That's possible, you know.    [Last several polls in the low 40s, one in the mid 30s. This is a big jump for her.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html)    Hillary doesn't even intend to make incremental progress in any meaningful way  Sure she does. You just don't consider is "meaningful."  That doesn't mean you're objectively correct.   Sweeping change that include massive tax increases won't happen.    I choose practicality and competence over dreams. I choose someone willing to accomplish incremental change over someone who will refuse to budge unless we make a wholesale change in our government. The first will actually accomplish things. The second will rant and rave and then fade off into the sunset forgotten.    I do. I think he promises pie in the sky with no way to deliver. He knows his proposals will be expensive and that means raising taxes, but there will never be enough support to raise them in congress. You'll never get 60 senators who are far left enough and willing to risk their seats to raise taxes. He's also a "true believer" and shows no willingness to compromise or work with other legislators. All reports indicate he has no friends or allies in congress because he's so ideological that he can't get along. So all his promises are empty.   He also has no foreign policy experience and seems entirely disinterested in it, even though it's the area of policy that a president has the most impact on. A Bernie Sanders presidency is a lame duck one on the first day. He gets nothing done and voter quickly sour on him meaning he loses his reelection bid to Marco Rubio in 2020.       No 12,000 is meaningless if those numbers don't move his polls.  Ron Paul got huge crowds too. He went nowhere.    I haven't seen any attention to O'Malley nor anyone saying he's anything close to a front runner.    They've been shown to be very inaccurate though.     I literally have yet to talk to someone who A. supports Hillary, B. does so with enthusiasm instead of "well, I guess it's inevitable" fatalism, and C. maintains that enthusiasm when they learn about her main competitor.  Hi. Clarence Darrow. Nice to meet you.   Also internet polls are terrible.    And I'm positive if he suddenly starts picking up steam and gaining in polls he'll get more coverage.    Nope.    Because his turnout at events does not show up in polls.    People that are plugged in and aware and just think she's a better candidate? Honestly people can disagree.    Has anyone considered that he might get less coverage because he's a distant second in polls, in money, and in endorsements? Like maybe there's no conspiracy. Maybe the media sees the writing on the wall and is focusing on the nominee that is overwhelming likley to win.       Monmouth came out with a Republican Iowa poll today, so it's likely they'll have a Democratic Iowa poll tomorrow.   Where's that poll?   Link to that poll?       Also, his foreign policy isn't really a weakness, but he'll struggle to show experience against Hillary.     The latest poll in Iowa has him down 43 points. In no way shape or form is even close to a tie with Hillary.    You're saying someone who was in the house for the majority of that time, which does not approve treaties or vet ambassadors, and never served on a foreign affairs committee, has more experience in foreign affairs than a former Secretary of State?   People support most of the ACA but if you put it up for a popular vote it would almost certainly lose. Identity politics is king. People vote for the whole package. They hear socialist and say, no thanks.    Are you kidding? There was a just a poll last month that 53% of Americans would never vote for a socialist.    Still trying to talk about how he's not the bad kind of socialist. He would start a general election campaign in the hole.    The issue is Americans don't like socialists. Most Americans would never vote for one. Sanders starts already behind because he admits he's socialist-now he has to try and explain to those in the middle that he's a special kind of socialist, not the scary kind.    That's still a socialist. You're trying to add nuance to it that the voters are unlikely to buy. Trying to explain how he's a special kind of socialist won't wash.    Obama can and rightly did deny that he was a socialist. That's why the attacks didn't derail his campaign.   Sanders admits he's a socialist. He can't deny it.    So of the tiny number of people that this happens to, less than half of them are accidents. The rest of the millions of parents in the country manage to not leave their kids in the car.    That doesn't say it can happen to anyone. It says when it does happen about 40% of the time it's an accident.       What makes New Hampshire the most important? Several candidates from both parties have won NH and then gone on to lose the nomination. [Also Sanders could win there and lose everywhere else.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bernie-sanders-could-win-iowa-and-new-hampshire-then-lose-everywhere-else/)   You really think his wife said that sanders can't be bought and neither can she? That seems like something a real person would do?      Polls randomly dial landlines and cell phones and ask questions to obtain a representative sample. Of course people who are 18 or who don't vote frequently get polled.    No one here actually believes this right?   There's a big difference between 16 points behind and 40 points behind.    The general election isn't for 16 months. *The primary* starts in a little over 6 months. Big difference.    [The majority of Americans will not vote for someone who describes themselves as a socialist.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/poll-voters-socialist-atheist-catholic-119273.html)   [Now you're just making stuff up. McCain had double digits leads in the summer of 2007](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-192.html)    Your arguments against Sanders are basically little more than "he's not the frontrunner at this point".  It goes well beyond not a front runner. Scott Walker is not a front runner but is only a few points behind. Sanders is 40 points behind. That's a huge difference.    People are fucking sick of the billion dollar machines, and are getting really pissed off about them.  Is that why Clinton has huge leads everywhere?   What works in Vermont will not work across the country. People don't like socialism   You're missing the point that he *admits* he's a socialist.  Obama can and did deny that he was a Kenyan, that he was a socialist, that he was a Muslim.  He could deny all these things because they weren't true.  Sanders has a political belief that is anathema to a majority of Americans and he can't deny it.     What could genuinely said to be socialist?  Sanders himself.  He admits he's socialist.  Socialism is poison to a candidate.    None of these things imply shit all, really.  Except people like Nate Silver have shown that they *do* show shit all.  Even this early, a poll deficit of that magnitude is very indicative of who will win.  Those reasons that you yourself listed above are exactly why he stands little to no chance.  It's not mindless repetition, its a substantive list of factors that show exactly why Sanders is very unlikely to win.      You can easily get labeled a conspiracy theorist for talking about these sorts of tactics  Because when you make these claims without any proof that's exactly what you sound like.  But they happen a lot in the US.  And what is your proof?    There is a difference between "polling low" in the sense of "Hillary currently is dominating most of these demographics" and "polling low" in the sense of "minorities disapprove of Bernie Sanders". A very, very large difference.  What's the difference?  A low poll is a low poll.  There seems to be this attitude among Sanders supporters that if only one could hear the holy words of Saint Sanders they would instantly be converted.  There seems to be this denial that someone could know all there is to know and still not support him.    Nobody's ever given any evidence of that besides for lists of other people saying the same thing.  Lists of people who making a living being accurate in their predictions.  And the fact that he consistently trails in national polls by 40+ points.  And the fact that huge numbers of Democratic office holders endorse Hillary and none have endorsed Sanders.  And the fact that he has far less money.  And the fact that only one insurgent campaign has ever worked, and that was Obama, and he has far more money, more endorsements, better polling numbers, and a much better relationship with the African American electorate than Sanders.  And the fact that the majority of his policies that poll favorably Hillary agrees with.  And the fact that he polls far behind in Iowa, South Carolina, Florida, and many other early primary states.  And the fact that Hillary has barely started campaigning, and hasn't held any large rallies.  And the fact that she has a huge lead on him in organization, with dozens of field offices and paid staffers in important states.  538 essentially said if he wins, everything we know about primary elections is wrong.  There's no conspiracy among Clinton staffers here.  All the evidence we currently see show he has little to no chance of winning the primary election.   I think if you have to rely on a massive, collusive conspiracy theory to explain your candidates lack of popularity you're already conceding defeat.   Ron Paul used to gather huge raucous crowds too. He went nowhere.     If establishment media, the ones who produce these polls - WasPo, NYT, Wall St. Journal, Fox - weren't actively trying to diminish Sanders' campaign then I would agree would you.  Now you're venturing into tin foil hat conspiracy territory. There's no concerted effort to push down your candidate just like there wasn't one for Ron Paul. He gets less than 20% in national polls. He's behind in all states. Clinton leads by 40 points. He's a distant second and thus isn't going to get a front page story on the NYT everyday. The newspapers pay a polling firm to poll for them. These firms make their money by being accurate; they're hired by candidates, PACs, business, etc. They'd go out of business.    They're alive dammit!   You're falling into the same trap as the republicans in 2012. You're trying to "unskew" the polls because they don't say what you want. As it turns out the polls in 2012 *were* correct.    Probably. But they polling firms compensate for all of that, or at least try their very best to.    They weight the results to compensate. They don't just put up raw numbers.   I'm speaking of New Jersey specifically. You're referring to national polls.    Is there an updated poll on New Jersey showing Clinton's lead shrinking?   Latest poll on there is 440 landline and 352 cell. They then weight those responses to match the electorate.    Polls call home phones and cell phones.   	81

It's not easy but my rule is,  decent filling breakfast (yogurts,  fruit,  etc).  Lunch is usually provided for me,  but keep it small. For dinner never a starter or desert. Just a main course and a coffee. Pick something light.   Exercise wise: body weight training for at least 30 minutes a day,  if the hotel has a gym,  use it. I also go for a 30 minute run every morning before the start of the day (depending on location,  if it's a safe place I am visiting I will go for a run,  if not I will do it in the hotel gym,  if no gym available,  no run,  but 30 minutes of jump robe in the hotel room or garden).   Take it easy with alcohol. Better yet,  don't drink during weekdays (hard in some cultures).    Sounds like my perfect flatmate.      On that note.

Made reservations 3 months before and postponed my trip a week to make it happen as fine dining is my number 1 hobby and I aim at at least 2 Michelin stars a month (2*1 or 1*2) and know quite about about good food.   I would like to point out that almost all of the quality is from his son. Jiro does some QA but that's about it. Honestly I believe his son will take it to a higher level when Jiro steps back completely. Jiro did the first 25 miles of his sushi marathon,  but his son did the final stretch.   If you aspire to eat there bring between 400 and 600 USD a person (depending on the exchange rate)  and be aware that this is not a place where you sit down for hours. It's pretty much in and out.   Anyway, like I was sayin, corn is the fruit of the field. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Theres corn-kabobs, corn creole, corn gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried.

                   Given he's the first with this specific condition to receive the treatment, his age may have actually been a factor in why he was chosen - if something goes wrong, he has a much shorter time to live with the consequences that someone younger.

Might involve a TV appearance but could do the trick                                           Oddly with WSJ articles, if you access them via Google they aren't paywalled.  Here you go:  Technology Will Speed You Through the Airport of the Future  Car-parking robots, tracking beacons and facial recognition systems aim to make travel relaxing  Like a good matre d, the airport of the future will recognize you, greet you by name and know exactly where to put you.  Airports around the world are beginning to move in this direction. At Londons Gatwick Airport, beacons identify you by your smartphone and give GPS-like directions to your gate, pointing out food or shopping along the way. In Germany, robots at Dsseldorfs airport park your car and return it curbside after you land, linking your itinerary to your license plate. Researchers are developing robots that will be able to check your bags and deliver them within minutes of landing.  Facial-recognition systems speed you through passport control in places including Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. Some airports use facial-recognition systems to track your movements around terminals. Gates in some airports are automated with doors that flash open like a subway turnstile when you scan your boarding pass or flash your smartwatch.  At the airport of the future, directional signs will be only for backup. Check-in kiosks will be tucked in a corner. Human agents may be even more unnecessary.  The idea is to cut costs, speed up travel and make airports more hospitable. In theory, travelers will be more relaxed, with time to get work done, shop or enjoy entertainment since the airport will track their time and location and tell them where they need to be. Travelers may fret less about sitting down at a nice restaurant when a flight is delayed, rather than camping at the gate.  The airport becomes fun again, says Terry Hartmann, vice president of transportation and industry applications for Unisys Corp., which makes the technology for some of the new airport features. You feel you know whats going on, you interact with the environment and travel is an enjoyable experience.  Of course, planes will still have cramped seats and airlines will still run habitually late. But flyers wont need to arrive 90 minutes early if they know lines and walks are short. Travelers worried about the airport being too invasive can opt out by turning off their Bluetooth connections.  In June, Unisys announced completion of the initial testing phase of a facial-recognition system at Dulles to help U.S. Customs and Border Protection identify imposters attempting to enter the country. New passports have a chip imbedded with data including your photo. The facial recognition systems, also in use in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and other countries, compare the travelers face with the passport and assign a score. If the match scores high enough, the passport control officer can be more certain of identity than todays system of eyeballing people entering the country.  Manually checking that the person in front of you is the same as a photo five years old is a challenge, Mr. Hartmann says.  At Gatwick Airport, systems estimate queues in real time at security and immigration checkpoints. And some countries have automated border control setups where the facial recognition system automatically clears someone to enter the country without seeing an officer. The U.S. hasnt gone that far partly because not enough travelers have the required chip in their passports.  San Francisco International Airport has 350 beacons installed in Terminal 2 and is testing an app that can give visually impaired passengers audible directions. American Airlines has signed on to a beacon rollout to help customers find their way, starting at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.  Virgin Atlantics lounge in London and Cathay Pacifics lounge in San Francisco have beacons that can recognize members when they walk through the door and offer information like food and drink menus. Miami International Airport has been doing limited trials. One potential use: tracking when someone enters the baggage carousel area and when they leave, showing how long they waited for baggage.  By 2018, 44% of airlines world-wide plan to use beacons, compared with 9% that have experimented with the technology currently, according to a survey this year by SITA, an aviation information and communications company. Geneva-based SITA is owned by 430 air transport companies and develops technology for the industry.  In Germany, Dusseldorfs airport is growing in passenger traffic but it doesnt have real estate to expand parking. The answer: a valet parking robot.  From the airports website, travelers make a reservation and enter flight information. Then they drive to a spot in the garage and lock their car. The system reads the license plate and decides where it will park the vehicle. A robot nicknamed Ray, which looks like a giant forklift, picks up the car by the wheels and moves it. At night, robots reshuffle the garage so cars that will be returned the next day are easily accessible. The system tracks if travelers flights are delayed or canceled and has their cars ready when they arrive.  The robots have operated for nearly a year and boosted garage capacity by 32%, says SITA managing director Christian Jahncke, who oversees the robot project. It has had one ding in one of the 40,000 cars handled. One problem: Sometimes the robot sets off the anti-theft alarm. Eventually the screeching stops. High-quality cars are very sensitive to being picked up, Mr. Jahncke says.  Close-in valet robot parking costs 29, or about $32, a day. That compares with 24.5 for premium parking the same distance from the terminal without valet service.  Each robot costs about $250,000, and Dusseldorf uses three so far. In all, Dusseldorf has spent about $1 million, far less than building a new garage, says Mr. Jahncke.  SITA is looking at whether it could make a robot to check bags, says Jim Peters, the firms chief technology officer. Travelers would self-tag, or have a permanent-use bag tag that identifies them. Robots would pick up the bags and maybe even deliver them, speeding up the process and reducing manual labor costs. Managing your baggage and not making it a pain is a part of the airport of the future, Mr. Peters says. The number of airlines offering self-tagging bag drop, but without robots, has increased to 17% from 9% last year. That is expected to rise to 74% of airlines by 2018, according to the SITA technology survey.         This is a very cool idea - a lot of potential for epic pranks!   Fair point - I also wonder if the road surface would have any effect on stopping distance.                           I think that's a very fair response, although it often seems like some people let articles, tv etc form opinions on every aspect of their lives!   I quite agree about the job issue, I think perhaps more articles about how people can transition to new jobs unaffected by AI (or even create them themselves) would help. Obviously no article would be a perfect solution, but this sort of approach, even if it is very basic, would help people realise it wasn't all doom!

    Thanks!         Every single thing this author publishes, it seems, is posted on this sub.    Good for Petula.    It's not that they published them, it's how they got them that will be the issue. All ESPN has to do is defend the right to protect its sources if this turns ugly and it may. The hospital may have a responsibility to discover how or if the law was broken here.   As an aside, it's weird that ESPN even felt compelled to publish them. I mean, a missing finger is not something anyone in sports can easily hide. Why would the team's organization deny it? They'd have to address it. It's not like the medical records are disclosing some mysterious illness.   outside of Bernie Sanders, who sees a need for an urgent response, climate change hardly registers among the presidential candidates. It is depressing.   A discussion about the 'ethics' of taking photos of topless women at a beach? You're kidding right?  It doesn't rise to that level. Complete jerk is more like it.   Just to be clear: If someone at the beach were to smack this photo happy 'journalist,' take his camera and fling it in the direction of the resident shark, the gofundme to handle the legal cost for this citizen avenger will soar.    The hed: Man who punched topless beach news photographer raises $100K   The kicker: News photographer who says he was acting 'ethically'  is suspended by newspaper        A separate point: Ask CCSU where most of its graduates end up. They will tell you that many stay in the state and locate in Central Connecticut. There are many people who will rent off campus housing and then stay in that housing once they graduate and start working. These are exactly the people you want in New Britain. Adopting housing regulations that deliberately attempt to force them out of town, is a non-starter for NB's future.    I'm fundamentally optimistic about NB.   I do think that NB has much potential, especially as a magnet for young people. The housing, parks, access to education and good transportation links weigh in its favor.   Personally, I'd like to see the city capitalize on the new bus system and focus on building housing in its downtown, especially condos that are affordable and appealing to young people. I do think Central Connecticut is moving in the mass transit direction, gradually, and to a point where people may choose to live without a car and rely more on mass transit, and I think NB should capitalize on it.    My point is that the tendency to point fingers at the most recent mayor(s) overlooks the historical trends that many good people who served in elected office have been unable to overcome.      New Britain has been in a deep hole for decades. It completely lost its manufacturing base in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the retail relocated outside its borders. It lost a huge portion of its downtown land to two massive intersecting highways.  There is no mayor who can fix these problems. Any candidate who says they can is delusional. There is no one mayor responsible. Where do you start? With the redevelopment decisions in the 1950s and 60s that destroyed many of the city's most architecturally unique buildings? Remember the Strand? Probably not. Or the decision on the highway? Or the shift in retail away from downtown to West Farms? What mayor do you blame for the massive lost of jobs and tax revenue? Almost every effort by the city to bring in new developers comes up short in some key aspect. Who is the major developer of downtown? Over the last three decades NB is. First, it renovated City Hall. Then it renovated the Gates building to create a new home for the school department, and it built a new police station. The state is responsible for the other new downtown development. CCSU and the court house complex and now the bus system. There's almost no private sector interest. New Britain's economic strategy has been on life support since the 1980s.   Although you may want to blame this mayor or that mayor or whatever, New Britain's core problem is it has no tax base other than a residential taxbase. It can't tax what it doesn't have. It's increasingly dependent on the redistribution of wealth via the state.   There's no demand for what New Britain offers: Empty industrial lots.   I'm not writing this as an apologists or defender of any mayor. The fact of the matter is New Britain -- all tiny 13 sq miles of it -- has completely lost its economic tax base to its neighbors and China. There's almost no room to build anything in the city anymore, and other towns have reaped the benefits from the spending power of New Britain residents who buy almost everything, other than groceries, outside of the city.   The longstanding efforts to revitalize downtown have lurched along because there's no population growth in NB or in Connecticut. There's no real job growth, and if the insurance industry keeps consolidating ...        Lived outside of Belvedere on Lawlor and Miller for more than 20 years. There was no climate of fear.     "Lock your doors and don't make eye contact."  That's harsh and most definitely not true.    Is it legal to define "students" as a separate group, and then set up a rule to discriminate against them?   And restricting by parking? The drafters of this legislation know that the vast majority of multi-family houses do not have enough offstreet parking. This legislation appears to limit -- "three (3) bedrooms -- (3) three spaces" -- so does this mean you can have a three bedroom unit (common enough in a three-family house) and not be able to rent to students because you don't have corresponding three off-street parking spaces?  This is a totally BS piece of legislation.   New Britain can't treat students as a separate class of people and apply special rules against them. It can't. It can't say these rules only apply to students, and not to people who are not students? You can't do that.   (Here's something else: A lot of CCSU students are vets. They don't want to live in dorms. I was one. Putting in a requirement that a family contact be available is offensive to the extreme.)   New Britain needs to grow up. If the corporation counsel gives this ordinance a green light, I would strongly suggest that opponents counter with a resolution for a second opinion from a lawfirm with real expertise in these matters.    I hope NB is sued over it.     Wow -- that video is something else. It would be a great beginning to an end-of-world film.    Norm Matloff, a computer science professor at the University of California at Davis, provides some commentary/background on the Primer, which was penned by John Miano, a programmer who later earned a law degree.  https://normsaysno.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/john-miano-suggests-that-journalists-open-their-eyes/   If you are writing up a layoff that involves tech workers, there's a very good chance they were replaced with lower cost foreign workers in the U.S. on a temporary H-1B visa. Their severance may have been contingent on training their visa holding replacement.   Here's a example of a local report in the Dallas Morning News: http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20150516-schnurman-fossil-sells-out-its-tech-workers.ece         Only $180 billion? That's a rounding error in the federal budget.    As president, Jeb Bush will cut as many federal workers as possible. This is from his 2003 Florida governor Inaugural address at the Florida state capitol building.   "There would be no greater tribute to our maturity as a society than if we can make these buildings around us empty of workers, silent monuments to the time when government played a larger role than it deserved."  (around the 15 min mark: http://www.c-span.org/video/?174603-1/florida-governor-inaugural-address)   Fine idea. But would rather see a support infrastructure for local bloggers who are committed to local reporting: help with design, legal issues, and most importantly, a clearinghouse or network that can funnel ads to local blogs.   There are many local bloggers trying to do some reporting. But they make zip from things like google ads, and don't have the experience, time or technical know-how to sell local ads.   Instead of creating a jobs program, this $3 million would be better spent incubating and helping local bloggers establish a base.   Another reason I'd have problems with a jobs program, I'm also mistrustful of any program that selects people for the job. Based on what criteria? I'd run, instead, with self-selected people who have already demonstrated some commitment to local reporting.     This pope is wonderful. He's taking on the world in an entirely new way.      the headline is clickbait, the piece is kinda meandering and doesn't really move the ball forward. but it's harmless, a little brassy, and entertaining.    great piece; very informative about Dr. Oreskes.    did the source contact you via your new work email? If so, then your source is interested in working with you.    Reporters, in my experience, are mostly introverts and loathe "personal branding."         The negative folks are always there; like crickets in the background. But when you nail a good story that brings some real change, the cricket noise will be drowned out -- at least for a little bit of time.    It's always been this way (pre-Internet guy here.) People were always down about something ('Why don't you cover more local news?'). It never ends.   It's only when they stop commenting/complaining that you have to worry.     I think the weather is doing all the talking. How many "extreme" events does it take to get people to at least think that there might be a problem?    Well, that's a plus for news orgs that are covering Sanders, because there is clear reader interest (traffic) on pieces about Sanders.           And so it starts; the path to entitlement, favors.       Hed should be *some* of the media reaction ... As the CJR notes, NYT's Carlotta Gall, and some others, suggest Hersh is on to something.   But the CJR is right to call out the hit pieces.   Anonymous sourcing is unavoidable in some things, but Hersh has proven his metal.      Check out his page views.    What's interesting about Drudge is that in terms of design and format he is anti-change.   In a time where news orgs are changing designs every two or three years, Drudge keeps his format simple, consistent, so 1990s. And it works.   There's a case to made for consistency. People like it. It's like the Citgo sign at Fenway. It started as a sign; now its an iconic landmark. It's part of the landscape. People love it. It's part of what they identify with, and that's what Drudge is now -- an iconic site that people now read what they want into it: It's conservative, its influential, its .... whatever. You can look at the links and debate those things. But the one indisputable thing about Drudge is its consistency, and it works with readers. That's what news orgs should be thinking about.        I would bring a couple of notebooks and tell the kids to write down their names before they break ranks. Take your own photos. They'll cooperate. It's in everyone's interest to make their parents proud.        What happens if they don't get 2,500 entries?    Great work!   it neglects argument that climate change is already a moral imperative.   where's the issue? that climate change inaction is somehow morally neutral? There's no pathway to neutrality unless you are severely delusional.              If the holes existed for a decade, does it mean that anyone who used these facilities over this period can make a similar claim? Are you making this a class action?           -- Q. What's your news angle? A. I'm not sure. At this point I'm just trying to connect with authoritative sources who can help explain the issue. (An iteration of SurlyDave's response)   -- Q. Will our company be the focus of your story? A. Not sure. It might. It really depends on the strength of the interview. (This one often works best for me, because the PR folks do get the fact that their source has to be interesting and quotable.)         That link is to Heartland.   Stephen Moore is a Fox News contributor. Moore is the Distinguished Visiting Fellow, Project for Economic Growth, at The Heritage Foundation.  Heritage, if not an outright denial organization, minimizes the impact of climate change and is skeptical of the global scientific consensus. It works to shoot down just about any economic and global plan for dealing with it.    Quote of the Week: We talk about [tripling] in terms of revenue for the company, but there is a direct correlation with between revenue and personnel, said VandeHei. If we are going to realise our ambitions we need a lot more reporters and a lot more people on the business side.   This is a very apocalyptic piece and it's great that CNN ran it.   	53
    All hail The State Authority! Thank you Comrade Warren   Fair point, but then they aren't the link in the chain that is working for free. That money paid to the doctors is coming from some elses paycheck in the form of wages that they can't keep for themselves because the government is making a claim on it.   You could make that argument for anything then. If we all chip-in in taxes, then whatever the majority says so, gets paid for through the tax system via the State Authority, and therefore is a "right". I view rights as something you are free to pursue, but cannot be one persons claim on some one elses labor. But I see your argument clockworkgirl21.  Edit: sorry I realized later that I was arguing another point about healthcare being a "right". Not about the smaller paycheck versus taxes.   Apparently people think when the majority "says so", that makes something a right. But it's not a right to be provide free healthcare. That would mean that someone in the chain is forced to work for free. Who would you suggest?   It's not a right to be provide free healthcare. That would mean that someone in the chain is forced to work for free. Who would you suggest?   It's a great idea that young workers would get smaller paychecks to pay for the Healthcare of people they don't even know. Or as most people would call it "Single Payer".   You realize the recent government debacle known as the Affordable Care Act does nothing to change the opaque price structure of the US healthcare.. It simply forced young healthy people to overpay for their insurance so others can pay less. The problem is health providers (not insurance companies) don't have any open pricing policies that the consumer shop, and that problem sure wasn't fixed 5 years ago.   The Democrat Party, with a wink-and-a-nod, flooding the US with low skilled illegal workers drives down average American wages. Maybe that's what resonates?   Bill Clinton says..."What I'm really saying is...lets let these drug pushing criminals back into the African-American communities, after all, I don't live there and have to deal with the consequences". Uh..OK..thanks Bill.  	10

 I'm from Spain and I started watching Adventure Time when it wasn't still translated or subbed or even aired here on tv. I watched it in english with my friends and didn't get 50% of the dialogs. Nobody seemed to know about that series back then.   Anyone involving grapes   Chaos red   It depends. Is my weapon a grape?   I know, man. We stopped being an empire centuries ago.

It's a compilation of his public speeches. I collect records and this is my rarest piece. I almost went crazy when I found it in the garbage.   Yeah. From the glorious Spain Empire.   Patata = potato      This album is your answer if you want to isolate and torture her at the same time: https://youtu.be/AguPH0XBxdw   Yeah, right, totally messy.

The transcription is not 100% accurate.  https://youtu.be/Dk0aqyMltRA   This is the most cliche comment ever when talking about murders. I swear I have to listen to it every damn time.   I guess they need to be sure that it's not a joke an details like if there is people still alive or wounded or if he is armed.

There is already an Adventure Time game based on D D, in case you are interested. My Lady Blackbird version is much simpler and narration oriented. I don't have much, just lists with races and classes (including detective and ninja) and some notions about swords, princesses and lands in Ooo. I planned to get all the information I needed from an AT wiki.   Oh, also, it's all in spanish. I could translate it but it would take me a while.   Interesting. This resembles the argument of "I have no mouth and I must scream", both the tale and the game.   And one day he will be 17 and be an emo and listen to black metal and smoke weed and make you ask yourself "What did I do wrong?".   I don't recall my typography  lessons very precisely but I think it all started with egyptian hieroglyphs. Complex symbols representing whole ideas and objects got simplified geometrically to represent sounds. This symbols were adopted by cultures like Greece, that were adopted by romans. So, letters evolved in time from very graphic symbols to letters that you can write fast.   I found this picture explaining it. It's in spanish but I think you'll get it.  http://www.editorialalaire.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aleph.jpg   How is that? Aren't they supossed to be different dimensions?   Planes are still science fiction for me.   1. Instead of nothing, something exists. Having in mind the high quantity of energy, rules and matter needed, the logic option would be that the universe didn't exist at all.  2. I'm alive and conscious perceiving reality from inside this body and only this body. I can't exist out of my body or ocuppy another one.   Is Lady Blackbird under the radar? I never played it but I love the setting and the system. It has lots of fans that have made mods and expansions, so maybe it doesn't qualify for this thread.  I have adapted it for Adventure Time and a setting of my own but still not tried them out.   I must read this!   Dungeon Slayers. Free download. Rules light. D20 system. Classic dungeon crawling: kill monsters, get loot, get XPs... Very useful when you want to play but the maximum mental effort you are willing to do is drawing a dungeon and set some monsters and traps here and there.   My players love it. It's like "Diablo II: the rpg".   I solved this by stating all the pcs were agents at the service of the New Inquisitioncfrom the begining. They are a team and have to make missions for money. If they get out of control or betray the organization they will get a new dangerous enemy. All this keep them focused and united... Relatively, of course. In UA almost everyone is insane and craves for maximum power at any cost.   That's a good idea. Maybe some day I will copypaste my story there.   Ha ha, don't worry. I can live with this.

I suspected that video was a joke, but with the asmr "community" one never knows, I've seen some weird shit. People that take it really seriously. Like this guy https://youtu.be/lGBJFIbS03k   Yessss. My favorite horror manga ever. The one about the cursed book really terrorized me.   This guy has the weirdest asmr videos I've ever seen. Does this even qualify as asmr? He's just tipping on all kind of things.  https://youtu.be/kVgUIUnL3Ag   Enlace a la web mencionada:  http://madridvo.madrid.es/   Muy autoritario tendra que ser un gobierno para mantener un sitio web que dijese que lo cierto es falso. Por todas partes habra indicios de manipulacin, incluso en los medios mayoritarios. Se liara la de dios. Muy mal se tendra que poner la cosa para que se usara esa web con el propsito que dices.  Una cosa es que los gobernantes trapicheen a escondidas, tergiversen, hagan circunsloquios y jueguen con el lenguaje, o que los medios distorsionen las noticias como en el juego del telfono roto, no se documenten bien o elijan las que ms les convengan a ellos o a los gobernantes, y otra que un gobierno ponga en marcha un medio pblico, una web, para ir diciendo que un montn de noticias verdaderas son falsas.  A m me parece que esto va ms bien por el camino de la transparencia y eso me parece bien. Por ahora lo estn contrastando todo con pruebas documentadas.   Me puedes explicar lo de la "confluencia"? Soy un poco ignorante en cuestin de poltica y novato en este subreddit. Este es mi segundo comentario aqu, de hecho.   Figura pblica + cuenta en Twitter = alabanzas al muerto de turno. Eso es as.   I only see something that could be a ghost boy standing in the porch, very blurred.   Of course he didn't always existed. He was created in the dreaming of the Cosmic Giant Beetle, of course, just like everything that is external to the game.  	70
 Those kids are doomed.         The Eastern side of the state is getting hit particularly hard, including much of Idaho. It's really bad, but at the same time it's really interesting. If you like adventure, I highly suggest checking out some of the record low lakes and rivers around. Parts of the Snoqualmie river for example are a trickle right now in areas that'd be over a person's head in a normal water year. Keechelus Lake is another interesting place along I-90, and with its record lows right now it's a lot of fun to hike/explore areas usually under water this time of year.   If we have another mostly snowless winter I think we'll be in super super bad shape. So hopefully checking out record low bodies of water is a limited time offer only.   After hearing interviews with Arnold lately my respect for him has grown substantially. I wish he could enter the presidential race, because out of everyone out there I think I'd trust him just about the most. He's incredibly pragmatic, and also understands people will not always agree and compromises are important.   Well that's another place to add to your list of where not to have a hangover.   I wish all wasps were this dumb.   Then I'd feed off of your thought reading by shouting out to all the other potential jurors not to worry because I was blocking your thoughts!      I think this one has earned its freedom. Set it free!   You should come to Idaho, here the rattlesnakes don't charge for bites.   They haven't tested it in animal models or humans. It's actual efficacy is unknown and to be determined.   Back then I should have, but now enough time has passed that I don't want to awaken that issue again. I find it concerning that there are people out there who get joy out of trying to ruin someone's life just because that person made a joke in bad taste (with no malicious intent, or intent to offend). I don't want them to start making things difficult for me again.   I don't have any reason to use alt accounts. And I think doing so would be childish. You called me paranoid?   I feel like I'm just a regular guy living life. Which I intend to continue. I don't understand all the hullabaloo.   It bothers me that you appear to be one of "them"... But the reason was to get away from the brigading caused by one stupid comment. I was very active in programming and financial/investing subreddits where people had a lot of questions. I'd contribute efforts to help those seeking help, but when all my comments were downvoted by the SRS members it was a bad deal because it made my advice look like the wrong advice, and could have an impact on those asking for advice. It still doesn't make sense to me... This was a couple of years ago so maybe SRS has changed, but back then their actions were completely inappropriate imo.   Nope. Not a hate monger, creeper, or terrorist... Just guilty of making a joke of poor taste.     SRS thrives on harassment and they really need to go... I had to create a new reddit account because I made a joke about feminists with my last one, not even meaning to offend anyone. There was a post about some misguided feminists at a rally that attacked a photographer for doing his job, and I posted a comment like "I volunteer to be the bus driver for the next rally... But our first stop will be a cliff.". SRS found out and followed me around downvoting me. They also doxxed me, found out where I worked, and tried to get me fired... All because I made a stupid comment which I don't think any reasonable person would associate with being serious.  This went on for months before I deleted my account, and it caused me a lot of stress. If that's not the definition of harassment I don't know what is.   If you don't trust the person you're sending them to you shouldn't be sending them. Extra protection behind two trusting parties isn't a bad thing.   Maybe I'm just cynical, but this posts extremely rapid rise to the top, and the title language smell a lot like a studio's doing to me.   Geologists hate him!   I think small drones with mounted projectile weapons will be the future of warfare. It won't be long before they start making appearances in insurgencies however, then regulators in the states will probably go nuts.  Or just imagine how much damage could be done with drones and explosives that have either encrypted / frequency jumping communication or pre-programmed GPS routes. It's a defense nightmare. About all you can do today is construct a giant net around what you're trying to protect, and even that isn't very feasible.   You don't. That's why this isn't that bad of a thing in my eyes. If it's a transfer between two trustable people using up to date software there is extra privacy, but if it's a company trying to limit viewing rights to their content, it's easy to get around.   This doesn't seem like a bad thing. It's really easy to circumvent if you really want too, but it also offers protection to common users who want their privacy.  Imagine the scenario:   **With protection on the image and platform**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. The image is set to be viewed only once. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. The client/platform allows person B to view it, but it also triggers the image to become protected/encrypted. It is now no longer viewable. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer finds the image but cannot view it.  **Without protection**: Person A sends a 'personal' image to person B via email. Person B saves it to his hard-drive, and then opens it. Person B sells the computer but unwisely does not erase his data. The buyer is cleaning up data on the machine and comes across the image, opens it, and can view it. Now the buyer can post it on the internet, keep it on his machine for viewing, and just be generally creepy.   If they are trying to sell it, keeping their original costs a secret is a wise move.   If the earthquake doesn't get you the volcano will!   If this means shutting down subreddits that people find offensive, I can't imagine it going any way but badly. It's like prohibition, when you try to stamp something out it'll just become more rampant and harder to control... Those people in subreddits like r/coontown likely won't leave reddit, they'll just start posting their comments in other subreddits and threads. This may drive *other* people to leave instead.   You better hope your dad never gets his hands on a time machine...   They are called social justice warriors, and they are fighting a war!!!! /s   Hey guys, I think Ellen Pao killed JFK!   oDesk used to be very good. It has since been renamed to [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/) . However with bidding sites such as that you'll likely find you are competing against many developers in other countries who are far more willing to work for less compensation.  If you don't want to start your own side project, one way to get side work is to post on sites such as Craigslist, and/or look for requests for help requests in the 'gigs' section. For example for Seattle, there are quite a few 'gigs' available: https://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cpg  Just be careful to not break any contracts with your employer, such as working on a project for competition.    I've screened a lot of resumes and done quite a few in-person interviews as a developer.  My suggestions (Specific):  * Instead of listing "C++/CLI" under languages just put "Managed C++".   * For frameworks just put ".NET" instead of listing 4.0 and 4.5  * Drop the Methodologies bullet point. It doesn't really add anything useful.  * "real-time streaming SQL queries" seems like a poor description. I'd suggest something like "using SQL integration to display data" * For the second job, combine the 2nd and 3rd bullet points. * "The end result of the project would be a poker bot". This is a big red flag for me. You say "would be"? So this is an unfinished project I assume? If it is, either finish it, reword the description, or remove it all together. Personal projects are a huge bonus when I read resumes, but a single unfinished project gives me a negative perspective unless it's actively under development.   For the short jobs, there isn't much you can do about that, just be honest.    My suggestions (General):  * If you can list some accomplishments for your last job. Did you improve anything greatly while there?     I hate paying tips because it's a big benefit to the employer (it's ridiculous that employers make customers pay for the fact they pay their employees shitty wages). But I do it anyway... If you don't pay tips you're hurting the people that are hard working decent people for the most part. I wish there was an easier way to stick it to the shady owners though... Maybe I should just start leaving with a trench coat full of silverware.   Hopefully people lay off of her now. She took the correct action of stepping down, and I hope we can all be thankful that she did, and wish her the best in whatever lays before her.   While the implementation itself may be proprietary, the concepts themselves are likely not. This seems common, especially in companies working on enterprise-level projects.  As long as you aren't stuck in maintenance mode (ie: not adding anything new, and not learning anything new about the projects) I don't think it'll do much to limit your career growth potential. I would suggest keeping yourself busy with side-projects wherever you can, just so you don't fall into a rut of not being motivated to learn anything new.             Banana!    But there is a catch! A person having such thoughts would likely already be pretty conscious about the state of the world and ways to help it... which means most likely they would teach their kids to have similar perspective. So by not having kids, that person might be removing important problem solvers from the future.  Now, convincing someone else not to have children...   They have a metric butt ton: http://www.businessinsider.com/texas-has-no-place-to-put-its-650-million-stash-of-gold-2015-7   Texas recently ordered its state guard (a militia which reports to the governor) to observe the national and federal forces partaking in state drills, to ensure they weren't part of a coup against Texas and its people. They also just initiated actions to have all of their gold bullion moved from other states such as New York because they do not trust the federal government. Maybe next they'll announce they are seceding from the Union.   Except your post history has pictures like this with you stating it was after you "tucked your kitten in". Which means you lie about having a niece playing 'mommy' with the cat; and it also means you wrap your cats and take pictures of them. Which means... I'm slightly afraid of you.   Man, this chick really did win the genetic lottery.   I think part of the reason ageism exists is because unlike the case with young hires, with older hires there is usually a much longer paper trail and job/performance history. I think a lot of interviewers see an older person's resume and think "they aren't as far along as I think they should be after so many years in the industry", and conversely upon seeing a young person's resume they think "this person has worked a couple of years on satisfying projects, his future is likely very bright"... But the whole comparison is unfair, because the vast majority of tech workers won't accomplish something that is front page worthy in their careers. Yet that does not mean they aren't extremely good workers to have by your side.   I think he slides it in and it bends against his thumb around 1:14, he does an odd and very straight/smooth motion and even his facial expression changes like he is concentrating on something.      Yeah, I'm not sure if the guy in the videos has a really happy marriage, or if this is how news articles start.   I like how it makes an appearance in his next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2dRqXz2Lrc      [OP's reaction](https://youtu.be/rB0wzy-xbwM?t=1m37s)   What's in that totally rock'in building?   He's well on the path to immortality. Let the genetic line continue   The FDA allows "compassionate care" use of previously unapproved treatments if it has a chance of improving the quality of life of someone who has a severely degraded quality of life or outlook. It's risky to drug manufacturers however, because if they attempt to treat patients too early, before doses/tolerance/safety are worked out in phased population studies, there is a chance it could make a patient's condition worse or even kill them. Such an event can put a real black mark on their ability to continue research and get approval in the future.      I was under the impression that in humans Alzheimer's most serious symptoms present themselves after the brain is already undergoing atrophy due to cell death. So is this model from the study more aligned with a very very early stage of Alzheimer's disease?    If you're living in Greece, that's actually not a bad idea...   I'm just going to sit on it, there aren't many options these days for something out of reach of risk related to a collapse in Greece and the cascading effects it may have. If I could I'd buy more property, but for now, I'll just check my account every 10 minutes on Monday and hope it doesn't drop too wildly.   That looks like a trip to the hospital.   What about when an FBI agent gives someone a fake bomb / nuke as part of a sting? It's not real either, yet they can be charged with that too.      No, I just hate most political discussions when they are circle jerks. I'm not one who would classify himself as Republican either.  I'm seeing politics posts all over the place in sub-reddits that used to be full of quality content. It wasn't much of an issue until r/politics got removed as a default sub, but then after that it began spilling out across reddit.  An hour before OP posted this, he posted another court article in r/politics. It's people trying to bring political discussions to subreddits that used to be mostly free of it.   Great if true, but considering the timing it's probably propaganda. Hopefully it actually works to sew some distrust between ISIS fighters.   I think today's terror in the news shows that god is upset with the world for allowing such a tragedy to take place. I only hope that those who were for it get a chance to redeem themselves before they burn in eternal **HELL**. I question what is next? Is this western drought going to be the end of our society as we get a taste of the flames that will lick our feet in the depths of the *underworld*?  Just kidding. Can we all get over stupid things to hate when there are so many more big/real problems lurking in our future?   /r/NotTheOnion is the new r/politics   You would have been close to the recommended maximum payload for sure. Looking at your truck's specs its bed is 4.8ft long (usable space), 56 inches wide, and has a depth of 18 inches. Subtracting 4 cubic feet for the wheel wells (it's likely more), and 2 cubic feet for the unused space on top we come out to about exactly 1 cubic yard. Since your soil looks dry and also uncompacted it's probably a few hundred less than the typical 2,000 lb for 1 cubic yard estimate.  Your truck's manufacturer lists a max recommended cargo payload of around 1400lb, which is likely very conservative (because lawsuits).   With the weight being evenly distributed across the bed there shouldn't be any extreme stress on one particular point unless you're cruising around sharp corners at 30 MPH.   When I lived/worked on a farm we would regularly exceed max payload specs as long as we kept the weight uniform and drove carefully. We never had any mechanical issues related to weight, and I don't suspect you have anything to worry about either. But I wouldn't recommend packing it down or taking wet soil and filling it to the top =)   The load on your truck should be fine. Just curious as to how much you figured the load weighed?        Knowing Washington it was probably muggy as hell too. Looks can be so deceiving, I've made the mistake of trying to escape the heat with a pacific rain forest walk before... Nope!   Looks awesome and I'm also digging the straight forward construction (nothing weird / overkill). How long did it take you from start to finish?   This chick is like Goldilocks crazy. So crazy that what she does doesn't make any bit of sense to the typical non-crazy person, yet not crazy enough to be smearing feces all over the walls (yet).    This new study really hammers BPA safety.  It amazes me BPA hasn't been banned/regulated when it's well known to have detrimental health effects: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A    I'm a software developer with a specific focus on automation systems, so if my job gets completely automated I'd say it's great progress on behalf of humanity.  Such a change in the way we work as a society will not be easy, but I think it's necessary and though it may take centuries, it will be well worth it to future generations.    This is just a straight up r/politics post.    Then we should take those people out of the system with today's economics if we want to maintain a stable world. Our efficiency and automation is exploding, and so is our population... It's destined for disaster in the long term, and something will have to change, our economy is ripe for change, but nobody wants to be the first to do it, and I don't blame them. I think we'll start undergoing an evolutionary step in the way we work and function as a society.   Most of the process of 'cooking' the food at places like McDonald's is automated, but they still use people to move it along those steps and put it all together in the end. Those people likely won't be going away anytime soon.  Eventually they likely will, but there is a lot of regulation needing to be defined and cleared up before completely automated food (no humans preparing the food in the restaurant)  becomes a reality.   Not necessarily. I don't go through self-checkout when I have a lot of items simply because I'm not nearly as efficient as the baggers. I love self-checkout when I'm just getting a few things, but when you have a full cart load of stuff they suck (in my opinion).   You are correct, most SSDs are spec'd with the goal of having no less than 3 months of non-powered data retention. The fact that the threshold is so low says something about the data retention ability of current SSD tech.   I hear Guantanamo is nice this time of year.    They are all shopping at Walmart.   Ooooooooo... Japan gonna get banned!!!!   With this technique could it eventually be expanded to bone fragments by you or others? Could someone fake a death and leave behind fabricated skeleton remains that match the genetic profile of the "victim"?   Do you have an example of a limiting regulation that is unrelated to safety and infrastructure? I'm genuinely curious. When I talked to one of the city managers he said it was extremely rare for a proposed project to be rejected. But of course that doesn't mean there aren't builders that want to build, but just never submit a proposal.   No, I'm saying Seattle isn't really doing anything to hold back builders. So while some Seattle neighborhoods may complain about change of neighborhood character, it isn't holding builders back from record setting development.   Oh thank god, that makes a lot more sense. My mistake.   Seeing the lake 22 feet below it's regular surface would be an interesting sight for sure...  The locks raise the water level by ~20 feet so to lose all of that would imply there was almost no inflow at all. Is that expected? If so does anyone know if water restrictions are planned to maintain the Cedar River flows? I've lived here for about 10 years and there haven't been any water restrictions during that period, are watering restrictions super rare in this area?     I remember reading somewhere that 2015 already has more units approved for construction than all of 2014 (which was already an active year). The boom is happening, but it's nowhere near enough to bring prices down. Seattle is now estimated to be adding nearly 30k people to its population each year, but suburbs are of course adding many more than that so demand for housing in the city is continuing to rapidly rise and likely will for a long time in the future.  Builders have every incentive to build right now, and I think they are building as fast as they can. There is just such an influx of people wanting to move to Seattle there is no way they can keep up with their current staffing and building capabilities. I'm not sure what more the city of Seattle can do to increase construction.   It was all fun and games until I started to scroll down and got shot before reaching the last link.   Maybe there was a Taco Bell nearby   From what I've read this falls outside of the realm of false advertising because it has no impact on the product and service itself. It seems to be a gray area. Some other laws may catch it however.   I know it is likely unethical, but is it actually illegal if there are no investors and the company is private? It's not for tax purposes either, but simply because due to the nature of the business a higher  previous customer count is incredibly crucial to gaining more customers.  For example, say I start a security system company. If I were to say "More installations than any other security provider!", is that illegal if it is not true? Just to clarify, I'm not asking about ethics here but rather the legality of it.   Baggy eyes, pale, transfixed stare, and sweaty looking. The joyous hallmarks of sleep deprivation and stress.

             Is anyone shocked by this ?                      Why did you move to Louisiana ?     Pixar movies have always done that. Cartoonish characters on realistic backgrounds.   But there is something about the background here in "The Good Dinosaur" that seems more real than it usually does. When you look at the trees, grass, water, mountains, and everything else it looks so much more real than it usually does in a Pixar movie. I mean not even the coral reef in Finding Nemo looked as real as the background in this trailer did (at least in my opinion). The contrast with this real background compared to the dinosaur really bothered me. Maybe the lack of dialog had me focusing on the background more than usual, or maybe it was the fact that the dinosaur is so cartoonish that he seemed out of place. I don't know.   Other than that I liked the trailer. No plot given away, just music and scenes of a (possible?) budding friendship. It actually made me more interested in the movie.                                      I'm assuming that the computer system is one of many projects that they want to use the $175 million for.

His father is from Jordan so he likely went (possibly under the ruse) to see extended family and then snuck into nearby Syria or Iraq (this is of course assuming that the guy carried this out in the name of radical Islam, while all initial signs point to that there is still no statement from the FBI on why he did this). Also Jordan is one of the U.S.'s allies in the Middle East, it isn't crawling with terrorist groups like Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq so visiting there wouldn't raise any red flags.                *sigh* I'm not even surprised anymore             I know, unfortunately the GOP has run a successful union busting ring here for the past 50 years. The regional airlines here are separate companies that use non union pilots and are contracted out by the big 3 airlines (Delta, United, and American) to fly smaller planes ([40 to 80 seat planes like this](http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acimages/crj700er_kp.jpg)) from their hubs to small cities, think Chicago to Green Bay. They are staffed by pilots just out of flight school so they are desperate to get their "dream job" and go to work for regional airlines because the larger ones won't hire you out of flight school. The regional airlines know that they don't have to pay a high salary because there are plenty of eager pilots in line to get a job. In a perfect world you spend a few years flying for a regional airline then get hired by the Delta's, United's, Southwest's and JetBlue's of the world. But that doesn't always happen.    About damn time they spoke out    Not having minimum wage in the US   The U.S. has a minimum wage, it's not high but it  does exist.    Nothing. Ryanair will still fly to Denmark. It's just that now the crews and planes will be based in other countries (like Germany, Lithuania, UK, etc.) instead of Denmark. So the employees will no longer be "employed" in Denmark but in Germany, UK etc.     He should work for the regional airlines here in order to know what it's like to be an underpaid pilot. They make only $23,000 a year.    Reminds me of the situation here in the states when a few months ago Walmart suddenly closed about 5 stores in various states due to "plumbing issues", laying off all the staff in the process. The company and not filed any construction permits with the local governments concerning plumbing work and Walmart said that the stores would reopen in about 6 months. Rumor has it they closed the stores to stop people from unionizing             Then you better vote and get your friends involved.                            If this is real I will laugh my ass off. I never thought that the stereotype of the Welsh being sheep fuckers was true       Finland is prepared    Didn't y'all also use school buses to travel?                There was the special they aired about the guy with the 132 pound scrotum.    They pulled reruns when shit hit the fan. This announcement is them officially canceling it.      [What is known about him at this point]( http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/jul/16/what-we-know-about-chattanooga-shooter/315002/)                  They are probably employed by a company called Veritas that AT T hired to do door to door sales for them. I know this because I applied for a "Management Trainee" job at that company a few months back. I went to the initial interview and was invited back for a 7 hour "day in the life" event to see how the company operatives and was told it would be business professional. Get there having no clue what to expect. Told to go with this guy and  this girl (the girl had only been there a week). It quickly became clear what this job really was. I felt like an absolute idiot for not picking up on the red flags sooner, I had just graduated college so I was desperate and didn't think. So here I was walking around the poor/lower middle class part Akworth in dress shoes and a suit all day in the May sun sweating my ass off doing nothing but watching these people try to sell AT T U-verse to people who can't afford it. The whole thing was BS. The guy even said to the new girl "don't sell the cheap package sell the expensive one". And the whole spiel they gave to people was complete BS too.  Like you said, given a huge list of addresses in a certain area and have to cover it multiple times to make sure you catch the person.    Like /u/Coup_Soup said it's to make sure that you catch a person while they're home. Plus in some cases the person that answers the door will say that "I don't handle that stuff, so-and-so does. They'll be here around _____" so you go back to ask the "person in charge".                My Grandma calls it commode as well, she's from Eastern Virginia.    I've seen yellow lids too.    I don't know what his ratings at 5pm were like. I do know that his ratings at 11pm were bad because sporting events would delay his show or push it over to ESPNEWS leading to an inconsistent air time and channel.    At least they kept the "home" in Home   Garden Television. TLC has nothing to do with learning anymore   Holtz retired, May is still under contract with ESPN, Cowherd probably got a better offer from Fox, Olbermann left because ESPN wanted to censor his criticism of the NFL, and Simmons was a mix of wanting too much money and ESPN trying to censor him from criticizing the NFL and ESPN personalities/shows *cough* First Take *cough* .      They are also in the process of budget tightening. They have lots of personalities contract's coming up this year, so it's all about choosing who is worth paying. Simmons was a case of wanting too much money and being critical of the NFL, Olbermann was being too critical of the NFl, and now Cowherd is probably wanting too much money. FWIW they have already resigned Stephen A. Smith to a new contract.                  The Duggars are huge anti-gay bigots.

Hard to explain, I don't understand it, but I sometimes wish I was back in Iraq.  Not that I "enjoyed" it per se, but there was nowhere near as much drama or bullshit that you find here in the "real world."  It's comforting but maddening at the same time.         No problem!

So people shouldn't talk about places they've never been to?   The action did not in anyway indicate me being upset.   OK  That is in your mind, think what you want.  I will.  Also, rules and etiquette are two separate things.   Nothing in etiquette against reposts either.  There is against those who complain about them though.  Poorer arguments on top of poor assumptions. Nice.  You get butthurt over reposts.  On reddit.  That's pretty much all anyone needs to know.  And lead by example in this specific case.   Again. This is reddit.  You take this too seriously.      If you wanted me to ignore the post because it was repeated and i am being immature by stating it here, you are setting yourself up in the same area by replying to my 'repeated' comment.   OK  You are just moving in circles not even realizing that you are calling yourself immature.   Your deflection attempts are amateur.  A sad life, if you have nothing better to do in your break.

This rule does NOT mean that posts that contain links to news articles over 2 months old are not allowed.     which in itself is a poor assumption  Actions speak louder than words.  How about you getting riled up on a repeated comment which you deem insignificant anyway.   Oh I'm not riled up at all.  I'm merely mocking you while taking a break during my work day.  You should have followed your own advice and ignored my comment then!  So you're not going to be a grown up and just ignore things and instead lead the charge to get OPs to remove re-posts even though there is no rule against them?  [Sounds awesome!](http://i.giphy.com/4bMAaXendmGWc.gif)  Lead by example.  Seriously?  Lead what?  Redditors?  Yeah.  OK.  But you had to reply.  Yes.  Because you people amuse me.  Looks like you are just a hypocrite.   OK  Or would that be Captain hypocrite to you?   Lacking originality.  I would rather have another deserving post taking up space than a repost of something posted not even a day.  That's why they have up/down vote buttons.  Guess what?  Not everybody saw it the first time around.  Just because you did doesn't mean anything.  Downvote and move on.  You're not some white knight saving the reddit universe.

But that day itself. That is shitty.   So what?  I didn't see it the first time around.  I know I'm not the only one.  Obvious stated or do i need reiterate for you?  Is that even a sentence?  Edit: Seems like OP got the message. Fuck you :)   Still lacking originality.      News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) more recent than two months are not allowed.  Did you read the entire rule?  News and any sources (blog, article, press release, video, etc.) **more recent than two months** are not allowed.   A repeated comment and a Repost are not the same things.   Both are insignificant.  You got your thoughts mixed up.  Nope.  This is a concern.  Seriously?  It's reddit.  Calm down.  That is a title post.   Thanks Captain Obvious.  The more people point it out the more likely OP will be to rescind the post.   Or you could just, you know, be a grown up and ignore it.  There is no rule against re-posts after all.    Though, looking at your stance, i can understand if that explanation sails over your head.  My stance is that you need to step away from the computer and experience more of the real world if a repost upsets you this much.   This has already been brought to the attention of the OP.  Did you search the comments to make sure you're not making a repost by stating this?            What the hell does it matter?  That was 11 hours ago.

If any of these politicians give one damn about our vets, I don't give a fuck what party the politician is in, they would step up and take action to actually help our vets and not use them as a political tool.

McMahon immediately enlisted and entered flight training in Dallas, Texas. Afterwards he completed fighter training in Pensacola and obtained his carrier landing qualification. While he was still in flight school, McMahon became an instructor, a role in which his ability to project came in handy. His flight instructor status lasted for two years until he was given orders to report to the Pacific Fleet. However, before he entered combat, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which ended the war, and facilitated the cancelation of his orders.  Although the war ended, McMahon continued his service in the Marine Reserves as an officer. Once the Korean War began, McMahon's active duty status was reinstated. His primary role during that war was to fly Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs as a spotter for batteries and Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions and earned six air medals.

Rice is also active in his support of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation of New England. Rice's involvement with Major League Baseball's RBI program (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) resulted in the naming of a new youth baseball facility in Roxbury, Massachusetts in his honor in 1999. A youth recreation center in Rice's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina is also named in his honor.  Rice's most notable humanitarian accomplishment occurred during a nationally televised game on August 7, 1982, when he rushed into the stands to help a young boy who had been struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of Dave Stapleton. As other players and spectators watched, Rice left the dugout and entered the stands to help 4-year old Jonathan Keane, who was bleeding heavily.

The wide use of boomboxes in urban communities led to the boombox being coined a "ghetto blaster", a nickname which was soon used as part of a backlash against the boombox and hip hop culture. Cities began banning boomboxes from public places, and they became less acceptable on city streets as time progressed.  The boombox became intrinsically linked to hip hop culture and, as Fab Five Freddy puts it, was "instrumental" in the rise of hip hop. Certain models like the JVC RC-M90 and the Sharp GF-777 were known as the boombox kings, having the power to drown out other ghetto blasters; they were frequently used in music battles.

The latest attempt, led by neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley from the University of California, San Francisco, kept it simple by targeting a single cognitive skill: multitasking. In a study published Wednesday (September 4) in Nature, Gazzaley and his colleagues demonstrated that a handful of training sessions behind the wheel in a 3-D racing game could improve multitasking performance, and that such improvements lasted up to six months.  Gazzaleys group developed the game, called NeuroRacer, to test the multitasking abilities of subjects ranging in age from 20 to 70. NeuroRacer requires players to steer a car around a winding track with a finger on their left hand while signaling the presence of randomly appearing road signs of a particular shape and color with a finger from their right. The researchers found that initial game performance declined linearly with increasing age.  After playing the game for just 12 hours over a four-week period, 60- to 85-year-old subjects improved to the point that they outperformed 20-year-old subjects who had never played it before. The observed performance improvements lasted for six months following the initial training.  Certain cognitive abilities that were not specifically targeted by the gamesuch as working memory and sustained attentionwere also improved among the older subjects. NeuroRacer doesnt demand too much of those particular abilities, Gazzaley told Nature. So it appears that the multitasking challenge may put pressure on the entire cognitive control system, raising the level of all of its components.  Gazzaley cautioned against over-hyping his teams results: Video games shouldnt now be seen as a guaranteed panacea, he told Nature.  Other scientists are taking a wait and see approach. The science is still too early to know how much it can help, Douglas Gentile, head of the Media Research Lab at Iowa State University, told The Wall Street Journal.  Emil Toescu, a neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, agreed. The technology is not yet sufficiently proven to recommend itself for immediate adoption by older people, he told The Telegraph.

 What are the implications of that? Do I lose all of my other purchased content?   I was in Canada last week for vacation. It still astounds me how polite they are compared to US Americans. And yes, I know, that's a joke, but it's also true. Seriously, anytime we needed help the people were extremely helpful and gracious. Hell, even the bums panhandling for cash were polite by asking if they could have a minute of our time. The border officers too. My wife somehow cut her leg with her shoe (no idea how she managed, maybe itching a mosquito bite) and the border officers insisted on taking a look to make sure she was ok and providing bandaids so she wouldn't bleed on her clothes. Genuinely super nice people.  You Canucks have a pretty awesome country, don't let the conservatives up there ruin it for you.   The terrifying part is I am seeing more and more republicans supporting him. They love people who spout their racist BS out loud. But don't mention that he had bankrupted several businesses and that his crowning achievement,  selling Atlantic City on casinos, has caused the city to turn into a massive disaster.   If the goal is to get to the UK because they lack an ID requirement, why not just spend the required time in the foreign legion to get French citizenship?   Yay! OP is the real MVP :)   Well, OP tried making it with actual Kiwis but they kept resisting and muttering something about sheep when he tried to put them in the blender.   OP don't leave us hanging you bastard! Share the recipe!   Hey everyone. I am about to tackle this epic. I found a transliteration (honestly, a podcast). I know it is an  utterly massive work. Any advice on how to approach it?  I know when I attempted war and peace it was suggested to keep a notebook to track all of the characters who are introduced so you can keep them straight in your head. Is this similar in scope?   Today my wife and I were in Ithaca NY for lunch, and there was a guy handing out leaflets. As we walked buy I shook my head and said no thanks. He stiffened up and started going off about how he should thank me for showing him that some people think they are so superior they will hush someone without even giving them a chance to talk. At least that's what I think he said... I was already walking away. I was uncomfortable,  my wife was uncomfortable,  but it did make me think a little bit.  In my day to day life I work in a very large city, and am constantly bombarded by panhandlers, crackheads, the supposedly homeless, buskers, etc. When I first moved to the city I tried to at least hear them out, but after a few really bad experiences I just stopped paying any attention to them (up to one time when police got involved because a guy started going violent). They talk to me and I walk by like they aren't there. At most I may give them a "no thanks" without even looking at them.  The thing is... these are people. There is another soul behind those eyes with thoughts and emotions. And not all of them are violent crazies or crackheads. Am I doing something morally abhorrent by not even giving them a chance to speak? Am I acting superior by mentally putting those people in the same mental white noise category as passing cars?   You look pretty as is, I wouldn't change a thing (not creepy internet guy hitting on you, just stating the facts).  That said, you are the only one who has to live in your skin. If it matters enough to you that you think it is worth the risks (from regret and financial hardship, up to botched surgery and permanent disfigurement or even death) then go for it.  Just remember that plastic surgery can become addictive, and always have you chasing the next improvement. Instead of learning to love yourself and becoming comfortable in your own skin, you can find yourself seeking out and focusing on your imperfections. You can find yourself constantly chasing some unreachable goal of perfection that will always be driving your self esteem down because you just cant accept how you look.   Sadly this was true. Also you always had one... less than attractive... girl there who acted like a diva because many of the neckbeards got caught up in "OMG A GIRL" fever.  There were a lot of posers and script kiddies who were "l33t". There were ALSO a bunch of industry guys who had "adult" conversations about real network and system security issues. That was me. It wasnt all "omgh4x0rz".   If you listened to people and asked questions you could learn a hell of a lot. Learning how to sniff tcp streams with wireshark and extract binary information from sessions was KILLER. It actually landed me a job promotion when I showed my employer, a medical PACS vendor, that they needed to use SSL OR TLS to encrypt all transfers because you could grab the images off the wire. Also learning how to execute poison ARP attacks. I also remember going to cons for competition hacking. That stuff was COOL.  Sadly I also remember having to explain to guys what telnet was and how proxies worked a hundred times.  I wonder if the group still meets up...   Admission = you are given a room by the doctor's order and legally considered an inpatient. This happened in the ER, which is considered outpatient care. They aren't the same thing.   http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/newoldage/2013/10/29/two-kinds-of-hospital-patients-admitted-and-not/   Sadly this is true. My ex was pregnant and we took her to the hospital due to hemorrhaging. They never admitted her. The doctor checked her vag and determined it was an ovarian cyst that had burst. They gave her 2 bags of saline, and took blood for bloodwork. She left the hospital after 2 hours.  The charge was $16k without her even being admitted to the hospital.   Sort of. Bubble hash can be made using ice water and no extraction.  Wax is exclusively made using the butane process (put pot in a tube with a nozzle, force butane through it and let it drip on a tray, scrape up goop after it stops bubbling). Basically you can warm that goop to remove more butane and it takes on different physical appearances depending on how pure it is and how much butane was removed.  Wax looks like earwax.  Overall its like traditional hash.   Damnit, I live about 30 minutes from one of the largest pork processors in the US and we never ever get deals like this, not even manager specials (and I am buddies with a butcher). How do you guys do it?   Is it poisonous? Usually colors that bright serve as a warning dont they?   Fox makes nice bike shorts that come with a padded pair of underoos that you cut out. You can wear those underoos under anything to pad your bum.  As some other folks mentioned, the soreness should go away over time if the bike is fitted properly. But I can understand wanting some relief in the meantime.  Also a good saddle is a great investment, but they will take time to break in. I love brooks saddles but they take lots of miles before they're really fitted properly to you.   Some window break sensors work by detecting the sudden pressure change created when a window gets smashed on an otherwise closed vehicle.    Is this more or less sensitive than a window break sensor?   Probably several grand split across many sessions, each costing a few hundred. Ink like this is never done in a single day.   Honestly? You won't. At least not in the short term. I grew up in the country on a farm, so hitting the occasional bun or turtle with a lawnmower (or worse, tiller - vegans have no idea how many animals die because of plant based diets) happened all the time. It sucks. A lot.  You just have to remember that the mechanism for rabbit survival is outbreeding what the predators can kill. A lot of bunnies die. A LOT. Heck, they will literally kick so hard they'll snap their own backs and die if they're startled. They're just not sturdy animals.   It's shallow comfort I know, but there is a huge possibility that bun wasn't going to live long anyway. That's the best I've got for ya.   My biggest concern about google these days is that there are so many antitrust rumblings starting to bubble up.  If that takes hold, it could quickly impact google. Especially if, in the worst case, they were forced to divest into several companies. A lot (nearly all) of their services rely on free access to data from other google services, and having to pay to access this could quickly chew up any revenue for the newly created companies.  Apple I have never been enchanted with (I know several engineers who were badly screwed over by Jobs). Jobs left a 5 year plan, and much like when Gates left MS to Balmer, Tim Cook isn't a visionary as much as he is a sales guy. I mean, quality is already slowly slipping (reception issues on iPhone 5, the bendable iPhone 6, etc). They're already near the top, and they cant stay there forever. Android devices are coming out with new features far faster than apple, apple is starting to play the "hey, we can do that too!" game and is innovating less and less with new products, and just repackaging things other companies have done. The one thing they may be doing is the apple car, which could be an interesting twist but I doubt it will supplant their main business.  Tesla I think has an interesting future, especially when their lower price model becomes available.   That's kinda the reddit MO these days. If someone asks a question or has a misconception and asks for clarity people rate them down. It's sadly just kinda the way things are now. I agree, it sucks.   Challenge: trying to slim jim a car that is on fire and has a person trapped inside desparately trying to work the handle as you're doing it.   This is hugely helpful. A friend of mine died in a car fire and the thought of it happening to anyone, let alone my family, absolutely terrifies me. I'll pass this on.   Fruit leathers.  We have a farm market across the street and they have a discount rack for fruits and veggies that are super ripe or starting to mold.  We take them, cut off any bad parts, liquify them, and spread them on a fruit leather tray in a cheap dehydrator. 12-24 hours later you have what are essentially fruit roll ups that you can eat guiltlessly.  A week ago we picked up 10lbs of strawberries for 9.90. Half got turned into fruit leathers, the rest turned into several pints of strawberry jam and thrown into the pantry.   He is incorrect on one part (unless the law changed in the last 7 years which is possible). You are in fact allowed to buy more than 192 ounces at a six pack shop if they choose to let you.  However you are not allowed to PHYSICALLY LEAVE the store with more than 192 ounces in your possession. So, you could buy twice that, but you can only physically walk out of the store with half of it at a time.  This leads to some hilarious situations where you watch college kids trying to buy a bunch of 40's realizing that they can only carry out 4 at a time, and maybe one or two bottles of their six pack. They then have to drop that off in their vehicle or set it outside the door of the shop, walk back in and get the next 192 ounce qty, and repeat until they have everything.  Even if you have a group of 2 people the group can only leave the premises with a volume less than 192 ounces. They would then have to return and get the rest.   Gov Wolf is also in the pocket of the PA malt beverage distributors association who are very happy with the status quo.   Thats not really true. PA is one of the largest states in the union, and while most of the major metropolitan centers are sort of near borders (lehigh valley, delaware valley, pittsburgh, etc) they are still often an hour away. If you are in the middle of the state it is easily a 2+ hour drive across a border.   I live in the Lehigh Valley and it is about 30 minutes to NJ. I have to make the trip somewhat frequently to buy grain alcohol for making extracts. You can get a license in PA for free, but there are only 2-3 stores in the state that carry 90%+ grain alcohol so even if you have the permit you're screwed if you arent near them.  If you live in Philly you could go to Camden if you really don't value your life.   This depends a lot on the restaurant and how tightly they want to play it. The concern is straw buyers... where someone buys it who is over 21, and hands it to a person who is under 21.   I used to work at a beer distributor (the only stores legally able to sell beer that dont have a "cafe" license). This is totally true. The PALCB (liquor control board) charges breweries to allow their products into the state. When we got special requests we would have to look up the brewery and individual beer to see if they had paid the PALCB the bribe money to let the beer exist in the state.  This combined with the fact that regional distributors (google the 3 tier system for more info) are aligned with either SABC or InBev means that most breweries simply can't deal with the state.  It also leads to horror stories where bars got rare bottles, kegs, etc and the PALCB confiscated and "destroyed" all of it.    As a Pennsylvanian, our laws suck. Worse still is that the PA LCB tries to justify them by saying "theu result in cheaper prices for consumers because the state buys in bulk" yet if I go 10 miles over the border into NJ, I always pay less.  Stupid outdated laws need to go away.   Courtney cox in a heartbeat, so no worries.   Not to mention, cartels don't instantly fight every time they talk. Suppose Guzman doesnt have "a guy" near you. But another cartel does. They trade x amount of product in exchange for cartel #2's "guy" to dispose of you. You go away, Guzman is happy, the cartels have their business transaction, and everyone continues on their merry way. Except you, you're dead.   Sadly I have actually started seeing some really dumb people supporting him and saying he would get their vote. Never ignore stupid people in large numbers.   I don't know if they would survive. Despite Texas secession enthusiasts fapping over rose tinted history, the Republic of Texas was on the verge of collapse when it joined the union (and wanted to join so desperately that it relinquished large portions of land on its northern borders to do so). The republic encountered massive issues with droughts, self defense, and being unable to afford any kind of meaningful infrastructure.   So Texas has its own power grid? Cool! But good luck getting nuclear fissile material. Or natural gas when the US shuts off the pipes. Coal is absolutely not going to produce enough to power the whole state.  Self defense? Well considering the mass exodus of federal workers and military there will be massive portions of Texas with no meaningful defense. And Mexico is right there seeing its old land defenseless. Thats if the cartels didnt start taking over swaths of now defenseless land. The abandoned Fort hood under the control of the narcos would be interesting wouldnt it? Especially when the usual MO for the US military abandoning a base is to leave equipment behind (or sell it by weight to the highest bidders).  I'm not saying they can't survive, I'm just thinking most Texans don't realize how deeply in shit they would be swimming if they left the union.   The Texas republic failed, and history tends to repeat itself.   And this is why I am slowly convincing my wife that we need to retire in Holland.   Is that what the God Dang Mongorians use to knock down the shitty wall?   Wow, I never thought I'd be thankful for Sodexo.   So out of curiosity what happens if someone receives a fatal punch? Is it considered manslaughter instead of murder because you weren't actually assaulting the other party?   I am not a cop. However when I worked at a gas station a decade ago we offered free coffee and donuts to all police as a way to get them to come through more often (this wasn't in the best neighborhood so the extra protection police provided was appreciated).  Not all officers took advantage of the offer, but we certainly saw about half of the local precinct coming in and out regularly. So I'd say that it certainly doesn't phase all officers. I can't speak to the officers who didn't come through though. I'd guess some just don't like to eat coffee and donuts, or they're watching weight, or whatever. And then there may be a handful who feel a stigma.   Jackal ears!   I am offering a new unregulated private hedge fund called SOUPGUNS. Our goal is long term hedging by trading options on companies producing cans of soup and guns, and use profits to build both a large soup kitchen and armory. You can make your check payable to /u/train_subject8232.  /s   Hey everyone. Of all things, this was kicked off by a comment I saw on youtube stating that "you don't have to respond to a police officer in any way due to the 4th and 5th amendments, and that includes providing your name."  Always, I was told that if stopped by a police officer, you are expected to provide your name, and in some states, they can compel you to provide ID.  But the comment did make me think - which is correct? If you refuse to provide your name to an officer, is it considered reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop? No matter which one is right, what is the actual case law on this?   Assets.   You may want to check out /r/askelectronics  There may be some mining folk there who can give you help too   3edgy5me   Um, you may want to make sure the kid goes to a doctor. Dead birds are bad juju and can be a sign of west nile. God forbid the kid would get sick. Just trying to look out for a fellow redditor cuz that's the shit people will sue over in a heartbeat.   http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/faq/deadbirds.html   Groop power!  /r/groopmasterrace   It's like the Stanford prison experiment's wet dream.   Yeah, it doesn't feel like it does it?   I am not OP. However I was on a flight to Las Vegas where a guy nearly died two years ago. Apparently he was a severe hypoglycemic or diabetic (not sure which), and he kept asking the attendants if he could purchase food because he needed it, but they kept refusing because first class had to be served first.  Then he went into a coma. The person next to him started screaming for help thinking he was dead.  Cue flight attendants realizing they fucked up and turning ghost white. Cue passengers freaking out because dead guy. They announce asking if there is a doctor on board, and if there is if they would identify themselves. The guy was extremely lucky because there was apparently some kind of MD convention going on at the Four Seasons, and like 12 people stood up.  The only reason I know about the convention is I was staying at the four seasons and saw those same folks walking around in tuxes and gowns.  They put a packet of sugar under his tongue I think? They kept tapping his face to wake him up. When he came to the attendants basically gave him all the food he could want and more.  Still, it was pretty nervewracking as a passenger for about an hour. I can't imagine how the attendant felt.  This was on US Airways. Don't fly with them in coach or business if you have blood sugar issues.   150 years is a long time to wait for delicious soup :(   Nope.gif  Beautiful photo but it may take awhile to get the boys to come back out, if you know whut i mean.   Death is a personified character in both Marvel and DC universes. Different characters, but both are Death.  Marvel death: http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150126144913/marveldatabase/images/b/b3/Death_(Earth-616)_from_Deadpool_Vol_2.png  DC death: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Death_(DC_Comics).jpg Personally I like the DC Death character more - she's a quirky Gothy woman who tends to be pretty awesome. Not badass or anything, just awesome, kind, etc. She's especially endearing since she is in cool things like a [PSA about safe sex](http://io9.com/5750398/neil-gaimans-1994-safe-sex-psa-starring-death-from-sandman-and-john-constantine/) costarring Constantine. She tends to be the voice of reason for her siblings.   I like my coffee like I like my women.  ...ground up in the freezer.  Wait, that's not right...   It shouldn't carry very far at all, especially if your state allows JHP/home defense cartridges to be used. Hooray for Pennsylvania, they actually let us use [home defense JHPs](http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1367631/oscar-pistorius-trial-dum-dum-bullets-killed-reeva-steenkamp.jpg) (essentially JHP dum dums).   A buddy has a five-seven USG and I LOVE shooting that thing. Sounds like a beast, but has recoil somewhere between a 22 and 9mm pistol. I'd love to play around with a five-seven mk2 but no one around here carries them.   It's probably the only thing I would consider using to replace my Ruger SR9 because while I love it, my wife occasionally stovepipes it. For a home defense weapon, that's kind of a deal breaker for us.   Do you know if home-processed fruit is ok? Specifically, my wife and I have pureed/dehydrated a bunch of fruit into fruit leathers.   FYI, I actually just called the Canadian Border Services Agency. If you haven't called them, they are incredibly helpful. You can also talk to a person almost immediately - it takes about 5 minutes to get just about anything answered. You can call 1-204-983-3500 to reach them (you can press 0 at any time to get a human). (source: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/contact/bis-sif-eng.html)  Sadly US Border Services hotline is an absolutely pathetic shit show and you'll probably go insane before you talk to a real human. However, the number to reach them is 18772275511 (provided to me by the Canadian border services agency).  Since you are crossing both into Canada and then into the US, you have two different sets of policies to worry about.  Also - I called them because I will be bringing a quart of kerosene and a quart of coleman fuel across into canada, and then back into the US for the second half of a camping trip. Apparently it is allowed into Canada, but I don't have any idea about the US border yet.   To be honest - the harry potter books, and the Witcher series (the translations). I literally read one a day, daily, over a christmas vacation when I was in college. I'd get up, start reading, finish and look up and see 3am or later.   We have been looking at picking up one of the coleman CPX6 tent fans: http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-CPX%C2%AE-Lighted-Tent-Stand/dp/B008DCYDH8  However the product details seem to show it is a free-standing floor fan. I am looking for something that can be used as a floor stand, or attached to the top of my dome tent (using a Big Agnes flying diamond 6).  Any suggestions would be awesome!  This will be for use in summer months in the northeast US. Budget is about $50 for the fan and battery pack.   Come play with us!  http://www.sundaydumbday.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Shining-Danny-Lloyd-Come-Play-With-Us-Forever.jpg   Can confirm. Our basement door has kid's heights marked on it. We've been here 3 years and I have no intention of removing it until we gut that section of the house which is years off.   I would give up eating steak if I could have fried sweetbreads and blood puddings/sausages instead.  And 100% agree - I feel like the tongue section was a lot lackluster. It takes well to any braise, not just chili sauce. Treat it low and slow like a pot roast and slice very thin after peeling.   How did it turn out? I've wanted to do this but most recipes seem to suggest piercing the leg in a bunch of spots and plugging in bits of pork fat to make up for the lamb's lack of fat.   Is that broccoli with hollandaise?    Food safety wise in the US, store bought ground beef should probably go that high if it is coming out of a large processor, especially if it had to travel. The chance of foodborne nasties is just too high with ground beef. You can still have a moist burger cooked to a safe temp if you use a panade which will keep it moist even when well done. Take a slice of bread with 1 tbsp of milk mashed into a paste and mixed in to the meat then cook to temp. Still not great for purists, but it will yield a moist burger.  If you want it cooked to a more reasonable temp - like the bovine deserves to be cooked - it's better to just grind it yourself from a large cut (or chop in a food processor if you don't have a grinder). The chance of problems drops to almost nothing so you have a ton of flexibility.  Then you can get it your way, with your favorite grind, cooked to the temp you like. I like mine 115-130 depending on my mood.   *Worse* is subjective. Other people may have different tastes.  I personally agree with you - I love grass fed with a grain finish. But not everyone has the same tastes as us.   If you ever have the chance, I recommend trying these 3 in a blind taste test:  * Pure grain fed  * Pure grass fed  * Grass fed finished on grain  Each one DOES have a slightly different taste. Grass fed can have a slightly gamier, stronger taste. Grain fed can be kind of sweet and tends to have more fat. Grass fed with a grain finish falls somewhere in the middle, and is my personal favorite. Not that I'd turn down any of them :) All of this is in a spectrum though, because genetics of the livestock can have a big impact too before food even becomes an issue.  If you really are hooked on grass fed beef, find your local dairy/cattle farms and see which ones are ok with you visiting. These are the guys you want to deal with - the ones who say yes are 99.9% legitimate. You should become friends with your local farmers anyways, they're good folks and buying directly often gives you a better price than market, and it puts more money in your farmer's pocket because they don't have to sell in bulk through a series of middlemen who each want a cut (and believe me, they need the cash).   Did you get it at an Asian market? If so, usually mock meat is made of seitan (wheat gluten). It's high protein, and has a very meat-like texture. However it isn't meat. It will also give you some horrific gas.  If it's something else, post back because I'd love to know. I'd never heard of it outside of that context.   Awesome, thank you!   Not OP, but I'm pretty sure that's lodge. They usually have the lip on either edge.    Telephony product development/r d engineering.   Yup. But he is also aware that there are about 40 people with my skillset in the US (and shrinking), and on average people who leave our team are hired by competitors within a week. There's a noncompete clause but they don't hold up in court, and the competition is companies like AT T, Verizon, etc. They can and do fight it.  Believe me, I do my best to get into the office in time, and I stay within the boundaries I am given. And none of this is meant to sound cocky. But my boss is very aware of how hard it is to find replacements for our team (we have openings for years at a time), and he knows that its a 4+ year investment to train someone who is a greenhorn. He also knows that the products we, a team of 4 people, make is the fastest growing product portfolio in our company (responsible for 4.8b revenue last year, aiming for 6b this year, and huge amounts of IP). So they give us a lot of legroom.  I suppose I should preface my original post with "your results may vary" because I have a bit more sway than the average worker.   I would but sadly that would cost my wife her job. She's a music specialist teacher who has tenure in an area where most schools are cutting arts programs. If she quits there is a very real chance she won't find another job.   Honestly? A job that pays 4x the median income for where I live. I am young and I know it won't last forever. They know it too, which is why they extended the telecommuting offer. Plus usually the max trip is about 3 hours if the trains are slow. 4 is usually a huge problem like flooding or snow.  Plus, my wife is a tenured music teacher. Were we to move, she would have to find new work, and that isn't a really easy job to find. Especially not with most schools in our area being on the verge of bankruptcy and cutting music/art programs.  This way I suck up the commute and get paid handsomely and can telecommute, my wife keeps her job, we keep our house. I honestly don't mind the drive - I worked as a professional driver for several years so lots of time behind the wheel doesn't really phase me. Plus about an hour of the commute each way is on a train so I can read, work or nap.   Q for you. When you make head cheese, is the brain left in?  I am in talks with a local farm to buy a hog and process as much as I can myself (I want the blood, sausage casing, the head, the trotters, etc and normally those parts aren't included).  I've never made headcheese but I usually just see the head get plunked down in some simmering water with some spices. I'd assume since brain is mostly fat it would more or less dissolve like bone marrow does?  And would it screw up the head cheese if I remove the jowls to make guanciale?   Well, there's more to it than that. She received half of them, filed a lawsuit because TWC wouldn't stop calling her, and sued them successfully. They STILL didn't remove her from their robo callers, for another half of that 153+.  The judgement was largely punitive because TWC claimed they didn't have a way to know she wasn't the intended party, and the judge basically said "SHE FARKING SUED YOU ALREADY NUMBNUTS". I wouldn't have wanted to be TWC's defense attorney.   Heh, I had a boss say that to me one time (at my current job, actually) because I showed up a half hour late.   I reminded him that my commute can vary from 2 hours to 4 hours *one way* based on traffic, and mechanical conditions, and unless he wanted to increase my pay to justify making me get up at 2:30/3am (I already have to get up at 4:30am) I will base my departure time off the average time. I then calculated the duration of my average drive/train trip, and the number of work days in the year - because as it stood I was already spending 56 days a year just commuting back and forth to work.  Not only did it not come up again, but after a year I was given the privilege to telecommute 2-3x a week (or more if bad traffic or weather conditions caused a problem).  It helps that I not only have a good boss but also a fairly low-key office.  There's not a lot you can do when you leave early when traffic reports are clear, only to go to hell an hour later when you still have another hour of commuting left to go. I refuse to acknowledge fault because I'm not psychic.   Crap, I searched for it but it was showing results from 2-3 months ago. I switched to responses from the last week and a ton of stuff showed up. Thanks for the heads up, I'll delete the thread.   Well, on the upside shares of those emerging market funds are about to get cheaper for a little while.   http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/03/16/16-baghdad-bob.w529.h352.2x.jpg   From my perspective (and most pleb investors) they aren't really going to ever have a lump sum - at least not at an appreciable amount that most investors would really consider a lump sum. So in that case, it makes sense to invest like you said - what you can, when you can. Just do it on a set schedule so you don't start skipping it.  By buying that way, say, once every month, even if you aren't intending to it is still functionally the same thing as DCA, isn't it? Even if you aren't saying "well, it's a little high right now, so I'll take this 10k and invest 1k a month for the next 10 months" it's still more or less what you're doing. You just don't have the long term plan. The nice part is you likely end up with a much lower cost basis over time, but you do lose out on the dividends (if applicable) because you didn't have the lump sum invested up front.  If I (or OP) had a lump sum to invest, I would really be torn honestly. I've been in funds that have lost a TON before. I've also been in stocks that have gone completely worthless. I'd probably end up doing a mix of both based on current market conditions.  You make some really good points.   No worries! Sadly the downvotes began yesterday before I ever mentioned it (every single post in this thread was downvoted). I've already reached out to the mods/admins because the same user seems to be downvote-stalking me for the past 48 hours.   Really?? I definitely need to check that out! I thought they had a flat commission per trade instead of per day. Thanks for the tip!! Anything that can shrink my expenses would be huge (everything is long game for me).   Can you provide citations showing DCA is less effective than lump sum buying? It's honestly the first I've ever heard that assertion.  Edit: Thanks for the posts guys! Good info to look through   This is with sharebuilder/capitalone. It is high, I agree! But it isn't a "normal" stock purchase.   Basically you choose 7 funds (several you cannot get commission free from the fund creator), and then they execute the trade on all of them for the 19 dollar commission. So instead of a $7 commission for each trade, you get 7 trades for 19 dollars.  More info here: https://www.capitaloneinvesting.com/a/main/Trade/PortfolioBuilder   Lots of good questions, though I fear I'll just get rated down again if I respond, but what the hell.  I track a LOT of accounts (17 currently), and maintain ledgers on all of them to the cent. However, checking accounts serve a fundamentally different purpose than the majority of those accounts. There is constantly cash going in and out, and we have multiple people using the account (myself and my wife). This leaves a lot of opportunity for errant charges to slip in.  For balancing the checking account, I do two things - first I check that every charge referenced in my checkbook has a matching line item on the statement and vice versa. If there is anything in one but not the other, I take the appropriate actions.  At the same time I check the amount of each transaction - while the amounts are rounded, they are never more than 99 cents off. While this still could potentially cause problems with transposed number errors, it still gives me enough precision to see if I am off by more than 1 dollar.  The small 99 cent amounts are never reconciled against the account. The net effect is that in your checkbook you will always show a smaller amount than what is actually in the account.  The major benefit is for people who don't have cash to set aside to put an actual buffer in their checking account, and are constantly overdrafting. It essentially lets them slowly build up a buffer over time by borrowing a few cents at a time from themselves in their checkbook, while not actually removing the money from their account.   The problem with moving it to a savings account is many checking accounts don't offer overdraft protection, so moving it to another account gets rid of the "buffer" it provides in the checking account. Even the most diligent accounting still can miss the occasional errant transaction, charges cleared by accident, or charge placed by a spouse that they forget to tell you about when you are doing your weekly banking. This extra amount can absorb that before any overdraft protection would get kicked off, or worse, any overdraft charges get levied against you.   I am handling an account for 2 people, so we have about a 1-200 transactions a month. That would quickly become overwhelming.   Not really, and I'll tell you why.  My other account ledgers are tracked to the cent (I track about 17 different accounts).   The only exception is the checking because it has a fundamentally different function from savings accounts (money constantly going in and out, therefore it is the most likely account to have an errant transaction, a forgotten bill, etc). Plus our checking account is the only account that several people spend from directly, so if my wife makes a large purchase without letting me know but doesn't realize we have 2-3 bills coming up, we don't end up with an overcharge.  By introducing a small buffer on each transaction, they are easy to check against the statement (if I record 10 transactions but the bank shows 11, something is awry). The amounts are never more than 99 cents away from the actual amount so it is still relatively easy to catch errors (if I record a grocery trip at 5 dollars, but it shows as 30 on the statement I know there is a problem). This would not protect you from some simple transposition errors, so that is a caveat.  While your idea of adding a buffer immediately is great and absolutely works, the problem is a lot of people on this sub don't have 2-300 dollars to put in an account at one time. This method allows the folks who never seem to have any money and are chronically broke to slowly build up that buffer over time without requiring an up front amount to use as a buffer. If you have a way that works for you, awesome! But this post wasn't really meant for you. It was meant for those folks who are constantly overdrawing their account and can't seem to get enough cash back to establish a buffer in the first place. This lets them establish the buffer slowly over time because a little less precision matters less than getting slammed with overdraft fees on a monthly (sometimes weekly or even daily basis).  I do agree, it can be a little annoying if I am trying to calculate exactly the size of the buffer because it requires not spending for a day or two so everything clears, and then checking the difference between the checkbook balance and the ledger balance.  I fully expect to get further rated down for responding to this, since everything else I posted got rated down. God forbid people present different ways of doing things that have worked extremely well for them. So please don't take it as an affont if you respond and I don't post a reply.   dillar dillar bill ya'll.  Seriously though, touchscreen keyboards suck BFDD.   It's for the portfoliobuilder service that sharebuilder offers (you pay one fee, they invest in 7 different funds). A number of the funds/ETFs offered can't be invested in directly through the firms that created them without a commission, so it usually comes out to a much cheaper price than what I can get on my own to invest in 7 funds separately. Plus it keeps things consolidated so I don't have to keep track of 5+ brokerages. So it sounds like a lot (and it is) but there are some benefits you get for the price.  Luckily for single company/CEF investing everything else I'm interested in is offered on robinhood or vanguard so I can get it commission free. The only other brokerage I work with is fidelity when there is something that isn't offered elsewhere (and their commission is 8 dollars I believe? It's been awhile  since I've traded using them).   Yup, dillar cost averaging is your friend. Invest early, invest often.    Hopefully the title is clear enough. I do dollar cost averaging on a portfolio. Every other week I set aside about 200 dollars between two brokerages.   However the commission for a purchase ranges from 8 to 19 dollars (very high I know).  Assuming the worst case scenario of 19 dollars, in your opinion, how much should I actually have to invest before pulling the trigger?  Example: if I pull the trigger when I have $200, that means I instantly lose 10% to commission. If I wait until I have 2k, I am only losing 1%. What do you consider the appropriate commission to be?   Holy hell that was fast! It takes me an hour with a knife and a saw. Granted I dont have the same tools but still... respect!   My wife claims she has seen fruit trees for sale that have several different types of fruit trees grafted on - apples, pears, peaches, figs, etc.  Is this something you have to custom order from a nursery? is this a common thing? Where would I go to start researching where to find this in my area?   So jealous! I've wanted a fig tree for years!   If I had it...  Desalinate in water for 4 hours to get the salt and additive content down to something reasonable.  Throw it on a flat top with some onions, mushrooms, shred the meat, place on an amaroso or d'ambrosio roll with whiz or sharp provolone and a long hot.  When life hands you crap meat, make sandwiches.   And then there are Del tha Funky Homosapien, cunninlynguists, atmosphere, and other rappers who are all crazy talented but will never see airplay. Which sucks.   I'd have to throw Maynard James Keenan to this list. Roger Waters. Peter Frampton. And about a million more.   Yeah, also reddit was being a little shit about formatting into quatrains. Otherwise the rhyme pattern is pretty simple: ABAB CDCD EFEF GHGH  And youre correct, everything is in iambic pentameter (never really noticed, but now that you mention it every line is 10 syllables).   Nono thats the watch list you get on when you wear white after labor day!  This one just got you on regular watch list.   I would see this concert.   Whenever Richard Cory went down town,  We people on the pavement looked at him:  He was a gentleman from sole to crown,  Clean favored, and imperially slim.   And he was always quietly arrayed,  And he was always human when he talked;  But still he fluttered pulses when he said,  "Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.   And he was richyes, richer than a king  And admirably schooled in every grace:  In fine, we thought that he was everything  To make us wish that we were in his place.    So on we worked, and waited for the light,  And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;  And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,  Went home and put a bullet through his head.  "Richard Cory" by Edwin Arlington Robinson   No worries! It's a good idea if OP can handle cold calling and the area allows it. Most PDs will have a nonemergency number you can call to do your due diligence for questions and project support.  That goes for most business activities really. It's amazing what the pd will do to help you in general so long as you talk to them early on in your planning. We once held a large concert on the steps of a building in our town for charity, and the PD was awesome helping us. They provided a presence,  helped neighbors who were concerned about noise, advised us about ordinances and quiet hours - heck they said if we gave them more notice they would have been able to close the two streets at the intersection where it was held. All kinds of good stuff.  Never underestimate the power of asking! Give people the chance to say yes!   Just be very careful to clear the canvassing with the police first. Some areas get very pissy about solicitors.   Hm, do you know if they do tourist/guest permits in TX? Sounds like a good chance for free range pork bbq with some HS buddies who live out there.   Probably a combination of the Handmaiden's Tale, and a history book of the dark ages.   Well, at least we actually were doing some reconstruction this time. Unlike Haliburton after the first gulf war. So we've got that going for us, which is nice.   They really, *really* want Iran to get even more involved in this fight, don't they?   They also defined the Random Number Generator used by the NIST, which was then used to build elliptical curve cryptography. Effectively, they built a very long tailed backdoor.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG   The absolute best was Mutant League. I would LOVE for a modern mutant league game to come out.  Killing the ref in HD? Sharks swimming under the hockey arena?  Landmines on the football field?   Probably not. But that's not really the point. The point that it acts as a notice to you that something is weird, and then you can follow up on it. See the wrong number there? You can call your bank and the vendor to investigate. See some charge you have no record of? Call your bank and investigate. See a subscription fee that was applied to your account, even though you cancelled? Call the bank and the vendor to dispute the charge.   Ermehgrd Gersberms!!!!   You can use a checkbook or ledger to track more than just checks. Like a debit card.  And many municipalities require checks or money orders for things like sewer/garbage/taxes. I'd rather use a cheap check than pay $2 for a money order at the store, you know?   The problem is, mint just reports what the bank says happened. If a vendor overcharges you and the bank clears it, you have no written record showing that the amount should have been different unless you saved your receipt. Likewise, if an unexpected charge shows up, Mint doesn't really tell you. That's why I prefer the old fashioned method. I can spend 2 seconds to jot down the spend and then at the end of the month do a stare and compare between the written record and my statement (or Mint) and catch any problems.  The first time I caught a $100+ charge that was accidentally applied to my account I never looked back.   I'm pretty sure you can have a non-business joint account with a multiple signature requirement. I know you used to be able to at least. A long time ago my fraternity ran a memorial golf tournament, and as part of it we needed to put together an account to hold funds. We requested 2 signatures be required for any withdrawal and the bank was able to make that happen without it being a business checking account.   This was Sovereign bank around the year 2003 so things could have changed since then.   I do use checks for some small things - music lessons, paying bills. But I use my debit card daily. I just log it all the same way in my checkbook (checkbook app).   I don't use the physical checkbook, but I do use an app checkbook where I log every buy/spend I make. It also tracks my net worth, credit card spends, etc.   Do you compare your spends/deposits on your bank statement to those that you have recorded in your checkbook ever? It gives you the ability to point out fraudulent charges, or even if vendors accidentally mischarged you.   LOL! The first app I ever download on a new phone is my favorite checkbook app ;)  I guess I'm old fashioned! HA!   This was something my mother taught me a long time ago, and I have always done it. Whenever you make a purchase, round up to the nearest dollar, and whenever you deposit, round down. So, if you spend $1.01, you put a $2 spend in your checkbook. If you deposit a $100.50 paycheck, you put a $100 deposit in your checkbook.  The amounts are small, but over time add up first to a buffer for unexpected charges/clerical errors. Eventually when we get to over, say, a $1000 buffer, we'll pull half out and make an extra payment on our mortgage.  Obviously this requires that you keep a checkbook, and it does make it a little more difficult to balance your checkbook, but in the long run the benefits are worth it.  Does anyone else do this? Do you know of any other similar passive tricks to slowly build up little windfalls and buffers?   Thank you so much! Honestly, I am asking because I was thinking about the number of railroad ties on earth, and if they all had them, that must be a pretty good investment to make. We'd be talking millions and millions of them across the world.   Sometimes I wonder - am I the only person on earth who actively goes to shows/concerts and am constantly worried about whether or not I am blocking the person behind me? ESPECIALLY if they're a kid?  It probably stems from my first "big" concert, seeing Dave Matthews Band with my walker-bound cancer-patient father. We managed to get 2nd row seats, and were super psyched. The show started, and instantly everyone in the FRONT FUCKING ROW stood up on their chairs. View of the stage? Blocked. View of the video displays? Blocked. We literally could see nothing. Security basically told us to leave if we didn't like it. We asked the people in front of us to sit down, they gave my handicapped father the finger. Great band, horrific fans.  Anyway, always remember there are people behind you who paid for tickets too, and they may not be able to stand up. If you don't need to stand, sit in your goddamned chair. The 1 foot of height you gain isn't going to somehow make the artist notice you, and the view isn't any different.   I'll have to check that out, thank you!!   Fair question. Well, for example I believe I MAY HAVE stumbled across a bug with an older kernel (2.6.18-404) involving the bonding kernel module, and the bnx2 module. Basically, if you use them in a certain combination, the modules simply will not load and kernel won't even see them as present (even though they are).   As it stands, the issue has been in Red Hat's hands for several weeks now. They're doing their best to help (and this is in no way a dig against them), but without being able to actually look at and understand what is going on under the skirt, I am more or less beholden to them figuring it out. I think i know what's going on, but I can't confirm it because I don't know anything about what the kernel is trying to do when it fails, and where the failure actually occurs. I'm just kinda handing it off to the vendor and saying "Is broken, pls fix." In the meantime, I have servers in our QA lab that aren't able to function properly because they aren't running the same OS stack as our other machines, so any QA testing on them is currently invalid.  Basically, I want to be able to understand what is going on underneath so I can ask better questions, and therefore get better answers. I hope that makes sense.   Hey everyone. Let me start by saying that C was the first programming language I ever dabbled in decades ago.  As I get better and better using linux, I want to understand it more and more. I am a sysadmin for a fortune 500, and linux is basically my life. However, I am still constantly confronted by issues that I can't find any decent resolution for. I can ask a newsgroup, but I'd really like to help resolve them completely - not just for me - when I can.  I realize that eventually if I really want to understand it at deep level, I want to be able to look at the kernel source and understand it.  Likewise, I want to be able to drive hardware, and C is usually the best way to do that.  I know linux was written following Tenenbaum's book, but are there any really good modern, pragmatic texts for using low-level C today?   Hey Adam. First, let me say you're one of my heroes, and I respect you a lot. Thank you for everything you've done to help bring science to the masses, AND thank you for the entertainment.  Now for my question... my wife and I are trying to have a kid. No matter what this child ends up being interested in, it's important to both my wife and I that they're scientifically literate. We want them to be able to understand statistics so they can read news objectively. I want to make sure that they're able to be captivated, fascinated, and intrigued by the world around them. We feel that, even if they choose to go somewhere completely unrelated to STEM, that curiosity and desire for understanding makes amazing fuel for creativity.  As a geek dad yourself, I can only assume that you had similar wishes. How did you go about trying to instill that curiosity? Have you found that there are any major areas where it's no longer easy to expose kids to the sciences, and how did you overcome obstacles (for example, it's nearly impossible to get a chemistry set now)?   You're right.  But you also have to worry about student loans (easily as much as a small mortgage). You have to live somewhere, so rent or mortgage. You need a car if you can't live somewhere with good public transit, so gas and possibly car payments, parking costs, plus car insurance. Maybe an additional commute is required (train/bus/trolley passes). Plus the requirement to maintain medical insurance now in the US. Several folks have to deal with city taxes (Philadelphia is nearly 5% of your wages on top of state and federal taxes). If you own a house, you have to pay school, and per-capita taxes. Have a kid who needs daycare? Tack that on too.  Obviously the folks who are closer to the median income have it worse because a lot of these bills apply to them too and they're less able to afford it, but they also get some benefits that dry up when you earn above a certain point (lower overall tax bill, subsidies on insurance). I'm not trying to play a pity party sorta game because I recognize how well off I am in relation to other people, but it seriously doesn't feel like it sometimes.   These are the things that family tends to forget about. They see you earning 100k a year, and they think "HOLY COW HE HAS AT LEAST 100k IN THE BANK!!!" and it just doesn't work like that. Even when you purposefully live below your means.  No, I'm not paying for your kids' schoolbags just because you wanted to go out and eat every day for the past 3 weeks, and then blew $100 on kickstarter stuff (true story). I'm happy to help, but I'm not happy to get taken advantage of. And I'm especially not happy to encourage continued bad habits.   There was a show awhile back all about the science of stuntmen and daredevils. While bikers might not, those guys absolutely do. The physics and precision involved is incredible.   Basically what the title says.  I would assume most people believe in the speed of light, whether or not you believe in an old Earth. As a result, you would believe in the scientific basis for the light year as a unit of measurement.  If you accept that the speed of light exists, light from a star a million light years away would take a million years to get here. If the Earth and Universe are 5000 years old, that light wouldn't have gotten here yet. We would only be able to see stars about 5000 light years away. But we can see light from stars much further than that.  What do people believe to rationalize this flaw in the young Earth theory?   Wow, that size is simply *astronomical!*   We spent 31k on our wedding. We had a total of 125 guests, and food/booze for them, plus hotel space for bridal party chewed up a massive amount of that.  DJ, photographer, makeup and hair styling, stationary, etc. All of this added up fast. Etsy was great for stationary and thank-you cards.  We were given 30k as a gift from my wife's parents with the direction that we could use it for anything marriage related, and then the leftovers were ours to keep.  I wanted to do the Elvis wedding in vegas for a couple grand and then use the rest to pay off bills. My wife wanted a fancy wedding with all of our friends. She won.  We could have made it out cheaper except her best friend had just gotten certified as a wedding planner and started listing off everything we "needed" to do, which caused my OCD wife to flip out and start tacking on all sorts of crap. At a certain point I had to remind her that all we NEEDED was a 60 dollar license, 2 witnesses and 10 minutes of a magistrate's time - everything else was wants.  Luckily we had enough after the wedding to afford our honeymoon (2 weeks across the Netherlands, Belgium and France).   Pretty simple q I hope. I am wondering if anyone has read it, and if you did, did it help at all? Did it have "new" insights?  I am 31, and the first person in my family with a white collar job. My wife and I are the first to bring in over 100k. I have been almost obsessive about managing our finances ever since I had my boy meets world moment when I realized how much my student loans would be and that it left me with $25 a week for food, gas, and entertainment. I read "The Simple Dollar" and have followed it religiously since.  At this point, my wife and I only have 2 real debts... my student loan and our mortgage. So I don't really need budgeting help.   What I do need help with is handling family who see me as the richest person on earth, and how to handle the balancing act between helping out family and letting them manage on their own.   Every year I talk to the local turkey processor around november and put in a request for the largest possible bird they can find. This was from a Fresh 30lb [Jaindl](http://jaindl.com/) grand champion. Then break down into drumsticks, thighs (deboned), and boneless breasts. These are bagged and frozen.  The carcass and wings get sprayed with some vegetable oil and sprinkled with kosher salt and pepper, and thrown in an oven at 450 for an hour. Then simmered with junk veggies and herbs for about 6 hours (topping off as required) to replace lost liquid.  This was the last breast we had left, so I wanted to do something a little different. I love Memphis style ribs, so I figured I would use the same technique with a turkey breast. I didn't bother to wet brine because of time. I did do a 3 hour dry brine in our house rub.  I cooked on a Weber Performer Gold using the grill baskets for two-sided indirect heat. I wanted slightly higher heat to avoid drying out the breast, and I'm glad I did it. I used a mix of apple and cherry wood for smoke.  Every 20 minutes or so I mopped with our house mop (1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 3tbsp house bbq sauce, 3 tbsp house rub).  Smoked at around 275 for 1.75 hours. I have no specifics because we had storms rolling through the area and I didn't want my pitmasterIQ or my maverick to get soaked. I pulled at 170 because I was inside processing some jars of jelly and missed the mark by a few minutes. I had hoped to pull at 160 but it went from 130 to 170 way faster than I'd expected (40 degrees in a half hour!?). It was still crazy juicy though so no harm, no foul.  The smoke ring isn't too pronounced, but it still had a nice smoky flavor, even if it was a super quick cooking time.  Sliced into healthy slices, threw on a sandwich with some mayo and bbq sauce (not really Memphis style appropriate but hey, the sauce was in the mop and the bread needed a little extra moisture). Served with some bbq eel spring rolls for a nice fresh taste.      The researcher who originally discovered a link between gluten and inflammation (non-celiac gluten sensitivity), Peter Gibson of Australia, has since recanted since he has been [unable to replicate his initial results](http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/05/gluten_sensitivity_may_not_exist.html). However, it DOES appear that there is inflammation caused by FODMAPs which are almost always accompanying gluten. He suggests it is likely that either FODMAPs or a "nocebo" effect confounded his original results.  Thankfully the guy who is studying it is being very meticulous about his results and verifying everything is reliable.   Hm, I'll try removing it then and see if it perks up a bit. Thank you for your advice!     I actually haven't watered it, however we have had several substantial storms. Most of the water has drained out though the large saucer/reservoir on the bottom has had to be dumped 2-3x after some prolonged storms.  I'm wondering if I should try to move it under our carport the next time we know it's raining...  Also, happy cake day!   First, I am new to potted trees and in general have bad luck with potted plants, so I could really use some help to ID what I'm doing wrong. Raised beds? No problem! But put me in a pot and I have no idea how to make things work.  About 2 months ago I ordered this guy off Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CEVWO4I  It arrived in great condition about 12" tall. I promptly put it in a 22" pot. The pot was filled with mostly potting soil, with some plant-tone organic plant food mixed in. Drainage seems to be working ok. My intention is to move this in/out based on the season.  Almost immediately, the top leaves began turning brown. First, brown speckles everywhere. Then the leaves started turning almost completely brown. This seems to have only happened near the top of the plant. The plant has halted growth vertically. Instead, it seems to be sending off new shoots from the root crown (the bright red stems in the pictures).  There is no mulch on it yet because I wanted to be able to watch what was going on around the base. There seems to be a lot of green but I can't tell if it's coming from the roots or if it's some opportunistic little plants.  What can I do to help this plant along? Is it too far gone? I was really hoping it would get a big bigger before we had to move it inside for cold weather (which is about 3 months away at this point).  This gallery shows the plant as it looks right now: http://imgur.com/a/j5w0y   If it's a prescription med, it should be indicated whether or not he can drive. Scientifically speaking, research points to cannabis increasing risk aversion in drivers, making you LESS likely to get into an accident. HOWEVER not all people react the same way to the same drug, and in his case he could have issues focusing because of it.   Make sure you prune the dead canes off of the plants at the end of the season. One cane is usually good for one year only, and you have to prune them back at the end of the year for best production. Also, keep an eye out, wild mint loves to grow around raspberries for some reason.  We have a raspberry/wineberry/blackberry patch behind our shed and use it religiously. We're adding in another small patch for blueberries, and huckleberries.   SEPA, we have wineberries all over. They tend to be found towards the roadside and along trails. True raspberries and blackberries tend to be found deeper in the woods (at least around here).  They do make killer jam, compotes and pies.   Yup, they're wineberries.   Can confirm, they grow wild in our area (along with wild raspberries, blackberries, and loganberries). They're a bit tarter.   There are very sadly a lot of people who "go gluten free" because they've heard from a friend it's healthier while having no idea what they're talking about. So the study does actually have a valid basis at least insofar as it shows that "gluten free is healthier" isn't really scientific fact.  There was a Jimmy Kimmel sketch where they walked around the street asking random people who self-identified as "gluten-free" what gluten was and the answers were amusing and far, far away from what gluten actually is (a combination of the proteins glutenin and gliadin). It's a food fad currently.   This is beautiful, and I am so happy you found someone in HK to assemble it!   Oh and congratulations!!!   Draw me like one of your French Deadpools   That cake looks amazeballs. Is it an apricot on top??  	150
 i thought bears ate bones too?   He gets asked, "well, if you don't get paid, how do you keep the food on the table?"  He answers, "I keep the tips"   What if you lead someone into your home. You kill them and feed them to a grizzly bear that.frequents your home. You follow the bear and pick up its poo. You then put the poo in a bucket, buy weather balloons, let the wind carry the poo away. It will fall eventually, and wherever it falls, someone would assume its disposal from an airplane, and no one is going to investigate the poo   This is nothing.

Leave them on the floor so ants can come and eat the candy shank. Then some would think the ants killed the person and made a hole in their body?      Soon.

I was like wtf he makes art?   His friend didn't make this. He found this online and posted it saying his friend did this, he didn't. Guaranteed this has been posted 3 times before.

Justin actually looks like a woman   All I need now is to see a giraffe anus   They deleted the account for that video   Looks like the other guy has a sword up his ass   I feel like not wearing a bra would be easier   I can't believe I saw a rhino anus   threatens to kill "El Trumpo" aka "the Donald"   For some reason I thought her liver came out of her wrist   Is this post brought by Donald Trump? I feel like he's going to say, "since we freed the slaves look at all the shit they have done" srsly not all people are bad   Lol I'm searching for da pussy   I prefer to call him Jebron Lames   The car. The fucking piece of shit gave way in the middle of a highway and I ended up causing a collision. Where all 28 people died from one truck that rear ended me. Poor Mexicans. It is still something I have to overCOMB  --This message brought to you my Donald Trump   Ask when his machine was calibrated and how.    Well I would get pissed I couldn't finish my tunnel   Yeah everyone loves him for the most part. He donated shit tons to charity, schools, etc Some Mexican see him as a robin hood doing bad to do good   Lapras cause he is a dinosaur   Chuck e cheese guy fell on a disabled kid on his birthday. Gave him an expired coupon   For every second of fame my dick grows an inch   My asshole prolapsed   "3 gallons of blood in his dick"   Chapo guzman   Pussy   Residency   Yes I know but shrek is life   Ignorance is bliss by beartooth   In eight grade I saw a video of chips decapitating a drug lord. Sick stuff. There are blogs of druglords and cartels. Also Mexicans support el Chapo Guzman sorta. They pray for him, etc. He is considered like a Mexican Robin Hood. He literally donates shit tons to neighborhoods, schools, etc   About two and a half times the US population ~700000000 of people don't have access to clean water.

 Possibly slice mozzarella cheese and put it on top of that! All the cheese might be a bit too much, I'm just trying to think off the top of my head.    Thanks!! Oh jeez, you've got me stumped. I was going to say pita chips, but I guess that constitutes as bread as well. Honestly, if you really feel like eating it and don't have a substitute for bread, you can totally just use a fork/spoon and eat it! My sister dove into it after a while, she couldn't hold back! I hope that helps a bit, I can't think of much else besides bread or some type of chip!   Made a quick feta dip for my sister's birthday! I drowned it in olive oil a bit too much, but it was delicious.   http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2012/12/easy-feta-dip.html  Here is the recipe she gave me from Pinterest.       I drowned it a bit too much in olive oil, but the taste was incredible. My sister found it off of Pinterest, so I made it for her birthday!   http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2012/12/easy-feta-dip.html  There's the recipe! Enjoy!      I drowned it a bit too much in olive oil, but here is the recipe! Quick and easy. Took me less than an hour. http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com/2012/12/easy-feta-dip.html  My little sister got it off Pinterest, so I made it for her birthday.     As a redditor who just purchased a new car about a month ago, I would love to see an answer to this. I had a mini heart attack from the dealership all the way back to my house.    Exercise. I am by no means fat or overweight, and I've been into athletics and whatnot my whole life. I still to this day hate anything to do with exercising. I do not understand how people find enjoyment from it.    Throw a ball. I grew up playing hockey as a goalie. I can hardly even shoot a puck.

 If that were too happen. Wouldn't the middle class substantially?       Good points.  But can you answer my questions?  Thx   Maybe someone can enlighten me please,  Is wage "appropriately" adjusted to our current inflation? If minimum is $15, does that also mean the current minimum wage for jobs that require experience and education such as,  a nurse for example, need to rise as well? Facts , or opinions based on facts would be nice.  I'm just trying to explore through dialogue.    I'd love to have a psychoanalysis done on some of these billionares. Some deep shit are hiding in those closets.     I actually think he does believe it    Nsfw. http://i.imgur.com/SkhTK.jpg   And STAT if it goes through   Not to mention he left cavs with a sign and trade that sent our 1st round picks away. When he left miami it was bone dry. We are lucky to at least get this top 10 pick. Because we are not going to see one for a while....   I agree. At least it seems he won't be an every down bsck by splitting it with miller. Save him on wear and tear  	10
    The raptor is running in slow motion at first and it speeds up.   Hehe this is rad.   Ahahahaha this is GOLD! Using it right now.   appreciate it!   hey thanks man   Hey Mac, why are you going to Tucson AZ instead of Tempe or Phoenix? We hate Tucson here. It's the asshole of Arizona. :(  also I made a shitty music video for Special K last night [:)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu-QZmMtY74)  blessed be you   it's like Mountain Dew and Coffee Creamer put through some filters in Final Cut... haha I bullshitted so hard. But now that I have the idea I'm gonna try and put some more effort into it and make something cool.      Is it just me, or is SNL Black Skinhead on here has soooooo much more energy than the original track?   Are you happy with the current state of society?   Super dope.   I remember back in the day on Rotten Tomatoes, it was at an 85%, which was pretty good. Now it's at 93%. Time has definitely been very good to Jurassic Park.   Tyler the Creator, The Doors, Mac Demarco, David Bowie, Pink Floyd   I agree. What, did he manage to see his Bernie Sanders button on his tiny phone screen from 15 feet away? Yeah, bullshit.   Isn't techno so shitty? Even disco seems punk. The water's so filthy, it's no wonder why we're drunk.  Chinese Fountain by the Growlers   Honestly, this is my first time voting but I'll vote for him! I just hope it's not a lost cause.   I'm gonna play devil's advocate here: I was pressured into going to college and it was actually extremely beneficial for me. I learned a lot about growing up and figuring out what my place in the world is.   Yes, and I also think they did it to set up the joke where Lowery goes in for the kiss. I felt the cringe in the theater as he went in for the kiss like Owen did and they played it off perfectly. Biggest laugh in the film.   I actually have a younger cousin that behaves exactly like the youngest kid, believe it or not. I thought he was the most realistic character in the entire film.   What is his contract with Disney? He is the Tonight Show host on NBC, which is NBC Universal.   Hahaha that's awesome. Makes me really miss Richard Attenborough to imagine that he could have been in this movie. :(   Haha but I mean *this* exact shirt that I posted. Literally that one. Idk if it's just sold in high volume where I'm from (Tempe, Arizona) or what. I am not lying when I said I counted 17 in one night. That isn't including other varieties of the classic logo shirt.   is exactly like Richard Kiley's in Jurassic Park. "The voice you are now hearing is Richard Kiley! We Spared No Expense."   I think they were totally aware of that and the movie was being very self aware. That guy, Lowery, is basically the audience.   I LOOOVED the new score, and I'm happy the Composer tried to do his own thing without relying *too* much on the original themes. Even though there was a ton of the original in this.   Nooo no no, that isn't a hybrid. That's a dimorphodon, a real thing.      It's actually funny, I actually like the fact that it's reverse because it makes it unique. I always thought it was weird that they did that.     	30

Amen.   If you are white.   Well if you don't have any, who needs a board for it?   Obama is racist..., now give us money.    Trump supporters are limited. The are the extremist on the right side. Sure he has them but that is as far as it will go. When the  other candidates drop out, their support will not go to Trump.    Donald Trump believes in Donald Trump.   Here here!  It is insane to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When the rhetoric dusts settles down in the years to come, history will show Obama had the right approach and he will be remembered for it. That is unless we elect Scott Walker and he goes to war with Iran on day one of his presidency.  We have been doing this for decades and it had been a total failure.

But we don't 20 posts a day telling us this. This is not news.   Sure. I will PM it to you.   Looks like they are having a bit of a drought too.   I don't know if this would work but how about using a carpet shampooer.   http://cutecaptions.com/images/reddit-meet-lemondrop/ahhhh-i-want-my-mommy.jpg   Since when is not okay to say stewardess? I didn't get memo. Apparently I have been offending stewardesses for years now.   Sounds like the premise for a sequel to another "Ghost" movie.   I have not got a response from him yet. So I am thinking if you could send me a copy or screenshot of that contract you had him sign. Also let me know what state you are in. The next step I am considering is small claims. Having a contract will make that much easier and give us a much better chance of winning.   You'd think, huh?   Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma,   Why would it be?   You are so young. If you aren't married yet these could be the best years of your life.   Get your GE out of the way as fast as you can.   And the most important class you will ever take is you internship. Get one at a good place where you make contacts.   Bitch   Howling black mobs?   Wow, you actually out-editorialized the Daily Caller. I did not think that was possible.   I agree. I just want to see the circus Donald will undoubtedly bring to the debates.   Because  of the public.   Haven't heard about that. I hope not. I am looking more forward to this than I did Game Of Thrones.   Okay there Cletus.   Oh you know they will do their best to get it.   Yes each one will get bigger. That is how it works.

It's just the Bernie Army is  all excited. The Clinton folks will appear once the race gets going. It's just like last time with the Ron Paul armies. Quite annoying but they are entitled.    This sounds like a project he would do. He is very good and very fair. He can give you either a time bid and you pay materials, or a bid for the whole package. What city are we talking about?   That's cool.

I will do my best and will keep you informed.   I do as well. Pretty much the only other alternative is another quagmire of war. It's time for that to stop. I was just making light of Ron giving his blessing, like it was  was actually worth something.   Oh I have that already. I meant what was the agreement of how he would pay it back.   They are not injecting it. It's just a crane boom to pour it as usual. It pumps it to the top but is only filling a hole using gravity.   Well I'll  let you know right after we get rid of ISIS. That will only takes us a couple days.   I always travel through Tahoe when I am off to for desert camping trip in the winter. I just love it there. Retirement is calling me there. (someday)   Thank you. I will see what I can do to resolve this.   Could you PM me the arrangement you made with him so I know the details.   Can you please tell us who it is?   Oh yea. I love Tahoe!   Ughh! Well it's an El Nino year so keep your fingers crossed.   Woo Hoo! Sorry I missed that!   Tahoe is very special in a lot of ways.   * The water in Lake Tahoe could cover a flat area the size of California to a depth of 14 inches. This is enough to supply everyone in the United States with 50 gallons of water per day for 5 years. And believe it or not, the amount of water that evaporates from the surface of Lake Tahoe every year could supply a city the size of Los Angeles for 5 years.  * Tahoe has never frozen over. Waters are so cold in Lake Tahoe, staying a constant 39 degrees. The Lake Tahoe Basin has its share of below-freezing days and nights, but surprisingly enough the Lake itself has never frozen over. On occasion, Emerald Bay has been covered with a layer of ice, and ice also forms in cold protected inlets. However, Lake Tahoe's great depth and volume of water is always in motion and keeps it from being the world's largest ice rink.     Hey for us it was a monsoon. :D   How big of a job we talking about? I know a great guy (I work for him) but it has to be big enough to keep a couple guys busy for at least one day. He is a contractor and does excellent work.    Albertsons - I got fired from there years ago.   I liked his answer. It is actually the only real one that should be given. He had nothing to apologize for.   Because then there would be no need for religion.   Only me and Donald Trump know.   Muhawhawhawhawhawhawhaw!   Early morning drama turned into finding out that the head gasket on my car wasn't blown  like the mechanic said it was. (never going to that mechanic again)  Ended up being a good day.   Well great. Since Ron is okay with it, let's do it already. :D   :D   You mean there still is a Northern California? Oh my god, the rumors are not true. Praise the lord!   Laugh, laugh, laugh.   This is the most right-wing twisting of a story I've seen today. What a joke. It will effect all government employees if the republican led congress does not pass a budget.

    Ahhh but this is the question? Can you separate the art from the artist especially with the crimes he has committed?    Agreed but lets have some faith. Chinatown has just been nominated which is a classic that not many people have seen before. I aim to bring up some different films as well.      CHOO CHOO. Off I go.   **Rush** Dir Ron Howard. A really engaging film about Formula 1 drivers and their death defying rivalry. The film was a high octane story that constantly changed how you felt about the characters throughout.   Snowpiercer, Leviathan and For Those In Peril.   The most unbelievable part of this video is that Vin Diesel has a large amount of hair.   Funny you should say that. They are releasing a remake of Point Break but I don't think it will be anything like the original. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2058673/ Source: My friend worked on the production.   Nothing like a good ol' meatspin.   I don't think this I just used the title of the article. I just thought it was an interesting piece of tech.   Thats the plan.    Hmm that is definitely something worth thinking about. Will be a while yet until we are able to find out its flaws/perks. Interesting step forward though as well as a good price they were suggesting.         	15
    Right into his ear.   JW Sound Forum has a used section. So does B H, TrewAudio and I think TAI Audio. I also stumbled across this group on facebook, which posts used stuff all the time. Not sure if this group link will work, but give it a try. Facebook group for used gear.(https://www.facebook.com/groups/6814558628/) University websites and craigslist are also an option. You're kind of looking for Pro-sumer audio gear so that sorta stuff pops up all the time.   I think for about $500 you could find a combination of new and used gear to fit your needs, if you can afford to wait for good deals.    Your best bet is to buy used if the ntg2 is too expensive. Plenty of used recorders go for cheap on eBay, and other used equipment sites. But I wouldn't bank on spending less than 500 for the whole kit.    The way that NiMH batteries discharge makes it impossible for most devices to give an accurate reading of battery life.  So it might even read 100% and die a minute later. At a Lectrosonic event, they described the difficulty that, the change in charge of a lithium ion battery dropping from 100 to 99 was greater than the change in a NiMH from full to empty.     It sounds exactly like the picture regardless.   If comteks are way out of your range, I've used a Sennheiser G3 connected to a headphone preamp in video village. Worked great for a few gigs, but it means the headphones are tethered to video village.  This happened to work well at the time because it cost me $20 to rent a G3 and the clients and scripty where also at video village.   Here's the headphone preamp I used. Pyle-Pro PHA40 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amplifier  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003M8NVFS/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_VIAqub0AH284G      Spend some money on a decent harness. Portabrace makes a cheap one. It will save your back. And it will make you feel like John McClane  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0010BZKFI?pc_redir=1408585832 robot_redir=1   Between the two I think you will enjoy the 633 a little more. I agree the noise floor on the 633 is a little louder, but over all it shouldn't be too much of a deciding factor for you. It's a great recorder, that's compact, super easy to use and well built. The SD 600 series reminds me a lot of the 552 or 442, built like tanks, they will last. I use the 664 for my kit and I fins the user interface to be much more streamlined than the 700 series recorders.     I attended a lectro event in Chicago and their representative promised that the L Series would be within about 200 to 300 of the 400 series pricing. For example he said he didn't believe the new LMb pack would go for more than 1000, and he also hinted at a drop in pricing for the old LMa packs.    I think to keep it in budget get the Rode lavs with the XLR adapters. That should work best. The countryman b6 or the sanken cos11D are also great lavs but I think would it would put you over budget and the rodes are surprisingly good.  	12

 This one is great... [if you'll allow it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpKQHpMGMNQ)   The world was created for people my height!   A friend and I were talking and were wondering if there is a movie where the Nazis created an army of robots?   But what is.... Mars?!   Erasing the ending from your mind more than likely won't be possible, but I've read the book and the clues Q picks up on can still interest you. Try to say no to your temptation of googling the ending of a book and remind yourself that it'll just ruin the book, this would be one of those things you can add to your list of experiences.   Yet strangely better than anything I could do   Ducks are awesome friends and their quacks makes me laugh every time, what isn't to love.   The thumbnail made me think she had a beard.   Reddit was the one that created that fear for me... whoo.   Fuck a monkey.   The control governments have over our lives.   The cat?   The bad guys always lose.   Borderlands, It's funny, not too hard to get the hang of and helps teach the importance of skill and stat point placement.   We don't know. Some beliefs are that we're reincarnated (What as is based on how good you were in your previous life), we go to an alternate plane e.g. Heaven/Hell, our souls are trapped on earth forever or until a goal is completed, we're ghosts with a purpose or that we simply die and that's it, nothing happens.   :O It's the all original, all game changing "Fall Out..."   Is this in a universe that is excluding Vault 108 and the one true god(s) Gary?!   If you watch the Fallout Lore series you'll learn about the water merchants who were able to obtain water that was deep inside the earth that had its radioactivity filtered out by the ground.   One of the major flaws in this is in some of the video's we're shown, they give footage of us in the vault and say events transpire while we're down there :/.   Amata's my bae.... shame all she ever does is hate you for doing the right thing :(. Really wish they expanded her more as a companion atleast.   He shall make for a great companion in a desolate vault, or a great prop (or a thousand) for a social experiment.While you're at it, you should take up metal working too and make him some power armor.   You seem like an awesome dad.   The dude earlier today who showed his mouse pad resulted in me buying one of the two bears highfiving.... HYPE!   On the positive side you made it to the toilet in time.    Codsworth will be my going out on adventures companion because I wouldn't be able to handle Dogmeat being injured in fights... also Codsworth can talk to me and stop me from going completely insane.  	25

 Ever had that feeling that somethings watching you? Even though you know nothings there? I found something - or should I say, something found _me_, and.. I can see _it_  I dont know how I got away from it. Its been with me for months now, it knows where I live, where I work.. everything. It follows me, wanting to touch me. I dont know what it wants with me, but I know its bad. because _it_ doesnt want to be seen.  I suppose I should start with who I am and what I do, it might make sense then.  Im a van driver. I know, not exactly the most exotic or exciting of professions, but hey, it gives me time by myself to sing at the top of my lungs, or just to think. With home life going crazy at the moment, its nice to be alone. I can drive hundreds of miles a day sometimes; heck, sometimes Im away from home for weeks on end.. Like now.  Ill start at the beginning - but I can only hope that I can finish it before it finds me again.  It all started a few months back - as usual, I was driving around, listening to music, or the radio, I cant remember.. I usually listen to Jeremy Vine during the day if I can, otherwise I just put on some of my usual music.  One of my last jobs that day was at an old house - I think it was the house of some accomplished author, I didnt really pay too much attention - it looked like it had been refurbished to accommodate tours, but the entrance for loading was down in the basement, using a ramp down to an open door.  Despite its new refurbishment, when I entered the basement, it still looked.. old. It creeped me out a little bit, it was still dark, and there was a biting chill in the long corridor. I buzzed the button and waited for my contact to come find me.   In the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow.. peeking around a corner - I thought there might have been stairs there, and my contact was making sure I was there. When I twisted my head to look and wave her down, it was gone.   Hello?  Nothing.  I shook my head and noted that I should stop letting my imagination get away with itself. It was only a few seconds before I heard a loud groan and a screech in front of me. My ears tingled and I stepped back, goosebumps appearing on my skin, before I realised the lift was coming down. Knowing it was the person I was waiting for, I stepped back outside and opened the back door of the van, ready to offload a few bits and pieces of equipment.  After boxing up a lot of things, I offered to take the lot upstairs and take it to the room the person needed. I left the van open, as I was only going to be a few minutes at most, and this place was in the middle of nowhere. Itd be fine, and the van was empty anyway. Any would-be-thieves would be disappointed.  I spent 4 or 5 minutes unpacking all the items, before heading back down to the van and waving goodbye.  It was a few weeks after that before I started noticing the shadow a bit more. Sometimes, Id feel something behind me while I was driving. I knew the back of the van only had empty boxes or my laptop sat inside a bag under my seat, I never let anyone in the back - it was too dangerous, and I am a stereotypical van driver - quite nutty on those left turns.  I saw it most at my home though, but Ive always had weird experiences at my place, but Ive always put it down to sleep paralysis or just my imagination running wild, as usual. Shadow men approaching me as I lay in bed, but the shadow.. figure was being spotted not just by me, but by the family. Itd hide in cupboards, outside in the shed, stood in the garden staring at one of the cameras. But wed only see it for a few seconds before it disappeared.  It was focused on me though. Id spot it the most, and Id see it outside of the house. It was definitely the same thing though. It had a very distinctive shape. It was tall - about 7 feet tall, Id say. Im 62, so it was almost a good foot taller than me. And it was very wiry, almost only a few inches thick on its arms and legs.  It never approached; just watched. Just stood there staring. Id feel the hairs on the back of my neck creep up, and Id spin around to catch its long spindly arm disappearing behind a tree, or a traffic post, or around the corner of a building. Id spot it on the motorway, just standing on the verge, staring, as I sped past. It didnt have any eyes, but I just knew it was staring.  It started to escalate about a month ago now. If I wasnt constantly vigilant, itd start creeping towards me. Not a single crunch of leaves or gravel, even in quiet, echoey rooms, not a single footstep would be heard. It started getting exhausting.   It was the worst when Id feel it while I was driving. I tried to ignore it - I checked the van already.. There was nothing there. Until I went to look into my left mirror. It was sat there for a split second, staring.. But this time, it had these.. empty, white eyes. I panicked, My van slid around the road and I pulled up on the side of the road and scrambled out. It was lucky I was on a mostly empty road. I stood across the road from the van and stared, my heart pounding and my breath fast and sharp.   This was getting ridiculous now - but I had no idea on what I could do. Maybe it was the medication? A few of us in the family were on similar medications. I decided to stop taking them and talk to the doctor about the hallucinations.  Its been about a week now since I said Id go to the doctor, and Ive not had the chance to go. Ive not taken the pills, but Im still seeing it. Im getting exhausted from the constant vigilance, but I dont want to find out what will happen if I let it catch me. Im holed up in a hotel at the moment, working long distance. Im not expected back until Friday, and this hotel is a signal deadspot, no mobile signal, so if something happens - no-one can contact me.. or try to contact me anyway.  Maybe its trying to keep me awake, its hard to drive when youre tired. Theres only so much that coffee can do. Ive not seen it today, though. Maybe I lost it driving down here?     Money for kickstarter projects doesn't get taken until the funding date has ended. So in this case, no money was taken at all because the creator cancelled before the due date. It's a much needed safety precaution.   If the funding wasn't hit by the due date, money wouldn't get taken (Unless it was flexi funding, which this wasn't - Always keep your eye out for that.)   Update: the funding has been cancelled. Looks like the creator had a flick through the comments here and realised they hadn't thought it through.. :(   The software they're using is a package software which looks like it allows them to use assets on a premade "app" so to speak. I've raised a few of the issues with them still   Hey guys, not sure if you've heard about this yet.   There's a kickstarter underway to make an Asexual dating app, much like Tinder or Grinder. I'm not affilated with it at all, but I'm hoping it can get funded!   I'm very much sick of flicking through both Tinder and Grindr to try and find something, and all I can find is people after casual hookups or are very much searching by appearance.  The creator's answered a few questions about the effort, and it seems like it's pretty legit, chucking a dollar or two at it shouldn't be too bad. :3  Link is here! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2109948862/cinder-the-asexual-dating-app?ref=email   Took 3 hours, done in one sitting.  Had quite a crap few months. Elastic Heart by Sia helped me realised I had depression and pushed me to get the Diagnosis. Felt it only right to get a homage. It also looks badass.      ..And I don't get paid until Thursday. There's only so far Noodles are going to get me.  I would be super appreciative if one of you kind folk would sub me a pizza - I will get you a pizza right back on Thursday!   If it helps any, I'm in the UK   Niiice. I love me a bit of 'tallica. Static-X and Rammstein was pretty much my entire teenage years. Gutted about Wayne!  Watched Rammstein..  last year? at Download Festival. Damn crazy show.   Oh man, Black Dahlia Murder - Only head of them when I was at Download Festival in 2008. Jumped into a pit and promptly got knocked over, fell on my face and broke my nose. Fun times.   Woo!  At the moment, I'm in an "Upon a Burning Body" mood, which is where I got the inspiration to get the commission for! But my all-time favourite band is In Flames      I went there yesterday. Jesus Christ, couldn't move for people standing in the way, or taking selfies.    http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com  Absolute nonsense but mostly funny reblogs with a little bit of furry in there.   I'm on the staff for one of the bigger UK pony cons, and some of the stereotypes of bronies can be completely true. It's the most vocal, noticeable members of fandoms that almost set the tone for the entire fandom. Not to say that they're completely annoying - some of my closest friends I met through the brony fandom, and while I'm now anything _but_ a brony, I still keep in frequent contact with them, and I'm trying to put time aside for watching the show.  In terms of them being almost the same, I can see your point, but while the pony fandom has a canon thing to base their fandom and discuss and whatever else, the furry fandom doesn't really have so much of a base other than themselves. Yeah, there are films and shows like.. half the disney catalogue, but furs are a completely separate entity. In terms of how the fandom feels, yeah, they're lmost the same, I guess. I find the furry fandom tends to have an older average. I attended BUCK 2012, and I worked it in 2013 and will be working it this year, and I'd pin the average age for bronies (in the UK at least) about 17-18, making me (24) feel a tad old.  On the other hand, Furries in the UK tend to be older. I was at Confuzzled this year, and there was times I felt like one of the younger attendees. With an older average, the behaviour tends to shift more towards mature... Alcohol related stuff.  It's just unfortunate that the pony fandom has this huge stigma around it now because of the surge of what I like to call "Former Sonic Fandom Members" - the open RP on public pages, terrible english/grammar, and over the top fandom-evangelicalism. ("This video is 20% cooler!")  .. Wow, I kind of went on a bit there.  Quick edit: [I had a kind of similar ish blog post last year-ish.](http://www.accordingtotaern.com/2013/10/a-breakdown-of-fandoms.html)    Aah nards. In that case then, if you're searching display name, it's just Taern and you should see my fursona in there somewhere. He's a grey lynx with back hair \ blue ear tufts   Add me on steam! I've got about 200-odd games so chances are we'll have one or two in common. I'm EU based so timezones might be wacky.   I'm "zeifer" on steam.    Cosmic's suit is so soft and huggy! Was at CFz, it was amazing!   Go ahead and add me if you like. I'm Taern Fastgrade on G+ :3   Me too. I was gearing up for an eye-rolling night, but the only time I wanted to punch him was when he started going off on one about airports.   Mine also ends in BJ. 9BJ.  All 9 of them.   Brugge is fantastic. I went in January in 2007 and there was barely anyone around, I walked around all the buildings, the parks, the towers and bought some excellent chocolate from a tiny gift shop down some really tiny side street   Not been in for a year or two myself, but yeah. It's pirate themed and got a little monorail inside. Not sure if it's laser gun themed because every time I've gone, it's always been off!  I think I'm too big ^tee^hee for the ride anyway, I'm like 6"2 and pushing 300lbs and I imagine it's a bit tiny and aimed at kids anyway.   Aaah, Blackpool. Many a childhood memory there. Coral Island took all my money as a teenager. I love arcades!   I'm not sure that would be wise. I know for a fact I'd be attached to a wall mumbling something about keyboards..   Once I left the Retail job, My tax righted itself and I was only paying around 50 tax/NI.   It was coming out of my new Full Time job, which I got a few months after starting the weekend part time at retail.  Was getting around 800 a month from my Full time place, which the 200 tax came out of, and 220 from retail which wasn't taxt. In the end I was essentially working weekends to pay off the 200/mo tax  I worded it badly, I'll admit that one. o.o'   The Retail job was my "first", technically.   I moved to what is now my current job which became my second. the 20% applied to this, which was where the 200 was coming from. Rather than fuck around with the tax office to get codes swapped, I just left my retail job and got the issue corrected.   Got my weekends back and had a good wage until I got myself in debt like a tit.   I was doing 8 hours a weekend in my old Retail gig, coming out with about 220 a month from there.  200 was taken out in tax. I was losing money just working there with transport costs   Not exactly the most imaginative, but it goes so well when I'm tanking and I'm playing FFXIII music!  [Paladin](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q5wkZmrl5tE/UzWpH4Oyw5I/AAAAAAAA1os/mJCVFFgwkTU/w1038-h539-no/DslnGWS%255B1%255D.jpg)  Working out outfits for my MNK/SMN     Hi Guys, apologies if it's already been answered elsewhere, but I did search and found nothing.  I've come upon hard times lately and trying to work off a ton of high interest debt. I'm just about getting by with my current wage but it's by the skin of my teeth.  Pay rise at my current job is out of the question, so I've been thinking about a weekend part-time job just to pad out the earnings a little bit and get a change of scenery from the office  I've scoured the HMRC site but it's all vague and personal allowance stuff, which I'm already over with my current job salary.  Last time I had a second job, I was 17 doing part time, and with the tax code I had I was paying upwards of 200 on my second job, making it completely pointless with the hours I was capable of  Just wondering, what is the usual situation for a second job's Tax Code? I think last time I may have been on an Emergency Tax Code   I use CJS keys, but I think they're a UK company. It's all online, so it shouldn't matter, but all prices are in !  http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/products/Final-Fantasy-XIV%3A-A-Realm-Reborn-60-Day-Timecard.html  **Quick note, what I've linked is an _EU_ time card. Careful!**   Similar mechanic on WoW - Disengage for hunters.  Mid Lich King Heroic attempt, decided to disengage out of a puddle of bad.  Went flying off the edge like a lunatic. Cackled all the way to my death.   Reading the shenanigans at the reception, I had the Benny Hill theme playing in my head. It just fit so well.   We're still recruiting to get enough people to get a group of 8 actives in the FC, so we're just getting stuff like Ultima and Titan HM on "farm" to get our FC working well together! We want to get to coil soon and I think we're getting there.   "Cheers pal"  If everyone in front of you has already used all the variations of thanks, it feels weird, and I always feel shite if I forget to thank him.   Hah, will do. Pretty set in Cerberus though. Playing with a pretty tight-knit FC and some rad contacts in my linkshells!   Nope. I went the whole hog after trying everything I could find on the internet for the last 3 hours.  Internet Options, clearing files, attempted reinstalls, .rar files of game folders before losing my temper with W8 in general and reinstalling 7. Then I found this thread.   God damn, there I was cursing out W8 for ruining everything. Lost my temper and put W7 back on hoping it'd feex.  My connection in general with them has been pretty shite of late too.    Taern is the secondary character in my story idea. He's a soldier in a rogue squadron after being denied permission to investigate a potential threat to the species. They rob a shit-ton of weapons, armour and shields (Sci-fi!) and go investigate.   I eventually adopted him as my fursona, but making a few changes to identify between Canon-Taern and Me-Taern   Probably. I even type it too much as well. Even when something will definitely happen. "Yeah, probably will."  What can I say, I like an open ended story   I think I've seen this before! When you approach it with the prerequisites filled, an event kicks in!   On my mind right now?  Debt. Debt. Debt. Currently buzzing around in my mind like particularly vicious wasps stuck in a jar. I'm running around a labyrinth in my mind, trying to find solutions but I keep running into dead ends and pitfalls. Pitfalls filled with even more vicious, angry wasps.  Above the maze, a lone laughing figure, occasionally slamming a huge fist in my path before demanding more money.   I have a small companion running the maze with me, but clearly not as invested as I am, mostly because I'm keeping him out of it on purpose. He's my only light at the end of the tunnel, and thinking of him keeps me sane in the labyrinth of debt and anxiety.  Sometimes, I'll reach sections of the maze with giant books in the way. I open these and huge ideas fill my head. I want to write them, draw them, live them.. but I'm trapped in the eternal loop of work, sleep, and running the labyrinth   I keep meaning to come to the manc meets, but I'm always working. .  Cool suit!   I use CJS keys. If they're in stock, you can usually get to your key within 5 mins. Pretty nifty. I'd link but am on my phone.   I always saw it as inflating one cheek only. It always looks like a neutral-ish expression, kinda like thinking about something.   :T   I use CJS Keys. I pay via bitcoin too!  http://www.cjs-cdkeys.com/products/Final-Fantasy-XIV%3A-A-Realm-Reborn-60-Day-Timecard.html   I was torn from my Button yesterday. The MT from the previous fights was sleepy, so I made the ultimate sacrifice of leaving my button.  I miss my button. Tomorrow, we shall be reunited.   Gravy on everything. Including ice cream.  Gravy is good.    I'm in a relationship now with my boyfriend now for 4 months. We've engaged sexually twice.. mostly because of awkwardness with families.   I'm personally up for it, if just to keep him happy. I'm a complete virgin so I'm extremely inexperienced, but he's been amazing and very understanding about it.   I can't say I enjoy giving oral.. I've gagged quite a few times but I guess it's all about learning. Heck, even receiving.. It feels odd.  I'd rather just snuggle and watch films..    Is it bad that I kind of want to roll a planet? Your description was amazingly disgusting still, but.. did she actually roll or was it kind-of-like a deflated [football](http://leicesterexchanges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Football.jpg)?   It's difficult to be in a relationship with a "sexual" (As much as I hate the term), because your partner wants sex, and in my case, I'm just obliging him to keep him happy.  I don't mind doing this, because in the end, a relationship is about compromise. But that's just me.  You just have to be clear and draw a line with him where you feel comfortable and where you don't. If he doesn't like it, there's no point "hooking up" because it'll only result in more and more friction and it might get ugly.   I generally just mark in order of what should really be killed (Barbers in Pharos, Dullahans in AK) then tab then 2, etc.  Makes it a little smother, so I can get a combo off on 1, flash, 2, flash 1, flash, etc.   I'm on Tumblr, but I'm not exactly a source of info. Laughs, maybe. Little bit of cynicism and sarcasm dotted around with maybe the occasional Asexual post.   Probably get latched onto by the boyfriend for one, then get extremely confused because if I'm in here, then who's being "Me?"   Shit yeah we do. Otherwise it's my fault if you pull an enemy off me, and my pocket healer laughs at me.   Beat you to it by a few years! But it's a nice reminder. :   Was just messing around in Revenants while waiting for LS buddies for Crystal Tower and got my camera like this.       Hallo!  Mostly lynx with a bit of an otter side.  [Purr](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4n2hcvmsvlteu3/train_subject8542%20lynx%202%20v2.png)  [Robot because why not](http://www.furaffinity.net/view/11742195/)    I stream here or there. Usually when I'm fucking around on FFXIV with Free Company buddies.   [My Stream!](http://twitch.tv/zeiferrei)  With 2.1 hitting, we're playing a lot more, but we usually do end up playing at 8pm on Sundays more often than not.   "Shit me, I'm on Mars."   This just in, Bear found shitting in woods   How to run further and faster  1. Warm up: Watch your ankles, the Benny will stay 1 step behind you at all times.  2. Another dog? New friend!  3. How to hill climb: Just follow the dog.   Hybrids are fun to work with! It's all about trying to merge to animals together in all sorts of different ways to see what looks good.   Folfs are quite common as well as Dragon/Anything  But you could always combine the different kinds of cats. Lynx/Jaguar? Tiger/Lion?  I've gone Lynx/Otter for mine because why not?   You get the occasional crazy, aye. But most know their boundaries and will back off when asked.  If not.. well, that's what people like me are about for. Find a staff member and they'll find security, and we'll give 'em a proper telling off or kick 'em out if they're repeat offenders.  But don't let the stories scare you (if they are!) Cons are a blast and I've met many great people from them.   Me and a few buddies play Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn.  We're hyped as shit for 2.1 when we get home.  We mostly UK with a few drop ins from Scandanavia. We're more of a gaming community in ourselves. Most play LoL, while the rest of us play FFXIV. We'll drop in and out and play other games too.    Aye. Twas BUCK.  Pants man was this incredibly crazy fellow running around with a pair of boxer shorts on his head, thrusting at anyone and anything. He even got a group and stood outside the convention venue and thrusted at passing trams.  I had to make sure anyone he was thusting at wasn't feeling uncomfortable, and watching that lunatic as well as vendor tables was a headache. :P   Might possibly be working this year. \^^  It'll be my first, but from my past Con attendance, UK cons seem to be pretty chill in terms of attendees. I worked at the UK's biggest Brony con doing security and aside from a few creeps, everyone was rather well behaved!  I'd say depending on where you live it might be worth staying at the Venue. If you live only 20-30 miles out, it might be worth just buying petrol money/public transport. But if you're like me and 90-100 miles out, on site accom or nearby accom is best bet.  But in all, Conventions are made by person interaction. Half of the conventions I've been to wouldn't have been as funny if it wasn't for the attendee interaction.   Oh Pants Man, you were amazing, but such a security annoyance.   About a year and a half now.. I'm 23.   I asked a few weeks back as well. Got a canned "Not accepting at this time but isn't ruled out" response.  (Ooh, actually. Quick edit: Takeaway.com have some places in the UK and they accept bitcoin!)       such coine                           wow        bite cgminer                         DCTm3ZdtKnBbbhGrEQ4DAoZFCjpo31XfHE                   such addreess   Left the house for a coffee and to walk the dog. Nearly got bowled over and damn near dropped my coffee. Dog shit himself when I nearly fell on him  Also, lost my favourite hat. Whizzed off my head, rolled down a hill and landed in t' river.   Love this song. As someone in a relationship with another male, this one really hits home.    On the submission, they say that the final thing is full colour. The sketches are just an example of the poses.   If it's heavy, I usually love it.  Prog, Melodic, Heavy.  In Flames, All The Remains, Devildriver, Rhapsody of Fire are my favourites, but I love all kinds of metal   I got the same. I found it actually quite accurate. I might actually have to pick up To Kill a Mockingbird.   Used to play quite hardcore, but dropped it after burning out something awful.  I might pop back for Warlords of Draenor and see where I go after that   Very much so. I find when I'm doing some tome grinding I can only do 3 or 4 in a row before needing an extended break. Luckily I usually run with FC/LS buddies so they can usually be quite happy to wait for a few while I take a few to catch up on reddit or something  I'm getting used to tanking, so I'm getting better at not fucking up too often. Have my occasional brainfarts, but who doesn't?  I saw that someone said they run with the focus of not messing up - I'm exactly the same. It really drains you, even when you mark and cane the emnity. You want to position everything right so that the MNK/DGN doesn't have to move much.  I'm an overperformer when I really don't need to be. I hate to inconvenience the rest of the party and it kills me.   Well, you know. We like to hold hands and be interested in people of.. _The same sex_  We're totally deplorable and I'm surprised we've gotten away with it so far   I run in screaming.  Run in spamming my key for Shield Lob until it goes off. As I'm positioning the boss, I'll throw in Circle of Scorn, turn around, start off with Fast Blade, then throw in a Spirits Within, then Savage Blade  Rage of Halone  then just FB  SB  RoH, throwing in Spirits Within and Circle of Scorn when available or save them for upcoming mobs or save the high damage things for Bloodbath combined with Fight or Flight   Not much development has gone into weapons yet, but I've got a "gun" that targets an electrical appliance and turns it off. Usually used by "dark" squads to kill lights as they move around starships  I'm more or less focusing on society, mannerisms, and clothing styles right now.   Still on my PS3 at the moment, but feel free to add me if you like.. Is it cross-platform for PSN friends? I forgot.  Add me!   **train_subject8542**   Same here. Oddly enough, Google Services on highest battery usage, followed by AlarmDroid, weirdly enough.  Only at 73% battery though, though I leave mine on charge overnight. Been at work now for 7 hours.  My usage today stands at 27% Services, 26% AlarmDroid  Unless Play music streaming counts as Services now, it's a little odd.   Meteor is always hilarious. We didn't have any melee DD for a pre-made titan group, but we were getting the heart down every time, so there was no worries  We were saving the LB3 for healers should shit have gone down, but we were gong flawless, so a BLM used LB3.  all I could hear on mumble was "I CAN'T SEE!" and the guy's HP bar suddenly drop to Zero. Turns out he got hit by Landslide.  It was some miracle I could actually stay upright to finish tanking him. That was our kill too!   That was an interesting afternoon. I was like "That's that Charlie fella from busted, oh this is going to be pure cringe."  And then they actually were quite good.   We're stuck in the early 90s.  Please help us.   Your profile is confusing me. You're in Paladin gear but the picture shows not-paladin gear.   I've found when I'm tanking anything or running around in FATEs or whatever.. I'll run out of the AoE and jump.   I've not been hit by an AoE in a while unless I've been _really_ derp and either not noticed the cast bar (AK End boss, I'm looking at you) or I've just horribly mistimed running away.   I'm in IT Training, hoping to get into IT support soon.  the whole talking with other people aspect of it is kind of draining on me, being an introvert and all that, so at the end of the day, I'm really drained and absolutely _need_ to be left alone.  But aside from documenting what goes on in the calls, it's great for me because there's no other organisation to do really. I can just have piles of paperwork of things to teach or show around me, with no need for anyone else to look at my stuff.  I'm quite outgoing when I am on the calls (or at least I try to be) but I definitely need my downtime between calls or at home otherwise I burn out and get cranky and nasty with colleagues or family.   I'm a little bit of a cynic, I've been burned a few times in the past when I was a little more trusting, so I've slowly evolved into a bit of a cynical bastard.   I totally forgot about it. I used it back in 1.0 with the limited amount of time I played.  [Shameless link because I can](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/2284483/blog/436904/)   I don't hide it, but I don't flaunt it.  Well. Maybe a little. Profile pictures are of him, but I'm not labelling myself furry on profile bios or anything. Heck, on Facebook (Old school friends, family, etc) I even got a few likes when the "Changed his profile picture" went up.   Aggressive stuff. Heavy/Hard Rock, Metal, "Bro"step (Knife Party, Some Skrillex)  Favourite bands at the minute are [In Flames](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFgQqklqHM), [Royal Republic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN2hL8NvrMw), [Knife Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipX6wgwuHho), [Pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogMNV33AhCY), [Korn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hetDSqvMT4 feature=youtube_gdata_player)  But I pretty much like anything - [Ah Nee Mah](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uqFJ0daX6s), some BGM Music for towns in FF games like [Cosmo Canyon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvpL1bfc6YI) or [The Great Warrior](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4bEPxULwME) are my favourites for chilling out to.    Excellent. Just in time for payday too!   Huh, when did that change? I drove past a Sainsbury's on my way home and it was 1.29.    Extremely unpopular - everyone would kick off if it shoots up again.  I know I've got it good on my tax (20/yr) but 1.30/L up norf still makes my wallet shiver.   Bit rainy, like. Nothin' we can't handle. they've been yammerin' on like it's the end of the world or summat.  Weather was worse on Friday, like. See that funderstorm? Bloody hell, not seen one like that fer a bit.   I'm totally the opposite. There's barely anything there.  I'm in a relationship now and still - nothing. Although I am Asexual, so that probably explains it.   Eesh. Typo'd in the title. Meant to say Grumpy butt. It's what I call him when he starts groaning at me for patting his paws while he tries to sleep.  He's 13 now. Old git!      That road looks so familiar. It's actually going to keep me awake while I think of where it is.   I'm on Cerberus as well. I'm Paladin, I have a WHM/SCH friend and a Bard friend. If we're doing nothing we're always up for anything short of Coil! Our FC isn't exactly active though - we're like freelancers.   Aye, that you can. M/23/British here as well and somewhat sexually active. My body doesn't seem to do much more other than snuggling and stuff after a weekend with someone close last week.  There's groups of Asexuals (I've seen them) who are a sex hating bunch, and it's hard to talk them around or even have them see your point of view without getting hostile  Sexual attraction and the act of sex are two totally different things. I've always been Ace, so I can't even describe how Sexual attraction works, but yes, you are still Asexual if you don't feel sexually attracted to someone.  (I've always imagined Sexual attraction being - upon seeing someone, you have a pull to have sex with them, or at least get really close with them physically)   "Yes, this is dog. What's that? Your owner obviously didn't throw the toy and he's acting like he did? We can get him for distress for that. Here's my direct number and address."   I came out to my parents a few days ago, though mum's totally confused. Admittedly, I came out as Biromantic at the same time, but she's confused at that too.   Exactly.   I had a bit of an experience this weekend where I found out I'm definitely Ace, I can understand why sex is "valued" by people, but I frankly found it boring and was quite happy to just have the snuggles and the cuddles, etc.   Done by klippy, she did such a fantastic job on it I just can't even anymore.  Character on the left is Shia'le, on the right is my main 'sona Taern.      [](/cadanceheart)I pick up on smells and scents a lot. I've got a pretty close person in my life right now and lots of smells trigger memories of them. It's amazing and it helps me feel a lot better  Old smells, like Nan's cooking will sometimes come to be out of nowhere. Kind of like a scent memory bank. I get looked at funny when I say "What the hell, I can smell [thing]!" when we're in a concert or in the car or somewhere where I won't typically smell the thing   Tell me about it, Luckily I was tanking and my FC buddy who came with me was healing, so they had to be a little patient, the other tank was having fun with trash with the other healer  Still felt mad pressured to skip cutscenes though, buddy kept shouting at me to watch the cutscenes over mumble   The beautiful thing about a newly released MMO is that boss tactics aren't widely known in game, and no-one "expects" you to know the dungeons  I tanked Cutter's Cry a while ago, and Chimera was definitely interesting, After a 2nd wipe I was wondering why the healer and the caster dps were getting hit - was I missing adds or was there some damage I couldn't keep hold of?  turn out I didn't notice Dragon's Voice hitting distant players. After we got the dance down, we caned him.  I love running blind in dungeons - I tried to do it in WoW but I was a late starter and everyone expected you to know what to.  Heck, I ran Ampador Keep blind last night with two FC buddies and while I was freaking out at trash mobs (I'm a paladin and there was a Bard and a BLM in the party, AoE Party!) It was super fun, Demon Wall took some doing and working out when and what happened.   the worst part about trying to come across as sex positive as an Asexual is that people, upon finding out you're sex positive then say   "Well then, you're not Asexual"   as if to say the "Involuntary Celibacy" is the whole point of being Asexual.

 The "Molly Ringwald" syndrome   Was expecting cheesy generic space comedy-ended up with a trojan horse of darkness and feels.   Ah, you run on now young blood   Surely starvation and homelessness isn't due to lack of motivation? I agree each rung in the ladder should have an incremental increase in quality of life but why can't a thriving metropolis be at minimum built on a strong social foundation of responsibility instead of the bodies of those left behind?      I get it. Buy up all you can, pushing the price up of what you already have and then dump it before "Bubbles" the invisible elephant in the room comes in and ruins everything. If this hurts low income earners then they should have studied harder or made better decisions in life. I had a work colleague tell me "being homeless is a choice for most of these people". Much like not attending/coping at work because of depression is a "choice". Mental illness is just an excuse lazy people use to drain decent hard working people of their income. #amirite? Besides it's survival of the fittest.   The story was good but I just felt the BS2 was a more 'arcadey' stunted version of BS1. Less dread and more action. Like going from Hellraiser to Diehard   Number 1 was creepier and felt like it had more atmosphere. Number 2 looked like a console port that was cobbled together in a rush. It's like a fan made version of number 1.    I loved the first game and hated the second. Which one is the book closest to?   Let the homeless sleep in investment properties that go for months unoccupied.

 Being a horror author its rare that I have a true story that can compare to the fiction that I write. This one may be stranger than fiction, though.  When I was growing up, we didnt have the internet or computer games to while away our time. As kids, we actually played with each other, and played gasp outside! No, thats not the horrible part. Youll have to wait for it. Anyway I had a lot of friends around the neighborhood, most of which I also attended school with. Ill have to admit, though, that it was probably atypical for not one, but two of my good friends to be the sons of funeral directors.  In order to maintain a sense of professionalism, I wont use their real names, but Ill call them Matt Smith and Brian Jones. Matt lived with his family at Smith   Sons Funeral Home, and Brian with his divorced father at Jones-Johnson Funeral Home.  Early in our relationships, I asked my friends why their families lived in funeral homes, of all places. Couldnt they live somewhere else, and their fathers just go into work like normal people. Matt said that Ohio law stated that someone had to be present in the mortuary at all times. I guess that in the old days, it was a measure taken to prevent body snatchers and other criminal types who would use corpses for, er other less savory reasons.  Brians father said that for him, it was just easier. Being a funeral director is a 24/7 job. People dont seem to want to cooperate and only die during regular business hours. Hospitals, morgues, and families would call at all hours for bodies to be picked up. It was sort of like an ambulance service, and someone had to be available around the clock.  Nevertheless, since we all played together there ultimately came a time when we played over their houses. Thats right  in the funeral homes. We usually stuck to the rooms upstairs where their families lived, but when there were no visiting hours being held, we were allowed to play in the large rooms downstairs where bodies would usually be laid out. It was sort of cool to have all of that space.  Naturally, when we hit the age of ten or so, we got curious (and mischievous) and asked Matt and Brian if we could actually see some dead bodies. Both of them had been exposed to the sight of dead bodies, and even watched their dads embalming corpses, since they had been really young, so it was no thrill for them. But it was for the rest of us. At first, this meant slipping into the viewing rooms between visiting hours when bodies were laid out for viewing.  Eventually, though, we just had to see the mortuary where the corpses were stored and the embalming was done. So in due course, we snuck down into the basements of both homes to check out the mortuaries.  Surprisingly, we discovered a lot of funny things about how corpses were treated. Funeral directors see so many dead bodies that they come to realize them for what they are: objects. Empty shells, dead meat. If there is a spirit or soul, its gone by the time the get the body in front of them. Their job is to pretty it up for the families and then get it into the ground before it starts to stink.  Not all bodies are embalmed. In fact, most are not. If there is no health reason, the body is not being transported out of state, and the body will be buried within ten days, then embalming is not required. Its not even encouraged, as its not very environmentally friendly.  Just a quick primer on the embalming process, for those who are unaware of what it entails: Typically, the embalmer (Matts dad or brother, or Brians dad) suits up in personal protective equipment - a gown, apron, shoe covers, gloves etc. - and evaluates the person to decide how to proceed. Every case is different and requires a special combination of fluids, which are mixed according to the height, weight and physical conditions of the deceased.  Setting the features involves closing the eyes and mouth and placing cotton in the mouth to give the person a more natural expression. Next, the arms, legs and fingers are gently flexed to relieve the muscle tension or stiffness of rigor mortis. The body is washed and the genitals are covered out of modesty and respect.  Typically, they use a scalpel to make a small incision near the right collarbone. From there, incisions are made in the carotid artery and jugular vein. Tubes are placed in the artery (one is directed towards the heart, while the other is directed towards the head). A drain tube is placed in the vein to facilitate drainage of blood. The hose, connected to the embalming machine, is then connected to the arterial tube directed towards the heart. The embalming machine is adjusted to regulate the rate of flow. The machine is switched on and the fluid begins to move through the hose, through the arterial tube and into the body. As the embalming fluid is pushed through the arterial system, the blood is forced out through the jugular vein.  The body is vigorously massaged while this is going on to help facilitate drainage and distribution of embalming fluid. The tissue begins to firm and take on a rosy appearance, which is an excellent indication of a successful embalming. The tubes are then removed, the vein and artery tied off and the incision is sutured. Next, the cavity is treated. Fluid is suctioned from the hollow organs with an instrument called a trocar, then another, stronger fluid is placed into the cavity and the incision is closed. The body is again washed. Their hair is combed and cream is placed on their face to prevent skin dehydration. The deceased is then covered and will remain in the prep room until they are dressed, made up and ready to be placed into a casket. Matt and Brians dads both used the same woman to do make up and arrange the bodies hair. She was a local hairdresser.  The reason I say that its not environmentally friendly is that all of the stuff that comes out of the body goes down the drain and into the city sewer, along with all of the excess embalming fluid. All of it ends up going through a treatment plant and eventually comes out of the tap in your kitchen sink. So think of that the next time you get a drink of water.  So, in and between all of this taking place, the naked corpse usually just lays on a steel table in the cool room waiting between stages of the process. This is when we would sneak down for a peek. They werent dimly lit or dirty rooms. It was always quite bright and even somewhat cheery in the mortuaries. Matts father even had a Hang in There cat poster on the wall.  Unsurprisingly, being boys and testing out our courage, we had to occasionally dart up and quickly poke the bodies. Just to show that we could. Eventually, as we got older and braver, we would lift the sheets on some of the female bodies to get a peek underneath. Sounds desperate, I know, but hey, we were like twelve. Wed laugh at the huge erections that the men would get due to rigor mortis. Occasionally, a body would moan or make other noises as decomposition gasses made their way through the vocal cords. Then we would all go running upstairs, screaming like little girls.  Time passed, and we turned into teenagers. Other than Halloween or to scare girls, sneaking down into the basement mortuaries lost its shine. When we turned eighteen, both Matt and Brians fathers offered a few of us jobs doing late night runs to pick up bodies. Twenty-five bucks a run for each of us. Not too bad for an hours work for a young college kid. It was a little strange at first, but we got so comfortable that we would go through the McDonalds drive-thru or even stop for a pizza with a body in the back of the van. (I dont suppose that was entirely kosher, so thats why I omitted the real names of the funeral homes.)  My friends took two entirely different paths around this time. Matt decided to follow in the family footsteps and become a mortician. He went to school and continued helping out with embalming and providing directors services for grieving families. He stopped letting us sneak down into the basement and, when we did go down for business reasons, he demanded that we have the utmost reverence for the corpses. He said that he was truly ashamed of being disrespectful as children, even though we had really done nothing outrageous. We thought that he had turned into a little too much of a prude.  Brian, on the other hand Well, he went the entirely opposite way. He wanted nothing to do with the family business. He wasnt interested in college, either. He continued doing pickups for his dad, and got a job as a house painter. We would still hang out at his house, and after a few beers (or more), wed end up sneaking back down into the basement. Hed go so far as to say things like Hey, check out the tits on this one, or drape a corpses arm over his shoulder and ask one of us to take his picture.  Then, one night, he went a little too far. She was a young girl  about our age  and had been quite pretty. Im not sure what she died from, but it hadnt taken any toll on her body. Even in death, she would have been considered beautiful. As usual, it was after a night of heavy drinking that we had ended up down in the morgue. Brian turned the basement lights on and led us over to the table, promising something that we wouldnt want to miss.  We were figuring that it would be some gruesome car accident victim or another laughably large penis, but no. It was this pretty, young girl. He presented her with a magicians flourish by whipping off the sheet and pointing at her naked body with both hands. Ta da! Of course, we all remarked that Wow, she was hot, and what a shame it was that she had died so young. Then, he touched her. I mean touched her. First, grabbing a breast, then then other places. Cmere, guys. Feel this. Its almost like shes alive.  We all expressed our disgust. Not at touching a dead body  wed all handled our share of stiffs  but at the way he was touching her, the places he was touching her, and the palpable joy he was getting out of it. Dude! Thats just wrong, we protested. Come on, man. Get away from her, we said as we yanked him away. He became really defensive and it almost came to blows between him and another of our friends. He finally relented. Shit, man. I was just joking around. Brian looked truly wounded, as if he realized how shameful what he did was, but didnt want to admit to it. I put the sheet back over the girl as my friends dragged him toward the stairs, uttering a little prayer asking God to forgive us.  We turned out the lights and went back upstairs. Well, that had thrown a kibosh on the evenings festivities. So we all grabbed our leftover beer and headed out, mumbling our goodnights and til tomorrows. I lived only a few blocks away, so I walked home, drinking a beer on the way. Just being in the room when Brian did that made me feel dirty. I couldnt wait to get home and take a shower. I would need to finish off my six-pack (and maybe break open the bottle of Jack that was in my fridge) before I got into bed if I expected to sleep that night.  I talked to a couple of guys the next day and we all recollected how f---ed up the whole deal with Brian had been. We were really starting to doubt our friendship with him. He had become an odd duck, but that night gave us all pause to think about how far gone he had really been. Even drunk what a sicko. None of us even attempted to call Brian that day, or the next. My friend Rob was the first to find out, and he called me on that second day to deliver the news. Somehow, crazy as it sounded, I wasnt really surprised to hear the news.  Brian had been found dead in his room the previous morning. Apparent cause was a heart attack. Hed been having health problems according to his estranged mother. His dad had admitted a little more to Rob  something that was to be kept hushed up, of course. He was wondering if Rob knew anything about the irrational behavior that Brian had been exhibiting just prior to his death. Rob told him about what had happened down in the mortuary the night before Brian died. Oh, replied his dad, That makes a little sense, then. You see, the naked body of the girl from that ghastly night had been found lying on Brians bed.   I'm glad that you and your mother can have a good relationship today. Do me a favor - give her a hug. Don't tell her that it's because you are proud of her for getting sober. Just say "I love you."   My name is Jim Hutchison. Most people call me Hutch, even in my professional life. My family-owned business is as a concrete contractor, and we perform work for a variety of private and federal clients. One such client is the Texas State Department of Corrections. It was work at one of their detention centers that got me interested in volunteering at a facility.  About five years back, we were installing a parking lot at the Montford Adult Correctional Institute in Lubbock. It is also known by its more appropriate name, the Montford Psychiatric Unit, as all of the inmates have been diagnosed with some type of mental disorder or other. As my men were doing the preparation, concrete placement, and finishing over a number of weeks, I used to watch people walking in and out of the front doors of the facility. It was depressing.  Always the same scene. There would be inmates in orange and white striped jumpsuits  trustees  outside the doors sweeping the front steps and picking up trash: cigarette butts, gum wrappers, etc. But mostly sweeping, always sweeping. All day long. Must have been the cleanest set of stairs in all of Texas. I supposed that it was a treat for them, though. After exhibiting good behavior for a while, they were actually allowed outside the unit. I have seen the conditions inside, and boy, I would not want to be locked up in there for too long.  Still, the looks on their faces. Blank stares, slack jaws, sweating in the one hundred degree sun. As I said, very depressing.  I had a lot of experience with mental disorders, being diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder, and being a recovering alcoholic. I had found help and comfort through proper medical care and support groups, and I wished that there were some way I could pass that on to these poor men. Then, one day, I discovered how I could.  The guards at the front desk came to know me and some of my supervisory crew. They didnt mind if we occasionally came inside the lobby to get out of the summer sun and use the rest rooms or buy soda from one of the machines in the waiting room. I was sitting in a chair one day, holding a cold bottle of Big Red to my forehead, when I overheard two women talking nearby. They were well dressed and obviously not there as visitors. I wasnt trying to eavesdrop, but the few words I heard caught my attention. Apparently, they were volunteers at the prison, bringing the Word of the Lord to the inmates confined inside. I told them how much I admired their work, and how I had a desire to help in a similar way. And so, they suggested that I apply for a position as a pastoral counselor in the unit.  Long story short, I did just that. I had to go through some training  what I could and could not bring into the facility, what I could and could not say to the inmates (never share personal information or build friendships), and how to act when inside general population walking and talking amongst the convicts. It was all pretty much common sense.  For the first eight weeks or so, I had to be escorted in and out of the unit proper. I would arrive, place my boots, keys, wallet, and such on a conveyor belt, turn over my briefcase for inspection, and walk through a metal detector. Then one of the guards at the entrance to general population would call up to the counselors office and someone would come down to get me. During the eight weeks, I was fingerprinted, interviewed, and a federal background check was run on me. Eventually, I was given a badge of my own and no longer needed an escort.  I learned many things in my first few months of volunteering. Bibles were like currency to the inmates (reading material to overcome boredom). Pencils were not allowed in the cellblocks, so the men loved meeting with me to write journals. They spent most of their time doodling ideas for tattoos. The really sick ones  the mentals, as the guards cruelly referred to them  were not allowed into general pop and looked forward to my visits. Most of all, I learned how easy it was to get in and out of the prison. Not that I would ever have done it but I marveled at the fact that, given the right inclination, a body could make a mint smuggling in cigarettes or booze stuffed into their socks.  I followed the same ritual every evening that I visited. I would park in the lot, walk past the trustees who swept the front steps (wow, did they ever stink), and enter the facility. The guards got to know me and grew comfortable with my visits. They began by waving me through the detector without having to remove my boots or open my briefcase, and eventually started letting me avoid the security check altogether.  Next, I was allowed to bypass the desk and go directly behind to a filing cabinet, where I could retrieve my badge  I wasnt permitted to take it outside the prison. Then Id get buzzed through an unremarkable metal door and walk down a long, unadorned hallway. At the end of the hall was where the genuine security measures began.  The hallway terminated at another door, this one made of double layers of thick, cloudy bulletproof glass supported within a frame of four-inch by four-inch square steel tubes. I would approach and stand under a camera mounted above the door, lifting both my face and the badge toward the camera in order for the guards inside to verify my identity. Once done, the door would slide open, allowing me to step inside an airlock, of sorts. Then the door would slide shut behind me.  The compartment was a triangular room with three doors, all similar, and a window set into the side. The guards in control of the doors sat behind the window, and would control the doors, opening only one at a time. I came to call them doors number one, two, and three, sort of like the game show Lets Make a Deal. I always entered through door number one, and then was allowed to pass through door number two into the prisons general population. From the start, I would always gaze at door number three and wonder what was behind it, as it was the only door with darkened glass. Since no more than one door was ever open at a time, I never got a peek inside. During my orientation, I was told that the prisons infirmary was back there.  When door number two opened, the stench was overpowering. No matter how many times you would enter the block, you never did get used to it. Mostly, it was the reek of urine, but was accompanied by an underlying sweet citrus smell, as the result of the cleaning fluid that they ineffectively used to mop down the halls. Inmates ambled up and down the halls, always giving you the once-over with their eyes. Occasionally, they would lock eyes with you and try to stare you down. During orientation, we were told never to look away  to stare them down as you would a stray dog. Looking away would be a sign of weakness.  It may seem cruel, but you had to keep them beat down. You had to constantly remind them that you were in charge, that they were nothing. Anything less could lead to unrest and rebellion, and you couldnt have that.  The mentals were up on the ninth floor. The elevators, like the doorways, were controlled by the guards and monitored by cameras. I would press the single wall button, and eventually the doors would open. Id step inside, look at the camera, and speak my destination into the camera microphone. Sometimes, there would be an inmate or two in the elevator. I never stood with my back to them. I would always stand facing them, my back to the door, staring them down, and for the most part, they would lower their eyes to the floor and try not to look at me. I was instructed never to enter an elevator if it was occupied by an inmate that intimidated me, but I never backed down. At first, I acted brave because I was unsettled but didnt want to show it. After a while, I felt sympathy for the men more so than fear of them.  The ninth floor was divided up into five pods, each containing five double-occupancy cells. My habit was to rotate which pod I would visit on a daily basis, taking the weekends off. Even though I was educated not to make friends with the prisoners, I have to admit that I looked forward to the visits as much as they did. Sometimes heavily medicated, and by far the calmest group of men in the facility, they were (save for a few odd ducks) among the nicest people Id ever met.  So it was day after day, week after week, month after month that I would follow the same routine. There were occasional variances, on some days due to fights or unrest among the inmates in general population, but one thing never changed. Every day as I entered the block, I would look over at door number three and wonder what lay behind it. I asked a few times, and was always told the infirmary, and after a while stopped asking for fear that someone might become suspicious about why I cared so much. Truth was, Im just a curious person. Once, I even asked another volunteer if there was a chance that I could get a tour of the infirmary  perhaps visit the men back there  but was told (with great firmness) that my request would be impossible to fulfill, and that I should let the issue drop. I could almost hear the implied or else. That just piqued my curiosity even more.  My interest grew and grew until I one day decided that I was going to visit the infirmary one way or another. Although my decision was made on a Tuesday, I didnt act immediately. I became more attentive to which guards were working on each day and at each time. Certain ones were more lax, or friendlier. It took two weeks of studying them, and building my confidence, until I decided that it was time to act.  Exactly two weeks and one day from the Tuesday that I made my decision, I finally got up the courage to say, Im visiting the infirmary today. In my mind, I thought, lets see whats behind door number three, Monty!  The guard never even batted an eye. Alright Hutch. Have fun, he said, twinkling his fingers as his eyes dropped back to the video screens in front of him.  That easily, the door slid open. Boy, if the stench in general pop was bad, the odor wafting through door number three must have been quite literally a hundred times worse. In the hot Texas sun, and with all of the turkey vultures, road kill never lasted very long in Lubbock. Every once and a while, though, youd come across a fresh one. Thats the closest thing I could think of to describe the smell behind door number three. It was as if you picked up a day-old dead armadillo, buried your nose in its crushed belly, and took a deep breath. Well, what I imagine it would smell like. I had never actually done that. Definitely the smell of rotting meat and gangrene, though.  The doors slid shut and another long hall was revealed. Dimly lit, with flickering fluorescents, it was like something straight out of a horror movie. I soon found out that was an extremely appropriate description. Another door at the end of the hall hung loosely from its frame, allowing light to leak out around it. I could hear alternating moaning, crying, and the worst - screaming coming from behind the door. I could have should have turned around and headed back for the exit, but I had gotten too far. The only way to go was forward. Forward and through that door.  Although I knew it would seem suspicious, I opened the door slowly and stuck my head around the corner. The best way to seem as if you belong somewhere is to stride right in with confidence, but I couldnt. I was afraid of what might be behind the door. Heck, I thought, it most likely was just a prison hospital. Moaning, crying, screaming  all normal noises for men in pain.  It was most definitely not a normal hospital ward.  There were at least a dozen men strapped to steel tables. Some naked, some in orange prison jumpsuits, and some wearing the striped suits like the trustees that I passed every day outside on the stairs. All of them had IVs inserted into their arms, the drip bags containing a fluid that looked like antifreeze. Vitals signs monitors (VSMs) were attached to most of them, and I could see by the displays that two of the men were clearly dead.  There were two men and a woman, all wearing lab coats, standing amongst the tables. One of the male doctors (?) looked up in surprise, and then beckoned over Come in, come in. They must have noticed the look of confusion, quickly turning to panic, in my eyes. The female doctor began explaining in a soothing voice.  Dont worry. Youre not the first outsider to stumble his way into our infirmary, and Im certain that you wont be the last. As youve probably already guessed, what we have here is more of a lab than a hospital. Weve just become so used to calling it the infirmary that its simpler that way. She drew a breath and was about to continue when another of the doctors shouted, Its happening!  Everyone, myself included, turned toward one of the tables that held a dead man. Well, previously held a dead man, to be exact. His VSM had jumped to life, and seemingly so had he. He began twitching, and then thrashing, then he began to scream. I had seen a man being burned alive once, when a barrel of hot tar accidently spilled on him, and the screaming was the same. It was gut wrenching and made my skin crawl. You could hear the pain and sorrow in it.  The female doctor scrambled to inject a syringe of some milky liquid into the mans IV port and after what seemed like an eternity (although it was probably mere seconds) he calmed, and his breathing steadied itself.  Heres the thing: They had not been performing CPR on the man when I walked in. There was no defibrillator to be seen. The man was unmistakably dead when I arrived and during the few minutes we had been talking. Yet, here he was alive once again, as if he had spontaneously resurrected. Disturbingly, though, his eyes were still clouded over as if he had cataracts. An uneasy and sick feeling crept its way into my belly. The doctors had not told me anything yet, but on some level, I already knew what was happening  or at least part of it.  I was incredulous. Wha- whats going on?  So, while two of the doctors tended to the resurrected man, the third explained the experiment to me.  You see, we were tasked to find out whether or not so called evil men have souls or not, he began. Of course, I personally do not think that there is any such thing as true evil, but I do wonder if these malcontents have the same sort of spiritual makeup as normal people. After all, why do they do what they do?  In 1907, a Haverhill, Massachusetts, doctor by the name of Duncan MacDougall managed, apparently overcoming any ethical reservations over human experimentation, to put six dying people on a bed equipped with sensitive springs, and claimed to have observed a sudden loss of weight  about three quarters of an ounce  at the exact moment of their death. Having reasoned that such loss could not be explained by bowel movements or evaporation, he concluded he must have measured the weight of the soul. A follow-up experiment also showed that dogs didnt seem to suffer the same sort of loss, therefore they didn't have souls.  Im not implying that these inmates are on the equivalent of dogs, but one must wonder exactly how they compare to normal, healthy human beings. We obviously do not have much control data, but we have recycled these men as much as possible for our research.  It was there that I stopped him. Recycled?  Oh yes, he brightened. We dont just throw them away. You see, as a pleasing consequence of our intended experiment, we found that we were able to revive our test subjects.  Revive them?  Yes. Revive, resurrect, bring them back whatever you wish to call it. This way, we are able to take measurements and observe through a variety of different conditions. Its quite ingenious.  I really did not know what to say at that point. To question who authorized the experiment, what the ramifications were, how it worked. So I asked the first question that popped into my head.  So, do they have souls?  He removed a pencil from his breast pocket and tapped the side of his head, as if thinking it over. You know, Im quite certain that they do. As I said, we lack enough data to use as a control. However, it seems that each time we bring them back, they lose a little until  it seems  its all gone. After a certain point, we can no longer observe any differences.  And how long does that take?  Usually four or five cycles.  I cocked my head, still in disbelief over the casual way he was talking about the atrocities they were committing. And what happens then?  Im sorry, he said, I dont follow you.  After youre done with them. What happens to them then?  Whoo, he blew air through pursed lips. Yes, thats the problem, isnt it? Thats currently the little snag weve run into. You see, eventually they just stop dying.  He must have seen the look on my face.  I mean, its not as if we havent tried. We usually put them down in a most humane way. Sedation, paralysis, and eventually with an injection of enough potassium to stop their hearts. Then we revive them and do it again. And again. And again. Each time, it gets a little more difficult to put them down, until well, until we just cant do it anymore.  What? I was just about screaming.  In simpler terms, they are basically incapable of dying. Quite a problem. And they really start to stink, he said, as if that were the chief problem.  Cant you burn them, cremate the bodies?  It was his turn to look at me in disgust. Oh, now that would be cruel.  I held my head in my hands and began to hyperventilate. So where are they?  Well, he said, Outside. Sweeping the steps.  With that, I began to feel lightheaded. What caused me to faint, though, was his next question.  Mister, um he looked at my badge, then into my eyes, Hutchison, would you consider yourself to be a good person? Do you believe that you have a soul?  	3
 My friend has recently gotten into horror shorts and decided to make one for himself. You can check out more of his stuff on his [Facebook]( https://m.facebook.com/kijahstudios)          Touch a save point. It can be resumed by going to Single Player and clicking Load Game. Should be moved to the very first screen imho.   Figured this out after a game of 4 player local co-op was exited by over zealous button pressers. Turns out the save points aren't just aesthetic.   Never had an issue in over a year. If it ever went down, it was due to Comcast sucking. Whose your internet provider in your area? Do other streaming services on other devices have similar issues?   I'm not gonna discount your issue, sounds frustrating as hell, but I've recommended Chromecast to dozens of friends and have only heard back praise.

 In short, TLR4 receptors are part of the inflammatory signaling pathways that respond to things like bacterial infections. While some evidence existed that these receptors could affect insulin sensitivity, there was much debate as to the nature of this effect since it was only described in genetic knockout animals. These researchers used pharmacological tools to conclude that TLR4 block in vivo restored insulin sensitivity in both the periphery and the liver directly, and not because of influencing weight gain and fat deposition (as suggested in other studies). Does this make TLR4 a novel target for type 2 diabetes? Perhaps...but the well-documented role for TLR4 in immune responses leave me dubious. Nonetheless, and interesting read -- for those interested in receptor pharmacology!      [Link to original article, though I fear it's behind a paywall.](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/07/16/1510581112)  EDIT: Typo.   In other words: I don't think it's been documented, nor do I think it's possible for anyone to "have a clue".   You need any help on it, I'd be glad to be involved.   You're welcome!!   TOTALLY agree. And the title is actually COMPLETELY wrong: they made an anti-clotting agent.   Yes, it is...But the venom wasn't used in the experiments per se. They genetically altered the yeast to make the same protein as was found in the venom. And this is pretty cheap, by comparison.   Whew. Umm. Okay. To stick with the ELI5 idea:  During normal metabolism and cellular function, free radicals ("reactive oxygen species") are produced. These are highly-reactive oxygen-containing compounds with an extra electron that *really* wants to get rid of; in this instance, we're talking about superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. They can react with all sorts of proteins and stuff, causing cellular dysfunction and damage.  But, since they form through natural metabolism, the body has also developed defenses against them. Certain enzymes and vitamins (peroxidases and vitamin E, for example) help get rid of these things by reducing (as opposed to oxidizing) the reactive oxygen species and preventing them from doing damage.  However, many diseases and stimuli (diabetes, obesity, inflammation) can increase the production of reactive oxygen species. This is bad news when it overwhelms our natural ability to get rid of the reactive oxygen species. The result: "oxidative stress". Oxidative stress is a catch-all term to define a state where the production of these free radicals exceeds their removal, leading to cellular damage and ultimately dysfunction.   I think you mean plaque, not plague. But the problem (as stated in the article) is not just breaking up the plaques -- it's doing it in a timeframe that is soon enough to prevent the irreversible cognitive decline. Breaking up the plaques is super; subsequently restoring function would be the Holy Grail.  Still, as we're able to identify the plaques earlier and earlier, this new drug has HUGE promise at preventing cognitive decline.   I can try. Feeding mice a high fat diet resulted in oxidative stress, increased inflammation, and caused fat to be deposited in the liver and other organs where it doesn't belong. The researchers contest that a change in the connective tissue between the fat cells (adipocytes), due to oxidative stress, prevented them from expanding to store the circulating fatty acids that were damaging other organs and causes all the trouble.  By giving the mice a lot of vitamin E (an antioxidant), they were able to combat the oxidative stress, prevent the remodeling of the fat cells, and basically improve the health of the obese mice.    Ha. I'll bite....and start with something basic. I'm going to suggest the battery: that amount of electrical energy stored in such a small "container" would be of HUGE interest to things like space exploration and medicine.  	12
 And SJW sounds like a  good thing to be too.  Social Justice....  yeah, that's an evil thing to want.   Who would want that?       This is still a bug that has not been fixed.   It is a problem that has to be effecting a large number of users who assume when they see the forbidden message that the problem is that Reddit doesn't want them submitting, period.  So they give up and go do something else.  I know how to work around it, but it is annoying as heck.    Please look into fixing it.    This is still a problem.    I've explained in other comments in this thread exactly what causes the problem and how it could be easily fixed.     This is really annoying.  And while I know how to get around it, I'll bet it is effecting many users who just think Reddit is them that they are not allowed to submit, period.    Please look into fixing it.    Thank you.                                  /r/Coontown alone already is almost as large as Stormfront on it's own.   Include all the Chimpire and other associated subreddits, and they are much larger than Stormfront right now.                national hero  International hero.                                                           There were many fully secular people involved in the Civil Rights movement as well.  It was not a religious movement.   A good number of religious people were involved,  but the movement itself was not religious in nature.                                                                  Vegetarians are very evil.    As a /r/Food and /r/Health mod have seen amazing evidence that proves that they only consume Soylent Green.    And, as we all know, [Soylent Green is people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IKVj4l5GU4).       There are people in that thread splitting hairs so fine that several of them would claim Obama isn't even Obama because Robot Space Lizards don't have Earth names.                             It's from 1977.   Probably was recorded on some guys boom box tape deck sitting off the side originally.

They won't bother to research what Ted Cruz, Jed Bush or Rick Perry pays their staff though.  That's for sure.    A very long time.  I was the one who implemented that back in the day.   /r/History does it for six or eight hours.    Does Sanders pay his staff interns, or are they paid for out of the Senate's own internal Operations budget?    If the later, then Sanders has one vote out of 100 when it comes to what staff interns are paid.     If it's from a budget he controls, then he would get a to determine how it's spent.  In such a case, I would guess it would be something he farmed out to a Chief of Staff or something, which hopefully Sanders will be correcting the situation shortly.     Scalpel?    Use a weed whacker.   It's faster.     You're mistake is admitting those things.   True Jewish Zionists always deny it.  Always.       That certainly explains what Nixon was.     It's /r/conspiracy.   Monday is Tuesday.   Tuesday is Friday.   Friday is ElephantDay.  Just forget about asking about ElephantDay.    I miss Birdman.     "So, is there anything in your life that might be embarrassing if it was discovered after you came to work for Disney?"  Sadly, these guys wouldn't understand the question really.     Positive development.   Baby steps forward.       And AATA is so interested in how the guy found the thread.   Well, that's easy using Reddit search.  Find out where AATA is mentioned by anyone who is not AATA with [this search of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=AssuredlyAThrowAway+-author%3AAssuredlyAThrowAway+-reddit%3Asubredditreports restrict_sr= sort=new t=all).

Is this like "We salute you, our half inflated Dark Lord!"?                                                               It's all becoming clear now.   Obviously a guy who was in *Head of the Class* was turned evil by Howard Hesseman.  Diabolical!  Johnny Fever was prime evil!     Elos, your comment here is mostly gloating.  Yeah, you got him.   I removed him now too.   But come on, just send us a mod mail in the future instead please.   We can deal with it neatly then.   Thank you.    Well, this thread got me to remember [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6MOnehCOUw).   Yeah..... Well, you can use facts to prove anything which is even remotely true.     Does it matter?     It's the summer time.   A lot of people when asked by pollsters say "Sure [hahaha], I'd vote for Trump.   Pass me another beer".   When it actually comes time to really vote, even in a simple primary or caucus, people sober up real quick.     Making it through his POW experience was a bit more than just a passive thing though.   I'm a left wing liberal, I disagree with McCain on a lot of policy stuff.   But more than 99% of people would just give up and just die instead of allowing themselves to be treated the way the North Vietnamese treated McCain and many of his fellow prisoners.   Survival wasn't a passive thing on his part, nor was it simple.     McCain lost his teeth to a ball-peen hammer.  He has a personal relationship with torture that other people just don't have.     More of an 6.7 in my opinion.      I removed  the thread about this guy from /r/Bestof yesterday.  It was reported over 90 times.    Which is a lot of reports.   Most heavily reported threads never get more than 5 or 6 reports.  Sometimes a rare one makes it to 10 or 12.   But I saw 90 reports and removed it.      And now it gets even worse.     This guys problems are really turned up to 11.                                               /r/conspiracy, you just [never change](http://i.imgur.com/Ta3AY.jpg).       You are going to actually assert that thread is real?   It's a text-file created on free text file hosting service (similar to imgur is for image-files) is posted to /r/conspiracy by a mod of /r/conspiracy.   It's obviously fake and was created from whole cloth by the same account that posted it.      You can't figure this one out on your own?   I really have to explain it to you?      /r/Bestof allows any subreddit to opt-out per mod request.      They can have a permanent opt-out forever.   Automod will enforce that.     Or they can request removals piecemeal on a per-submission basis.     /r/Bestof always respects a mod teams rights to not be highlighted at /r/Bestof.    Likewise, we don't allow the subreddit to be used for witch hunts or in efforts to get somebody down voted.   If a submission to /r/Bestof is highlighting a comment people would normally want to down vote, we'll remove it.   /r/Bestof is meant to be a positive experience and the /r/Bestof mod-team won't allow it to be used as an attack platform.    We work with other teams and the admins to keep the *Best of* experience positive for everyone.      I didn't create anything.   I stepped up to defend some people who I thought were doing the right thing.    There is a difference.     I remember LouF.     I also remember /u/zephir (now zephir_baned_baned and zephir_banned_baned).   He used to show up in /r/science and /r/Physics and complain that Albert Einstein time traveled into his home, stole his work and physically assaulted him and a bunch of other butty stuff.     I think he is a [time-cube](http://www.timecube.com/) crazy.   I never really could figure out what he was trying to say cause it hurt my brain to read his comments.    Anyway, the mods of /r/Science and elsewhere have been repeatedly banning him for years.    He seemed to have made for this [Billy Madison scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c) to come to life.    Don't forget the guys at /r/conspiracy, who have more than 300K subscribers.  They [never brigade anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dtg7h/israel_affiliated_mod_utrain_subject8652_shows_up_in/).     The admins have directly said alts would count in the max-number of defaults one can mod.  So, /u/karmanaut and /u/bechus both count in the total number of defaults Karmanaut can mod.   If you have information about anyone modding more than four default subreddits, you should alert the [Reddit admins](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) about it.     R_A posted [this image](http://i.imgur.com/J2Ks9uw.png) in [this comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3dt2ix/drama_in_rdocumentaries_after_mod_nukes_nearly/ct8fknb).   Of course the guys from /r/conspiracy will now explain to us how none of that is antisemitic in the slightest.    I'm sure they will explain to us how they aren't a brigade either.   As we all know that bipolarbear0 made them do it.      Sorry about that then.   Please forgive me.    There are a few weirdos who follow me around with different accounts at times.     I didn't even remove the thread I supposedly removed.   Of course, it was all me.   Yeah, right.  Whatever.     Woman and their mind control powers.  I'm sure she rigged the Lotto numbers and controls the stock market too.     	156
    He's not saying that he doesn't WANT to believe it, but rather pointing out some inconsistent or strange details in the story, as many other people have in this thread. Reddit is notorious for blindly taking stories at face value without questioning the credibility, and thats exactly what /u/drguildo is doing.   While your statement is a very valid one, it doesn't apply to this situation at all.   That WAAYY too much truffle oil. I would use like 5-10 drops of truffle oil in 1/2 cup ketchup. I'm assuming they're referring to truffled olive oil instead, but that's a HUGE difference. Also, 2 tbls of real truffle oil would cost at least a dollar.   I'm more or less just summarizing what was on the front page of reddit in the aftermath of the FPH ban. I'm not stating whether the reasoning was sound or not, but rather WHY people felt that way. I mentioned /r/coontown because that was one of the frequently debated subs since many people consider it to be harassing, even though it didn't technically break any of Reddit's rules.   Although a bit of a double standard, I think it more the way that it was done.  Most people seemed to be upset that there was no transparency in what was going on within Reddit (Pao Admins Mods Users) rather than the actual situations. Plenty of people were 100% for banning FPH, but thought it was ridiculous that these rules came from nowhere and other subs like /r/coontown were still active. Also, Huffman seems like a standup guy whereas Pao seems like... well, you get it.   I have medium hands and use a fingertip grip and I find it very comfortable.    Nope, rather the opposite. I tried eating and ENTIRE lemon... the peal is still EXTREMELY bitter, where as the sour fruit is like lemonade.   Update on any photos?   Neither is "better" or "worse" because people died. 1st degree murder is generally thought to be worse than manslaughter, even though the outcome (someone dying) is the same.   Do you know if the M65 is the same size/shape with different features, or if it's completely redesigned?   Didn't realize they were actually made for claw grip...Thanks!   I noticed the chassis on my R.A.T 7 was a little bent making it impossible to get accurate shots, so I'm looking for a replacement. I mostly play FPS or RTS games, so I don't need dozens of buttons, but its hard to find a mouse that is good for us claw grippers.   Have you ever torrented before? I ask because a Windows 7 disk would be the best tool in this situation and it's very easy to get a copy via torrents.  Also, [see if there's a Microsoft Store near you](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/), they'll do free tune-ups and repairs for you!    Your system should still POST without a CMOS battery, although you can always try to "reset" it by removing the regular and CMOS battery, shorting out the CMOS battery pin for a few seconds with a paperclip, screwdriver, etc., re-inserting the regular battery, but leave the CMOS out and see what happens.  In some cases this can effectively reset your BIOS settings if that is the actual issue. As others have stated, it does seem like a possible motherboard failure. Even though it doesn't seem to be booting properly, I would still try a second display just for kicks and see if it even tries to detect an input. Most POST's try to check a video card, so if your onboard graphics are shot, you wouldn't get a display and the computer wouldn't continue to boot normally.    That link is a great start. Post back if you get stuck or none of those options fix it.   I believe MSI uses the delete or Del key to enter the BIOS. Make sure the system is COMPLETELY powered off, hit the power button, keep tapping the delete key. If it doesn't work the first time, try a couple more to make sure.   Yay!   I would still run at least [ADWCleaner](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/dl/125/) and [Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/lp/malware_lp_form/) since it's most likely some adware that caused that change in the first place. You may also want to look at any recently installed programs or browser add-ons/extensions to see if there's anything suspicious.  Good luck!   okie dokie... I would make sure your network drivers are fully up-to-date. Also, you can run the command, "ping www.google.com -t" and it will constantly ping that website until you stop it. Its normal for the occasional ping to not go through, but if you start to get several in a row, that's definitely an issue.   Generally, no. The LED is wired directly to the webcam, so if that's getting power, the LED is on.  That said, there are probably models NOT wired this way, but the vast majority are.

Do you have another device to test the connection with? This would help pinpoint whether it's your device, or the Comcast modem/router.   Go to your BIOS and make sure Secure Boot and/or UEFI boot are enabled.    What brand/model laptop? Different laptops use different battery technologies.   I currently have this issue and it's a known issue.  Your Ethernet drivers aren't currently compatible with that build of Windows. There's no software workaround (unless you can find an random Ethernet driver that is compatible with your NIC and Windows 10) but, you could purchase a Ethernet-to-USB adapter or a USB Wifi adapter if needed.  Things link this happen when running beta software :/   I would check your splices in the wires. I did the same thing once, the electrical tape fell off, and they shorted.    I'm thinking it's an OS issue, malware, or RAM issue.  1. In an elevated command prompt (search "CMD", right-click, and select "run as admin"), type "sfc /scannow" without the "". When the scan is done, let us know what it says.  2. Make a bootable USB with [Memtest86+](http://www.memtest.org/download/5.01/memtest86+-5.01.usb.installer.zip) on it. Boot to the USB and let memtest run overnight or for several passes. If you need further help with this, let us know.  3. Run a bunch of malware scans to see if you might have an infection. This is a [helpful link](http://rtechsupport.wikia.com/wiki/Virus_and_Malware_Detection_and_Removal)     Do you hear your HDD spin up? If you have an optical/DVD drive, will it open? If either of these are true, your PSU is *probably* fine and its a motherboard issue.  It may be a pain, but I would visit a local shop to help diagnose. Geek Squad, Microsoft Store, or even a local shop should have a power supply (PSU) tester and/or a spare PSU to test your components. It should very quickly tell if your PSU or motherboard are bad.   My guess would be on motherboard as that is a very nice PSU. That said, there should be a switch on the PSU for 120v/220v.. make sure its on the correct setting. If its a modular PSU, un-plug and re-plug BOTH ends of the cables.  Do you hear your HDD spin up? If you have an optical/DVD drive, will it open? If either of these are true, your PSU is *probably* fine and its a motherboard issue.   Sometimes, this issue fixes itself after an update, but lets try to manually do this.  What brand PC is it? Generally, the BIOS menu is F2, Esc, Del, or F12.    In addition to checking the Task Scheduler Library, try running a program like CCleaner (specifically the registry cleaner) which will sometimes remove missing .dll files. Autoruns is another free program that you could use to investigate and possibly solve the issue.   Couple things to try...  -Go to Control PanelNetwork   InternetInternet Options. Select the "Connections" tab, and then click the LAN settings button at the bottom. In the new window, un-check the "Use proxy server..." and check the "Automatically detect settings" box. If the proxy box was checked, this should resolve the issue, however, some malware will continuously re-enable it. Let us know if that's the problem.  -Malware is the most likely cause for this to happen. ADW Cleaner and Malwarebytes are awesome and permanently free. Hitman Pro is another great program that does a great job at removing rogue proxies, but its only a 30 day trial.  -If none of these work, you could try to manually remove any proxies from the registry, but lets cross that bridge only if we need to.     Do this:  1. go to https://myservice.surface.com/  2. Honestly answer the questions, or click on the talk to agent link.  3. They should be able to offer you a replacement for ~$320  OR  Go into a Microsoft Store, if there is one near you.

I have many male friends who have shorter, "professional" hair styles that require them to get their hair cut every two weeks. They think its strange that I wait a month!  	33
 Oh man...I found a picture of it on the photographer's website. It's even worse than I remembered. She even put his shoes back on for him and tied them.   My mom used to be Seventh Day Adventist. They're kind of like the Jews for Jesus people, right? She eventually switched to just being a Jew.   In this wedding, it was like a surprise for the husband. Like, the dude didn't know what was going on when his wife got a chair for him and took out a tub of water and started washing his feet. But yeah, it did mean a lot to them. It was still weird though.   Yes.   I thought so, but I really know nothing about any of that.  	5
 Looks like cotton or something to stop bleeding, I'm guessing done shortly before she passed. You can see a reddish tint around it.   Whatever helps you sleep at night.   But to answer your question, i would proclaim loud and clear, "I am Alexander the Grape!"   Letting the town's rapists have their way with his daughters, that he raised from their mother's womb, to protect two "angels" whom he had just met.  Yup, that's an everyday mistake. Yup....

 There are so many great ones to choose from, but my favorite has always been  "The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry."  I always have that line in the back of my mind somewhere, like a song lyric or something. What are your favorites?   Hey /r/Poetry,  I've started a GoFundMe for a new website that will, hopefully, appeal to all the poets here. As an amateur poet myself, I thought the idea was cool, but I'm curious to see what you guys think. You all helped me out a while back with a poetry experiment for my college class, so I'm hoping I'll get some help here too!  In a nutshell, writers will submit their poetry and short stories every month. Each poem and story will receive the same amount of exposure time, and will be voted on only by users. The votes will also be restricted, so it won't become a ridiculous popularity contest where the person with the biggest Twitter following wins every month.  If you submit one of the top 2 poems of the month, you get (if funding goes well) at least $100 and you'll be entered into a yearly vote for a large annual prize.  I'm really just trying to get the word out because I think a lot of amateur writers would like this idea. Again, maybe I'm horribly off base, but I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!  Please share or support here: http://gofundme.com/zajdng   I'd love to see them team up for some kind of existentialist crime spree or something.

I really want to find Bry's Q impression when he answers "I hadn't learned to walk yet!" after Walt asks about the longest he's gone without sex.  I keep seeing the quote, but with no episode listed.

It'll be fun and unique    Speaking of just talking about their lives, Bry never told the update to the Screengate story, did he? I swore he mentioned that there was one.   So celebrities are allowed to use a platform that started in an attempt to allow amateurs to have a voice to do whatever they want with it, but it's pointless for "random" people to record what they find entertaining? There are all types of podcasts. Don't listen to the ones that you discredit because they don't have enough pop culture clout for you.   And yes, we need a recording of that if those individuals want a recording of it. That's the good thing about podcasts. People can record whatever they want and people can listen to whatever they choose. I'm highly uncomfortable with the fact that a medium that began as a platforms for amateurs is now seen as a space for professionals and celebrities to further their pursuits, and now people like you say amateurs can't record what they want with their own money and resources.      "That's the Way It Is" is a pretty good and popular Elvis documentary. Highly likely Q has come across it.   Awesome!

 Besides the first one, I've seen that one a few times.    Where's Lord of the Rings?    Lord of the Rings is perfect hungover.    Storm of the Century    1. Titanic 2. Lord of the Rings 3. Armageddon 4. The Village 5. Jurassic Park   28 Days Later, my friend just said it was just like The Walking Dead, couldn't get past that.

Lord of the Rings   The Princess Bride, just haven't gotten around to watching it.    Just something to ponder.    I think it's gonna be really good.    Like Jurassic World was best at being just okay, what are some other ones??    Liv Tyler has a beautiful voice.    What does that mean?   What does going dark mean?   I'm wondering why my posts on these subreddits were deleted. Has this happened to anyone else? It says I'm not allowed to post there anymore....what does this mean?    Lord of the Rings   Big movies and music are now being regulated by the government to push for transparency, obedience, conformity, honesty, and science rather than entertainment or myth. No more Lady Gaga extravaganza.  Science fiction movies are now rooted in reality (tomorrowland, Jurassic world) because science fiction isn't something that's real, and they want to get away from not real, superpowers, myth, fantasy. And make things more science, Big Hero Six, The Martian.    Celebrities are suddenly becoming political to make the world think politically correct about issues.   Movies and music are getting away from the extraordinary and focusing on small things, the ordinary.    Bug (2006)  	31
    Completely agreed although i think that the feedback of the driver i a massive factor in the development. He can feel hoe the car reacts to updates/ changes. Telemetry doesnt always show that.   Probaly the smart desicion. Alonso en Jenson are perfect to develop a car. I guess they target wcc/wdc in 2017 with Alonso and Vandoorne/kmag.    Yeah that would be way to rational en spoil all the fun whining about Max   Well, i think he did. Thats why they went looking for it and found the problem. Ofc he doesnt know excactly what the problem was but i think no one wouls.  The point is he noticed it first in Q1 and there was really no time to fix it in qualy so he just set out to do the best lap he could do and get it sorted after.   hahaha that awkwardness when Ted was talking about the "back support" of the french reporter   Toro Rosso right up there again in FP1!

Yes Sainz is more consistent and quicker in qualifying, but he hasn't raised my heartbeat once so far this season. Max just is an exciting driver to watch. That's what this article is about.

Nah, Destiny is amazing.   My last relationship      YAY!!!   ?   590 is so close the difference is negligible. Also, the film will easily surpass that number with DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital sales.    You have a right to criticize, as well as to speak with your wallet. However, to call a company terrible in many ways without any justification or examples is just childish and entitled.   I couldn't disagree more. People tend to act entitled as if Riot owes them something, when in reality they are providing a service that is free that you have no obligation to invest any of your money into.     Yolo Queue is the heart of the game. LCS, and E-Sports in general is the advertising budget.  I could not agree more with this statement right here.    Did anyone else think Resident Evil when he first opened up the mansion doors?   Worth   Correct me if I am wrong, but if they included the .gifs for the animations (when available) in the client install, how would this affect load times at all?   Comments are filled with armchair therapists. Be warned.    There are some champs that I will not play strictly due to lore.   ex. Darius, because Garen is my nigga.    Relevant Text:    "So as anyone who has watched the Vi champ spotlight may know, Vi was originally intended to be a top laner.   She's got a lot of cool gameplay in top lane with the Q charge up and E cleave but, honestly, she's just too fair up there for too long compared to our current crop of top laners. In the early game she has meaningful mana costs, telegraphed attacks, and massive cooldown windows for her passive and all of her spells (P - 18, Q - 18, E - 14 per charge, R- 150). I actually think top lane Vi could be a pretty awesome experience for both sides of the lane if we did stuff like lower her CD's or buff E's range and mana cost but then jungle Vi would go to crazy town. Could nerf jungle Vi to compensate but then are we screwing over the many Vi mains who prefer her out-of-lane experience? It's a tough call.  All this said, SmashGizmo got diamond last season almost exclusively with top lane Vi. He'd typically play conservative until 6 focusing only on CS and rush an Iceborn Gauntlet for the extended dueling power and mana to offset her high costs. Turns out if a Vi manages to stay even until 6 there is not a single character up there (not even Irelia or Jax) who can beat her in a straight up 1v1. Her burst and sustained damage output is insane when she gets the chance to use it and her late game with top lane items is monstrous for the enemy teams' squishies (or at least it was in season 3, a lot has changed since then)."     	52
 I guess I can see that   It seems weird to me that those people need to use religion as a crutch to handle the big horribleness of life, while people with no faith seem to manage it just fine. Why are we so special to be able to deal?   Those phones have buttons...the cameras would be shit too         I have. It just makes me.more mad because whole sub is nothing but pictures of Minions!  I mean, I get that is the point...but I hate them because they are everywhere, so why would  I visit a sub full of them?   Actually, nick nacks is a legitimate alternate spelling   Oh FFS those stupid Minions! All of these stupid quotes that have been splashed around social media for years are now suddenly resurfacing on Minion pictures and lauded as if they are new and amazing! I get so irrationally angry about it all!   I crochet. I make toys and blankets and little nick nacks. I am planning to have a market stall   An inbuilt computer chip that stores all our personal records, bank details etc. No need to sign for shit, no need for credit cards, no facial recognition software. You can't take the chip out because it is powered by electrical impulses, and it can't be corrupted by spammers.   I have come to the conclusion that is getting too big for itself. With it's rise in popularity, it has become a breeding ground for angry people to vent their frustrations on others, for Karma-whores to reap meaningless attention (I guess Facebook likes aren't doing it for them any more) and for spammers to bombard us from a new and invasive angle.  Those who are not part of these groups are left annoyed, disillusioned and cynical. We don't believe any of the sob stories any more, we are sick to detah of shit turning out to be stupid stunts and are just so fed up with trolls and their bile spewing out all over the place.  Honestly, it feels like a small-scale mock-up of how the whole of humanity is slowly sinking into chaos.   I love this. Great stuff.  What a horrible, stupid quote though! I always get so bothered about the almost offensive way religious people try to make any sad thing upbeat.  Your baby died? He is in a better place!  Your mum had cancer? All part of God's plan!  Million suffer in pain? Through suffering, we know God!   Ugh. OK, so my old work has an online service for all our payslips and tax documents....but I no longer work there, so I no longer have any kind of access to previous years' tax stuff or any of my slips.   My old work also have my old address and when they sent this years statement in the mail, despite a mail redirecting service I have in place, the letter got lost. So, I called them up to get a new one. They tell me I need to change my address with them by filling out a Change of Address Form....which they are able to email to me. I ask them why they can't just email me my group certificate. They tell me that is against their security policy. Ugh.  I ask them, if I fill in this form, will you process it quickly? No, there are lots of people trying to change their address and you will go to the back of the line.  I am more than annoyed. They have an electronic copy of my group certificate, which they refuse to send to me. I have to fill out a change of address for so they can mail it to me. They *email* me the form, and I am able to email it back, but even when I do, it will still take weeks for them to even process it!!!  And, after they process the form it will still take another week for them to send me my tax certificate...and then I have to wait another few weeks after for the Tax Office to process my return!   In this day and age, why everything isn't electronic is beyond me!  I am just so mad at the bureacracy of it all!  /rant    When this happens to me, I make up elaborate stories in my head. Like, I am some sortof hero who saves people, or a victim of a crime and I have to make up the clues and then solve them myself. Usually I get so fosused on that my brain stops dwelling on other stuff, gets bored and falls asleep.  This came in handy for me the other day. My brain decided that 1am was the perfect time to start stressing about this really ridiculous family problem we have at the moment. My dad's nephew is being really abusive to my dad because my dad has some money he owes him and his sister. THeir father used to live with us, but passed away leaving all his belongings at ours. My dad has told his newphew "I have your money, you and your sister just need to come get it. When you are here we can go through your dad's stuff and sort it al out." But they don't like eachother and refuse to come over. So, my dad buried the money in the backyard until they come over. My brain decided to begin stressing about this at 1am, because it came up with the horrible thought that if my dad died, no on would know where the money is, and it is about $50k, so it is fairly important.  Anyway, this probably doesn't help you at all but I can sympathise a least!   No, I'm pretty sure they made it themselves.  ba dum tis!  ..I'm sorry   I hate having to say "bless you" when someone sneezes, I just don't see the point and I hate that it is considered rude if you don't say it.  Obviously, because of that, I hate it when people say it to me. It bothers me that these people bless me, then I usally have to say "thank you" to acknowledge that they have acknowledged my sneeze.  It is petty and stupid, but it just pisses me off   My husband once wrote me a love letter and he decribed me as "a sparkling diamond in the rough crowd".   3  As to a non-soppy one, I would always have people in school come to me for help (usually with Science) because "you just have a great way of explaining things that actually makes sense! You should be a teacher!" THis made me happy   Agreed. That was just anecdotal bullshit.    Oh! I need to know about Capital Gains Tax!  How does it apply to inherited properties. I own, but my sister is buying my half of an inherited house off me. Will it get taxed?   I am new to CC, so I keep waiting for the assholes to show up and shit all over it. But they haven't! Everyone is so nice. I hate that I am suspicious.  I am in Australia. I work in a lab, but we have a lot of staff and everyone gets their own computer, so I often find myself just sitting around Googling things. It is kinda cool, but a bit boring.  Mine was apple, carrot, spinach and ginger. It was a greeny brown and I put waaay too much ginger in it. Plus is was super chunky and I couldn't bring myself to chew it so I tried swallowing it and now it is just sitting in my stomach like a lead weight. Blergh.  My favourite recipe so far has been banana, vanilla yogurt, protein powder, honey, cinnamon, a cube of frozen lemon juice and almond milk. It tastes like breakfast! Really yummy and very filling   r/relationships is where relationships come to die. Everyone is angry because their relationship sucks and try to compensate by giving shitty advice and telling you to dump your SO.  My night is actually a wednesday morning, and I am at work on Reddit. I am on non-rostered duties, so I have no where to be so no one can get mad at me :)  Also, I tried a new recipe for a fruit and veg smoothie thing today. It tasted like shit and now I feel sick :(   Does Kjeragbolten mean "stay the fuck off this dangerous"?   The human body is truly a messed up thing.   Oh, you are becoming an adult...here, let me fuck your whole face up nice and good with this acne!!!   Fucking trains, amirite?   Damn nature, you scarycool   My housemate would never wash his dishes. I would always end up having to do them.  One day, we had some people over and having refused to do his dishes the night before, I also refused to cook that day. He did the cooking, no fuss and all seemed well. UNtil I looked down at the lamb cutlet I was eating and noticed a fly. A charred, well-cooked fly. THen I noticed another....and another.  I ran into the kitchen and looked into the frying pan with horror to see a whole meal of dead crispy flies in the pan.  He had used a dirty, fly covered pan to cook our meat.   Unfortunately for him, it was only he and I who were eating the lamb cutlets. WHile I discreetly disposed of mine, I allowed him to eat all of his before showing him the pan. Needless to say, he washed his dishes from that point on.   The sweet, sweet justice is delicous   If you have any kids I am imagining they are just gorgeous.   He gets to see all the other weird stuff I do. This....this is for me   More like, THLAP THLAP THLAP THLAP   Oh I LOVE that song!   And I reckon that is the key difference...how they make you feel.   When I read Harry Potter...even after all these years, I feel like I am returning to the exploits of old friends. I laugh, I cry, I cheer because I feel so connected with them.  ASOIAF is great and well written but I just don't feel as strongly for the characters. It's like reading a gripping account of history. I need to methodically get through it, even if it is just to have a sense of knowing what is happening...knowing but not feeling.   this is too cute. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy   That I waited a year to go on my trip to America. We were supposed to take the trip last year but decided to move instead. Now we are prepping to go in October...so if I died today I would be a pretty miffed ghost   Only if they are TV-show quality   A blob fish.  You can only fight crimes that occur deep down at the bottom of the ocean   I stand in front of my mirror naked and shake my hips to make my butt cheeks slap together.   Not even my husband knows I do this   I learn craft hobbies, like crochet and drawing. Creating something feels like a good use of my time, because then it doens't feel wasted. To make friends I turned to Reddit. CatchUps are the best.  Other then that I just think about all the things I have always said "I should do that one day" and make moves to achieve them...however slowly. I will take a class or two in some random thing. It doesn't matter if I don't carry on, at least I tried. I go and explore places that I always see form afar and always think I want to have a closer look at. I also bake and bring the results to people at work. I walk around the shops or open malls, not really looking for anything, and strike up conversations with people. I have met the nicest people on the train who noticed I was crocheting and wanted to talk about it.  The way I figure it, time isn't wasted if you can say "well...I did *this* today. It can be small and just the one thing, but it feels good   Isn't that Angels and Demons? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons_(film)   Someone shattered the glass for me for "Blue" by Eiffel 65.  I'm blue,   I'm in need of a guy  I'm in need of a guy  I can't unhear it now   The HP series was for the child in us. It fed our imagination, helped us come to terms with complex things like love, and sacrifice and death. We grew with the books, and every time a new one came out it was like you were growing older with them. By the time the last one came out I was not much older than Harry. I felt like his friend and *needed* to know he was OK, because then, whatever I was dealing with or thinking about at the time would turn out OK.  ASOIAF is for us as adults. It satifies our lusts. Blood, sex and violence. We get involved in the politics and the characters because they are complex and interesting....but also otherworldly. We might have some things in common with the characters, but int he end we are enjoying reading about things that we can't relate to. Kings and Queens and war and betrayals. GRRM isn't helping us grow, he is letting us peek into a world of his own. A world that we have grown up seperately from, and one that we want more of because we don't know it.  We grew up with Harry Potter, but we live as adults with the people of Westeros.  ...well that is how I see it anyway   I just stared at it for a while, not daring to open it just yet. I knew that once I did, I wouldn't be able to shut it until it was done....and a part of me wanted to draw out the feeling of not knowing the ending for as long as possible. I enjoyed the anticipation   Please tell me your were under your bedcovers, delicately turning the pages so your cranky uncle and aunt wouldn't wake up and find out you were reading about magic in the dead of night   Lol sorry!!! I have definitely heard of Linda Rondstadt, if that redeems me!  Also, thank you. Lately I have been trying to expand my music base, so this is a big step for me as the style is not somethig I usually listen to (but have decided I want to)   I sure hope so. ASOIAF is sort of that for me, but I have yet to attend a book release. I will for TWOW   Melbourne, Australia.  Gorgeous and sunny but it is still chilly. Maybe 12C.  12:57pm   I remember going to get it. It was the first book w I was old enough to go and drive to get. I has such jittery nerves and was so happy when the lady handed it to me. It was sunny, but a little chilly. It was a school day, so the roads were quiet and no one was home when I got back so i was free to curl up on the couch and read in silence   I work in Medical Science, and in my experience it is a mostly female field. I have only ever had female bosses/supervisors. There are males and they are in vary degrees on senority, but the percentage is probably 30M:70F.  Because of that, I have never experienced any gender-related obstacles. My old work had a small team, so pregnancy was a thing that disrupted us quite a bit. But that never stopped anyone from having babies. It just meant that when someone got pregnant we knew our boss would be stressed out.  My new job is much better in that regard. Big team, so pregnancies are no big deal.  Aside from pregnancies I have not once came to a point where being female has stopped me achieving anything beyond some heavily lifting. I am not talked down to by any of my male collegues or made to feel inadequate.  I know all of this doesn't really answer your question, I just wanted to give my 2cents      Exactly! And what about a 16 year old girl who gets her face splashed all over Facebook so all her friends and schoolmates see it. She would cop so much from that.  And what about women in abusive relationships? Maybe they can't stand to bring a child into that environment but would be in such fear for their lives if their partnet found out   Well...yes. That's the point.    "Just be nice and and not horrible to other people, k? Oh and for goodness sake, do something about the goddamn environment!"   Isn't that like any crime?   Well said   Mental and emotional harrassment that causes a person to fear for their safety or wellbeing is very illegal in Australia      ...or to help their mental and physical well-being   I think such a law would actually be even more of a free speech/rights issue   Now *there* is a reason to protest   But...but I just described my Sunday morning   Well a similar law already exists in one state here, so I have a feeling this one will pass.   I liken this to our restrictions on smoking. You are allowed to smoke, but in certain areas to protect the public. In the past some of these protests have affected the public negatively and so restrictions are set up to prevent that happening. The law must protect all its citizens...not just protestors   Ugh, don't even get me started on those!   It must highlighted that its says "illegal at certain times" and "illegal to film" patients. They have their windows and they aren't allowed to "stalk". These seem pretty reasonable to me   The problem word here being "peaceful"   If police tell you to move on because you are in breach of the law and you refuse then you can be arrested. It's always been like that   There are fines, but no jail time   I think the point of this law is to make the existing laws easier to enforce   I think there is real trouble with deali g with the harrassment/harrassors...which is bringing about the need for the law   The protestors aren't really being punished   No, but inciting bullying against someone through social media fits into the Australian definition of harrassment...and that is why I think this will be helpful   This is what I liken it to aswell.   Last I heard, harrassment was illegal.    The article singles out this being a means to stop the protestors taking photos of the women and splashing them all over social media to shame them. In my books that qualifies as harrassment.   Like I said, they aren't making protests illegal, they are just making the areas around abortion clinics safer. They have every right to protest down the street   Sorry you had to go through that.   My friend was abused the other week on the train because of his beard. The guy was totally off his chops drunk and was telling my friend to go back to were he came from and stuff like that.  The kicker? My friend is a pasty white guy. He just happens to like beards   The idea of the law isn't to stop protests...it is to stop protests affecting the safety and confidentiality of people seeking medical care.   They have the right to protest, just................over there   I was very happy to see this being drafted. It is a big win for women's rights...particularly the right to safe, confidential medical care   Not that far south. What crazy weather!   ----E ?   Well I was pretty happy about it :P   I saw [this](http://imgur.com/U3n81uz) in a shop once. It made me so mad that people thought this was even acceptable to sell   I could watch these all day.  Whatcha doing tinytruck?    My husband was very quick to make sure I did not do this. In the end it defrosted well enough before I had to leave      Being in warm bed on a rainy day, you have nowhere to be, nothing that needs doing and no one who needs you. You don't need to pee and someone has brought you breakfast in bed (a nice wholesome breakfast that isn't messy and wont get all through the bed)   These are cool. Could you do 3D stuff with them?   This is cute. Although, knowing cats it is probably more like "This is my spot, human."  Also, I expect someone to come along and say this is somehow child abuse, at some point. So prepare yourself for that...    My wedding dress   My windscreen had ice on it this morning. As an ex-Queenslander this was a first for me   "I punched it in the back."   Australia   ...why would I make up something like that?  And yes...it's really raking the Karma in!      Thanks :) [These] (http://imgur.com/a/M5rhx) are some of my other AT themed stuff. Super crappy photos and I never did finish the Marci-PB one but I still love em.  I love the story of Marci   Thanks :) The photo is hella grainy. I meant to do a whole bunch of them but never got around to it   [This](http://i.imgur.com/o8hWnn9.jpg) was my attempt   The jaw and the eyebrow, plus no lip definition.          I like it, but Marci looks a little too masculine   Watching my husband play COD while I make dinner.  Also my legs hurt for no reason at all :(   Ronnn Weasley   Roonil Wazlib   My cynicism tells me OP just thought up a joke and had a bad time applying it to a meme         I report every one I see   Pure joy and awe like this is rarely seen in am adult. It made me feel warm and fuzzy :3   I don't think it is OP's picture   She probably would have blamed you too      FWIW, I have never had a ticket or been involved in an accident either   All by myself?   One of the simple pleasures in life   My car isn't underperforming...I just obey road rules and speeds   A bigger person *would* let it slide...but I freely admit it makes me laugh.  Also, I pick my battles and I don't do it every day. It is a every-now-and-then thing, only reserved for the really annoying people.  One day it might bite me on the ass...and I will have no one to blame but myself       A bumper up my ass,  a blaring horn and a finger is a sure fire way to get me to be an asshole driver back to you.  Oh you want me to go faster? It would be a shame if I *slowed down even more!*   I want a lot of money so I can do all of the things I wanna do on my American holiday.  ...I mean...World Peace?   People mostly only talk about the bad stuff because they need help and are reaching for it.  They don't talk about the soft kisses their SO plants on their neck, or the cute notes they leave for eachother, or the way they fall asleep holding hands, or the strength they give eachother in hard times, or the happiness they enjoy simply by having someone love them back...because those things are sacred and secret and don't need to be aired.  Don't be scared off by a little dirty laundry!    100 people can find something mildly interesting, and that doesn't make it more interesting than something only 10 people find mildly interesting. It just means more people have seen it   I constantly have people asking me where I am from in my own country...but I have never travelled long enough to have any other accent.  It is just the way I talk.  It makes me really paranoid that I talk funny   Wut   I see this less of a good deed and more like a stroke of luck to be able to rescue a baby duck.  If anything the adorable ducky did a good deed.for you by getting itself in trouble and getting you to save it.  A day where you get to hold a baby ducky is a good day, in my books   I really feel that if you tried hard enough, you could see double meaning in almost anything a man says to a woman. Unless he is being outrightly rude enough to call him out, just let it slide. There is maturity in letting little things not bother you...and not trying to find insult where none exists   Let's get down to business   While I agree that people could all be a lot nicer to eachother, it wasn't as if the two women were deliberately or maliciously targeting the woman   Jai'me   Nope, except for having to occasionally accept the rope she pushes into your hand for tug o war, she is really very low maintenance   My Foxi Russell has a toy snake that she deliberately whips around in the air til it is draped across her back. She then trots around the house pretending it isn't there until some sort of internal switch flips and she then enters into a dramatic struggle with it like it is trying to get her. She usually ends up on her back, like she is pretending the snake is winning, then suddenly finishes the game by hurling the snake through the air to the other side of the room. Triumphant, she trots over to me and expects love and praise for defeating the deadly snake that invaded our home.   ...and then she spots it again and the battle begins anew   She is a weirdo      Never get angry. Never make a threat. Reason with people.   Mario, The Godfather   *herself   Don't even get me started on the term "hero"! u/siccoblue would have a conniption   I don't know why I could tell you were being saracstic, but it wasn't because you said Natalie Portman. It could have been anyone.    I guess this place can be just full of so much crap, it is hard not to turn off the crapfilter sometimes.  On top of this picture being a hella old repost, the man is publically shaming his daughter for a very normal girly thing...she wants to wear cute shorts like all her friends wear. This isn't something for a man to go around embarrassing his daughter over. So excuse me if I am not singing this father's praises.  On top of that, the "Father of the Year" phrase *has* been a bit overworked lately, and for things (like I pointed out) are actually a little mundane. I may be a downer when I point this out, but I guess I am just not that easily impressed.  The second point you made is a little beyond what I was being critical of. That sounds like someone with an agenda scrambling to find a way to squeeze their gripes into the conversation. At least mine was in context.  And the last one...how many times have you seen sob story posts that turn out to be bullshit? We are jaded from all the lies. Can't help it.  Edit: I think you are overreacting a little about the "mass downvote" bit, but I think the reason you aren't getting agreement is because you came off really negative yourself. So what if one person disagrees with a post...they have every right to do that. Just because you don't agree with *them* doesn't mean they are wrong or the post is ruined or the world is falling apart. The world needs the Happy Harrys as much as the Debbie Downers. Keeps things grounded. Don't agree with them? No problem, you don't have to.  Also, looking at the world with a glass-half-empty attitude isn't the sign of a bitter person, and it certainly shouldn't mean that they should just leave Reddit. It just means they aren't easily impressed and thus are more selective with things they do like   "Father of the Year" has lost all meaning these days.  Man talks to his child...FOTY.  Man feeds his child...FOTY.  Man makes responsible but obvious parenting choices...FOTY.   We are easily pleased and easily pissed off. It's a system.   ....not a *good* system   I feel the need to see this as a comic strip   My American holiday in October!!!   Wake my husband up and fuck his brains out   About 3 hours  	141
    So? They probably contract 4j's people for some stuff. I fail to see why this deserves a mention    Not worth it   Out of state was 50k for everything   Did a year at a CC and transferred to a great 4 year after saving 30k on my first year. Know a ton of people that did 2 years and then transferred to top schools like UCLA, Berkeley, UCSB, USC      Married no-name CFO of a big name company (conde nast I believe) allegedly tries to have closeted gay sex with a hooker. Plan foiled because plane is delayed. The story was absolutely terrible for a couple reasons, A) gawker's only proof that any of this happened was an "anonymous source," and B) the guy isn't even famous so why write a tabloid article about him?   Basically imagine you, a random dude, are married with kids and your local newspaper decides to write a slanderous and baseless story about you and gay hookers. That's what gawker did.   I think with military bases most of the people going in and out are issued firearms and probably have their own personal weapon so the sign is supposed to act as a reminder to check your weapon into the armory aftet target practice and leave your gun at home.   And the US gov classifies arabs as white   I think it has more to do with the content of the site than personal attacks. The hive mind does have a bit of an anti women anti minority sentiment.   Those are commercial units within a building. Much less expensive than residential property.   No? Prison labor isn't forced. The two are completely different.   Army Ranger Battalions and Navy SEAL units plan to integrate women by 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Correct me if I'm wrong but so far I don't believe any women has gotten through ranger school, let alone RASP, and very few have even passed the standard infantry tests.   But that's thing, women *can* do that. They werent allowed to be in combat positions. In the event of a draft most of the draftees are getting tossed into the infantry, cavalry, whatever, whereas the guys that enlist get to pick their position. Even though women have been allowed to try out for infantry positions for a year or two now (maybe longer?) I haven't heard of a single woman passing the  physical aspects of the officers test or ranger school (which is not to be confused with RASP which let's you join the 75th). Logistically it just doesn't make sense to draft women if 90+% of them aren't even physically capable of being in the infantry. Sure you can make the argument that you're making, but realistically speaking every time we've instituted a war time draft we were tossing draftees into fighting positions and not logistical positions.   Insurance is a terrible way to do it. Cops aren't independent contractors working under an LLC like doctors. And suddenly cops will try to avoid certain positions and working in certain areas because it will raise their premium. It's just such a bad idea once you give it a minute of thought.   That's what I thought might be the case. I don't think there's anything really wrong with my dad's set aside from being old and missing an iron or two. I think it's from the 90s and he never golfed much so it's hardly been used. The driver is an 11 big bertha war bird. I'm not actually sure if the irons are Callaway's, they say Lamkin on the grip and stainless steel custom on the heads.  E: The fairway woods are pinseekers.   I've been using some old Callaway's I found in my dad's garage but now I want to buy my own set. What do you guys suggest? I was looking at this set:  http://m.dickssportinggoods.com/product/index.jsp?productId=60552686 cp=4406646.4413989.4414118 categoryId=4414157   When you're covered in blood and a cop is asking about it maybe it's a good idea to eat the fine and tell them you picked up some roadkill. Certainly a better idea than running and reaching for a gun..... all of this is moot though because nobody mentioned roadkill and it seems like you're just looking for any reason to validate your hatred of police officers.   Airports/airplanes are a threat because an airplane can be used against a hard target like a building. If someone wanted to take out a soft target in the manner that you're talking about it would be easier for them to sneak past some guards at a sporting event or hit a crowded tourist attraction. The anti-TSA circlejerk is a bit ridiculous. Sure they're not as effective as they could be, but even security lines at major airports are less crowded than a lot of public attractions in big cities. When it comes to airports the government is mostly worried about somebody stealing  a plane because to date the two most devastating attacks on US soil have been from people crashing planes into things.   Idk why you'd think that. A lot of CEOs and guys on wall street are putting in 100 hour weeks near quarters and 10-12 hour days the rest of the time. There's a reason that adderall is corporate America's favorite drug.   Afghanistan was about undermining the Taliban's control over rural regions through a hearts and minds campaign. It was NEVER about poppies or opium. Most of the time the top brass actively discouraged burning down the poppy fields, and at least one base even went so far as to let a farmer use their sewage run off as irrigation for his poppy fields. The reason being that destroying an entire village's livelihood is going to do more to make them support the taliban than to win over their hearts and minds.   Suppress the mitigating factor and of course poppy cultivation flourishes, but it's not because the US government was trying to get in on the afghani poppy trade.   Where do you live that beat cops make 40-60 an hour?   Clearly nobody has told you that celebrity.yahoo.com covers all of the pressing stories.   UC Berkeley offers a BA in Luso-Brazilian Literature so yeah you're not far off.   Where did you get the idea that it "just happens?" Yes, a common-law marriage is easier to form than a traditional marriage but it requires both parties to act as if they are married by introducing each other as husband or wife, filing joint tax returns, combining assets and debts, and just generally doing what married people do. In recent years common law marriage was mostly used as a get around in states that didn't allow gay marriage. Are you really trying to tell me that anybody that's been roommates with someone for more than "x" years is automatically in a legal and binding relationship with them? It's not that simple.   Common law marriage doesn't just automatically happen. You have to file some documents.    It's blanket banned under the chemical weapons and nerve agents ban. I'm sure that they'd love to be able to use pepper balls and tear gas when dealing with insurgents holed up in buildings.   In legal terms a marriage is a combination of assets to be shared equally among the members of the partnership. If you don't agree to those terms or view them as unfair then either don't get married or be married in faith but not legality.   That's why you get a good lawyer to write your prenup. Also if you include extreme clauses like not splitting assets then of course it will be thrown out because that's not how our judicial system works.      Oh my god dude I flew first class with united a few weeks ago and the flight attendant was crazy attentive. Anytime my drink got to 1/4 full she would appear out of nowhere to refill. It was awesoms.   Sssshhhh he's an innocent martyr in the fight for personal freedomz    I get that people are mad and what happened was terrible but this is honestly kind of fucked up. Every guy I know did stupid stuff when they were young. Some of it stupider than what these kids did. We were all just lucky enough that we weren't playing with fire during a heatwave. Charge them with trespassing, vandalism, criminal mischief, and some other misdemeanors, but these kids don't deserve to face trial for multiple felonies.   Usually the degree is for the job and the minor is for personal enrichment    The funny thing is that if he hadn't mentioned the rapist part then people may have actually been receptive to this   I mean I'm not going anywhere    Viva le revolution   You never burned leaves when you were a kid? The most likely scenario is they had a lighter and started playing with fire in the press box. It got out of hand because it was a 90+ day and hasn't rained in a long ass time. These are 12 year old kids, don't forget that. 12 year olds, while stupid, are not criminal masterminds capable of successfully getting away with arson in broad daylight on one of south Eugene's busiest streets. This lady is upset and maybe she can't think clearly, but any objective observer can say with certainty that they are unrelated.   Except it is illegal. And their servers are being hosted in the EU so they're subject to a ton of political correctness stuff. The company they were renting from before had to sever their contract because the hate stuff is illegal in Europe.   Also I don't think that number includes housing, books, etc.   80+ for 90k? Jesus christ that's terrible.   Civic wasn't locked up well at all. It was easy as shit to get in there. I remember during high school a few years ago every once in a while people would brag about sneaking in at night and drinking beers or smoking weed in the grandstand or dug outs.   Somehow I doubt that there is a ring of pre-pubescent arsonists in eugene.   Yeah i did a ton of stupid shit as a kid. Idk if any of it was felonious but it very well could've been. The difference is I never trespassed or caused property damage.   One commenter on the article mentioned that parents of minors can only be held accountable for up to 7.5k of damage done by their child, any truth to that?   I believe it's actually popular because in WW1 they found that circumcised dudes were not getting some sort of genital infection from living in the trenches as easily    And the civil war was more about states rights then slavery, though the right to own slaves was part of it.  An excerpt from the vice president of the CSA's cornerstone speech:   "Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition."   Is it right wing? I don't read it so idk but it's usually the left that's complaining about cops.   Here's the airsoft gun from the Andy Lopez shooting next to a real AK. If a cop tells you to drop your weapon and you whip around and face him while holding that it's no wonder you're getting shot.  https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/usa-california-teen-shot.jpg   60 days is the bare minimum amount of time that the bill has to be public before congress votes on it. So you'll have at least 2 months, probably more time to contact your representative.   While it wasn't part of the original CSA flag it was incorporated into the design of later versions.   Well yes, because it was just recently finalized. It will be public for at least 60 days before congress is allowed to vote on it.   Did you even read my comment? What you're describing is literally the exact opposite of what's happening. Classified negotiations =/= secret bill passing.   Except that can't be further from the truth. The full uncensored text of the bill, and any other bill that appears before congress, will be made public for at least 60 days before they vote on it. Stop acting like there's a giant conspiracy. The only reason any law was passed without you reading it is because you never bothered to Google the text of the law.   I still fail to see why this is such a bad thing. It seems that most of the people in this thread have no idea what fast tracking a bill even does....   Don't forget killer of Bin Laden and the president under which gay marriage was legalized.   Why do you think that? Like I'm not trying to be a dick to you, I'm legitimately curious about why so many people on reddit realistically think he has a chance. Here's why I'm not so sure he does:    Bernie is running on a campaign that promises free college, $15/hr minimum wage, cheap healthcare, and an increased amount of days off. Don't get me wrong that all sounds great, but there's absolutely nothing to suggest that any of that is feasible. Obama ran on a similar platform and didn't do any of it. He'll get roadblocked every step of the way, and he hasn't actually suggested much that he could reasonably achieve. On top of that he has absolutely no experience in foreign policy or diplomatic relations and has little experience dealing with minority problems and no experience dealing with border issues. The polling in his favor is done rather optimistically. The polls that show him gaining on hillary were done in his state, which has a 95% white population, is predominantly middle class, and has a population smaller than most large cities, or in other New English states with similar demographics. Finally, he's a self described socialist which is not going to fly in a lot of red and purple states. I doubt I'm going to view him as a realistic candidate until he shows polling promise in states in the midwest and west.   But if you have a reason to believe that he is a realistic candidate other than his ability to connect with people then please tell me. Bernie's ideas are good in theory and if he could honestly pull them off I'd probably vote for him, but I would rather have a dem candidate that's realistic than a democratic party that's divided and a Republican party that's rallying behind one guy.   Maybe, maybe he could beat hillary in the primary, maybe, but then he'd get torn apart in the election campaign. No republican, independent, or conservative liberal will touch him. The democrats would essentially be committing election suicide if they nominate him over hillary.   By law the full text of TPP will be made public before congress votes on it. Congress cannot pass laws in private. When the bill is formally read to congress it will be made public, if not sooner.   What? If anything this promotes debate rather than further secret negotiations. The full bill has to be publicly disclosed (I believe at least for two months before congress votes on it), and Congress can't amend it so they either have to pass it or nix it. If there's any discrepancy in TPP you'll have plenty of time to write your representative and tell them to vote against it. Furthermore I don't understand why you people keep harping on the secret negotiations aspect of it. Classified negotiations are par for the course with any FTA because it makes reaching a deal simpler. Hell it's par for the course for non-FTA bills, even Obamacare was negotiated in secret. There's literally no reason to go all conspiro about this.    It will be read publicly in front of Congress. This fast track doesn't pass it, it just means that Congress can only pass it or vote it down instead of amending it.   Yes. It will be read publicly in front of Congress.   The term "poor door" is kind of misleading. The city needs low income housing so apartments built low income housing, with the caveat that the people that are paying a reduced price not have access to many of the building's amenities that the majority of tenants are paying market value for. Poor doors open into a section of the building that is physically separated from the pool, gym, etc. It's not about degrading poor people.   The reality is that this ruling will make more property managers resistant to having low income housing in their buildings, which is really a shame because these programs allow lower class families to live in safer neighborhoods with better schools. It's not unreasonable for building managers to want to charge market value if their tenants are going to be able to use the door man and the pool and the gym and all of those rather expensive amenities.   Isn't Alabama just straight up ignoring the supreme court ruling?   I hate this idea that reddit perpetuates. Afghanistan was never about poppies, it was about winning over hearts and minds in order to undermine the Taliban's influence in rural areas. Most of the time the top brass actively discouraged burning down the poppy fields, and at least one base even went so far as to let a farmer use their sewage run off as irrigation for his poppy fields. The reason being that destroying an entire village's livelihood is going to do more to make them support the taliban than to win over their hearts and minds.   I've never experienced any sort of constant racism since moving to socal. Some isolated incidents here abd there but I think you're either exaggerating or from so bumfuck nowhere small town   That's because 90% of the American public has no understanding of basic economics and gets lost in the first paragraph of any TPP article. If you go to any business or economic centric news outlet (WSJ, Bloomberg, The Economist, etc) they are all talking about the TPP. As an informed person you are supposed to diversify your news sources. ABC, CNN, HuffPo, etc none of them hire experts, they hire *journalists*, so all the TPP stuff they write is like a crude ELI5.  Honestly you shouldn't be trying to get specialized news like science or economics from a major news outlet like CNN because those outlets are primarily equipped to report on things like politics and war because anyone with any type of degree can understand it.   Holy shit that's true. Why is it that all of the people that aren't going to college are the ones that post the crazy conspiro stuff? I recently had a fb friend share a post that was a picture of a HS or college age girl with tabe all over her face and written on the tape was something saying that the cure for cancer has already been found but the cancer industry is too lucrative for them to announce the cure.      It's prescribed for narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder   Meth is still a prescription drug, trade name desoxyn. The problem with meth is that it binds to a protein that makes it neurotoxic even at low doses. That's why doctors are willing to prescribe high doses of dextroamphetamine before they prescribe even low dose methamphetamine. A study comparing long term meth and cocaine use found that a 6 day exposure to meth causes neurotoxicity, but cocaine was not neurotoxic at 11 days. Neither of them are safe but if I had a gun to my head I'd take the coke over the meth.   No. I've got friends interning in IB firms there right now. They've been telling me some stories haha   Cocaine adderall and modafinil fuel wall street    The Dinghy is pretty good. I rode an Arbor Pocket Rocket awhile ago and really liked it. It's a bit closer to the size of a penny. For $70 Churchill makes the Penny Killer which is basically the exact size of a penny except made of maple with metal trucks.   Because most people don't get a story written about them doing their job   Right but it might change the feel of the board.    Wheel recommendations for the tugboat? I took the 66mm zig zags that came with it and put them on my Land Shark bc I felt that they fit that wheel base better. I've found that the tug's wheel base feels a bit too small for me so I'm thinking smaller wheels might fix that problem. Want to try that before I go through the trouble of selling it.  I've got polar bear trucks and 1/4" risers btw.   Eugene hasn't been a small town for several decades.    Like the guy on tifu(?) that torrented a copy of dawn of the planet of the apes for his dad and it didn't have the subtitles for the apes   What happens when you've got lava rocks on both sides of the road.

How about the full size?  http://www.tactics.com/almost/daewon-joker-dc-comics-series-775-complete-skateboard   are Almost decks any good?

Hey guys what's a not too expensive street complete? I want to get a board that I can ollie on and learn to do shuvits and whatnot. Are there any solid setups I can get for less than 100?  E: Would this be good?  http://www.tactics.com/tactics/emblem-ii-8125-complete-skateboard/silver-trucks-white-52mm-wheels   Nah the mini is symetrical and has longer kicks.   He's right. Most countries drive on the right.   R/changemyview    I don't know a whole lot about dh but Bustin's sale section might have a good discounted dh board   http://www.bustinboards.com/sale   Haven't turned in any handwritten assignments not including math and in class work once since I started college.   I just watched it like 1000 times at .5 and .25 speed and I didn't see any rocks, granted the quality isn't great at those speeds but I atleast should've been able to see it bounce away. I think she just accidentally shifted her weight in a way she wasn't expecting when she settled back into her tuck. Rough stuff though she got bounced. Sending her good vibes OP.   :(    Haha yeah it stays relatively cool here. The wind definitely helps   UC Santa Barbara haha I'll take the sunshine over the rain every day.   I feel. I grew up in Oregon but dipped tf out to go to school in SoCal. Fuck pnw weather haha   According to the article he was convicted of dealing crack cocaine and attempted murder under RICO.   You at OSU?    Bustin is one of the biggest *quality longboard brands out there   You can get a blank custom from bustin. Same price.   Do you like edm? The new galantis album is pretty fire.  https://soundcloud.com/wearegalantis/sets/pharmacy-out-now   I wonder if enough of the market is untapped that they could just raise the cost for new customers.   Doing mdma once a week is really bad for your serotonin receptors. You're supposed to wait three months between rolls.   Damn ben stiller skates surprisingly well. I would have thought that they had done all of the shots with him skating on flat ground. You think they gave him a bit of practice or he has some experience?      How long does it usually take Bustin to get a custom board out? When I ordered they said that the wait was 10 business days but I'm hoping that they will get it out sooner than that. 10 business days + 5 days shipping D:   I prefer bud over dabs all the time. Dabs hit you like a train and then it's all comedown for 90% of the high.    Dude the max for stat in oregon is like 5 years... Your friend did more than have sex with a 17 year old.   The same black box could be installed in a normal car but we don't do that now. What makes you think self driving cars will be any different?   Econ/accounting major here. Can confirm that math has been done correctly.   His point is that it works for Portugal because they're small enough that they can actually prevent drug smuggling. The US on the other hand is bordered by 2 oceans and 2 countries. We have a 2000 mile long border with one of the biggest drug exporters in the world. Comparing the US to Portugal is comparing apples and oranges.   You haven't been looking then.  http://m.pnas.org/content/109/40/E2657.abstract   Because marijuana doesn't actually cure anything. It alleviates symptoms. Stoner "activists" act like a couple puffs off a joint is enough to cure cancer but there is absolutely zero evidence that marijuana does anything but alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the legalization of marijuana, both recreational and medical, but people need to be realistic about the situation. It's not a miracle drug. So far there's no scientific evidence that points towards it being anything other than a potent painkiller and seizure drug. Acting like it's a miracle drug is only going to hurt the case for legalization when actual scientific papers come out.   That's in part because Portugal is actually small enough to effectively secure their borders from drug smugglers.   Did you sit on the water pallet and turn your board into an awesome rolling chair?   What kind?   Right but bankers are involved in finance and not the creation of goods. Inflation is the elevation of the prices of goods and services. It's realistic to think that companies will raise the prices of their goods to account for the increased production costs. That 28m figure is only for federal minimum wage workers. It doesn't include anyone making 7.26/hr or higher. 29 states have a minimum wage higher than 7.25/hr. I agree that people should be realistic about the pros   cons, it's not going to kill the economy if the minimum is raised to $15 but there will be consequences. I imagine that unemployment will go up quite a bit until the economy is strong enough to re-absorb those workers.   An 18 trillion dollar economy that's supported by a lot of outsourced labor. Mom and pop shops and local businesses are already struggling to survive competition with large corporations. Significantly raising their operating costs will kill a lot of those businesses.   3.3 million people make at or below federal minimum wage. For simplicity I'm going to say that all of those people make 7.25, although that's not the case. 3600000  7.75 = 27,900,000. That's not an insignificant amount. Especially when you consider that that's just for federal minimum wagers and doesn't include everyone making below  $15/hr.   High: finally out of school for summer  Low: i was skating in this park literally just 5 minutes ago and I hit something that just absolutely bricked me. Idk if it was dirt or rocks or what but fuck it hurt. Currently sitting in my car with bleeding knuckles, elbows, and knees. Trying to calm myself down a bit before driving home. Weird thing was that as I was walking away from the crash I felt like throwing up and I was seeing spots but I didn't hit my head. Had to lay down for a minute before walking all the way back to my car.   Ooohhhhhh all for 25? Well sheeiiiit I thought it was 25 each   If I recall correctly from my high school days, teacher aides are =/= to teachers in training, but rather are just people that exist to help teachers that have large class sizes.   That's what I thought haha had to make sure I didn't have an a deal to good to pass up in front of me   noice   noice    noice   Are those surf rodz?   Cheapest "good" downhill/slide deck?   Hahaha wtf   How tall are you? Maestro mini might work if youre comfortable with a smaller platform.   To date, reds w/ spacers + speed rings but I've only ever ridden those, some abec 5s, and muirskate beastos. I've got some zealous coming so we'll see how they are.   OnTrac only services west coast states so that might be why   Aight I know I've been posting a lot of random shiz lately but this actually seems kind of pertinent to the community.   I was just looking at the tracking information for my latest muirskate order and saw that they're using OnTrac and not UPS or FedEx. I hadn't heard of them so I googled the carrier service and apparently 97% of their reviews on BBB are negative.... Anyone know why/when muir switched over? If I'm remembering correctly I think they used UPS last time I ordered something from them which was like 6mo ago.   When I get my stuff I'll update about whether it was on time and arrived safely   But my steez    These jerks  https://flashback.as.ucsb.edu/2012-13/files/2011/05/2013-03-19_14-55-05_360.jpg   How do you guys go over those yellow devil bumps when youre using a short board? My campus has a ton of bike paths so they're everywhere.   I'll upvote ya brah so there's a start. Easiest way I've found is to go to /r/askreddit and sort by rising and answer the questions    :p   I don't understand how they decide when to post these threads sometimes it's noon sometimes it's 1am   Ole    Another Gaucho?   Order the deck from landyachtz and everything else from muir?   Sounds about right. The chicken is uncooked so you've got to cook it and slice it but then you've got 64 burritos worth of chicken haha   Ah I feel. Put weight on your front foot when you hit hills. The only time I really disperse my weight evenly is when I'm just cruising flatground.   Chicken breast is awesome. I go to costco and I buy 4lbs of boneless chicken breast at a time and it's only like $11   My Maestro comes next week!  P.S. FIRST, LOSERS!   Sounds like a solid setup. How new are you? Speed wobs can be a mental thing from overcorrecting. When I was first starting out I got speed wobs all the time, but now I can take my 27" Land Shark down some mellow-medium hills.   What is your setup?    That's fucked.   Yeah I drove by it. House was fully engulfed when I went by and the fire dept wasn't on scene yet. 26th and Jefferson. Scary part was that the flames were licking the trees so hopefully it doesn't spread.   $40 is a lot of money for most of this sub's demographic    The tug is really just designed to get you from point A to point B with a couple ollies on the way. Def not a slide or dh board.    I mean this website is reddit, eg reddit issues are a big deal on *this* website. Protesting and circle jerking about the NSA on *this* website gets next to nothing accomplished because most people here already have the opinion that the NSA is BS.    That's the point of his comment, comparing a problem to a worse problem doesn't negate the first problem.   reds with spacers and speed rings v zealous?   How dis it get under a bus?   If he's already well off he might be selling stuff at cost just to get people stoked on boarding. I can't really think of any other way he could have those prices      anorexic for a day lol you have to abstain from eating longer than that before some medical procedures.   Suicide by cop is a real thing that has been studied in scientific journals. The first official suicide by cop ruling was in the UK in 2003, but the phenomenon has been recorded by agencies as far back as the 80s.    I'm having trouble with my footbrakes. Been skating for a few months now but just decided I should probably get on that. I can foot brake with the balls of my feet but when ever I try to heel brake I either get off balance or end up walking myself to a stop instead of dragging my feet.   I mean OP did confess to dealing drugs on reddit so it shouldn't be too hard to prove.   I like hot mama's wings. The kamikaze wings are the hottest thing I've ever tasted.   Looks good.    For a full face you could probably just use a motorcycle comm system. Some of those are pretty sleel. I think Sena makes one that's almost wire free.   They as in the people you were talking about in your last comment as in the people running the ambulance service.   These particular people are being douchebags but your original comment cast a wider net.   Kind of but Judaism is less hostile towards nonbelievers than other religions. In Judaism they essentially believe that muslims and christians worship the same god but only the jews accepted the Torah. They believe that everyone should follow the 7 commandments, but there are certain things from the Torah that are only a sin if committed by a Jew. They don't look down on others so much as they hold themselves to a higher standard.   That's awesome! How do you like it? Do the flashbacks stick out too far or are they chill?   That's a good point. I thought about Kegels but 80mm seems like it might be too big. What about sector 9 cosmic core butterballs or orangatang stimulus?    Finally ordering my Maestro. What do you guys think of the setup for carving and commuting? Wheels are the only thing I'm a bit iffy on.  Maestro, Paris V2 50s, .19" Khiro drop thru pads (would .13 or .06 be better?), zealous bearings, 70mm Abec 11 81a amber flashbacks. I kinda think the grippings might be better but the flashbacks are cool looking and pretty cheap.  	172

Traveling from DC to Norfolk some years ago, I sat next to a man who was absolutely brilliant. Physics professor I believe.  We discussed chess, fantastic theories etc. Was really cool. He was attending his sons wedding, I was there for work.  A strike at my company caused me to have to reschedule my return flight, early by 3 days. When I boarded the plane, I was seated next to the same man. His son had broken his arm and they delayed the wedding and he scheduled an early flight home.   Supporting feminism      Good call edited to address that   Again, I do not support him. I'm pointing out real possible damage he could represent to Democrat opposition. Personally, I feel Republicans are up shits creek in this election and they know it. I would say, short of some catastrophic attack against US that allows GOP to ride the "Obama failed us" train into the White House, they stood no chance before Trump and now they stand even less of a chance of winning.   Edit: To address question, you have access to the fictional universe of your target.   'Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.'  -Horace Mann   Honestly? He's so under the radar he's difficult to criticize by personality while also being a minority. This blunts a great deal of criticism towards Trump as being racist, it practically negates a major attacking point of the Democratic nominee. Also he is an incredibly intelligent man.

I want him to be. At this point one of two things will happen. He'll continue gaining popularity in the party and win the nomination in a surprise victory OR the GOP will ostracize him which he won't forgive and we get an independent Trump in the general, bleeding conservative votes and sinking whichever idiot wins the Republican primary.

       Hey there, I've been working with Dave for several years and am currently helping him promote his work online:  1) You should be able to get virtually any of the phonebooks from your local comic book store. Just ask them to order them from Diamond. The first two phone books have just been remastered. The third one should be done soon. Eventually the whole series will be remastered. I don't think any of the books are currently out of print. Diamond should have some copies of each phonebook.  2) If you want to order them as PDFs, you can go to either http://sellfy.com/cerebus or to http://cerebusdownloads.com. Sellfy is a little cheaper if you share the link on twitter. The second one, "High Society" is free. Cerebusdownloads.com has PDF and CBZ. Sellfy only has PDF but CBZ coming very soon.  3) You can download them as a torrent. Sim has [expressed his understanding](http://www.cerebusdownloads.com/DaveThinking.jpg) that some people just don't have any money. The two main Cerebus torrents out there have the entire issues, so you get the letters and essays.  4) You can read it a page-a-day (approx.) on Tumblr: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/  5) Dave does weekly updates every Friday on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGlbTwyt9cw4XZ9jRqrPeUg  6) Twitter with lots of cool photos here: https://twitter.com/CerebusOnline  7) Facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cerebus/  8) Keep an eye open on eBay and Twitter for sales. People are always selling bundles of the phonebooks or individual issues for cheap.  9) Excellent Cerebus blog here: http://momentofcerebus.blogspot.com/  Hope that helps, let me know if you have any other questions! I'm running a lot of the social media side of things so am very much interested in any suggestions on getting the word out there. If anybody has any ideas or suggestions, let me know!    From the comments. This is how it works:  http://i.imgur.com/7lrGIuC.jpg     Yeah, I thought the same thing.       There's an excellent documentary about him up on youtube. I think it would make anybody change their mind.

(It had sold just one Roomba the previous Wednesday.) It was also the largest sales day ever for Amazon devices, a category that includes Kindles, Echos, Fire tablets and Fire TV Sticks.*   Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP3MFbKgez_LbMpgUY4oYlsYAq0YNi2Le    Thanks for the reply! You make several good points, I agree on the perception of women being powerless being very dangerous. It's one of their strengths, ironically.  You probably saw the point about the Twitter case:  http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christie-blatchford-ruling-in-twitter-harassment-trial-could-have-enormous-fallout-for-free-speech  That's where feminist "ideas" about free speech lead us.  "I suppose you can view human society as a system not unlike a biological system or entity..."  I think that's exactly what Dave is doing here, it's an analogy, seeing the feminist hive-mind as working collectively while men, as a rule, work individually. He's extending that analogy to the point of suggesting a hive mind. Again, it's a work of fiction. If you're at all interested in Dave Sim's work, I would recommend Tangent. I think it should be sidebarred here. I'll definitely be posting more quotes from it here in the coming months:  http://www.cerebusfangirl.com/artists/tangent1.php  Thanks again!   [Really.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism)   I'm surprised there's really nothing about him around here. Seems like a natural fit to me.    Discipline.    I agree...but I think you're both saying the same thing, Sim's just taking artistic license with the concept because it's about a matriarchy in a magical medieval society with talking aardvarks. But I think the point of that influence being used in business, politics, the courts and schools without being acknowledged is the real problem.   Ha, you're up on some stuff...I've been working with Sim for about ten years now. Currently helping him get his material online, for sale on an official site: https://sellfy.com/Cerebus and up on tumblr for free: http://cerebusonline.tumblr.com/ Just promoting his stuff on twitter, etc. Wonder what tumblr when say when we get to the 186 pages! Well, it'll be a while till that happens. But in general, I think r/TheRedPill would find a lot of what Sim says to be pretty insightful. I'm just going to post some various quotes of his to gauge the reaction. Although maybe going with "Women Read Minds, Guys" isn't the best way to approach it....still I've posted other quotes from him around here to positive response.  I think it's safe to say Dave Sim is very big on God these days, and so a fan of the Jews...and the Muslims...and the Christians.   Those are what you call problem glasses:  http://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9q2wjNCcAA48rW.png    Interesting responses. Note that the above come from a work of fiction, but obviously I thought it was relevant. Thanks for the replies!    I'm surprised there isn't more Sim here, I'm going to try and change that!    Made me think of the time Mr Chi-City killed a bug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7_F_AqeRqo       "It's a little more complicated than that. "Woman's intuition" is a nice way of putting it. "Women are more sensitive" is another way of putting it. A not-so-nice way of putting it is that women rape men's minds the way men rape women's bodies. It's not an exact analogy, of course, because rape is invasion and invasion is the man's way, not the woman's way; absorption and consumption are the woman's way; what they're built for. Consider the two genders; one that invades and violates and the other that absorbs and consumes. The nice way of putting it is that theyre complimentary. The not-so-nice way of putting it is that they deserve each other; serve each other right.  Some women are more efficient at reading minds than are others. Some only pick up impressions; they just get a "feeling" you could say. Others it's as easy as reading a book, For many of them it's like eating a piece of candy; absorbing the entirety of a mind in one gulp.  "Reading" minds isn't the worst of it. The worst of it is changing the minds they absorb; planting contrary thoughts. Changing her mind, the saying goes, is a woman's prerogative. Changing others' minds is a woman's darkest secret; the black cauldron of which we all partake. Some greedily, some guiltily. Some intentionally, some inadvertently.  What is spreading throughout the civilized world is an abomination. An abomination I was very helpful in bringing about and an abomination which can come to no good end. It is a very large and very dangerous force. Whose minds are being absorbed? Heads of state, business and economic and religious leaders. Whose minds are absorbing them? Unelected wives, grasping and opportunistic mistresses and concubines with handsome eyes and attractive figures.  Simply put, the civilized world is being subjected to mental bullying and thuggery on a monumental scale of which it is completely unaware."  Dave Sim, [Cerebus](http://i.imgur.com/aIIDecv.jpg)  ----------  Just interested in hearing your thoughts on this. To make a very, very, very long story short, the above is from Dave Sim's [Cerebus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebus_the_Aardvark). Widely recognized as one of if not the most important achievement in the history of the comic book medium, Sim was vilified by the industry when he came out as an anti-feminist in 1994 with issue 186 of Cerebus.  The quote above is being told to the main character by the betrayed leader of a matriarchal movement. She was responsible for building a matriarchy but was betrayed by another woman, the story's main antagonist. This is essentially her tl;dr of how women were able to take over a (fictional) society, but I think the overall theory of women using their "intuition" as an indirect means of influencing men and that "behind the scenes" there is an absolutely monumental amount of mental bullying and thuggery that goes on between husbands and wives--including between very powerful husbands and wives--is an important insight into how the world works.

You come back here to America and find a white man that believes in Jesus hell paint Jesus looking like a white man.

It's superb.    This is what Hunt actually said:  Its strange that such a chauvinist monster like me has been asked to speak to women scientists. Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry. Perhaps we should make separate labs for boys and girls?   Now seriously, Im impressed by the economic development of Korea. And women scientists played, without doubt an important role in it. Science needs women and you should do science despite all the obstacles, and despite monsters like me.  That this was turned into a sexist controversy and forced a Nobel Prize winning biochemist to resign is beyond disgusting. Things are way worse than you think.

"How do you feel?" had virtually replaced "who, what, where, when and why" as the journalistic cornerstone. "What are you feeling right now?" Every once in a great while, the Female void would run afoul of some military figure or a police captain or a fire marshal: some male who had not been devoured whole, who still had something of himself left to call his own. His answer would begin, "I think . . ." or "I believe . . ." and he would proceed to enunciate a belief, a principle, an ideal which was, to him, fundamental. The Female or Male Feminist (they differ only cosmetically from each other) interviewing him would be dogged in his or her pursuit: "But how do you feel as an individual, as a person, as a human being?" The interview subject would invariably look confused, discomfited at this. After all, he had just answered the question. He would paraphrase his belief, his principle, his ideal. "I think . . ." "I believe . . ." At this point the he/she interviewer switched, invariably, to another satellite feed: to another journalist or a psychologist or a social worker. Reasoning, Thinking Males with Systems of Belief, made for very bad television."  -- Dave Sim      Yes, sir!    No, come to my shop, buy one Ouzo get 20 free!

Schmeiser was an elderly canola farmer in Saskatchewan who for 50 years had carefully saved seeds from his own fields, replanting those that carried the specific traits he sought. He had never bought seeds from Monsanto; never even spoken to a representative of Monsanto. Somehow, his crops became contaminated by Monsanto's GM crops, either through drift from nearby fields or from the trucks loaded with GM canola seedoften without protective covers to prevent seed from blowing offspeeding along a road bordering his property. The result was that Schmeiser lost the strains of canola he had created over five decades of seed saving. Monsanto promptly sued Schmeiser, saying he owed the company over $200,000 because its patented genetic material was growing on his land. Schmeiser spent his retirement savings defending himself, but the Canadian Supreme Court ruled in Monsanto's favor, even though it did not grant the company monetary damages."*   Lee Scratch Perry gives an absolutely hilarious set of answers to some questions on a recent Guardian webchat. For those not familiar with Perry, he's widely considered one of the most influential producers in western music as well as a brilliant artist in his own right and, of course, a madman. There's a new documentary about him out soon called Vision of Paradise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqBPhJdzPnU        "No one should ever work.

If you (obviously I'm not talking about you personally, I don't know you) are not publishing the cartoons because you don't want to offend someone, the same way you wouldn't publish something anti-Semitic and racist, that's one thing. Your free choice. But that is not what's happening here. People are advocating not publishing the cartoons because of what others might do. You are afraid of what they might do. This is rank cowardice of the lowest order. Freedom of expression MUST include the freedom to offend. As usual, Hitchens explains it best:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZZ96SArpuc      In America, they buy it then break it.

Hey, at least one sane person in this thread. There is a veritable mountain of evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy and anybody who has done even a modicum of research knows this. On the other hand, in 50 years there has not been one single, solitary shred of hard evidence that there was a conspiracy. But, hey, lets not let the truth get in the way of a good story.

That's so naive it's almost adorable. If you think black people in the U.S. aren't faced with a racist society today, you're absurdly uneducated. Look at virtually any statistics on arrest and conviction rates on white vs. black individuals for similar crimes. Look at the incarceration rate. Black people are still largely treated like second-class citizens. Do you honestly think people get Freddie Gray-style rough rides as often in white neighborhoods? Blatant racism is a big part of America and will be for a long time.   Well, it looked cool...as close to a live-action Akira trailer as we'll get this year.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1GO-93Nt3c   Yeah! Why aren't the poorest descendants of people who are the product of 400 years of slavery, beatings, torture, lynchings, Jim Crow, discrimination, segregation and the War on Drugs better integrated into white America? Lazy! It's all so obvious now...   Pretty sure reddit is number four on that list.       All of this goes away on May 16th. Anybody who watches the Golovkin/Willie Monroe, Jr. fight will forget about the anticlimax that was MayPac and remember why they watch the sport in the first place.         "The police are able to use the press to make the white public think that ninety per cent or ninety-nine per cent of the Negroes in the Negro community are criminals, and once the white public is convinced that most of the Negro community is a criminal element, then this automatically paves the way for the police to move into the Negro community exercising Gestapo tactics, stopping any black man who is on the sidewalk, whether he is guilty or whether he is innocent, whether he is well-dressed or whether he is poorly dressed, whether he is educated or whether he is dumb, whether hes a Christian or whether hes a Muslim, as long as he is black and a member of the Negro community the white public thinks that the white policeman is justified in going in there and trampling on that mans civil rights and on that mans human rights."   Freddie, not Freddy.    The story of gangs "teaming up" to target cops got out there pretty damn quickly but was based on absolutely nothing. It was good to hear the other side, and they sound reasonable to me. Whatever else these men have done, questioning their motives at this point when they have the ability to quell some of the violence seems counterproductive to say the least.      Who the fuck believes this....especially when your source is the Washington Times? What nonsense.    "And when you see the blacks react, since the people who do this arent there, they react against their property. The property is the only thing thats there and they destroy it. And you get the impression over here that because they are destroying the property where they live, that they are destroying their own property. No. They cant get to the man, so they get at what he owns. This doesnt say its intelligent. But whoever heard of a sociological explosion that was done intelligently and politely? And this is what youre trying to make the black man do. Youre trying to drive him into a ghetto and make him the victim of every kind of unjust condition imaginable. Then when he explodes, you want him to explode politely. You want him to explode according to somebodys ground rules.

As soon as he realized Downey clearly and obviously didn't want to talk about his past, he pushed the point hoping Downey would walk out, like Tarantino did, so he'd get the views. It worked.   Great story. I love the New Yorker. I live outside Toronto yet still read it pretty religiously. I think it's easily the best general interest magazine in America. Plus their movie guy loves Godard, which is cool. I think I read one New Republic story in the last ten years so can't honestly say I cared when it collapsed, yet every issue of the New Yorker has at least two or three stories I read from beginning to end.    A shit movie?    A Superman movie directed by Tim Burton and starring Nicolas Cage...that really does sound like the worst movie never made.   Surprise of the Decade!    Grand Moff Tarkin. He killed everyone on Alderaan.    I liked it. It's a short piece about a radical disruption in our culture. I thought it was interesting.  "Thats the real dystopia: not that our daily lives could be reduced to a state of constant shopping but that we might ever have to, even for a moment, stop shopping."   I feel the pressure too.

There is a very big difference between Malcolm X while he was in the NOI, when he basically just repeated what he was taught by Elijah Muhammad, and after he left (was forced out of) the NOI in early 1964. After he left he embraced a much more inclusive philosophy, rejected racism, rejected the NOI, embraced traditional Islam and fought for the human rights of all people regardless of color. However, he never rejected the philosophy of self-defense or his militancy. I VERY highly recommend this 1972 documentary, consisting almost entirely of footage of Malcolm X, which shows the evolution of his thought.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDyW60VktDM    [The opposing view.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIdfVxCttZQ)   It really is the greatest show in the history of TV.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wmgghlEagA     Greatest show in the history of television.

Race-baiting at its finest. No doubt the creator of this video has a fine future at FOX.    Haven't seen Shallow Grave in a long time, but I really enjoyed that one.   Really enjoyed del Toro in this....and Spacey and Gabriel Byrne and pretty much everyone else, the cast is really, really good. And I really enjoy the reveal, but the convoluted way Soze supposedly went about getting the guys together to pull of the caper still seems forced.    Well aware that I'm the minority in this, but this movie is highly overrated. The cast is great and it's well acted, but this is really a reveal in search of a movie. There's a reason Ebert gave it two stars.  http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-usual-suspects-1995   I always wondered that myself.

"Just three weeks after joining the Marines, hes trained in the use of an M-l rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.  Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range  still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away."  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/biographies/oswald/interview-gerald-posner/   I wish they would go over the body armor stats again and make them actually make sense.

 I'm looking for something that resembles this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYFQRd1sY5E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id1kZRmpVw4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyszvspirDE Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    gotta downvote this thread before it goes all viral   Love the chick at the end.    [Wear sunscreen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI)   I've anxiety and obviously that isn't a reason to get medical marijuana in my country. I've been wondering how hard is it to get marijuana legally (in my country the process is very very long), and how hard is it to get it illegally. Where I live the price of one gram is around 27$, but I heard its waaaaaay cheaper   accessible in the US so I wanted to confirm.   A medical question.   Mazzy Star should be somewhere in here.   You've probably gone too far.   I've iPhone 5, 16GB. I'm 17 and contasntly use my iPhone and to be honest, I don't have any significant space issues. Whenever I'm running low on storage I just deleted one of many apps I don't really use, delete a bunch of countless photos and there you have a few extra gigs. Also, if you've Jailbreak, iCleaner always clears up a few hundred MBs.    Do you think the 10th leading cause of death in the US isn't worthy of it?   I wasn't talking about the benefits of exercising, which are obviously improving one's condition (at least short-term), but rather on one's struggle to find the energy to make any kind of improvement in his life.    I wasn't talking about the act of exercising, but rather on the lack of energy to make a change, which is caused by depression.   I agree. I think telling someone suffering from depression to hit the gym, and at least start doing something with his damn life is as telling a man in a wheelchair to start running, or at least to take a walk.   I'm glad you're okay.    ?   Deleted?   "So... can I get a discount?"   Damn that's awesome!   I'm sure it's possible.       I fucking love unusual names. Why Camila?   I have a terrible phobia of bees. I'm not scared of anything else, definitely not cats/dogs, but you release a honey bee near me and I'm gonna run the fuck away.I guess that there's something associated with childhood, because when I was young I got stung, and my friend who's scared of dogs said he got bitten by one when he was a little kid, too. Following such an experience, the brain naturally assumes that "this type of dog = dangerous", and it can grow to "any dog with the same color = dangerous", and in some cases, "dogs = dangerous".   Because if someone would survive that (and most probably he would), everything else is gonna be an anti-climax.    Exactly that. Haven't heard of locationholic though, to be honest. I'm gonna check it out.  Edit: doesn't work. I'm looking for an app that won't only change my location, but whenever I open the weather app, it won't even check it. It would update the weather just like it does with 'affixed' cities (the ones you set, as New York). Therefore it would update the weather of an affixed city and display it in the Notification Center, without checking my location and reducing much battery in the process.   Rather than constantly checking your location.   I've discovered this sub an hour ago. I wrote something for you guys.   "I knew a kid once who always cried. He wasnt always sad, and I dont think a man his age had much to be sad about. He was authentic, solicitous yet an utter romantic, a man of his heart and a slave of his mind. He always cried, but he wasnt always sad. I dont think a boy as beautiful had much to sob for, though well, he did have ugly teeth. Maybe it was the teeth that forbidden him from smiling whenever he saw the beauty of sunrise, and the romanticism of dusk. Youd recognize his happiness by the enlargement of his eyes and a tiny, only fractious curve emerging on his lips. He was the kind of boys that cried when King Kong fall by a damn P-12. He was a beautiful, little kid, with burdensome dreams of being a man. And maybe thats why he always cried."  I've always felt happy while being sad. I had these moments where I'd lay down at night and listen to music and feel euphoric. I called it 'Happy Depression'. I've been browsing this subreddit and just having this wonderful moment because all of this posts, that's me. That's the person I try to hide because he's too emotional, not a man but a prostitute of these damn feelings.   There's so much I could say but I don't wanna sound selfish. I just wanna say that I love you guys, I love this community. I'm so happy, but I think I'm also a bit sad.    I've just discovered this sub, but I fucking love it.    Thanks.      I definitely support you. Who are the kids with?   Yes, I did. I've fallen into [deep depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/38wwi5/been_obsessed_with_an_ex_for_over_five_years/) that wrecked me mentally and made me utterly miserable.  Everything you said, from feeling so damn ugly and worthless, to suicidal thoughts, beautiful, little fantasies... that's me. Was me.   Whenever I read an advice online that stars with this boring, personal experience, and sums up with "well, everything's gonna be fine", I don't consider it as an advice but just a worthless jumble of words. No one knows it's gonna be fine. When I broke up with my ex I certainly didn't.   The only universal truth about breakups is that they toughen you. You discover some books, albums are like a remedy that makes you temporarily forget. How supportive people are, and what unexpected skills you develop as an attempt to pass time (I personally wrote, and that's my #1 advice, and I'd be most enraptured to read your fucking shit). For me, the sadness never faded away, but it gradually turned into a pleasant feeling. Many people have this at some point and you will, too. Suddenly your favorite song will have a chord that makes you remember your ex without feeling sad, but just pleasant. Soft. Acceptable. It's slightly different for everyone, but for me these were moments of inspiration.   But I don't know you. Hell, you could be a real fucking pig, and maybe the sadness will never really fade off. Maybe it's gonna take some five years and shit-load of tears to get over this motherfucker, and that's what gonna be if you let yourself drown in this easily-drownable depression. You can't. Do stuff. Read. Write. Play an instrument. Go for ~~a run~~ a walk. Watch people talk about breakups, whatever. I don't fucking care - just do something.   And everything's gonna be fine.  ~~Worst fucking piece of cliche I ever wrote on Reddit. On and sorry for my terrible English.~~   That's fucking awesome. Fifteen pounds is a great damn record.    No. I don't have a monkey. AND I ALWAYS WANTED A FUCKING MONKEY.   I like this. Even people who posses racist and holocaust-denying opinions (considered as the worst class of opinions to have), contribute to society because I think just ignoring these opinions and pretending you're normal and everyone else is normal is far worse. Obviously as long as expressing these opinions is done in a civilized way.    the real me got 15 upvoted  i knew life gets better   sometimes i cry   and its ok  its ok   i read 'gun' at first and thought, "damn this sub has taken it too far"   OMG FUCKING GENIUS   Going through this shit RIGHT NOW.   	39

The night sky is illuminated and air deafened with speckles of anti-aircraft fire, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress known as the Pacific Pearl and its fellow squadron soar in formation. The right propeller putters to a smoke billowing halt as its struck by enemy artillery. Veteran Pilot, Skip, and Co-Pilot, Holden courageously man their airship through a less than routine bombing run over hostile territory. Two crewmen, within the waste of the aircraft, haphazardly empty their staggered M2 Browning machine guns, blindly hoping to make contact with the deadly streaks of light originating from the ground below. Situated in the belly of the ship, a gunman unleashes lead, oscillating inside the dual mounted, spherical Sperry turret. The plane's tail is battered with stray munitions, yet maintains its course. At the nose of the plane, one nameless patriot mounts his Bendix chin turret, attempting to visualize ground forces. A sudden and forceful explosion of AA canon fire bursts directly in front the Pearl, obliterating the glass and metal comprising the nose and instantaneously ending the life of the bombardier within. Another blast detonates a hole directly at the Boeing's cabin, sending a shock wave of shrapnel into the nearby gunmen. Their bodies contort and rear on the cold metal floor, as their own blood fills their waning breaths. The B-17 wavers to maintain altitude as continued bombardment causes the ship to pollute the air with streaks of smoke and flame.  Come on, Skip! Fly this bucket and get us the hell outta' he-, screams the radio operator prior to him and his quarters being peppered with machine gun fire. His body quivers, as he instinctively grasps the blood oozing from the last bullet entry wound at his right arm. The pain departs, and he becomes unconscious - his body falling limp within his chair.  The bomb bay doors slowly part open, releasing multiple pairs of half ton whistling M44s upon their decent to destruction. The Pacific Pearl, now a war torn tin can of its former glory, limps gingerly away from the theater of battle towards a hopeful full moon. The former fortress and its scant crew rumble forward as pilot and co-pilot can now safely assess the damage.  I think we're hit pretty bad, Skip, says an uncertain Holden.  You better go back and see how bad it is, states Skip.  Okay, Holden responds with a sigh as he stands to remove his headset. Can you keep er' in the air, Skip? Holden inquires, placing a mutually reassuring hand on the pilot's shoulder, making his way to the cabin.  Yeah, yeah, sure... Skip quickly responds.  Upon entering the cabin, Holden is immediately greeted by a crewman face down nearest the cabin entryway floor. Kneeling down to investigate, Holden slowly flips the soldier face up, revealing multiple bloody bullet holes through his chest and one through the eye, directly piercing the man's left glasses frame. Holden jumps to his feet startled, backing away in shock, uncertain what to do but proceed forward. He reluctantly continues through the corridor of the airship, with only the vibrations of the passing air to break the silence. Holden gently creaks open the subsequent chamber's doorway, unveiling two bloodied gunmen lying lifeless across from a sizable hissing breech within the plane's haul. Holden leans against the metallic column connected to the roof of the rig, holding in place one of the bellied turrets. Unable to retract the turret's entrance latch, Holden gives two firm knocks upon the hollow metal alloy.  Nelson? the co-pilot beckons to the gunner, giving three more knocks. No response. Unbeknownst to Holden, the turret operator lays deceased within his glass coffin - a single projectile penetrating the rounded window, into his chest cavity. Holden examines the bodies of the two adjacent gunmen, unwilling to make physical contact as one of the men's eyes remain open, hauntingly gazing into nothingness. He lightly sneaks past the corpses, as if not to disturb their eternal slumber  a passive observer in a surreal reality.  Holden lowers his head making his way towards the tail of the plane. He can see a crewman sitting in a chair, facing away from him, peering out a broken rear window. He nears what he believes to be the first living causality of the day's combat. He rotates the swiveling chair, hoping to arouse an unconscious man. Turning to face him, with mouth hanging ajar and eyes transfixed, the departed crew member's intestines grotesquely protrude from his abdomen. The body falls directly at Holden's knees, splatting as the internal organs spill onto the ground.  Before Holden can react, through the shattered rear glass, a short distance from the plane's tail, he spots what can only be described as a floating orb, glowing a deep mesmerizing green.  Jesus... He shutters to himself in astonishment. Holden reaches for a nearby transmitter, building his courage to speak as he brings it to his mouth. Skip... Something's following us...  What is it? Responds Skip.  It's some, some kind of green meteorite...  What!? Skip gasps. Where? He asks, turning his head in all directions to spot this anomaly. The orb swiftly descends under the aircraft, latching itself to the belly, causing the plane to abruptly jerk in the air. The sharp movement causes multiple compressed air tanks to fall from their shelves, crashing onto Holden, momentarily knocking him unconscious on the ground. The orb begins to pulsate a bright luminescent green energy that begins to engulf sections of the Pacific Pearl. The bodies of the now dead crewmen begin to collectively glow a similar rhythmic translucence.  Holden! Are you okay? Skip beckons over the radio system. Holden's eyes slowly open to consciousness.  Uh...Yeah, Holden groans, shaking his head. I'm coming back, Skip, as he raises his body out from under the air tanks. Skip looks frantically about the cockpit, unable to spot anything unusual outside the aircraft. Holden groggily makes his way towards the front of the vessel. The motionless corpse within the tail of the plane begins to irradiate acid from its body, as if from within, revealing a bony decomposing monstrosity. The claw-like fingers of this previously deceased human begin to quake with life.  Holden, with his head still throbbing from its previous blow, re-enters the waist of the ship, the same haul breech still humming a familiar tune of death. Yet, one obvious detail plagues his already clouded mind. Where were the two dead gunmen? Holden, completely unable to comprehend the difference between truth and reality begins to tremble in a lucid fear. He staggers to turns his body, tiptoeing backwards towards the front of the plane. In his shivering retreat, he is halted with a clank as the back of his boot makes contact with the last known location of Nelson. With one last attempt, either out of spirited curiosity or cowardice fright, Holden crouches to unlatch the turret enclosure. Cautiously he lifts the hatch and peers in. A gut wrenching roar and two ungodly arms grasp him by the coat, heaving Holden into the glass prison. His screams of pain mix with monstrous growls as he's thrashed about. Blood can be seen trickling in droplets from outside the transparent sphere.  What the hell's happening back there!? demands Skip. No response. Shoot, he mutters to himself as he flicks on the Automatic Pilot switch, removing his headset and standing to investigate. As he casually turns the door handle to exit the cockpit, Skip is met face-to-face with a moaning monstrosity that was once one of his crewman. Portions of its skin and tissues have seemingly melted from its body, with only remnants of their uniform and hair covering what appears as a walking, decomposing skeleton. With a reflexive outcry, Skip slams the flight deck door in the beast's face. Left flabbergast, Skip slowly withdrawals to his pilot seat, frantically reaching for his Colt M1911. Trembling, he aims his pistol at the door - of which begins to bend and mold under the force of the atrocity's power. He squeezes his trigger twice, recoiling with each ricocheting discharge. The metallic entrance collapses under the power of the creature, revealing two more fiends lumbering towards the pilot quarters.  With what is seemingly his only remaining option, Skip desperately dons a parachute, opening the emergency exit latch located at his feet. He sits at the edge of a darkened abyss as he takes one last look at what appears to be the walking remains of his deceased crew, snarling and gnashing in a maddening blood lust. With a leap of faith, Skip hurls himself into the cold darkness. Wind rushes past his ears as he plummets towards the earth. He yanks his ripcord. Shortly thereafter, he is jarred by the flutter of his parachute bringing his body to a looming descent. Silhouetted against the first break of dawn, Skip spots the Pacific Pearl  now nothing more than a cascading asteroid.  After what appears to be only a momentary respite, the pilot finds himself making a gentle landing on an unknown tropical beach front. Releasing himself from his pack, Skip stares up at the darkened sky, caressing his own face in awe, as if to affirm to himself that he's still alive. The island is lush with the sounds of populating insects, frogs and birds. He cautiously makes his way towards and through the dense jungle that lay before him. Brushing aside vines, Skip curiously gazes through an opening in the vegetation. The pilot is taken aback in astonishment at what comes into view. From tree line to tree line, as if planted by design, dozens, if not hundreds, of timeworn air crafts lay crashed and abandoned  engulfed by the overgrown flora. Skip begins to drift through the airship graveyard, taking note of military vessels from all makes, models, nations and creeds. Without warning, the squawking of a fearful feathered creature brings him to a heightened alert. Beginning with a low gurgle, Skip hears a familiarly repugnant sound emanating from what appears to be every and all directions. In a frenzy of terror, he becomes aware of bubbling growls accompanied by the crumpling of rustic metal quickly surrounding him. Paralyzed in fear, Skip witnesses hideous mutations of what were once downed pilots, emerge as deforming horrors  rotting skin and musculature held in disarray about the bodies of these once presumably men. Countless numbers of glowing green eyes surround Skip as the bellows of inhumane morbidity grow in cacophony. Years of suppressed fear explode from the bottom of his diaphragm in a voice shattering wail. Yet, the pilot's cries echo into silence, amidst the Coral Sea air.      Just imagine a pig doing that to a human.    I love YOU.    Thanks :)   It seems as though, based on his various interviews, as if Noam Chomsky does not openly admit, to a public audience, that he believes 9/11 to be committed by the U.S. government. Who does he believe committed the events on 9/11/2001, if anyone would happen to know?   It's wrong    I had recently committed sin to the point where I disgusted myself and the sight of sexuality outside of marriage made me heart broken and I decided to stop PMO. I thought I had it kicked, not doing it for 2 weeks without a sign of weakness. I was so proud. And that was my mistake. I went from one sin of lust, to the sin of pride in my own abilities. But then, I found myself burning with the desire to PMO. I convinced myself that it would be okay to attempt masturbating without any sort of external stimulation or internal fantasy and to just look at it as a bodily necessity. Which ends up just being a statement that I can control my own body the way I want. Which then led to PMO. And now, here I am again. Low. Broken. Fearful of death. Duped by myself and most likely Satan.  I realize the best way to break this is to have the discipline I briefly found, grounded in deep hate for sin and its effects, but also to primarily and forever abide constantly in the peace that is found in what JESUS DID on the cross. Not my own strength. Forgive me.        that last slap one is great                        yeah np   My grandpa owns a tiger                     Who is this Facetious character and what's his connection to ISIS?

But its so confusing, because the old testament does actually discuss the presence of Giants, with actual dimensions and issues they caused the average man. I don't think the word "Giant" was simply discussed in such detail strictly for metaphor.   I mean, legitimately, there is mention of Giant individuals within the biblical text. I think when I have more time I'll gather up everywhere it mentions Giants in the bible and we'll examine the context and translations together. But I do see your perspective :)         * bn hlhm () the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)  Genesis 6:2-4 (ESV)  2 the **sons of God** (Angels) saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. 3 Then the Lord said, My Spirit shall not abide in[a] man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years. 4 The Nephilim[b] were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.D  * bn hlhm ( ) the sons of Elohim (**sons of God**)  Job 1:6  (ESV) Satan Allowed to Test Job 6 Now there was a day when the **sons of God** (Angels) came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[a] also came among them.  There are multiple references throughout the Torah (Old Testament), discussing the presence of entire tribes of giants present before and after the flood. The later references being in Deuteronomy, where in Deut 3:11 -- "Og King of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah" -- and you of course know the story of David and Goliath (considered to be a descendant of the Anakim, descendants of Nephilim). Goliath being 9.5 feet tall.   It is with my understanding from the various accounts within the Bible, that the Fallen Angels exited the Heavens, manifesting within the physical realm, to sin against man, and conceive hybrids with the humans. This caused chaos within the Earth, but also could very well corrupt the bloodline of Christ, who needed to be directly descended from Adam. Noah was not a "Perfect man" without sin, but perfect in his adamite genetics. Thus, God preserved Noah's family before the Deluge or flood.   The Sons of God that Paul references in Romans 8:14 , as you know, are the spiritual sons, adopted into the vine of the church body, through the acceptance of the sacrifice of Yeshua, Jesus Christ.     Genesis 6:4 - "In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times."  Giants were a thing in the old Testament. Fallen Angels manifesting themselves within the mortal realm to Sin against man and procreate with humans, creating the hybrid giants. Demons are separate from Fallen Angels.   What lens of Paul are you talking about? Where does he mention the inaccuracy of legitimate giants within the ancient texts of the old testament/Torah? And where does he mention them as military leaders instead?  There are multiple accounts of Giants within the old testament. A breed of creation used to tarnish the human bloodline of the savior, Jesus. Thus, requiring the Deluge (flood).   Your interpretations of the old testament giants is rather contrived, in all legitimacy.          [Fortunately someone else uploaded a video of these terrible parents getting what they deserve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)                  lost footage from Reno 911 movie   well, that's the whole movie right there. 6/10   It sucks being human. It's amazing to me that the biggest differences between every person is "what they believe". It's like we're all walking through a vague fogginess. I wish we all instinctively understood the same truth and reality. So much ambiguity. What are your thoughts?   Well, if a "Christian" says they believe in Jesus, but doesn't believe the remainder of the text would be highly hypocritical.    It would be wildly confusing if a Chrisitan did not, due in fact to their Bible stating on multiple accounts of their existence and influence over mankind.   You go to church, believe a man from 2,000 years ago died for your spiritual separation from God but you selectively don't believe what he specifically spoke about demons? I'm confused    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8apzJyMf4w Thanks!   The context, my friend. The narrative context of creating the world in 7 days is presented in what we may often consider a poetic and metaphorical style of writing that was so common of creation accounts in most religious texts -- and thus, understandably ambiguous. Jesus' encounters with "demons", at least within the context of the scripture, is very hyper specific. That is to say, you can't really derive much meaning from these portions of the gospels other than Jesus was rebuking dark spiritual entities. There's not much room for interpretation, in this context, other than what is explicitly stated.     lol   She watched too many creepypastas    Shouldn't Mormons be happy someone follows Christ? What else could a Mormon want someone to believe?   Elaborate. Do you think that a game will lead a man with his experiences back to the dark side?   Apples to Oranges, my friend. The context of time may be ambiguous within the scripture, but the presence of dark spiritual forces, the likes of which have no authority below the name of Jesus, are very real.    How do you differentiate between demonic oppression and sleep paralysis?   Do you think Cern LHC will open a portal for demonic entities?

          roids      during fights would be better!    they're yes men    yeah, some bad press would probably be the end game here  but it doesn't seem like the ufc cares at all  plus, they prescreen all their journalists to be yes men or they don't get credentials    source? are you serious? you don't think they were directly involved in how much fighters are being paid? they are the ones paying them  come on now   They know and don't care. They have shown how little they care about the fighters over and over again.    Reebok is complicit. They in fact did decide how much money the fighters would get. They came up with the ugly designs. They are the ones profiting from the fighters and not compensating them. They are the ones who have shown no effort in their product or the concerns of the fighters. They are just as guilty as the UFC.   They have a contract. What good what a petition do even if it gets a million signature? Not buying Reebok is the most effective way to send them a message imo.   he definitely needs it  but who is in his life that can convince him to get help?    there's a good person behind that mental illness    Why doesn't anyone get him help? He clearly has a mental illness and needs help. I am terrified he will kill someone and then himself.    lol   they are one in the same on this deal   Miami Vice was good.    The UFC was smart for eliminating all serious competition before making these greedy moves.   When there is no real competition the monopoly can get away with a lot.    if he was a lesser fighter yes   maybe another way of saying chewed out?    [Chris Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj0mtxXEGE8) already educated us on this situation.    get the word out! kentucky too!    us liberals make up a large part of their audience lol   I vote early by mail.

Florian's high pitched voice is annoying. Stann doesn't understand fighting and regurgitates random facts and his broscience (like lactic acid build up in the muscles which is pure fiction).   If the UFC spends money on focus groups to determine who is the best, I have no doubt Frank Mir will beat out everyone on the B team.    If I'm at a ball game I can't get it. If I'm at the movies I can't get it. I don't really drink much soda at home. I feel that the American market is being had and we don't even acknowledge it.

There are definitely are extreme people but they are the small minority. The largest most self defeating voting block as to be the white christian middle class family that is staunch republican. They identify with the party that governs to make their lives difficult. We have always had a pretty rotten education system, but it's gotten worse with the new governor slashing primary/secondary/higher education.    arizona is the opposite of this   the big city is a bastion of conservatism and the outlying rural areas are liberal as is the smaller big city down south   Arizona is very diverse in terms of politics. A large majority of people are not racist. The state is independent heavy. In Maricipa County (location of metropolitan phoenix), the most populated county, the Republicans do win out. Down south in Tucson they're far more democrat. I know Arizona seems like a solid red state but that might not always be the case. With changing demographics we will certainly eventually go purple and very well could turn blue in a decade or two.    Sanders isn't attacking her so she'll have to play a little more nice at least for the time being. Plus, Hildog definitely wants Sanders's progressive voters turning out to vote for her.   and? he's sharper than most 54 year olds in congress both in his intellect and judgement   haters are going to have to do better than ageism    what?

New information will change your policies. However, it seems that President Obama didn't even try with many things, like the public option. He simply got big pharma and the other interests to cut the best deal.    Obama got elected, except he sold out 95% and didn't keep his campaign promises.    He's literally taking kids out of school and putting them in prisons. Those prisons have guarantees to stay full.                            I saw plenty of latinos and black people, but yeah it was mostly white   yup, little blonde boy I think   arenas and stadiums hopefully if he hits really big cities like LA or SF   that bothered me lol   no they don't   I'm talking about 12 pack of cans and made in the USA.   pepsi used real sugar for a limited time but took it back   Vote   because it's a buzz word   sanders does not propose having socialism   he proposes have more socialist policies, but not a socialist economic system    I get the economics behind it, but I still wish we had a choice. I buy the overpriced bottled coke from Mexico sometimes. In Arizona they sell it at Costco even.    I demand Coke sell cane sugar Coke in the US market. No more of this corn syrup garbage!    It tastes a lot better than corn syrup. Why does the US market get the inferior product when there is the good stuff around the world including down south in Mexico?   Step your game up Coca Cola!    he's not a "socialist"       people confuse the NBA with the Olympics   the NBA is about making money, not being fair or pure to the game   what if i told you the NBA wants players to get away with traveling    We won't know if he is what he used to be until he plays regardless of how great he looks.   I really want to see Jimmy Garoppolo start some games.          that's just normal wear and tear dude   She could probably get more money by getting a lawyer and suing the school.     I think anyone running for that job ... should say loud and clear that they agree: We dont run this country for Wall Street and mega-corporations, she said. We run it for people.  We're waiting Hillary Clinton.       you the scum that back the gop? sanders is the least extreme candidate running for president    Sanders knows he'll need a lot of help to get things done. What bigger things?          No, he could not. He would not even win the primary. That's why he he's going to raise a billion dollars.   everyone except bernie sanders   doesn't take bribes   the media will get bored   they'll build him up so they can turn on him and knock him down when he inevitably says more stupid things      trump will fall in the debates   It's all true.

   Today I stare at these walls. They're white and awfully clean; I think the intention behind white walls is a feeling of purity and innocence. Sometimes I think they're meant to be a canvas in which we can paint our lives once we move beyond the walls. Isn't it nice? I see Katie playing around our old oak tree in the backyard near our garden. How I wish we had an oak tree and a Katie. Oh wait, that must be her, we must let her in.   Did you know that white walls can also represent white sheets, but they replace them with walls. Everyone assumes the body inside is dead. But we're stars, can't you see? Our light just hasn't reached you yet. Don't cover me in white. Please dear, let me breathe. Katie, we can play grown-ups together? Wouldn't you enjoy that?  I have an awful headache. Katie, will you bring me some wine? I think I'm getting much too excited.   Katie is my daughter. She likes to take me to her room, so we can play grown-ups. I pretend to be the husband, and she pretends to be the wife. I tell her that these walls act as the boundary that separates us from reality. She likes to say our games are a dream.   Today Katie insisted that I take the role as a prisoner. She likes to speak three numbers on the phone, so big men can bring me away. She loves to play games.  Everyday we play prisoner now. I wish I would see her more often, but she's so devoted to the game. I wish she would bring me some wine.   We used to play doctor. Katie would bring me wine and then she would lie on the bed and we'd play. I was always the doctor, and she was the patient. It was our dream. Sometime the game was awfully serious though, and I'd have to clean up her bruises. I wish we could just play like old times. She never used to scream either. I miss her laughter.   These walls are changing. They've moved much closer and the lighting is even brighter. I miss the world beyond these walls. If it wasn't so hard to breathe playing with Katie, I don't think the walls would have covered her. I miss playing.   Don't scream dear. Let me play. Let me play.  Now I think these walls are just a projection.   She thinks I have an affliction, but she refuses to play doctor.   I think I need her help.   I wish I had a Katie.   It seems as if I'm always playing with these walls: these white sheets. People like to say they cover dead things, but they just refuse to see the life, the beauty.   We must let her in. Come and play.   I no longer leave these walls; I just wait for you to come in.   I will adjust to my affliction; I promise you dear, and so will you; it's just a matter of time.   Then we'll play.     Hey Reddit. I know teens and kids are living with parent(s) who are drug addicts.

We are certainly moving away from it, but for those who don't look to science and find their own moral compass (if morals even exist--another debatable topic) in religion than what's the harm in that?  *it doesn't make you a good person for shitting on someone's beliefs      Are there any things I should know going forward into this Nazi propaganda film? I'm watching it tonight.    Maybe a paradigm shift will settle our greed and wickedness, and I suppose I'm just a critic of human nature but perhaps my question is more applicable to (or makes more sense when discussing) anarchism-- if you're up for the discussion. Suppose there is no paradigm shift for man and we become entirely stateless, no hierarchy, no laws, nada, etcetera, and we desire happiness. What do you think would happen next? We can't overthrow a dictator and catalyze a revolution. What happens next if the government isn't the source of our unhappiness. Perhaps this makes more sense.  	12
    What AT T is doing, reminds me of Ashley Madison website for cheater where they charge $19 to delete profile :P         You are right, have not seen it before...thanks!      Only their CEO knows how many fake profiles they have...   Look on the bright side...you may get some cool dating requests...obviously joking :)  	8

    When are we going to see the aliens?   So I was trainig one day and I was doing incline bicep curls and was just finishing my third set with a pair of 14kg dumbbells. So this guy next to me is doing preacher dumbbell curls with a 16kg dumbbell. And since I can't find the other 16kg dumbbells (not a huge gym) I am waiting for him to finish. And once he is done I ask him: "Hey, are you gonna use that dumbbell again soon?" So he answers: "No, that was my last set." At this point I just grab the 16kg dumbbells and all of a sudden he asks me: "Hey, just a quick Q - are you using "the chemistry"?" And I was like: "Yeah, sure. Protein powder, creatine, you know." (Because hey, creatine is made in a lab, so in my understanding it's chemistry.) And he was like: "No, no, no I mean "THE chemistry", as in steroids." And I'm like: *laugh* "No man, I'm clean" And just as I say that, I hear him say back in a turned on gay way: "Hmm, well you've done a lot of work and made 'em big" And trust me, I was amazed by the compliment and that gave me sooo much motivation. Even though a gay dude said it. I knew he was gay btw, but that sentence just made me giggle on the inside. And it's not that I don't like gays, they're fine - a compliment is a compliment from whoever you receive it.   He's gonna be a great plumber, when he is older.   Arnold Schwarzenegger   I see Ultron vs. Hulk   Since I am graduating from High School I won't be mentioning the books, pens and pencils, but I will tell you that I use a climber's backpack (a big one). So here goes: 1. A towel 2. Gym shoes 3. Gym clothes 4.  A pair of boxers and socks for after the shower 5. Shampoo 6. Dry roll-on (Rexona stuff, anti sweating) 7. Padded straps for deadlifts 8. Gloves (Yes, they match my backpack, haters) 9. Pair of earbuds for the gym (not gonna fuck up my Hammerheads) 10. Stretch marks creme 11. The case for the Hammerheads 12. A bottle of water 13. Shaker with powder in the powder compartment. 14. A miny funnel for my one dose of creatine (hate mixing it with the shake) 15. An umbrella I guess that's all I carry :D   I'd have to say left one (delts), because I am indeed like that. I am not able to get a huge chest out. However, it's not a flat one at all - just my weak point. Not to mention the "Terry Crews" gap I have.. at least a proportional one (the gap edges are like mirror images of one another). Very good posts by the way, keep 'em up.   Arnold Schwarzenegger words: Chins, Pulls (Pulldowns etc.) are for the width. Any kind of rows (bent over, t-bar, seated cable, etc.) are for the thickness. Period.  And regarding my comment here: old-school is the real deal. Nowadays I see a lot of guys doing only mashines, because they think they put them in the right position. The problem of today is that there is a lot of information, which can be true AND wrong. I remember a guy telling me not to do squats, because they hurt your back. He also told me that nowadays there are mashines for those stuff. But to tell you the truth - the leg press at my gym hurts my back like hell, even thought "the mashine puts you in the right position".  So there is no magic behind the width and the thickness. Old-school is the best school! I train old school style and I can proudly say that I have made more progress than people who train the modern way (all out on the mashines).   At one point I was using MP Arnold Series Iron Pump, but realized I didn't really like such a huge pump. I know that it's *Arnold voice* the most satisfying feeling you can get in the gym, but I got a pump feeling without the supplement, and going above that wasn't for me. (Not to mention that my skin isn't "elastic" enough [not sure if elastic is the proper word], and I got lots of stretch marks on my biceps, triceps and shoulders) So I said to myself: "Well, I love the energy. I want energy!" So when I finished the whole thing I switched to Hyphy M.U.D - yes, I indeed tried the Coke with Coffee thingy, and man i was sure happy I had the energy. I can even recall that I had a conversation with a buddy at the gym while lifting heavy ass weights for my biceps, while at an incline,  while being on Kali Muscle's stuff. And I hadn't even tried lifting those kilos before. So that's that. Now I just take 3 packets of instant coffee and I'm good to go.   http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/647/716/c7e.png  	11
    I have that same keyboard, and I hate it...   Oh fuck. I really hate you for this theory... Now I'm sad.   It's hard to stress that this is not a normal occurance. I live in Nevada, a pretty leniant state, I also own an AR, but I would NEVER in my life go and waltz into the nearest Wal-Mart with it, because I don't enjoy scaring people. Also, I've never seen anyone carrying more than a handgun because its just stupid.   [Question]: Is it possible to turn off transactions for steam? I've noticed just now that any game, dlc, etc, does not display a price any more and cannot be seen. I assume a friend of mine did this as a joke but they wont fess up to it, could anyone help me possibly undo this?  [Platform]: PC  Picture: http://imgur.com/pfV5TvM  Turns out this may be a bug with steam currently, as I looked through this subreddit and some people very recently are having the exact same issue. So it isn't just me.   That is insane. Glad our nukes were safely secured!      I don't know a lot about the rules, but couldn't you have what you do now, with the video embedded where the picture of the thumbnail is now?   Its 4 am, I didnt check what I opened, and i just jumped about ten fucking feet back. Fuck you OP!   I thought seeing that movie was one of the security questions to sign up?!?   That took me a second hahahaha   I've heard Del-Ton was a pretty reliable compay, and was considering buying from them. Do you think this is an isolated case, or a problem they almost always see?   Sorry for being that guy.   They're  FTFY   Aw man, this story was fantastic. Really great job on this one!   Holy crap, that soon!?!? just made my week!   Are you willing to give us any actual timeframe on the release of the next case file? If not I understand, no pressure!   Fuck you OP. You can just stop right there and never write a goddamn word about these ants again. I was just peacefully sitting on my couch reading, but no, now I'm searching my house for any evidence of ants.  For the record this is even creepier to me as only a few months ago i woke up in the middle of the night to a large group of ants crawling on me, my clothes, and my bed.   I always put canadian roundels over my british roundels, it isnt noticeable if you do it right (most of the time)  I'm also not canadian I don't know why I do this.   Well good job on your finals. I'm dreading mine   As a NATO player finally branching out from just playing USA/NORAD, what coalition would you guys suggest? So far i'm leaning towards either Eurocorps or Scandinavia. I played Airborne as the US, but I feel like i've played enough to manage any deck type.  Also, I generally play with a friend that uses a Commonwealth Mechanized deck, so If my coalition/deck type could help seamlessly work with his that'd be great!  Note: I'm not asking anyone to make me a deck, I would just like some advice on what coalition + type to select.  	20
                   Except they did before the edit, as they always do, as I always say.  Oh yeah edge, totes. Jesus wept.   Oh yes absolutely. I can absolutely understand his POV. If you were in the same situation as someone I know regarding this you would too.  edit: i am timed response on here so i might not get back to you also leaving house now   rewatching skyfall at xmas made me realise how dumb that movie is, how limited the director is in general, style over substance with these movies, i dunno what his stage stuff was like but I would have hoped it was a bit more nuanced    recipe?   That was disappointing. Nowhere near as good as the last one  edit:  free speech, pao out!  i disagree with you - opinion gets downvoted!!  dumb fucking people     salmon looks awesome   started reading this and went to myself who the fuck is amy schumer and why is lebron there?        Rare for me to find a writer I know nothing about with such a career.  Anyone has any insight? Worth a read?       That's massively expensive.    Guess you should add feature film moreso than doc   was surprisingly expensive if I recall   Looking through his comments I am failing to see why people are so upset.   The reaction on the sub and here are truly embarrassing. But what is new.   I'll actually put the first one ahead of dredd as the ultimate indicator of how stupid the average fanboy is.  When a film makes that shitty godzilla reboot look good you know you've done something wrong.  Weak ass premise. Shitty stock characters. Contrived love story (but not really, daddy issues). Awful dialogue. The acting was so fucking bad even the good actors were uncomfortable.  What a piece of shit.  And it somehow made enough to warrant another?       To make money for a studio by taking it off dimwit fanboys who go out of their way defending a piece of garbage.    No they were shit.   No you are wrong.  Fucking terrifying how dumb this sub is.     I dont get it   short memories on here   feature lengths seem thin on the ground but plenty of tv stuff   Failure, and a serious anxiety about trying again   OH   tell me more - cheesecake? i love kiwi   I have an idea for a crossover where the babadook gets fucked at a halloween party (the only night he normally scores) and catches the sex ghost and has to spend the rest of the film trying to get laid like the rest of us            I might pick up a few during the week just to see   right o - you try them?   I wanna new show.      fascinating, what cuisine are they from?      what the... that's new one to me   so once, 22 days ago, on a different website, hardly 5 times already      Interesting read from the perspective of two agents involved in the drug war - which they claim is non existent       yes it is mentioned in the comments too... assume they will fix   Where. Link.          I want the same for Shrek    looks  raw?   it's a website where you post scripts and get feedback from readers (costs money)  if it does really well apparently some people in the business might take an interest  https://blcklst.com/   u could put it on the blacklist and see the feedback    intern, make contacts, work on sets, make more contacts, write dozens of scripts that are good, get a manager, get an agent, set up meetings, pitch perfectly, profit  or something like that  but there is no one way  there is a writer/director on the front of reddit now who mentions some stuff  or go spend time on /r/screenwriting and read posts  but thinking it is just about writing a couple of scripts you think are good and just sending them to the head honchos and getting green lit is tremendously naive   the fucking writing itself seems a fairly minor point overall      but that is not the way the business works  thousands of guys hocking scripts around    go to /r/screenwriting and post it there but be prepared for the feedback    is this a joke   withnail and I         damn kenji i think you just closed down burger threads for a while   not bad resolution - there is a good doc on here  episode of the born to kill (get the english voiceover one) - one of th ebetter shows     that's mine, i called it   well done   cool, thought it was falling apart   One of the UK's most brilliant wartime spies was poorly treated by colleagues at MI5 in the paranoid years of the Cold War and was left gripped by fear that he was suspected of being a traitor. Now an extraordinary letter and a series of family documents reveal the full story.       that looks awesome   thanks mate!   Now sort out abortion issue   democracy is a fucking joke   I think it smells amazing and I dont smoke it  I love passing by a house with a window open and people inside smoking or some guy smoking on the street     it's the only way   Really?   Thoughts anyone? Kickstarter and art? Do they work? Can crowds be trusted to make any decision that isn't just stupid?               Rather caustic piece but worth a read just to understand some of the other sides of the story.  I dunno if it is time for it to just die and we can move on but it seems more petitions are being made - baffling to be honest      Hate the director, dislike Cooper, indifferent to Lawrence...  But have to say like the trailer. At first I was not but it  grew on me.      Any and all military posts or posts involving an element of it which could be construed as propaganda in any way should be the first things removed from reddit when the new rules comes in.     Posts like this really just make me angry. Seriously.  Stop  whining and write. Or don't. No one cares.   It's a fucking screenplay it's not Ulysses just fucking do it.    really i never heard that - do you have source handy?   backward country            no they don't  this sub is just dumb   those hooded crows are the most cautious birds in my fathers garden (backs onto remnants of woods)  dominate the area but rarely come down ig humans around and are really careful if they do   No assist and scoring same match though?   get off the booze   Sad but interesting look at grief and how two men are dealing with it.      awesome            I remember a few years ago talk of new tv rights stuff  - more money coming in - did I just imagine that?   pretty cool   first time both dad/son scored?   I will have it one day.      Sure why not. Hell I'd give up 6 months of my life for one week of his wages.       Yes the bbc fixed their typo   that's a lot of food         Yeah it is a weekend round up, the total including domestic and overseas, and the the record opening day which is part of the domestic gross.  I don't see the problem.    It is record setting. Opening day is a common measure in hollywood box office http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/days/?page=open p=.htm    That includes a $46.2 million Friday domestically, the best opening day in history for an animated film.    It's human, it's exciting, well acted, the style is great, but mainly it is human, while still being a comic book film   keto is not 'effectively gluten free'  people on keto don't have to worry about tiny crumbs on a chopping board   can eat as much carbs as you want as long as they are gf  anyone want to explain their fucking dumbshit downvoting of scientific facts?  fucking lol      I've said it before I think the demographics recorded are off. It's far younger imo                        Looks great         I think ang lees hulk is the greatest super hero film ever made.         ok I was exaggerating a tad   I remember the quality of gf stuff ten years ago. It was truly awful.  But - if everyone starts acting like it people are going to eventually shrug and think they are crying wolf.   And pulling back to your comment - yes, it is insane, it's mass delusional cock, not arguing your point which is good, but when millions of people are deciding that they are afflicted with no basis that is insane, that is anti vac level    yeah would be a good signing   Interesing look at the fad and those that genuinely have to do it. It's insane really.       i have a feeling deadpool fanboyism might actually not need any circlejerk it'll just be   I kinda like it   nice   I couldn;t stay up.   Bring it   I watched that movie. Jesus.   think you might have missed the joke  repost  post  lamppost    also I am a massive drunk   You know I try, my jokes and all, I try... and I fail... I fail...   he's become rather toxic, don't rate him that highly either    [batman is definitely on some boards though](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PPC78_xih38/hqdefault.jpg)   [WHHHHHHHHHHUUUUHHHHHHHHHATTTTTTTTT?](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jHs5POy8-8Y/maxresdefault.jpg)   What number would change your opinion dude?   huh...    no doubt it took 42 hours to make dude... my brother made the fries you did and was raving about them   LOL   The fuck   Keanu was supposed to be in this back in the day.   Well this is actually very clever. Well done.   That's tragic in so many ways mainly just being funny       did the actor tweet this op?   one hell of a repost   	156
 Oh im not doing it any justice either.  I really loved this book.  Finished it the same day I bought it.   Not so far in the future.  The world is having an energy and over population problem.  A man (think of him like Steve jobs) create a virtual world where people can work, all schooling is free and of course play games and go on quests.  The man dies.  And instead of leaving a will he leaves a quest.  Solve all three riddles.  find all three keys and you get all of his like 240 billion dollars and control of the virtual world.  MC fights an evil corporation and there's a pretty girl.       I'll check it out.  And no way! I literally just got back from the library with that book.  I also picked up Dust by Hugh Howey and the shell collector.  I'm a little hesitant to start Golden Son though.   I've read that one too.  I loved it as well.  Some of the science portions were kinda dry but all together I thought it was a fun book.    Another book that I really got into was RPO by Ernest clein.  Wasn't the best written book I've ever read but damn was it exciting.   Holy crap was it good! I finished it almost a day and my mind is a million miles away right now.  My question to ya'll is: what book sucked you in the most?   Well big AL says his is deactivated.  He also says dogs can't look up so you never know with him.   Put grape in the palm of your hand  Make a fist  Beat adversary until he doesn't move.    And that's how you kill someone with a grape.   Tengen Toppa Gurren laggan.   Knights of sidonia    I would like to see a continuation of Hunterxhunter.  Gon and his father kicking alien ass or whatever.   I've read Red rising by Pierce Brown, Rant by Chuck Palahniuk and I just started Go Set A Watchman.   Horrible people like him win all the time in politics.  It's not that big of an if.   They should do a WW1 game.   Haha pathetic mongrels, took you guys this long to figure that out?   I'd watch amagi brilliant park just for sento.   Sword art online  Kill la kill  The devil is a part time  Knights of sidonia    satsuki kiryuin  I'm gonna be alright.   I've always been curious; why was is appealed in the first place?   Where does the iron giant come from?    Ya, he's saved her twice already.     Best girl Crimson hawk moth!   I will.   I don't doubt but holy shit dude.  That was a great finale.   THERE HAS TO BE A SEASON 3!   That blows.  Ya man I'd just cut off the handle, grind down the back half of blade into a hilt and make a neck knife.   How did that happen?   Big balls is a pretty kick as song as well.   That song gets me jacked up!   If you want blood (you got it)- AC/DC   Like when you're eating a plate of ribs or a big juicy steak.   I picked up lullaby at the library for a dollar, I was gonna start that this weekend.   Time is money.  money is power.  power is pizza   I'm sorry but what is with the obsession over this asshole? He changed the world with apple and the ipod.  Okay, can we move on?   Reading and hooking up with other people.   Cullen Bohannon.  God damn that man is badass.   I haven't read any of the progressive novels yet.  I'm caught up on the original LN'S but I wanna start reading them.   Nice!   Is he brings on Amy Mcdonald and that German racer chick I'd watch the show.  I think it would be pretty good.   How'd ya get it if you don't mind me asking?   I miss this show.     That's why you don't buy fish from a gas station.   That episode in scrubs where all of Dr.Cox's patients died of rabies.   Right now I've been listening to 'Don't wanna fight' - Alabama Shakes.  I love that song.   I know it is.  I've seen the show.  It just looks remarkably similar.   Isn't that the musket from amagi brilliant park? I'm watching it right now and it's very similar.   Fuck man I can't handle that right now.  It's just too much.  	46
    awesome film!   Would you wash your hands after you're done though? That's the real man question.   Cute, very cute. But it's a Mac. Better teach her to play on a real machine. She seems pretty disssssapointed in your choice.      Well its something you would do really isn't it! Silly girl and her silliness.   And she's better than me at poker......   Can confirm OP is a girl, she's my wife.....   This is very helpful, it's not actually for me but my wife so I will get her to read all your helpful posts and see what she thinks of them! Perhaps soon I will post some of her first work!   Again thanks a lot guys never before has a sub been this helpful to me!   Woman, you're clumsy.      Hi there, I'm interested in starting up animation as a small hobby, I was just curious as to what programs would be useful in starting myself off? I'm looking for any program that might have lots of pre-set templates that would be able to help me in studying the basic concepts of animation with an easy pre-cursor to more advanced things.  Sorry if this sounds like a silly request, have no real background on animation programs, the only thing I've really done in the past is stop motion.       Was wondering where In this post someone would mention the blatant mis leading title about being left at the altar. Original news post on reddit suggests it was a week before. Not at the altar as this post says.   It was only a phone camera, get off my case :( lol   Yeah this video didn't capture it very well but local reports from people suggested it did touch down ever so slightly out of sight from where i was.  	15
    I'm that91guy   good luck to all that enter :) hope we can get somewhere there this time    That sucks :( it's crazy to think that's how it was all those years ago   of course i did! ill never forget the time i said a$$ all those years ago      I would hit that.. Then it could make me some hot pockets after   Those Japanese are into some crazy things....   I think he's yelling 0?

Like some sort of magic bot puts all oc onto it   That's something I've never even remotely thought about... But next time those dogs is getting the old thumb in the bum trick. seriously though, thanks for the reply and i will actually remember this trick   that made me laugh so hard :)   thanks for the reply, yeah I'm pretty sure its the same here   Thats pretty crazy. but I'm like you, i would have done anything to stop these dogs from killing mine   thanks, yeah i thought that's how it would work   I win. Don't have any friends on steam :( or do I lose?   so this happened recently. I was walking my dog in a area where dogs have to be on lead, two dogs got out of someones backyard and started attacking my dog. I just want to know where i stand if i injure the dogs attacking my dog. Can I get in trouble? I live in West Australia if that helps with laws   haha i like it but when i bought it i thought it would be smaller... i barely use any of it its so massive!   thanks :) I've had no problems with the strix it runs pretty quiet the only thin i can really hear is the fans going on my case currently playing witcher 3 also with GPU usage in the high 90's   haha i had to do it. thanks. as for the wallpaper i got it from [here](http://wallpaperfx.com/games/other-games/the-elder-scrolls-wallpaper-15657.htm) that way you can pick your screen res and size if you like it :)   sure thing.

 Here's Sam vs. terrifying cat:  https://youtu.be/ASZkRM1vx54?t=7s   The private fake agents would've missed 100%.  TRUST ME: they truly sucked. And were officious jerks.  At least with TSA, you see some glimmers of professionalism.  Don't forget: private security companies like Argenbright and their ilk in NYC and Boston were the ones that let boxcutters and skeevy people onto the 9/11 flights.     The show's been on for freaking 11 seasons!  It would be nice if the Darkness just unleashed would get it back to its roots.  I need to re-watch the early seasons again.  I have seen every ep as it aired.     https://i.imgur.com/XSTVI.gif   We should never have broadcasted Glenn Miller.  The space aliens are going to attack and demand that he throws a concert before they depart.   I see your Catherine Deneuve in the 60's pic and raise you one Catherine Deneuve in the 70's pic:  http://clampart.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Jerry-Schatzberg-Catherine-Deneuve-Repose-1.jpg   You're missing my point -- the private security agents could do whatever they wanted.    At least now they're somewhat accountable.  However I don't think a machete would've been allowed pre-9/11.  I flew from San Diego to DC in the 70's and I remember I took a clock radio with me.  They made me plug it in at the gate to make sure it worked.  I was perhaps a 12 year old boy.   I live in DC now.  I hate the security theater.  Coming back from a Nationals game last month, there were all these DHS paramilitary police in black in the Metro.  WTF?!!!  But better them than the Argenbright Security Barney Fifes.   Oh that has to be tough for the Poles.  All of your friends when you were 16 recognize the plate for the rest of your life.  Did stupid things in a Lada?  When it's on a BMW 7-series, you still get laughed at.      Whoa.  That makes perfect sense.  Thanks!   I hope you heard the later Travelling Wilburies album.  I swear on half the tracks, he was teaching the other superstars how to record a song.   My cat used to come home smelling of really nice perfume.  One of my neighbors is a former model -- married -- and I suspect her.     Tires.   I was thinking about the four women killed on Long Island last week when a pickup truck broadsided their limo doing a U-turn.  How is that their limo was destroyed yet this one gets hit by a freaking train and appears to be somewhat salvageable?   Trust me, as bad as they are, they are FAR better than the private security they had pre-9/11.  Argenbright Security which ran the DC area airports were basically power hungry little termites.  I hated them having any kind of authority.  It was like volunteer deputies -- give them an inch of power and they'll try to take a yard.   Aw that's sad.  Still, Mr. Coe had a great run.    I wish the Archer people had let us in on the reason but perhaps he preferred his privacy.   You're getting downvoted but you're not wrong.  He does a lot more than action hero/conflicted pretty boy.  And even when he's in those roles, he brings something extra.  Top Gun was terrific acting believe it or not.      Toy Story 2 is the one that got me.  When Jessie was left at the recycling kiosk and sees her little girl drive away.  Utter abandonment.  And then Sarah McLachlan starts singing...      Me too!  Jeff Lynne is an underrated genius.  I listen to Concerto for a Rainy Day a few times each year to this day.     For anyone with interest: see The Deep sometime.  Great film and excellent photography of her.   Both of them are defaults now?    They're great r/'s.  I don't see a downside to either of them being defaults.   Imagine an alternative history where an astronaut gets sick and they're all "suit up Margaret!"   Wrong.  It was supposedly Westinghouse.  Also, what people forget that the elephant had killed a handler and was doomed to euthanasia, so it wasn't for yucks.    Edison may not have even known that it was happening:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_%28elephant%29#Death  Snopes needs to tackle this incident.   I bet I'm alone in here having watched Medium, but Alison's husband Joe -- portrayed by Jake Weber, who pops up all over the place, recently on Tyrant -- is a saint.    Literally psycho wife, three daughters showing the same trait, and he kept things real as far as domestic life was concerened.  A real saint.   I think this is more a combination of women marrying within the industry like Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes and them making terrible choices -- to this day Sandy B and Jessie James?  How did that happen?   RIP.  Was his ill health the reason Woodhouse went missing last season?   Meh.  She's in violation of the county code.  The eviction notice doesn't mean that's she's going to be evicted but the county taking the dispute to the courts, apparently unable to reach agreement with her.  This happens all the time.  I'm sure an accommodation is within reach somehow.     The trick is to look in the East Village, i.e., east of Wisconsin Ave. and north of M St.  The rentals in the West Village get snapped up by wealthy GU students.  This works in your favor.  I know a neighbor who had to go overseas for a year and rented his house for $1800.  This was maybe four years ago.    I know a property that's had a rental sign on it for a few months.  28th   P.  Not an apartment house so no gym or pool, but there're plenty of those around.  I'll jot down the number and PM you tomorrow evening.    When are you coming to town?   I saw a Nats game recently where Ian Desmond tried something like out of desperation and was off by just a hair.     I would wonder why Linda Carter is asking me out.  But if you're talking about a classmate, I'd be thrilled to catch up and take it from there.   It seems like the '70's pictures were a more vibrant blue.  Better processing on this image?   For $2800 you could get a small townhouse here in Georgetown.  You should consider that.  Your commutes will much more sane.   Orange tabby owner here.  When he was young, I could throw a toy mouse for him and he'd bring it back.  Then there was that one time when I misjudged him as being too tuckered out to bring the mouse back to me, so I went to retrieve it myself... game over.  He was testing me.     Holy crap this is the attention whore who played for Russia in the Olympics.     In the second pic, he'd be a new "deal with it" meme.   *ding ding*   *petsi!   One thing that may explain it that in the UK and maybe all of Europe, a car keeps its license plate for the life of the car.  So they need a format to basically print a VIN number.     It's not THAT clickbaity.  Here's the full list via the BBC:  http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films   Some very interesting choices.  They place Spike Lee in too high a regard though.     Plus the US version has radically different rules.  The hamsters conspire amongst themselves and vote each other out.  No public vote at all as in the UK version.     I live in DC and take Acela sometimes.  It's not that much faster than normal Amtrak, but it is more luxurious.    The problem is that the tracks are all laid out circa Civil War.  Straightening them to allow trains to go any faster is the headache.     I just looked out my front and there's plenty of parking in Georgetown.  You probably wouldn't get a ticket if you parked now and got it first thing in the morning.    I see this hostel is McPherson Square -- the 30-line buses would get you there, a taxi would be maybe $10, or you could walk to Foggy Bottom and metro.   Plan on taking the 3 but if you make the 2, terrific.  I think your plane would have to land early in order to make it.    Union Station's not a bad to cool your heels for an hour.  In fact, it's terrific.    I see nobody's tsk-tsk'd you calling it just Reagan.  We've got our panties rustled about the re-naming.  National, Reagan National, or DCA please.     Wish I'd read that first.    Interesting that he namechecked Edison.     Yup, it sounds like he had a good run.   I remain convinced the suite's designed with visiting heads of state in mind.  I live near the Four Seasons and sometimes see security out front that makes the place look like an embassy.  I wouldn't be surprised if every major hotel in town has a similar suite.  I'm pretty sure Netanyahu stayed at the Willard.     Awfully pricey for plastic toys.     What currency are these prices in?   His instruction manual states three rules: eat, sleep, pass gas.   Yup.  They changed the system.  McKayla Maroney almost got a perfect score on her team vault in London though.     I think that's the softest of the records so far in this thread.  Joe was facing a string of palookas in that streak, but I still think it'll fall.       This was actually a brilliant show -- Ton of Cash.  They would have to literally move a ton of I think $100 bills from point A to point B, sacrificing anything they couldn't lug.    They cast people who weren't so book smart.   No clapper inside -- they ring it by banging on it:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingun_Bell   How many errors can be assessed in a single play?      This is how Bryce Harper wound up looking the way he does.   Thanks for this -- I'd never heard of a geyser east of the Mississippi.     I thought this was going to be another guy landing on his privates.     If you're from Georgia and a student here why would you want to register in DC?  I miss being able to vote for a congressman or senators.  Just do absentee from home.  Contact your city/county's election board.     It's counterintuitive but do you wear a T-shirt under your business shirt?  It helps for me.  All cotton though.     JFK: I think it's one of the small wooden houses diagonal from the 7-11 on 27th   P.  I know for certain the first house he had with Jackie was 2808 P.  He was awarded the Pulitzer while living there.  The tavern is City Tavern on M Street.  That story might not be true, but Jefferson definitely ran into a tipsy Hamilton somewhere in the vicinity one night, retired to a tavern, and hammered out an agreement that resulted in a national bank.  My understanding is that it's most likely the City Tavern.   I wanted to see a tuba not saxophone playing the melody.   Please don't let us Muricans be searching cost of porn, please...  Patents?!  OK I'll take that.  We are an inventive country.   You are describing the behavior of my cat not only when waking up but throughout the day.   I had a girl drive 250 miles to my parents' house, break in, and snap a 45 rpm single that she'd given me in half.    That's all she did.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iol0B-clFFM) ["Build Me Up Buttercup"] for anyone interested.    A few years later I caught her cruising my new home's street.  My very understanding girlfriend and I accosted her, invited her in, and calmly explained that this kind of behavior couldn't go on.  She got it.   Typing to you from Georgetown.  We're really only more of a neighborhood now, but had been an independent city pre-USA and even post-DC.   There are all kinds of fun spots here and there.  JFK's bachelor pad I walk past all the time.  The tavern where Jefferson and Hamilton came to an understanding is still here.     Why go Oceans 11?  Leave -- oops -- a door or two accidentally open, place a few strips of properly-placed bacon and BOOM! you and doggie are on the run.  Simplicity trumps even Clooney and Pitt.   The problem would be you'd be denying -- for my home team, by example -- the Nationals the services of Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer for a two week period.  We'd right now basically be an AAA team without them.    I think the NHL recognized how valuable Olympic hockey is to the sport and just shuts down.  There is zero chance Olympic baseball will ever be as important to the sport while the World Series contenders are trying to keep themselves over .500 even in the doldrums of July.   Yikes.  Did airbags save the driver?   It was not very well thought out.  Remember that she is the sister of a brother who got himself fake kidnapped.     We'll see next week but I bet to let the SEAL expend his anger and win his confidence.  Seriously -- we've seen Raymond take punches like that.  Ever seen him stagger so melodramatically?   Thank you!  It's an awfully cute doggie!  I was worried that it might be a Presa Canario which has a checkered history.   And this is exhibit A as to why baseball shouldn't be played in the Olympics.    Anybody who is even remotely good is being paid to play this time of year.   I think I'm the only person on reddit or perhaps the entire universe who admits to loving Two and a Half Men, but she had an absolutely hilarious arc on it in its final seasons.     Nanny state strikes again.  Still, I wonder why if the children were crying she didn't excuse herself for a moment or two -- I can't imagine the interviewer would've minded.   I was in college in the 80's.  I think mine was the last generation to write love letters.  I was very good at it, by the way.     Stocking up on canned soup is actually the perfect thing to do when a hurricane or blizzard threatens.  Even if the electricity and gas gets knocked out, you have food.   *{{Sudden Clarity Clarence}}*   Also last week's Ray Donovan.  I think one of the real life Getty heirs did this, too.     Get her to meet you for a mai tai at the cabana tomorrow in daylight.   Don't be.  I've filled a passport.  I've had some dicey things happen -- being surrounded by skinheads in Munich is the worst, but it was only dicey and I walked away -- and 99 times out of 100, people look after travellers.   Well this is in a [Serious] post so I didn't think to, but even when in the wild, if it's a good story, I keep reading just in case the monster from the Pleistocene era shows up.  I love it when he does.   That was identical to the set-up here in DC until only a year or two ago.  They've since let the liquor stores open on Sundays at 1pm and stay open I think until 6pm.     There's a drive through beer store just over the bridge going into the Outer Banks in NC.  Brew Thru.  Its awesome.   No I type it from memory any time I see somebody asking about visiting here -- I figure it's something tourists would like to know.  It's a good introduction to the neighborhood.  edit: and once the leaves turn and the summer furnace turns off, try one.  It's a nice way to spend an afternoon!   This comment, the third down:  https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/3dqqpn/lost_cat_more_in_comments/ct85npc?context=3   Fun coincidence -- my 18 pound tabby just finished a session of gnawing on my hand.   *cough cough*   It's very popular in Korea and Taiwan too.     For anyone with interest, Jen Cheney of the Washington Post just published a oral history of Clueless.  By all accounts it's really good.     Nope.  I've been logged in for two days without a blip.     States qualify as autonomous?     What in the US qualifies as an autonomous zone?  The reservations?   Bloodbath.    Imagine being at the Park, suffering and sweltering, then this happens.  Plus they've cut off beer sales by now.     Especially with people from Hollywood visiting.   Why hasn't the Walking Dead or something similar apocalypse-y snapped this up as a filming location?   Oh come on Blue!  Horsepoop!   If you decide on Georgetown, there are printable walking tours easily found via Google.  They're heavily JFK/Camelot, but there's nothing wrong with that.     As for shopping here, the further you get from M   Wisconsin, the quirkier the shops become.     Heck I'm happy about this!!!   RFK had a bouncing third baseline for baseball.   I was in it for the second U2 concert on their Achtung Baby tour.   I got a little seasick but oh what fun!   R2D2   You're right -- 707 not a 727:  http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/how-travolta-got-shorty-and-a-short-707/story-e6frg95x-1225952224866?nk=305c8affb264431a39f3e99d56bd0a73-1437290298  I love the idea that somebody in Florida built a development around propeller-heads.     This kind of trickery makes no difference unless she can run and get a first touch on a ball passed to her.  This is Harlem Globetrotters vs. the NBA.         ^^Wow.                                       ^^Such ^^cute.                        ^^Tired ^^now.   He used to be a one season showkiller.     My first thought, too!   Professor Moriarty.     Anybody have google maps google-fu to see what this place looks like now?  Anyhow, what a lethal combination these two tanks made.   John Travolta I've heard lives in a Florida aviation community with his own Qantas 727.  Why couldn't the Spanish convert this into such a thing.  It'd be like golfers living along a golf course, except everybody's got an aircraft.   Gone from YouTube now.  Mirror?   Seriously,  http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/52283121.jpg   That sounds like an AWESOME show for the genre.  Real conflict instead of manufactured.      Sir David is so awesome.  He he is narrating Olympic curling:  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=777_1392789840   Any hope for the future?    I'd be terrified to pilot one of these things, but I'd thought if the USMC let them go operational, things will be fine.     No (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold)[Benedict Arnold] nominations yet?   That really is badass.  I thought that with all of the early problems with this aircraft, it'd never see operational status.   Glad it made it.   SW Virginia here.  Rednecks in the Appalachians are people who I think are indispensable.  The mechanic who jury-rigs a fix on your car?  The man running a Winn Dixie grocery store?  I really like them.   And I don't use the word redneck ever.     Sounds like my last Pan Am flight.  '89 or so.  I really miss that airline.     I see this question a couple times of year, true, but come on -- different former prisoners answer each time.  I think it's interesting.     Cowboys vs. Aliens.    Great concept, but crappy movie.  How is it possible to put Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the same movie and have it suck that badly?   Dina Meyers.  Those are the only two things I remember.     I agree 100%.   Why didn't somebody just swat it on the nose?  I thought they hate this.   I grew up in the 70's and this was fairly popular.  I liked it.  I don't think I've had it since then though.     Just spewed Diet Coke!   Call up Schneiders or Calvert Woodley to see if they have that much in stock.     I had to get a DC license replaced there last December and sailed through.  Be aware that they're now issuing something called "real ID's" so look at the website carefully to find out what documents you'll need.    BTW the entrance is on the corner on M just east of Dean   Deluca.  I walked past it a few times myself.  I think it's mainly a gym there.     Hell of a catch Bruce!   "Dodged" a bullet there.   I've always thought they're the side facing seats at the doorways.    The first row of front facing seats are sort of a gray zone.     Sweet stroke on that HR!     Then he's probably still hiding inside.   I've had my cat for 11 years in the same house and he still finds new places to hide.    Open all of your closet doors and so forth in case he's trapped.     This does not factor in humidity.   Drama Queens.  The cat started it, but the dog executed it.   How well are you adapting?  Do you stay within a fellow Somalian enclave?  Do the Swedes embrace you?  Have you learned to cross-country ski yet?  You'd be good at that.     In case anybody didn't click through:  http://astro.ic.ac.uk/bmay/home   Seriously there is aww and then there is something beyond aww.   Eastern Air Lines.    Now that's a name I have not heard in a long time.   Problem?  Send a terrier in.  Problem solved.     That revolver.  It's scary.     Agreement.   I was seriously angry when Peking became Beijing.    How did anybody let the Chinese Communist Party change the name of the great city we'd known for centuries change its English name?  We let the unctuous assholes re-brand themselves.  And only a decade after Tiananmen Square.     Dammit just when I had forgotten how furious I am at the damned Russians.  These dissembling sons of bitches.     He's old enough for Iams kitten food.    Your next few years are going to be all about devising new ways to entertain an adolescent cat.   Hint: take an old shoelace, tie knots on on end to resemble a mouse, and swing it around.  Do this until the cat is tuckered out -- 15 minutes or so.  The doggie will take care of the rest.   So sad.  And with Schumi languishing in a coma.     "Because I DID know that I couldn't do that!"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B93BoC9ylg   I'm from the south -- redneck accents are southern but not all southern accents are redneck.  They're a subset.    This man doesn't sound too rednecky though.  I can't place it but he's soft spoken.  North Carolina maybe?    I hold people like him in high regard.     'Zactly.  I hope that water wasn't contaminated.  It looks iffy.   Sorry about this Angelenos.  Nats Park is actually a really nice place.  Never seen this before.  We had two Taylor Swift sell outs there during the ASB.  This must be related.     Fun fact: I was at that game and had no idea what was going on until I got home.  They didn't draw any attention to the misspelling to the live audience.     Harsh.   Holy crap I'm glad they got this game going again!!!   Why would he do that?  It's way too early in the game.  If you're having lighting problems I'd think it's best not to turn off the spigots.   Huh.  I remember making that post -- this is a mangled version of it.  Somebody had posted an album of old photos of DC buildings on r/dc.     +/u/User_Simulator /u/train_subject9153   Check out /r/justFPthings -- a collection of FP's musings.   Yup.  I bookmarked it for viewing tomorrow.     How many parking spots does the District have that are actually under a bridge?  I'd think parking on the emergency shoulder would trump physically being under a bridge in most circumstances, too.    Something's not right here.   TV and radio station web posts are always notoriously mangled.  I've always thought there must be something going on when they take a blurb prepped for on-air brevity and turn it into a written news article.        On the kettle thing, I think the electrical grid is easier in Europe to heat water or something.  For us, I'd use my stove.   No they're not pests in the sense that rats are pests.  They're just part of the ecology.  I get them in my garden tree every day, they're cute, piss off my cat, and move along.     In the mid-Atlantic we absolutely love the French.  We know their role in the Revolution and a lot of us are Huguenots.     There are two schools of thinking:  one is that crazies are attracted to Florida and the other is that Florida embraces and nurtures crazy.  It's a symbiotic relationship of crazy.   Yes but don't read too much into it.  It's more the ceremonial start to the day than anything else.  I know it sounds creepy to foreigners, but it's a really good civics lesson.     The Superbowl is the championship of Madison Avenue advertisers.  Everybody's paying top dollar for a spot.    I personally love the NFL so watch the game for the game, but even in the VCR era would tape the game so I could back and watch the commercials.    My all time favorite?  From the mid-90's, Ross Perot's EDS "Herding Cats" ad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk7yqlTMvp8     Yes.  It tends to be a black/African-American thing, particularly from those with roots in the South.    I live in DC.  No better lunch than a pair of half-smokes (the local specialty), a Diet Coke, and a bag of Doritos, eaten on a park bench.  A regular diet of this would consign you to an early grave, though.    The Washington Animal Rescue League  My sister found her now-soulmate toy poodle there on an adoption day.  They're inseparable.    I'm sure the others don't suck though, but WARL's good.  Go get your doggie/kittie and don't worry too much.   Find a 7-11.  They keep fresh coffee brewing for law enforcement.   I don't think that's true.  Dialing 1 means securing an international line.  Maybe things are different now, but I grew up in the 70's and you would dial 1 for the international line, then country code, then the local number.  I remember having an Englishman visiting my parents' house as late as '95 or so and having to take a couple of tries before getting his call to London connected.     In the US, starting a number dialing sequence with 1 means you're about to dial internationally.  112 could lead to some horrible misdials -- I don't think it'd even go through.  The line would be waiting for the rest of the numbers.   I grew up with a bulldog.  He could clear a room in five seconds.  My mother loved throwing bridge parties.  One day, he crept underneath the card table, detonated a particularly lethal emission, and my mother and all her friends en masse ran for the door.  It was a sight to behold.  I have never been as proud of him as I was that afternoon.    Chaos.   I didn't think about that -- it's clear to me they're playing a game.  If the cat didn't like it, he'd move.  He's not cornered, he's not being hit hard -- this boy and this cat have done this many time before.    It's a "How long can I annoy the cat until he pounces" game.    I don't which of them was having more fun.  That cat is a feline jack in the box.     Boston makes no sense.  I heard a story that the roads follow old cow paths.   Me too.  I've only needed them twice but POW! they were there immediately.     He's right -- a mai tai really would hit the spot at that moment.   I know they're here somewhere -- a friend's house caught fire and he and his family stayed in one for a few months until the house was fixed.     Right back atcha!    Holy crap you're right, and they still seemed to have had trouble listing the clones properly:   Tatiana Maslany as Alison/ Cosima/ Helena/ Rachel and Krystal/ Sarah  Why the "and" in there?  For when one clone pretended to be another?  They missed the transgendered clone, too, but maybe he didn't appear in season 3?  http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners   Dumb question: for which role was she nominated?   Yup and right at the start.  Ishmael was trolling us.     This is no Rusty the Red Panda escape, but go agouti, go!   Bud Greenspan was a woefully underknown documentarian.  He was an international treasure.    I think his son is trying to keep his productions alive but haven't heard anything lately.   Why would you say that?  It's Emily Yahr -- there's a picture of her at the bottom of the article.   Ah missed it.  There it is in the final pic on the shelf!   HIMYM fan and I missed the reference.  Clarify?   Have you ever read the Cetology chapter of Moby Dick?  It struck me that that Melville via Ishmael was amazingly accurate for 1850.  Your thoughts?   I'd be so tempted to mess with him by calling him Elijah.     TIL Obama's going to Kenya.    You'd think they'd be thrilled about this.        Loved the Wesley Snipes sighting at the end.   HUZZAH!!!      It happened to me in Xian.  I'd finished the tour of the terra cotta soldiers, stopped to buy an ice cream, and suddenly a pack of cute Chinese stopped me and each had their picture taken with me individually.    Blue eyes perhaps?     I also live in DC.  My favorite is when somebody asks to see THE Smithsonian.  (For anybody who doesn't know, there are dozen or so of them -- Air   Space, American History, etc.)   I don't think this is tin-foily at all.  MPD still hasn't said why the people detained with Wint were released.  It's a fair question and one I'd like to know.     Preface it with "PSA date time ____ line(s) is/are fucked" and that might be helpful.    Imminent weather dangers such as derechos might be a good idea, too.     UWOTM8?!   I once toured the battlefield of Borodino -- Napoleon vs. the Russians and made famous in War and Peace.  Its monuments were pockmarked with bullet holes from when the Nazis later tried to take Moscow.   	201
    Yes there are many names for it. Circle of death is one. I like the idea of the beer tab...brings a bit more excitement into the game. You're drunk...trying not to pop the tab..and BAM..it break and you're chugging. Some of the rules change as well like what each mean. When I only play with 4 people I change 8 to Trivia. bc it's not enough for a "mate"    Don't be black.    What state?    Well this was a dumb question   hahahahaha thats so foul   Playing style differs depending on region I have found. This is how I play it.   We put a can of beer in the middle of a table and surround it with a full deck of cards without the two joker cards.   Each person sits around the table and gets on turn each. You pick up a card and depending on what the card is- is what you follow- each card has a rule or activity that must be performed. When you are done with the card you place it under the beer tab....the person that makes the tab burst must chug the beer....  **Rules**   1. Aces= Waterfall (Everyone starts drinking/chugging at the same time...but the person to your right cannot stop until you do, and his person to the right cannot stop until he does..and so on...So if you are last...it sucks- To determine which way the you start the waterfall from your left or right I usually ask a common question -Common such as *What beer are we drinking?*- between the person to my left and to my right. The one who gets it right I start in his direction, making the loser..last)   2. Kings= Rule Master (You can make whatever rule you want...such as "little man" "no Names" and every time you break the rule you must drink)   3. Queens= Question master (Anytime the question master asks you a question you must answer with a question and so forth until someone doesnt and that person must drink- some people only allow this once others allow it until the next queen is shown)   4. Jacks= Thumb Master (The person who gets this card puts his thumb on the table and the last one to do it must drink)   5. Tens- Categories (You choose a category such as "Countries in Africa" The person who fouls up must drink)   6. Nines= Rhyme Time (You pick a word and go in a circle and you must rhyme...if you don't or you repeat you must drink)   7. Eights= Pick a mate (Everytime you drink your mate must drink with you)   8. Sevens= Heaven (You raise your left arm and the last person to do it must drink)   9. Sixes= Dicks (All males must drink once)   10. Fives= Social (Everyone takes a drink)   11. Fours= Whores (All women must drink once)   12. Threes= For me (You must take 3 drinks)   13. Twos= For you (You must pass out two drinks)   Kings    By Steve Alton   More. Of. Us.   "I'm actually between jobs. After teaching, I went into software QA and test writing. Unfortunately, my position was eliminated in a buyout, so I'm "on the hunt". Fortunately, I just had an interview for a very awesome Product Manager position with a web company, so things are going well.  Not really. Kevin and his parents were entertaining, honestly.

No. It was states rights.  Yes...states' rights to have slaves.    [Funny you should say killing with grapes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3e3ii4/someone_is_trying_to_kill_you_with_a_grape_how_do/)   I've been pronouncing it GIF all this time instead of jiff. fuck. MIND BLOWN   Probably not. But you could do 1v1v1v1 then. And for splatfest have a tournament, maybe 1v1 tourney or something.    They don't mean no one, as in NEVER, they mean it as a rarity. More often than not people do not.   But no, it's not boring. It's quite peaceful    I'm being dead serious.  Nope. There's no way.    I'm sorry I refuse to believe you're being serious in your responses.    Damn. So is that his job or hobby?    does he get money for winning tourney?   The muffin man?    It doesn't look like he kicked your ass. It was pretty close till the last few turns. So you play the game online? How do you know if the other person is cheating or not?     Privilege is only bad if you can't acknowledge it. If you can't acknowledge it you can't deal with it appropriately.    You are either high out of your mind or trolling. Not sure which. I know you can't be serious. I refuse to believe people are that thick headed.    Well Eru is God....so I didn't know if that really counted.     I don't think he should be responsible for it  Are you high?    I try to use it to splat as much ink as possible: depending on the map. In Kelp Dome there are certain areas enemies won't touch for 30-40 seconds when I inkstrike it.   A few seconds of them cleaning up an instrike is worth it because it's more time they arent supporting teammates or pushing. I stay away from snipers, only on Moray Towers do I use it to move a sniper. But mostly I use the Ink Strike on Moray to strike areas around the top of their tower because hardly anyone ever goes down that more than once. People just run away from their home base and hardly ink it, it's always not inked all the way, lot's of black spaces on lots of maps.   Or if I am near an enemy at Bluefin I will InkStrike the bottom platforms and they will move out of the way towards me so I can kill them because they have no where else to go- either into the inkstrike and die or towards me and die. While this area will be eventually cleaned up I also leave an Ink Mine there so when they do come to clean it they might die to the mine. Or I leave them in blind spots and go somewhere far away from it. Or...lol if I make the mistake of jumping into an enemy i place a mine right away before i die and then they die   I never said they were more special. I said having sex in a dumb way and getting someone pregnant is not the same thing as a sperm donor. Because it isn't. They are completely different.   I never said it makes them their parent either. I said it makes him the kids father...because it does. He is their bio father. The woman...still has the kid, it is her kid- she is giving birth to it even though she is drunk but the guy dips out..but he's just as much responsible for it as she is. So he's nothing more than a coward. A sperm donor is nothing like that. He offers his sperm knowing exactly what is going to happen with it, and signs release forms saying whether or not contact is allowed...etc They are not the same at all. The guy who dipped out is still the bio father- he just dipped out bc he's a coward.   Yes exactly thats what I do when I see an inkstrike on turf wars I just shoot into it and it's almost completely gone. So when I ink strike on turf wars, I just make sure to strike somewhere where there isn't any enemy around. Usually around there hjome base making them waste time not advancing.    Thank you!! I like to use Inkstrike to take out or momentarily daze a sniper so I can move position while the strike is happening     Morgoth AKA Melkor of Lord of the Rings.    wow. That looks ...so futuristic and nice compared to how I thought it would [look in my head](http://www.betterphoto.com/uploads/processed/1045/1011030343191inside_a_.jpg)    Because you're not a sperm donor. You got someone pregnant because you had sex in a dumb way then dipped out and left it to the woman. A sperm donor offers their sperm willingly with the idea that someone who definitely wants kids is going to get them and in return they get money.   They used the national crime database to track down my father so ...you're wrong there buddy.    Sure you do. You might not be around to see them, but they are yours. And one day you might get tracked down using DNA and shit.    What kind of train is it?    Multiply the amount you put in by how many paychecks you get per year. Use that amount and multiply it by 10 or 15 and that's how much money you would have without  interest. Depends on your savings account, the type, how much interest you get per quarter.   You can put money in a CD, not sure I'd recommend it right now.   But If I wer eyou I'd save 50 bucks per paycheck. 5-10 is too little.    having to pee   You'd be surprised. I hide on the walls   Unless someone is camped by a beacon. Sometimes, I camp next to beacon and wait for people to jump in to it.    [The Roots- The Tipping Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wS5J0cQe7k)   When you call someone a cunt you're basically calling them a bitch, coward, pussy, dumbass, whore, slut, piece of shit, arrogant asshole all in one.    A room full of thousands of spiders crawling around.    Save a little bit of your paycheck in a savings account for 10-15 years. Never touch it.    In the front of my door my mom had these house slippers or boat shoes, they were neon with blotches on black all around it, a very 90s type of shoe thing. It was just a slip on. Anyway at night it looked like it had massive holes in it which I thought were spiders coming to get me. So I would always high tail it around the corner near shoes on my way upstairs. Also, worried my father would beat the fuck out of me/mom.    There's no way to know. Maybe you can find out.    Oh...leave packages by someone's door. Because whoever sent it did not check the box that it needs to be signed.    They have no way to get it. They're completely isolated. Unless they find some way to manufacture it themselves...maybe palm wine? I dunno.    Well, what happened was I was watching that food show on travel network with that one guy...what's his name ...Bizarre Foods with [Andrew Zimmern and saw him eat some fried tarantula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZkhpRfqsI0) so my friend went to the store and bought one. We fried it, using the ingredients we saw in the show and then ate it. It wasn't all that bad, kind of nutty. Then I had a guy come over late at night and we fucked and I sucked his cock.    I bet.    Star Wars Episodes 1-3.    It's weird to him/her, you asked for personal responses. So it may be the weirdest thing for him/her, but not you.    Fried Tarantula. And a cock.    There a place/an island right in the Bay of Bengal where no outsiders venture, if they venture on the island the culture living there usually kills them. I'm willing to bet they don't have alcohol.    Can you somehow reword this or can someone translate I'm not sure what you're asking?    Teachers.    hey! I'm a counselor! Yay   Definitely Salo.    Cannibal Holocaust, A Clockwork Orange, Eraserhead    Agreed. I'd really like to see a free for all 1v1v1v1v1v1v1 or something similar. That way it's not so much team anymore. It would be a nice change of pace than being 4v4 all the time.    Money isn't really worth much though. I have about 500K right now and nothing to spend it on lol.    I've had this problem too. The key to tower control is one person or two on the tower and hte other two out in support usually inf ront would be nice. I always put an Ink mine on the tower in the event I die, the other guy dies too. But What I don't understand is why they just stand there staring at it when no one is around. GET ON IT AND MOVE IT. Or they just jump off for some random reason and then no one is on it. You can see how many people are on it easily.    I'm not entirely sure powering up the special midway through the match is advantageous. It takes time to go to the areas to ink to get enough energy to use your special- in that time you could have been doing the same amount if not more inking than what your nuke was worth. So I'm not entirely sure it is worth it- In the beginning yes, because everything is clear so it's easy to get special right off the bat but in the middle of the match it puts your team down a person allowing the other team to push while your off trying to get your special.    This one event didn't cause you to lose.  Don't just sit and cherry pick. Have multiple areas where you can shoot.   I don't ever use beacons and I don't ever plan to. That being said I never jump where a teammate/enemies are. If I jump, which is rare, would be if my teammate is some place advantageous or it's the end of the game.   Beacons are a waste of a sub because hardly anyone uses them, and the enemy just destroys them fast. As soon as I see an enemy beacon on my game pad that's the first place I go. Or I just nuke it.   I try to stay as far away from people as I can and just splat the ground for turf war because that's the object to win the game. In splatzones I do the same, I make sure the splatzones are splatted and don't worry about killing people unless it's in defense or completely necessary. The most important thing is the area to be splatted.    That hasn't happened yet. I've never had to play more than 3 games in a row before getting a win.   For instance, I just played now. I won, so I quit for the day I got +8 so I'm at +38 now. I got the +8 because I had As on my team   Well, I'm not the best shooter in the game but I've figured out a way to move up in ranking.   I play one game per session online. If I win, I don't play any more ranked games till the next time I play Splatoon.   If I lose, I get a new team, and play till I win. Then quit. This results in me having two end results at the end of a Splatoon session:   1. My point/ranking stays the same 2. I move up +10 or +12 or whatever I get.   I Have used this to move up from C to B. I have never gone 0-7 though in ranked or 0 anything in ranked. Sometimes for Tower Control I'll go like 10-16. In splatzones it's more like 6-5 or 5-4.   I changed to this style because if I play too many ranked I get frustrated by my team at times. Now I don't get as frustrated.    You're terrible!   Good job!   Or   Stop using a sniper in Turf Wars!   Splat the ground!!   My views? You want my personal views on men/women? Because we're just talking about what male privilege is.   I don't believe men are any more competent than women- no. But I agree with the statements and definition of male privilege I have given you.    Privilege is a real thing. But that doesn't mean it's a *bad* thing to acknowledge it. It's just a reality.    Sure.    Kids have been trained for most of their lives to think of my gender as the authority.  They might have learned it at an early age when assertive girls were smacked down with labels like bossy "bitch" (see Lupe Fiasco's Bad Bitch song)  a reality that recently spurred the Ban Bossy campaign.  They might have learned it from watching media that rampantly objectifies women, often blurring the line between mainstream media and pornography.  They might have learned it from consistently seeing men over represented and women underrepresented in positions of power.  And I benefit from all of these lessons as a male.     K. Here are some examples.   As a male....I  1. I Have the Privilege of a Gender That Confers Authority  2. I Have the Privilege to Show Skin- That is men can take their shirts off and not be called sluts, whores..etc   3. I Have the Privilege to Move About Without Fear of Harassment, Assault, or Rape  4. I Have the Privilege to Enjoy the Internet Without My Gender Being Assaulted  5. I Have the Privilege of Seeing Myself Widely and Positively Represented in the Media     **If you want more**  The Male Privilege Checklist  1. My odds of being hired for a job, when competing against female applicants, are probably skewed in my favor. The more prestigious the job, the larger the odds are skewed.  2. I can be confident that my co-workers wont think I got my job because of my sex  even though that might be true.   3. If I am never promoted, its not because of my sex.  4. If I fail in my job or career, I can feel sure this wont be seen as a black mark against my entire sexs capabilities.  5. I am far less likely to face sexual harassment at work than my female co-workers are.   6. If I do the same task as a woman, and if the measurement is at all subjective, chances are people will think I did a better job.  7. If Im a teen or adult, and if I can stay out of prison, my odds of being raped are relatively low.   8. On average, I am taught to fear walking alone after dark in average public spaces much less than my female counterparts are.  9. If I choose not to have children, my masculinity will not be called into question.  10. If I have children but do not provide primary care for them, my masculinity will not be called into question.  11. If I have children and provide primary care for them, Ill be praised for extraordinary parenting if Im even marginally competent.  12. If I have children and a career, no one will think Im selfish for not staying at home.  13. If I seek political office, my relationship with my children, or who I hire to take care of them, will probably not be scrutinized by the press.  14. My elected representatives are mostly people of my own sex. The more prestigious and powerful the elected position, the more this is true.  15. When I ask to see the person in charge, odds are I will face a person of my own sex. The higher-up in the organization the person is, the surer I can be.  16. As a child, chances are I was encouraged to be more active and outgoing than my sisters.   17. As a child, I could choose from an almost infinite variety of childrens media featuring positive, active, non-stereotyped heroes of my own sex. I never had to look for it; male protagonists were (and are) the default.  18. As a child, chances are I got more teacher attention than girls who raised their hands just as often.   19. If my day, week or year is going badly, I need not ask of each negative episode or situation whether or not it has sexist overtones.  20. I can turn on the television or glance at the front page of the newspaper and see people of my own sex widely represented.  21. If Im careless with my financial affairs it wont be attributed to my sex.  22. If Im careless with my driving it wont be attributed to my sex.  23. I can speak in public to a large group without putting my sex on trial.  24. Even if I sleep with a lot of women, there is no chance that I will be seriously labeled a slut, nor is there any male counterpart to slut-bashing.   25. I do not have to worry about the message my wardrobe sends about my sexual availability.   26. My clothing is typically less expensive and better-constructed than womens clothing for the same social status. While I have fewer options, my clothes will probably fit better than a womans without tailoring.   27. The grooming regimen expected of me is relatively cheap and consumes little time.   28. If I buy a new car, chances are Ill be offered a better price than a woman buying the same car.   29. If Im not conventionally attractive, the disadvantages are relatively small and easy to ignore.  30. I can be loud with no fear of being called a shrew. I can be aggressive with no fear of being called a bitch.  31. I can ask for legal protection from violence that happens mostly to men without being seen as a selfish special interest, since that kind of violence is called crime and is a general social concern. (Violence that happens mostly to women is usually called domestic violence or acquaintance rape, and is seen as a special interest issue.)  32. I can be confident that the ordinary language of day-to-day existence will always include my sex. All men are created equal, mailman, chairman, freshman, he.  33. My ability to make important decisions and my capability in general will never be questioned depending on what time of the month it is.  34. I will never be expected to change my name upon marriage or questioned if I dont change my name.  35. The decision to hire me will not be based on assumptions about whether or not I might choose to have a family sometime soon.  36. Every major religion in the world is led primarily by people of my own sex. Even God, in most major religions, is pictured as male.  37. Most major religions argue that I should be the head of my household, while my wife and children should be subservient to me.  38. If I have a wife or live-in girlfriend, chances are well divide up household chores so that she does most of the labor, and in particular the most repetitive and unrewarding tasks.   39. If I have children with my girlfriend or wife, I can expect her to do most of the basic childcare such as changing diapers and feeding.  40. If I have children with my wife or girlfriend, and it turns out that one of us needs to make career sacrifices to raise the kids, chances are well both assume the career sacrificed should be hers.  41. Assuming I am heterosexual, magazines, billboards, television, movies, pornography, and virtually all of media is filled with images of scantily-clad women intended to appeal to me sexually. Such images of men exist, but are rarer.  42. In general, I am under much less pressure to be thin than my female counterparts are. If I am fat, I probably suffer fewer social and economic consequences for being fat than fat women do.   43. If I am heterosexual, its incredibly unlikely that Ill ever be beaten up by a spouse or lover.  44. Complete strangers generally do not walk up to me on the street and tell me to smile.   45. Sexual harassment on the street virtually never happens to me. I do not need to plot my movements through public space in order to avoid being sexually harassed, or to mitigate sexual harassment.   45. On average, I am not interrupted by women as often as women are interrupted by men.   46. I have the privilege of being unaware of my male privilege.   "That's cool." or "lol"   Because I have a totem.    I would trade places with Warren Buffet and send myself 4 million dollars.    Columbus, Ohio.    I once bought generic chicken noodle soup. It tasted awful like it was just water and salt with chicken chunks and random noodles. It had this strange stale taste to it...like diet pop.  Campbell's...I will always spend the extra 40-60 cents on some Campbell's.    Marijuana.   Are you asking seriously or jokingly?    Yeah, that is fine. This is not a democracy here. I am the dictator.    This is my sub I make the rules.    1. Take your balls out and tea bag him.   2. Draw cocks all over his face.   3. Put shaving cream on his hand then tickle his face.   4.

Photoshop some guy pounding his girlfriend and text it to him.     No I don't because I already know how you got them. You tried forcing yourself into my apartment and then after a long scruffle I took a frying pan to your melon. Your head was bleeding from the blunt forced trauma but still you motion onward to come at me. I wouldn't allow this so I took my mallet and pegged you in the leg. With your mobility weakened, I bit your fucking ankles and took some flesh out while screaming crazy nonsense at you. This frightened you because I was acting crazy and insane so you ran out of my apartment never to return.   That's how you got your scars.    No dude. Shortbus is a Canadian indy film about sex, orgasms, and orgies. There's a scene in the film, which takes place in NYC, where three gay guys are having a threesome and one of them uses his mouth like a trumpet and sings the national anthem in another guy's ass. It's graphic and shows all of this. [Here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367027/?ref_=nv_sr_1)   The orgy participants seen throughout Club Shortbus are credited as 'Sextras' at the end of the film   Jurassic World   Tricksy Hobbitses Mount Doom    Depends what you mean by criminal?

I mean he was a sub character, but prominent enough that I noticed the omission.    I have to say, the saddest death was watching that Assistant get taken away by the dino bird, then eaten by the water monster with the bird. She was eaten whole so you have to imagine she was alive while being in the stomach of that thing for probably 2-4 minutes before drowning.     Wait you say "cool?" They know you don't like them.    In Jurassic World, we don't find out what happens to the other trainer after being stuck in that log that Chris Pratt saves him from. We just see him alive at the end of the movie for like a second. We have no idea how that happened.    The X-Files. In HD first 6 seasons.    First person to respond to this comment.   No. They would have my jizz and someone else's vagina juices in it, plus my stank sweat from fucking in cooked pasta. So no.    It's not rude. It's just like saying you don't like a particular movie or piercings or whatever. There's nothing rude with saying you don't like something. It's rude to put on a show and be fake. You can express your feelings on tattoos without being rude, without being a dick, and without hurting someone's feelings. You just have to use tact.

Well if you don't want to have kids the dumbest way would be without birth control or a condom and not using the pull out method either. Just cumming in her and hoping her ovaries don't take your little semen.      Why do you have to pretend it's cool? Why can't you be honest?    It's far away from the primaries far enough that people don't care about it right now.    Well I'll be honest here. I've always wanted to have sex in pasta. So I've been hoping someone will serve me pasta in a giant pool where I can have sex with someone in it.   That would be my favorite.    Lava lamps   A used condom.

Then someone replies to 1 with "2" and so forth. You cannot reply to yourself.   They had so many replies in a thread once that it messed with reddit's servers so now each thread in the count can only be 1000. So every 1000 counts, they start a new thread. Right now I believe they are on or around 430,000  There are other threads which count not just numbers like they have a count letters thread which starts with AAAA. The next would be AAAB, then AAAC....till AAAZ..then you would go AABA.. and so forth until you finish with ZZZZ.   There is also counting with Binary numbers, counting palindromes (same backward/forward) only, evens, odds, counting subreddits. If you can count it- you can make a post which starts the count.    Here is their [current thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3du07m/428k_counting_thread/)    I wouldnt say they are.    /r/counting I didn't see the point of it. But then I started counting, I obtained some GETs and now I am obsessed with counting on their main counter thread.    Tiny jars of vomit being hidden.

What's your secret that could literally ruin your life if it came out?** on /r/AskReddit  His answer  **[]Lynfect 5580 points 3 years ago**  Cousin died when we were both seventeen. There was a reception at his house just after the funeral. I went into his room and stole all the money that was there, took some other valuables that his parents wouldn't realize were gone. No one knows that I did it, they just assumed he didn't have any money in his room, only loose change. I don't regret it, but I will never admit I did it. Also my cum box.  that is his answer                         **and someone...with patience and professional language said in return, "]eeeeevil 3842 points 3 years ago  Elaborate on this cum box, please."**  His answer:    Well, it is exactly what it sounds like. It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.  Because people were asking, my greatest shame.  EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.  EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.  Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. New picture.  I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

In reality, it was miracle whip, mayonnaise, and grape jelly all in a gross mound between two pieces of bread. Then he ate it and his dog licked up everything that felt out of the back end of the sandwich. It was really gross. Also, my friend showed me the cumbox reddit post. That was odd.    Oh well.    The deception isn't in the photo, it's in their language when you talk to them about it.   If you are so worried about being deceived just ask for a photo of their entire body of them standing up, within the last week. Problem solved.

It's the number 1 rule that unfortunately still gets broken. Attraction is different yes, but I always remember that these students are younger, and developmentally not on the same level. Even when I was 22 and I had an 18 year old student. They just looked like students. I never saw them as an attraction.    I never posted FIFA crap. But I am not going to stop playing FIFA 16'.

 Shot of a car cuts to Bond asking Q "Make me disappear"   http://momentumbooks.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/aston_martin_inviz.jpg   I have a two year old and have started watching more kid's TV and movies. I have a strict no crap policy (Lilo and Stitch YES, Lilo and Stitch 2 NO) and am loving watching a generation of movies I missed.  This morning we watched half of Bolt before I dropped her at childcare then I came home and watched the second half by myself.   So what other great kid's movies have I missed?    This is how you make super villians   Fat does not have to equal unhealthy. Moderately obese people live, on average, 3.1 years longer than average weight people. Obese people who are metabolically healthy have no more risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.          **My 5 Questions:**  1. How did you get into the business? 2. Were you ever asked to do anything you didn't feel comfortable doing? 3. How much money did you make? 4. Did you ever feel like you were taking advantage of the men? 5. Why did you leave?     Carrots. I'll eat a kilo of carrots in a couple of days.    Think of all the Fantastic Four cosplay!    I got a response:   ********  OMG what rock did you crawl out from under down under?  Talk to the people who actually work there, those clubs are all the same when you work in them. I mean do some real research at least. Even I've done that much and it's not my subject.  You are only a tourist, WTF would you know unless you worked there.  The clubs you are talking about like in Kings Cross in Sydney are sleazy dirt bags, because the men made them that way. Australian men are insecure around strong women, so they keep them down and call them con artists. You are calling them con artists, because you are ashamed of yourself for not realizing what the club was when you walked in there, so you blame the club and the women.  But it's the women who suffer, because you put them that much further down on the totem pole of hierarchical society.  Australia has been bleeding its most beautiful and intelligent women since year do, because of forever being put down put down put down. You make everything sleazy and disgusting, nobody is allowed any pride in their work, they all have to be desperate. . Also because of idiots like you writing about women being con artists, because they can't get decent paid work in the straight world. And why not, when they get told they are overqualified for a normal job in Australia, or are a con artist for trying to not be on the dole bludging off Australian tax payers or their parents.  Australia's employment and DNA problem is because of idiots like you who have no real world education and put down women who want to do better for themselves without charity.  When visitors come to Australia they see under 21 year olds who can't handle their alcohol in the bars causing fights; really good look for Australia that is. This doesn't happen in California because the age for drinking is 21, when humans are physically and mentally better able to handle substances, and in Europe they simply have better educations.  Overseas, Australian men are an embarrassment. They can't handle their alcohol and they don't know how to act around strong women, or in public.  Write a book about that and you might have an international best seller. There are lot more strong women than men outside of Australia, plus all the Ozzy anything fans, they'd love reading it.  Get out of the gutter, as you really don't know what is there, because you are only a tourist. You are complaining of the same thing you are doing, being a con artist, selling false information.  Write about what you know, which is idiot Australian men.  FYI: My day job is audience development for writers.  Let me know when you are working on that book, I may be interested in helping you.    $100-$200 AUD would be great.   Because I'm recording in odd places, I picked a dynamic one. I'd like to avoid too much BG noise.     I've a bit of gut and so higher waisted jeans suit me better.   I've got a couple from dejour (because I live in the north and have a beard and it is the law).  Any other places with good jeans that are not skinny and low?      It isn't censorship. The book is freely available. It is just wrapped in plastic before sale. Like porn is.    I've been recording with 2 x behringer xm8500s. They're great mics but require the speaker to have a good mic technique.  The recording volume ends up quite a low a lot of the time if the speaker sits back a little or moves their head around.  Any tips? Any recommendations for good microphones?    "now streaming free on crackle"  That's a depressing turn of phrase.   Quvenzhan Wallis   I have neither seen nor heard of any of these!

I gave away a bunch of free tickets last week to the Melbourne Magic Festival but several people missed out.  However, we have the Fast   Loose launch tomorrow night Wednesday which is free and will have magic, circus, comedy and scams.

Then slide the top row of pieces along one.   Every note would be a tiny bit smaller    If less that 5% of the note is missing, the note is worth full value.  I wonder if you could remove 5% of 20 notes and make a new one...   No. It's a con artist pretending to perform miracles.   Fuck you traitor.   :)      When I was a kid, Pizza Hut was the ultimate family restuarant. It was Australia in eighties. They had a promotion for Tom Hank's BIG. I won a big badge saying BIG on it.

I've currently got a moka pot that I use but it's splutters everywhere and is annoying to clean as you have to wait for it to cool, unscrew it, pull out the coffee etc.       What does the different pressure mean practically? How does it affect the taste of the coffee?   I don't have the time and talent for a real machine or the stomach for instant or pods. I was thinking this would be a nice one to get.

I'm that guy that everyone assumes is fun at parties but then isn't fun at parties and sneaks out when no one is watching.               I think I'm ok with that. It is just for a podcast. Most radio stations I've interviewed record down to one track.   Cool. So something like this would be a good option if I wanted to record four microphones for podcasting?  http://peavey.com/products/index.cfm/item/699/116922/PV%26nbsp%3B6%26nbsp%3BUSB#features      Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm talking about.  It has been brought to my attention that not every channel on a mixer will necessarily have a preamp meaning I can't plug a microphone in every channel and get the same output.  How can I tell which channels are suitable for recording from microphones?        Nice. USB powered as well.        Id reccomend you stay away from cheapo presonus and behringer stuff  Learned that the hard way :)   I'll occasionally have a third guest.    Two channels 99% of the time but, occasionally, I'll have a third guest.     Can anyone suggest a good 4 channel mixer for podcasting?  I'd prefer something small with at least 2 XLR and solid preamps.      The Sheriff knew what was going on. He cut the break line in 2014, before he was frozen.

He lives in LA but is coming back for the festival.      I try to slip in various ideas such as 'appeals to authority' and 'confirmation bias'.   I think that is an excellent point. In the placebo section I focus on powerbands, homeopathy etc but perhaps a shift to diet fads would be a good idea.   This is all good stuff. Thank you both for sharing.

I'm revamping The Bad Science Show at the moment would love some impact on what you think are the important issues facing young people in skepticism. It could be a particular issue such as vaccination or more general concept such as the need for empirical study.

Congratulations!    In this thread there are a lot well meaning people saying that if only LGBT people today dressed conservatively or acted with class then they would be taken more seriously.  One of the key elements to the whole Gay Pride movement is for people to be proud of who they ARE. So they dress up in revealing, camp costumes because that is who they are. They express themselves.  Tellng gay people you can't take them seriously if they don't act 'more straight' is kind of messed up.          Bus Pride!   Expecting LGBT folks to change their behaviour and appearance to make them more accessible or palatable to others defeats the purpose of gay pride and tolerance.   Check out the movie Stonewall.    No one should be able to play God.   If you say so.   Possibly. The first one was 8000 and this time round I was under the impression it was more.    Sixteen.

I would suggest seeing a qualified medical professional rather than a hypnotist.   Yes.      She's not claiming that there is an evidence that what she does for a living actually works? Of course she is!  If I sound rude it is because she is setting up shop and making medical claims about something that does not work.     The NSFW tag made me think it was going to end with him killing and eating the fattened up dog.    I have never understood why this is such an important distinction for people.  Regardless of whether homosexuality is a choice or an innate part of a person, it shouldn't matter to anyone but that person.      Do you have any real medical training?  If not, how do you justify calling what you therapy?     Because there is literally no empirical evidence that it works.    Glad this is the top question.   No one likes a narc   Hell!

Yes, Yes and there are variations which still exist today but probably not in the way Wednesday describes it.  About five years ago I shot the Australia series of The Real Hustle and we pull that exact scam in an Australian jewellery shop. There was no bishop involved but the basic scam was the same. I played the cop and had a fake badge designed by the Channel 9 props team even though police in my state don't carry badges.     Bootlegger is not "violent or sorded", Jackson was a student activist who was never prosecuted, Jerry Orbach was friends with Gallo and there is no evidence he was involved in any criminal activity.  Danny Trejo I will give you (although you edited him in later.)  I think you need sleep.     What are you talking about? I can't find any record of those men having 'violent and sordid criminal pasts'. What crimes are you talking about?       Jimmy Stewart was born 50.      Have you read up on him? He's an amazing guy. He used the money from The League to set up a production company that makes micro-budget films like The One I Love and Safety Not Guaranteed.     It really it is.    No, that's about as mainstream as Australian cinema gets.    This song?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZU3-xXIcIo  Is this the song? This one? This one?   urgh.

    I drybrushed white over the gesso, *then* painted it.  And yeah, that site is hella 90s. Funny thing is, I have yet to find a better beginner painting tutorial site.   I am one of those people who paint by priming black, and drybrushing with white.   I've done white with black wash on top, and it has some good and bad things. First of all, the end result ends up looking almost exactly the same. However, you can use washes other than black, and you can get a much brighter miniature, so that's a plus. However, I can never seem to have good luck with white primer. It always ends up chalky, or needs several coats for good coverage, or whatever. Also, you have to work a lot harder to get into the cracks and crevices (basically working hard twice, instead of once). I'm also a fan of the black-lining style of painting, so priming black is kind of a no-brainer.  If you really want, I can try to get some pictures of some from both.  Keep in mind, though, I'm a shit painter, and my goal is tabletop quality, not award winning.   I do this all the time. In fact, I [did it](http://imgur.com/a/TVYeJ) just a few hours ago.  I learned it from [this guy](http://www.how-to-paint-miniatures.com/), which is the first site that came up for learning to paint miniatures in a search for "painting miniatures" in Google when I first started.  edit: oh, and as for why, for one, it allows me to put lighter colors on a black primed mini without as many layers, and two, how the hell can you see where to put the paint when it's all flat black?  edit2: oh, and 3, you can prime and highlight white and you can see the details enough to start using them if you don't have enough time to fully paint them yet.   For the "if everything is weird, nothing is" thing, the two times I ran a "Numenera" setting I did a stock medieval world, and a stock space opera world. This gave a nice baseline so that I can then add in weirder things when I wanted to, but that's not what the players were used to expecting.  For giving the system teeth, 2 of my campaigns I put a hard cap on Tier at Tier 2. Like you said, starting at Tier 3 players just get ridiculous.   Another time the set weapon damage in the book was only for "improvised" weapons. Actual manufactured weapons did much more damage (usually in line with a lot of the weapon-like artifacts).   I've done conversions of other systems to something akin to the Cypher system where I only had two pools instead of three, and in one, I had only one pool of 5 points. That's basically a whole different game though.   So, /r/shauni55 asked, and I had planned on testing this out anyway, so I got them out and got to work.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/TVYeJ) is what I found out.  I primed them with black gesso, which worked great. I scratched at it and it didn't flake off, and it completely dried without being tacky. Spray primer would probably be completely different though. You might get by using paint without primer, but it'd be kind of iffy. The plastic was just a bit reluctant to take to the gesso at first, and paint might not hold to it.  After priming it painted just like any other mini, though the detail isn't fantastic on some of them. The Razor Boars seemed pretty good, though I don't have metal ones to compare them to. The Brigands were definitely inferior to the metal versions, but not so bad as to look horrible from afar.  After the paint dried, I bent and twisted the minis some, and the paint held to it. It probably wouldn't hurt to put a sealer on though (I'll try that after I fully paint them).  Let me know if you have any questions, I probably forgot to mention something.   Okay, I'm sold. When and where can I buy it?  The artwork is very nice; it's right on the edge of what I consider to be not too "animated" looking.    I fully plan to use this as a gateway drug to get boardgamers/children into RPGs.   Because Skorne are hideous and Trolls are beautiful, so it gives a nice contrast.   I have that StarCraft box set, and I bring it with me whenever I go gaming just in case someone wants to play it (they never have). It's a very convenient size for something you're never going to use.   Yeah, they reduced character creation from 10 hours to about 3 hours. I don't think I could run it without pre-mades without the Transhuman book.   Well, he didn't say complex. He said cluttered and impractical, which is exactly how I'd describe the WH games (I've played about half of them).  It's not complex at all. Percentile systems are pretty much the opposite of complex.    Rogue Trader might win this one just for its tables alone.   Eclipse Phase could possibly win for it's character creation, though.  Honestly I love them both. I've also tried converting both, and failed, because you can't really reduce them down without losing a lot of what makes them special. Best thing I've found is printing off quick reference guides to help out.  Any game worse than those I usually just read, and then never run because I can see how ridiculous they are. Then I steal the setting and use different rules.   Are they even from the same faction?  You won't really be using them both at the same time (at least until you play ridiculously huge games). However, when you have more than one caster from the same faction, you can swap them out, and the difference in their spells and abilities change the way your army plays.    It gives it depth. It gives the world you are playing in structure that makes it, not only believable, but *tangible*. The more rules a system has the more ways you have to interact with that world.   I play Iron Kingdoms a lot, and it's one of the crunchier systems out there. When I sit there and micromanage my gold to be able to keep my steamjack fueled makes me feel like I'm really taking part in an economy.   Fate is about taking part in a **story**, crunchier games are about taking part in a **world**.   I've used it almost from the moment it was released. I've run 2 full several year long campaigns, and countless one shots.  It's definitely a nice piece of software, and I've tried a lot of the other virtual tabletops, and none really do as well. It's very reliable, and has every feature that I really would want to use for a vtt.   The only thing, is it's online, and if you are dealing with online people, they are usually pretty flaky. When I use it to play with friends, it's great, but I haven't managed to keep a group of strangers together for very long. This is not the software's fault, though.    Yeah, uh, considering the alternative is just dead-dead, I'd say you're being pretty easy on him. If he doesn't like it, he can stay dead.  If he rolls up a new character, make sure it's a lvl 1 character, too.    Smallest points based size games are generally 15 points (smaller than that is "battlebox" games, which is just a warnoun and their beasts/jacks). Most tournaments are in the 35-50 range. I've been playing for years and I've never actually played a 75pt game (though now that I say that, I really think I want to).   After you start to get a grasp on the rules, start doing scenario games. The game is really designed around having scenarios, and terrain, and without it it can get stale pretty quick.   Prepare to lose. You might do fine, especially with not being new to wargames, but you get better at WM/H the more you know. You can even do better in games with an inferior army if you are more familiar with it.  I'd say "start small", but I don't know much about that. I had 75pts  in two different factions before I played my first game.    The core mechanic is this:  The GM decides how difficult something is, on a scale of 1 to 10. That's its difficulty. The players then tell you their skills and abilities that might make the task easier, reducing the difficulty. The final difficulty is multiplied by 3, and that's the target number. The player rolls a d20, and if they meet or exceed the target number, they succeed at their task.   Example: John wants to jump across a wide gap in the floor. I decide that it's pretty far, and give it a difficulty of 5. John is trained in jumping tasks because he's an athletic sort of guy, so that reduces the difficulty to 4. He's also going to spend effort (effort is basically burning HP to push yourself), so that brings the task difficulty to 3. Lastly, he says he's going to get a running start, which I decide is an asset and that makes the final difficulty to 2. The target number is 6, so if John rolls a 6 or higher, he makes it across.   Another fun part of the system is GM intrusions, which are basically the GM paying the players XP so that he can screw with them.   In the above example, I could offer John an XP to have him make it across, but he stumbles a bit and knocks some boards loose, making it harder for the next person to cross. If a player rolls a 1 on the die, you get to use an intrusion on them for free.  Another thing, Monte Cook has a raging hard-on for how awesome cyphers are in the game (they are single use magic items, like a potion or scroll). He even named the system after them. It's not that exciting to me (single use magic items have been a thing for a long time, Monte), and they don't really feature into my games very often. They are not the selling point of the game. You could rip out those pages and I'd still buy the book.   Also, a lot of people get all nerd ragey any time you talk about running a Cypher system game that doesn't use the settings that come with them (Numenera or The Strange). I don't get that. This system is able to run almost any setting imaginable really well. The new Cypher system book coming out should get people to see that (I hope).   One of the most competitive lists for a while had 3 full units of Gatormen Posse. That probably doesn't seem strange coming from 40k (especially orks), but it's pretty unusual for WM/H. Thing is, it's already getting better (Croak Raiders just came out, and I hear they are awesome). It's both a newer faction, and a faction meant to be able to combine with other factions, so it has less variety. The problem with not having variety is that it's harder to have answers to lots of different lists (WM/H is kinda rock/paper/scissor-y, and if all you have are rocks, paper armies are going to be a problem for you). Again though, they are getting new models all the time, and a lot of the models they have are really solid (Gatormen Posse are probably the best heavy infantry in the game).   If you are serious about running minions competitively, I would check out the [Privateer Press forums](http://privateerpressforums.com/forumdisplay.php?74-Minions-List-Discussion) and read through the discussions on there.    If you are interested in minions, play minions.   Mercs/Minions are both a little on the weak side, but not really. It's more that they have fewer strong options.  Mercs could be a little easier to play, but only if you are buying one of the colossals.   Warmachine and Hordes are the same game, don't let anyone fool you. The only differences are in how Warlocks/Warbeasts work in comparison to Warcasters/Warjacks (a decent difference, but not enough to make one harder than the other).  But yeah, if you like minions play minions. If you want more options but still want to use your minions, do like lolredditor said and get some Skorne to go with them.   I highly recommend the Cypher system of Numenera or The Strange.   The rules are simple... for the GM. Honestly, I was playing a variation of the Cypher system before it came out, the Cypher system just gives my players more shit to read through.   Cypher System: because I am a lazy fuck.  Seriously. Someone could show up at my house early in the morning saying, "We're here to game, all day," and I would be able to crawl out of bed and start running a Cypher system game immediately, with 0 prep, and would be able to run it for days, if necessary, with 0 prep and without having to crack open a book once, all while letting the players have the pleasure of a moderately crunchy, narrative focused game with balanced encounters. It has plenty of fun content for the players, and everything for the GM is just helpful pointers for newbs.  edit: also, it has great rules for miniatures without using a grid (grids, of course, being an abomination)   Are you, uh, asking for a "friend"? *wink*   Sadly, I think it qualifies. Though it has been picking up in popularity since Unleashed came out.   You seem like you need a little [IKRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery) in your life.   I always laugh when people talk about poor bones quality, and then pick up one of my painted minis that they thought was metal and are surprised to find out it was a bones figure.   [Get 5e.](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)   The classes and abilities are extremely rigid, and it makes using them in a variety of situations difficult. It gets very hard to break from the "I use [Insert Ability Name Here]." over and over style of play. It requires zero creativity, but also allows zero creativity. It is very heavily invested in making the abilities "balanced", and allowing someone to use an ability creativity breaks this balance, and makes other player's ability choices (which is the focus of the game) unimportant.   Those are pretty amazing.   I'm still trying to get the balls enough to try LARP, but I admire the people who can do it. Maybe I'll start by trying a few photos of tabletop characters first.   You would have done a lot better if you had gear. Paladins are meant to have armor, and barbarians are meant to be fine without it, which means the situation was stacked in their favor. That's just one obvious way that the situation wasn't a good measure. The other is it is a cooperative game. How the classes interact with one another as a team is considerably different than how they do 1 vs 1. For one thing, paladins are spellcasters, and healers, which dramatically changes their role from a barbarian, which you seem to think is identical.   Arenas in rpgs are pretty dumb most of the time, and 9 times out of 10 it means the GM doesn't give two shits.   D D, and really, most roleplaying games, are built for cooperative play.   If you are looking to be competitive, I highly recommend something like Warmachine or Deadzone.   The first question is dependent on the second. Technically, it's not really "in print", since it was a limited run. If you can only find it for $300 or something, it's not really worth it. If you can get it at MSRP or lower, it's a good deal.    I've never been burnt out on roleplaying. Burnt out on a certain system, or a certain group, or burnt out on running games for ungrateful little shits maybe, but never burnt out on the whole thing.   In fact, my favorite kind of campaigns are the ones that last years. My longest campaign ran 6 years, and they barely scratched the surface of the campaign world.   I don't do 1 on 1. I don't know, I just don't think it really works well for me, with maybe the exception of personal side quests. If it's me and one other person, I'd rather just play a wargame.   I don't think anyone actually read your post, mate.  Here's some of mine:  [Never Split the Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waa2ucfgVgQ)  [Critical Hit Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA0erM_B3CA)   You didn't specify a price limit, so [here](http://www.miniaturemarket.com/mgma51-1.html?___store=mmonline ___store=mmonline utm_source=GoogleShopping gclid=Cj0KEQjwz6KtBRDwgq-LsKjMk9kBEiQAuaxWUqjfK3XOWqfWXhwk1ir8ojvKdemkl-06P7pcpab3UdAaAj1g8P8HAQ). You can't tell from the picture, but it has a grid. 3 inch squares, though. You could buy 3 of them for 60 bucks and that would be a helluva nice road. They are made out of a mouse pad-like material, and are super durable.  You might also want to check out the scenery packs they have for that game, as they are pretty good for post-apocalypse.    There is no colossal that is a must take in every list  Tell that to the Mercs players.   What can I say? We're just a bunch of grognards who won't give up the old traditions.   All of them. Every single one. There's no such thing as an original idea.   You probably don't want to believe me, but go ahead and post your ideas here, and just from the sample of people who read your post you will probably get dozens with the same idea.  Good News: Ideas aren't what people buy. Execution of ideas is what people want. The blood, sweat, tears, and expertise put into a thing is what will make people enjoy what you have to offer. If you don't have any of those things in your thing yet, keep working on it till you do.  Also, it's not a problem to have more than one of a thing. Don't try to "fill a void in the market" or whatever bullshit assholes from 50 years ago will tell you. This is the 21st century, there are no holes in the market. Just do what you love, and if you want to share it with other people, do.   Male, GM, and I can't really tell the difference when gaming (if by "gaming groups" you mean sex, then I prefer just women). Gender isn't usually an issue when gaming, though my groups don't put our genitalia on the table, so YMMV.   If you are going to run your world, run your world. Just give them a rundown of what is and isn't available, that way they can start working on characters that do fit.  If you are interested in including the players in world construction, you can maybe take a look at [Fate Core](http://fate-srd.com/fate-core/game-creation)'s Game Creation as an example of a system that is intended to include players in world construction.   If you really want to go all out, I've had a lot of fun using [Microscope RPG](http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/) with my players to create the setting, and then running a game in it using another system (usually the Cypher System, but you can use whatever floats your boat).   Unless by "torment", you mean not letting her out her cage to eat, you really have no fuggin clue what evil means.   Four? Lucky bastard. That's about 6 less than me.   They sort of have two ways to reproduce. They reproduce the fun way, which produces babies, and they raise them to be full fledged whatever they are. All true trolls (Trollkin are somewhat like "half-trolls"), can also "reproduce" when a piece of them gets cut off. This is more to do with the rampant regeneration than it does with reproducing. These are not really full fledged creatures that reproduce on their own, and are more like a foot that grew it's own brain (and arms and legs and whatnot). These are the whelps, and they are less like children, and more like pets. And really, that's only for people who eat their pets.   There are (in order of size, from smallest to largest): Whelps, Pygs/Pygmy Trolls, Trollkin, Trolls, Dire Trolls, Mountain Trolls?  While all are technically related, they aren't really one race that breeds together.   I hope that confused things a bit for you.

                      I think the iPhone isn't an iPhone without the home button. But it's becoming a barrier to the iPhone's design. The top and bottom bezels are too big in my opinion and that's due to the home button. Look at the LG G3 or G4 for instance. They have small bezels and the bigger screen doesn't seem as big...                        Apple didn't invent the shape. The article says the future of tablets is 4:3 instead of 16:9                              you're right. Another thing is, the home button cannot have the metal ring "inside" the screen. Am I right ?   I use safari with 3 tabs max and it's usable. Sure it's slow compared to the iPhone but it's from 2012. It's a usable iPad for reading magazines, books and web                  It's nice to have a device with 5 years and to be used daily. I have an iPad 3 and it lags a bit with iOS8 in safari, but it's usable for everyday tasks. I use it everyday            iOS 7 in the 4 was rubbish, way to laggy. In the 4s it was also laggy. iOS 9 in the 4s is smooth      yes   In short: It's really good.

 ... but they won't, because they don't actually want to do it anymore.   I don't call a $1,000,000 fee to be able to drive a "legal" cab part of the free market.

They do have background checks, which might need to be revamped. They require insurance for their drivers, they just don't pay it themselves. And if you get caught doing anything like you mentioned, they take you off the system. Basically, you're fired... and arrested. If that isn't accountability...  Maybe they need to be inspected like Yellow Cabs are. Maybe they need to revamp their system on hiring. I don't know, but don't tell me that they are less safe than cabs.   A little bit, yeah. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't let that dick fuck that asshole, De Blasio.   I know. But it helps raise awareness to the problem in NYC.   He's also a major investor in the ride-sharing company.

[Not the worst sports related bird death](https://youtu.be/foLo3Z11RGk)  Trigger warning: Shitty YouTube editor   [You're doomed!](http://replygif.net/i/120.gif)   These kind of people would never have let her bring a gun on the set.  First, the recruiter would cut off contact if the prospect seemed too confident or willful.  Second, they ingratiate themselves with the prospect, lulling them into a false sense of security.  Third, they fly you out there and pick you up from the airport for a short trip, telling you that you don't need a lot of extra clothes. This way, they know you aren't carrying a weapon on the flight, and they have control of your luggage after it.  Finally, they will probably have you leave your purse in the hotel, claiming that they don't wish it to be stolen, leaving you with no personal belongings at all, and no money when the inevitable realization occurs that they aren't having you model, they are filming you being raped.     Not to mention rape.  I don't throw that out too lightly, but they lied to her, held her against her will, bullied her, and forced her to have sex.   Okay, first you would need to convince your lawyer that you should be given maternity leave, which is intended for bonding with your child and recuperating after the delivery, for the purpose of adopting a puppy.  Most employers are willing to give maternity over adopting a human child, but adopting a puppy? Get the adoption done on Friday afternoon, and you have all weekend to bond with the animal.  But, I almost want to see a case like this go to trial, just so a judge can tell these damned "pet parents" that their "baby" is not the same as a baby.   He seemed like it on the show. I just thought people would like the controversy.   We'll know in 5 minutes.

Honestly, the less bloatware, the better.  Since I don't use Skype, I won't miss it not being built in, and if I want to get it, I can download it.   It's all porn, isn't it?

Judging is what we do best!   There are a lot of black people that are proud of being from the South, and that includes wearing the Confederate flag.  It might be misplaced, but who are we to judge, right?   I actually first saw this guy on the Reparations episode of Penn and Teller's Bullshit.  He dresses this way to try and get reparations from the US Government for treatment of the South after the Civil War.   To put it most simply, Marvel uses a Multiverse, where any character can technically cross over into another (Japanese Spider-Man and his giant robot, Leopardon, in the comic series Spider-Men).  DC uses an Omniverse. The Comics, Animated Series, Movies, Series and the new CW shows each have their own Multiverse, where the other groups don't even exist. Dean Cain Superman will never show up with Smallville's Lana. But within those multiverses, there are dimensional rifts, pocket universes, and split timelines that can be crossed into, like in Crisis events.      I didn't molest you as a child because it's wrong!   For photos, yes. You want a picture of a single person, or a small group, or a tall building, then you use Portrait orientation.  For wide groups, vistas, and any situation where the camera is panning left to right at all, you Landscape that bitch.   Except for the god damned vertical holding...   Not racist.  The name is funny to say.   No, that is just the image they used for the fact.   George was recast for Parts II   III, with the new actor in makeup and using camera tricks to fool the audience into believing that Crispin was involved in the movie.  Technically, they would have been okay with the newspaper clipping alone, as long as they paid the "stock footage" fee to Crispin.  But creating a lookalike, as opposed to simply finding a new actor with visual similarity, created a false impression of the acceptance of the original actor.  The irony of all this is that Crispin left the show because he wanted more money, but he was originally angry at the idea that George's success meant that he was wealthy now.   It's not really the same, but she isn't too far different from "fit and happy" Lorraine.   Sounds a lot like sticking your dick in crazy.   Mex$ is simply an acceptable alternative if there is confusion between Mexican Pesos and US Dollars, or another currency that uses the $ symbol.   I'm sorry, but if I have to pay to use the restroom, then I expect at least a seat on the bucket.   And what I said was that I favored the Ice magic because it gave a high refresh effect. If I had stuck with THM longer, I probably would have naturally changed my playstyle as I gained new skills anyway.   A good point. I probably wouldn't be a good venue for buying online, but I could be able to sell locally rather easily.   Actually, I did change. They brought in Arcanist, and I went with that class as my main.  But, you are wrong on one thing. Final Fantasy XIV is a game. You play the game how *you* want to play, not how others want you to play.  The "there is a right way to play, and every other way is wrong" mentality was part of what poisons a community. Not everyone who plays a job is going to be worried about "mathematical optimability".   If you don't think I use Fire *enough*, then maybe it's just that you have a stick in your ass, but I'll grant you that if I don't use Fire *at all*, then I may be hindering a party too much.  But it is when people act in an unexpected manner that they can become surprising.   I'd like to say it's an original, but apparently there is a dating site blog (one2one) that used it before me.   Who needs charm when you have money?    I have both Lunar games on PSX   Now I'm heading it in his voice   It's stopped happening as much, because SE started giving a bonus to parties that include a first time player.   Eh, first I'd need a desire to really focus on Black Mage. I'm having too much fun with Scholar.  I love how people start down voting because I played with a job class "wrong"   We could always ask her.    That is a fair point. I wouldn't want to try and make it my sole income in any case, just an addition to existing stock, both as completed pieces and selling supplies to others.   When I play THM (I haven't unlocked BLM yet), I'll favor ice magic because of the massive Refresh effect, but I'll still switch auras to Fire and burn through my MP if need be.   But what about you, who ran through Aurum Vale, only to be kicked out just before the final boss fight (that you needed for your Zodiac Weapon), and now you can't even get a chance at skipping to the last fight, because the in progress bar is blanked out    That's what pissed me off about low level play.  I'd be running through an easy dungeon, but everyone drops because it showed the "one or more players is new message". It isn't hard to guess that the new player is the one watching the cutscene and getting into the story.  Worse than that are the trolls, who come in as a tank, purposefully aggro the entire dungeon like Leroy Jenkins, then drop out before the 15 minutes required to vote to leave without penalty.   Unless you get stuck in a cycle of being grouped with and kicked from parties with one Free Company that hates you for some reason.  Or if there is a guy that simply randomly kicks people out for no reason whatsoever, increasing the chances that you meet the same person...   Well, damn... That sounds like half of the interrogations on Law and Order.   Hell, I'll take Celine Dion over Kanye West.  Less of an ego.   Not Raiders. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  Page 2 has EXT - MILITARY BASE - DAY  Page 3 has EXT - AREA 51 - DAY   I would still venture to say that the generic, medical text laden, Harlequin novels are better porn that most fanfics.   Well, it might not have been on the very first page, but Indiana Jones uses the driving scene for credits and time wasting before the exterior shot of the secret government warehouse that the Ark and the Crystal Skull are housed.   Woosh   Shower sex is probably not the best place for acrobatics.   Would you rather sound like you're from Wisconson?  Oh, crap. Oh crap. Oh crap!   And Q - the omnipotent entity from Star Trek: The Next Generation   I never would have guessed you were a guy. Thank you for the warning.   Circumstances, dude.  There is a difference between Batman and Spider-Man.  Yes, both watched their loved one die at the hands of a criminal and that caused them to become a costumed crime-fighter.  But Batman was a boy, watched his parents (wealthy philanthropists) die during a robbery after leaving a play or movie. Spider-Man was a mostly grown boy (teen to young adult depending on the writer), already with superpowers, whose uncle (not particularly wealthy at all) was shot by a criminal that he had the power to stop.  While it has a similarity, it is not the same origin story.   Just remember that not all video game movies are bad... just most of them.  Final Fantasy: Advent Children was great. The Spirits Within... not so much.  The first Resident Evil movie was enjoyable, as was the first Mortal Kombat.  Were they Oscar-worthy? No. But they weren't terrible.  And even some of the terrible ones are good watching, like the JCVD/Raul Julia Street Fighter.   Cosby want staying in the hotel, right?    But then the Christians get to sent their own champion back, and they end up fighting, only to have your Terminator be crushed in a steam press   Not all of it.   Case in point... Artemis's Lover  A fanfiction so bad that I'm going to link to the [MST version](http://www.nabiki.com/mst/megane67/mst/oscarfic/al67.html).  A self-insertion fanfic about a hermaphrodite teenager who gets into a homosexual relationship with a talking housecat.   With him running for president, it was only a matter of time for the shows to go off air.  They'd be forced to give equal time to like 13 other candidates.   3 shoes off means he really fucked up.   And *that* is the danger. The complacency that comes about from understanding that someone will help, and assuming it doesn't have to be yourself.    We all make mistakes.   Who starts their run directly at a wall they have to climb over? Outside of people running an obstacle course, which aren't part of this discussion.  If you happen to be standing right at a wall with a conveniently placed  ladder, then yeah... go ahead and climb over. But in a real world scenario, you will be meeting the wall in the middle of your run.  The average person will do as I suggested, and head for the clearest gap in the wall, like a gate. A parkour expert *should* consider how high the wall is and whether it is easier to go to the gate or not.  Up to the 43 yard line, 7 yards away from the wall, it is still more efficient to run to the gate than it is to climb over it.    Anything aerial is considered extremely inefficient  That is my understanding of the matter. I'm not saying they are wrong to do it, especially if it isn't hurting anyone, but it isn't efficient.   It isn't the fastest or easiest in many cases. It's just the least complicated (less turning involved.)  http://reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/3dt4cl/parkour_wcgw/ct8v01u  Here is a breakdown of the wall example to show how simply running for the gate is more efficient than trying to climb over the fence.   http://reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/3dt4cl/parkour_wcgw/ct8v01u  This is why it is not as efficient.   Well, conserving the comparison, if it is a 10 yard run to the gap in the wall, it would be a 5 yard tall wall... 15 feet.  If I were going for peak efficiency of running toward such a wall, I would head directly for the gate, instead of hitting the wall directly and climbing over.  As for the spacial efficiency, if you are running a total distance of 100 yards with that fence at the 50 yard line, and the gate 10 yards away from your path...  The direct, line of sight path climbing over the wall is a total of 110 yards.  Running to the gate and through the fence is 101.98 yards.   If you are worried about financial risks of accepting checks, you can always use bitcoin for the sale.  Because it can't be charged back or falsified, you only risk problems with the currency failing.    Well, by the simple rules of statistics, the more people that see a request, the more likely *someone* will help out.   It's the same reason car dealerships constantly send out junk ads. Because they *know* someone will get it that needs a car. If they didn't advertise, they would have gotten less prospective buyers.  That's what the stupid "like this to have God cure Timmy's nut cancer" posts do is hopefully get some people to donate money for cancer treatment.   And you can't even get Tyson's name right?   Any info as to why this post has disappeared from the indexes?    That sounds about right.  The only thing missing from the explanation is the details on the details.  He hacked into a website and obtained names, addresses, and phone numbers of women who had an abortion, and was releasing those details publically.  Imagine if you were a rape victim, and you abort the product of that rape only to be hounded by anti-abortion picketers who call for you, a victim, to be assaulted or executed because you couldn't stand to keep the child.  This guy is absolute human garbage.    Even if they don't agree with abortion. Even if they don't agree with your reasons for getting on...  They have no right to plaster your name and number in public because you got one.   He is why it is so hard to have a successful campaign.    Actually, no. The 10 feet around the wall is action perpendicular to gravity. The 5 feet up the wall is against gravity.  You will expend more energy climbing over or vaulting the wall as opposed to running around it. Obviously, it's still more worth it to hop over a 2 foot fence, but climbing onto a 40 or 80 foot building? Just go around.    I fail to see how climbing and jumping off of buildings is "more efficient" than just going around the building.   Answer: you can only get one discount.  AAA or this special rate I pulled out of my ass.   They know two things.  First, that Priceline and other third party reservation systems take out a huge commission on the rooms, so you ask for $150, he gets it for $125, but the hotel only receives  $100. If you match the rate he was offered, you'll gain $25...  The other thing they know is that these sites are notorious for screwing up reservations.  So, they offer to book directly if you match the rate, and supposedly everyone wins.  As for asking if you have rooms available, they just want you to confirm that there is a room, and that the price they are seeing is better than what was offered. If you and the TPS are the same price, he'll just book with you directly since there is no price matching involved.   To be fair here, you told him he wouldn't get a discount if he refused breakfast, so why shouldn't he eat breakfast after all?   Worf.   [](/hnng) It's an overload of cuteness.

Some people just like the challenge of changing the character around. Some people want to dress as the character, and don't care about the implications. Some people do it for shock value.   China, Soviet Russia.   Hmm....  What if it's a FTM transgender?  That would be the Ultimate Crossplay   I would have simply told him he was free to cancel the room without charge.   It isn't just a pun.  That was one of Bender's wrestling personas in the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.   Such violence! I love it    He is such a troll, man.   [There is clearly only one answer.](https://youtu.be/0s9-qP7_Q1E)   I hope they make a ton of jokes about that.  Give him a leather jacket with chains and spikes one episode, have him meet a guy named Blaze, that kind of thing. Really relish the similarity.   The sad part is the fact that the fedora, as worn by Indiana Jones or 1930s gangsters isn't the same as the Trilby worn by pathetic neckbeards.  Edit - moved comment off of top of the thread.   Okay, it is possible that T-2 Skynet was able to deduce that it had sent a Terminator into the past, including the appropriate model as it would have had records from the original chip.  So T0 (premovie) Skynet is independently developed, identifies the resistance leader, sends a T-800 back in time.  T1 Skynet (Skynet as a result of the events of Terminator 1) sees that a Terminator was already sent and that it was used to help build itself, and sends a T-800 back to the original point to ensure its existence, then sends a T-1000 to try and kill John.   And this is why I don't understand high fashion.   HDM made the list because of seeming confusion in the names of the panserbjrne, though for a proud and ancient race that prizes families and history, it isn't uncommon to have similar names pop up like that.  However, that concept is foreign to modern humans, so it sounds weird to us.   Every single day people walk into the sliding door at my hotel. Hard enough that they knock it off track (it's the type that can be pushed outward to open in case of emergency)   Leroy Jethro Gibbs. The most redneck name in the universe, but he is such a badass.   I'm gonna just start Jaqen it in San Diego.    You shut your mouth, Zedd was awesome.  But yeah, the name was kind of out there.   Remember that Harry Potter was written as a children's book. So some of that is forgivable.    And a rather famous modern actor.   Depending on ethnicity, that isn't terrible.   [Get out! I have to take a Count Dooku!](http://www.galacticbinder.com/images/VentureBrothers/henchmen-count-dooku.jpg)   Harry and Hermione are fine because any confusion is dispelled by the fact that one of them is more common than the other.   Just panserbjrne things...   You know what. I can forgive that... But Reneesme?  It's like someone diarrhea'd on a page.   Was he a captain?

K'lisa = kuh-li-sa not kli-sa   But Star Wars was already Fantasy Star Wars.

They pay his paycheck. I'd he badmouths them, he loses money.    Oh, no. I could. But I'd have to give a fuck to do so.    He doesn't need it to crossreference. He knows that it works, so he knows at some level that the translation is correct.  He just doesn't care about French, so he doesn't bother to actually learn it.   Or worse actors   For the purpose of the writing, I would refer to an "anti-humanitarian" as "self-interested" or "practical"  It isn't that he doesn't wish to give money to hobos, it is that he thinks of his own needs.   Anthem is very good, even if you don't like Objectivism.  But my understanding of Objectivism is that Rand wasn't complete in her own philosophy. She was poisoned by a burning hatred of Socialism and Communism, and couldn't see where rational self-interest includes advancing of the interests of others.  You must be willing to help others, but put your own life jacket on before helping your neighbor.   For a neutral or positive view of egotism, Objectivism is not a bad way to describe it.  The goal of objectivism is rational self-interest, which many believe to include helping others in order to help oneself.  It is less sinister than pure egotism, but less empathetic than humanitarianism.   All men cellularly regenerate.   Think of it like the difference between "good for you!" (In congratulation for an achievement) and "good for you" (because I could care less)   Can confirm... "calm down" calms nobody down.  	136
 Thanks you! I hope it helps.   Great question.  We have found that people overwhelmingly prefer a good photo with a short review to a long written review.  Foodworthy gives a real-time view of the food people are eating in your area (assuming there is enough people in your area). With every photo that is shared through the app, you can include a short review and a ranking. Every photo links to a specialized restaurant page, showcasing what others have eaten at that restaurant. You can also find location specific information including directions, hours, dietary options and more.   Thank you. Finding food I want to eat has been one of the most challenging things, hopefully this will solve that problem   Thank you for your support! I hope you enjoy it!  	4

                   Most Bluths have a flaw. While Michael is presented as a straight man among his family, does he have a flaw like the rest?  As a bonus, what about George Michael?   We don't get to hear the character's voice or see their expressions when reading a book. What's the best example of when a novel was able to show the tone in the dialogue between characters?   What non-mundane setting in a novel was best-built and best-utilized? By non-mundane, I mean no schools and no offices.   "In case they have ribs."   "The same thing happened to me!"   If I like Arrested Development, what else will I like?         Any series you feel that perfectly introduced its main and supporting characters from the first episode?

 I looked at the Robot class before making my comment, because I prefer the stuff I tell people to be the truth, so I made sure. Hence the link. None of its methods are suitable for what you say can be done with the Robot class.  Assuming that you are not lying: You must see how improbable it is for any programmer to implement what you said via these methods. But instead of actually giving the people here information, you just toss claims around in short words as to sound cool-ish, add your signature, and that's it. Hence my suggestion that you should just leave this place. Now you replied in a way that completely fits that pattern *again*.  Will you now offer an explanation, as you *should* if you comment here, or what will it be?   Ok, didn't know that. But can you support your claim that Java has the same problem?    I reject that assertion. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to think about.  Ok, the result of my exercise: You're taking your novelty account too far and should hence take it off of this subreddit.   Was this on the official Sun JVM? Personally, I didn't notice GC lag on mature Java games (e.g. Minecraft) on Windows (standard JRE).   All of reality has a different shape for the length contracted (and time dilated) object, so it isn't actually compressed. The object is at rest (if it's not accelerating). It is only contracted in comparison to other reference frames.  The contraction/dilation is not one aspect that is different for the object, it's rather symptomatic for *all* of its reality.   Russell Glasser of the Atheist Experience suggested this approach for checking if some of your peers are secretly atheist, or for how dangerous coming-out could be:  At some opportune point, make a dismissive statement about a very extreme religious point of view or extreme practice, one that most moderates would agree is BS. Look at the reactions. If things look good, try again (Possibly not right away.) with less extreme stuff, and so forth.  Side-note:  DO NOT come out if you're dependent, that's the rule of thumb. It can go over well, but too often we see adolescents in the various atheism subreddits say that their parents grounded them and much worse stuff. Also don't underestimate how information can travel - don't tell your siblings or friends, your parents will probably get a whiff eventually. Obviously, don't put it on Facebook etc.  It's not a hard rule, but it should be adhered to in case of doubt. Just think about what you have to lose vs what you have to win by coming out.   What's so hard? You do not want to do this, so don't do it. How do you do something that you don't want to do? We're not talking about a chemical addition like nicotine. However you solve the specific problem at hand: I think you have a general "impurity of will" problem. Basically, everybody has this problem, but the scales vary, and yours seems to be significant. In case it's really not yet clear that I mean by "purity of will": If you want to do X and not Y, you would do X and not Y if your will were pure. The more impure your will is, the more what you actually do will diverge from what you kind of wanted to do.  But ok. You don't want to fall into this trap. How about you lay down a strict rule for yourself not to use a webbrowser while playing a game? Or maybe you need some replay-therapy: Play a game you played before, but be sloppy about it. A shooter like Half-Life 2 would do the trick nicely, because this one basically drowns you in health kits etc.  Some games require min-maxing, but you should try to learn that the people who make the games for us to enjoy often choose to not be so strict: They don't require us to use every resource to get through the experience. Or maybe they do - if you choose to play "hard mode". Always choose normal difficulty, except if you have good reason not to, but usually you won't have that reason.  Maybe part of the min-maxing reason is that you try to milk the most out of games, and since they often offer very little interaction, you try to make the most out of the few kinds of interactions you have - e.g. you try to pick up every last object / medkit.  Part of the problem might also be your diet. Do you happen to ingest soft drinks with sugar and caffeine and also sugary "food"? That could lead you to become systematic instead of following your natural flow.   It looks even a lot nicer with a lambda:      public static void main(String[] args){         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(ClassName::new);  This is how I usually begin my Swing programs. I put this main method at the *very* top of the Main (here: ClassName) class, so that this is out of the way and all subsequent stuff is on the AWT event dispatcher thread.  Java 8 brought a few things besides Lambdas, for example *method references*. Extremely useful. E.g. think about the method Runnable uses: The run method - no parameters. You can just take *any* method that also doesn't have any parameters and use it in a call that would usually require a Runnable interface, e.g. in the constructor of Thread: `new Thread(myClassOrClassInstance::someMethod);`  But this isn't Runnable-specific, and the method doesn't have to have no parameters - it just has to have the same profile as the method expected in whatever place you're using this.   If you're only dealing with H:M:S and not days/months etc., you can just store time frames via amount of seconds and do all math in this way. All you need in addition is methods to convert from this to readable time and vice versa. But you could also use the math functions of the various built-in date/time classes.   Probably super-cooled Helium or something like that. A super-fluid has zero viscosity. (Still has surface tension, though.)   I would make only one Scanner(System.in) and make it static and public, as long as the respective application only/primarily uses one thread. Several reasons: You wouldn't open the same file twice for reading just because another class wants to read, too (assuming that the position both readers use is the same, or the analogy doesn't work). And *closing* a Scanner(System.in) also closes System.in for good - you can't open it again afterwards (except with considerable effort), so even if you have 10 such Scanners, in a way you still only have one, so why not just use one from the get-go? It's also less code. Java is bloated enough as it is.  Speaking of bloated: I almost never see anyone use the `final` keyword even though it's very useful. I make all my variables, even in method heads, final. I've never stumbled over accidents like "Oops, assigned the empty class variable to the constructor parameter instead of the other way round.", because the compiler wouldn't let me. Making everything final of course makes you spam that keyword all over the place, which is I guess why people don't do it and why IDEs almost not at all help here. I wish there was a compiler flag that would allow to invert the situation: Instead of "final" to lock stuff down, I'd rather use "var" to make stuff variable. But alas ... - Well, I suggest to make all variables (incl. in method heads) final, as far as possible. It prevents bugs, it *expresses intention* (Very important. You'll learn to appreciate this aspect of coding a lot.), it gives you confidence because your code is less like leaves in the wind.  Making the Scanner(System.in) static and public opens it up for accidentally being overwritten (not that this is a likely event), so making it final in addition is a great usage example of that keyword.  You should try to keep your methods small, especially the `main` method. Part of the reason is again to express intention. What does your program do? If your `main` would call "gameLoop()" right away, this would say: 1) This is a game. It runs as a loop like most games. Let's get to it. 2) The variables defined in the gameLoop() method are required locally. Currently, the variables declared (in the main method, where your game loop currently is) could be for any other use.  This would also suggest *to you* a structure akin to "initialize, run, shutdown": You might have to do some clean-up at the end (e.g. close the Scanner - technically not necessary, but it should be done because cleanliness; then do System.exit(0) which is often not necessary but should absolutely be done regardless). You *could* of course just write this stuff right underneath your current code, but if you intend to encapsulate tasks (Make small methods etc.), you *do* realize that this would be part of the "shutdown" stuff, not part of the "gameloop". It should also give you a neat feeling of tidiness, of having things under control. Justified confidence is important in programming. It enables you to go further with your mind.  You should realize: Just like int, double, String etc., classes you define are just *types*. You are basically defining new variable types! In the same way, writing a method is like the creation of a new Java command. So, when you make a main method that says "initialize();", "gameLoop();", "shutdown();", you are saying in your own words what you want the computer to do, *and it will do that*. That's awesome, that's part of what makes programming fun. It also fits greatly into paradigms like encapsulation, cleanliness, expression of intention etc.   Assuming that your Windows is 64 bit:  The first two Google hits (and I don't mean to complain, just trying to help):  https://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_1603.xml  http://www.adminarsenal.com/admin-arsenal-blog/beat-java-error-1603-when-deploying  In case that doesn't solve the problem, you could also try https://singularlabs.com/software/javara/ (JavaRA = "Java Remove All"), which doesn't just allow to remove all Java remains but also to download Java versions.   Pure Java is not suitable for making games. You can "extend" it by using libraries (Something that is quite normal for Java, anyway.), which allowed to make [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), [Delver](http://store.steampowered.com/app/249630/), and others - but pure Java can only be used for game prototypes, experiments, or games that look like they're from the 1990s. That said, I love to try to use Java to make games without additional libraries for some reason.   How would you use the [Robot](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Robot.html) for this? You can't scan for open programs or open windows of other applications or if they are not minimized or where on screen they are ... - It would be possible to do something like OP wants to do with the Robot, but the situation would have to be set up very specifically. E.g. how would you click into the right Excel cells? The suggestion to use third party libraries to read Excel files is way better.   No, I didn't mean to say "Don't extend JFrame!", it can be a good idea, I'm just saying that I don't think it is one in this case or in most cases.   I absolutely agree. Not just for booting: Starting any program is so much faster! IntelliJ IDEA for example starts in only a few seconds instead of taking 20+.  An SSD is a *meaningful investment*, not a luxury.   WTF! I looked at that church photo like 10 times yesterday. Why did they remove it? That's weird.  ...

The audience does not deserve to hear what I have to say. Believe what you want. (Oh, the irony.)   The key question would be: How did the doctor know about the metal bits? Are there examinations for such a thing before deciding over an MRI? In case there aren't and the doctor decided based on knowing about the patient's life: Have there been cases where a patient was hurt or killed by an MRI? If so, what are the statistics?   Translation: "The statements made by this person are to be taken with a bucket of salt."  That btw. is also true for all those Internetizens who make statements like "This is the best movie ever!" and who abuse the word "literally" to mean "Not quite literally, I just mean to emphasize my statement unreasonably."    To investigate bizarre insurance claims that transpired in either accidents, death or both, a former cop and an insurance investigator travel throughout the country to look at the cases up close.

Ye, but if the universe is an unbounded-infinte space, it didn't become that from a bounded-infinite space. So, I don't see why you mentioned that.   https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3e1hl2/eli5_why_is_it_that_a_fully_buffered_youtube/ctavoxj   Thanks, I will dig deeper into this later.   I can try this one day, but my condern is that if I do e^x, the volume will effectively range from 0% to 270% of the original material. This can be amended, of course, by dividing by e in the end.  But I guess this won't work. Just look at this:  e^1 (Full volume.) = sound multiplied by 2.7, divided by 2.7 = factor 1. Good. But now:  e^0.5 (Slider half down.) = 1.64, divided by 2.7 = factor 0.61  So, instead of bending the curve downwards to make the higher slider values be more expressive/effective, we have achieved *the opposite*, because an actual slider value of 0.5 is now like an unmodulated slider value of 0.6 - This approach is clearly wrong!   I am completely aware of what I said, incl. that my mathtard-assumption "If e^x is its own derivative, this might be the reason that e is the sweet-spot." doesn't *seem* to make sense given that I do x^e here. It might or might not make sense - I don't know. I don't give a fuck, though. I trust my observations. Also, a parallel subthread developed that you probably didn't see:  https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3e1hl2/eli5_why_is_it_that_a_fully_buffered_youtube/ctav7wd?context=10    So as we go back towards the big bang - a time of incredible energy packed into a small space - time asymptotically approaches zero.  I haven't heard this interesting thought yet even though I do keep my ears open (e.g. via /r/askscience), but I also disagree with it: The universe may be infinite as measurements of the last 10 or 15 years have shown, so it would have been infinite right from the start (because you can't get from finite to infinite in a non-discrete process), so the density would not have been infinite. And the temperature also was not infinite but just very high, so high that a certain symmetry wasn't broken yet. (That was a really interesting askscience comment that I saved a while ago, would have to search a bit.) Anyway: This would mean that even if time moved at a different speed, it wouldn't go to the extremes you describe, so it doesn't solve the "How did time begin?" conundrum.  My personal take is that, like so many things in reality, an emergence effect occurred that resulted in a hard step from some blurry undefined thing to the first concrete universe situations.   All that may be true, but the fact is that the situation is vastly improved if one goes through the incredible effort of treating the sound like this, and almost nobody does it, apparently.   Did you move on from babbies?  In any case: Whenever enough mass accumulates in one place, the weight-pressure will overpower the nuclear forces so that the structures can not be upheld, so while the mass stays the same, the space it requires is reduced, which even increases the weight-pressure because the mass is spread out less. Ultimately, it all collapses enough to occupy less space than its Schwarzschild radius (Every bit of mass has such a radius, but this radius is normally well below the material's radius.), so now you have a Black Hole. It's hypothesized that the mass inside takes no space at all, that it is collapsed into a point.   That guy made a good joke that I didn't know yet. Don't know if I'm part of a minority and the rest upvoted because "Yeah, that. I know that."   A bag in which someone keeps and carries around feces. Indeed.   No, I mean it like I wrote. Made a small game in Java recently (The sound is realtime-synthesized, so the volume is applied directly in the sample data, so I certainly wasn't blindfolded by some driver's behavior.) that had the same problem at first. And it's logical that you have to do it this way round: Let's say we use 2 instead of e or something. A user input of 0.5 becomes 0.25. So, we are simulating that the user's slider is already way lower. This obviously works effectively against the problem that the upper range doesn't do much. It kind of expands the whole lower part of the slider and compresses the upper part.  Any number above 1 will work, yes, but 1.2 etc is much too weak to fix the problem, and if you go too high, you get the opposite problem: You'll not have any change in the lower ranges, and you'll also get too quickly to a quiet volume when going down from 100%. I fiddled with this, and about 2.7 seemed to be apt. Since it's close to Euler's Number, I figured that there might even be an objective reason to use e here. After all, e^x is its own derivative, so as a complete mathtard, I thought that this symmetrical behavior might be related to about 2.7 being a good middle ground regarding the volume behavior manipulation.   Well, you could possibly make a little weedery close to the roof. All that heating churches do so that the people on the ground have a nice climate must result in quite some heat up there.  But does weed need heat at all? That might be a wrong assumption due to the heat of growing-lamps, which I heard can nowadays be replaced with LEDs, so it would be a lot less extra-warm.   Well, that history sure sounds as if the person enjoys to offend. But with that in mind, it feels as if something like Poe's Law applies. Is OP trolling us, or is it just that OP's diet is questionable?   That might even be the fucking reason. I just opened a video, explicitly switched to 720p, let it cache for a while, stepped forward within the cached range a few times - it did (apparently) NOT download any of that again.  Just did the same with another video that was on auto-480. No re-caching.  I am sure that I had re-caching problems with the YouTube player in recent months, then I stopped caring. Maybe they changed something. I am sure that its behavior was as super-retarded as OP's question insinuates.   That's a nice way to become blind to the actual reality. If the observed behavior is obviously wrong, then someone fucked up. *If* (Not meaning to claim that this actually works, but I *guess* so.) you can open a YouTube link, let it cache completely, cut your Internet connection and watch the video completely, then it's completely retarded coding if clicking somewhere on the position bar requires new caching.  Take Portal 2 by Valve, for example: The volume sliders don't work properly, just like in almost all other games. They obviously manipulate the audio in a linear fashion, which is not how acoustics work. When you reduce the volume down from 100%, you hear almost no change until you're at about 60%.  Some games do this correctly by raising the user's input value (From 0 to 1.) to the power of Euler's Number (about 2.7) or something like that.  Valve's developers sure should know this better, no? And hence the perception of all users is wrong. Is that really how you think?   *We* would have to accelerate to something like that and then slow down again for *him* to have experienced more time than us once we're back together. Rule of thumb: The space traveler dude is the one who misses out.   I remember rebooting my machine in mini-LANs while I still had Win98. Took at least two minutes.

[Next](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435705/) (2007, Nicolas Cage, Julianne Moore, Jessica Biel) is generally an entertaining movie that can be recommended with confidence, but *you* should *definitely* watch it.  I suggest not to read the summary because it gives too much away. Just watch a movie where a guy has a neat superhuman ability.   I wonder why they don't add an input option where pressing forward on the keyboard doesn't just rev the engine but effects that the car *keeps* driving at that speed. So you can freely adjust your speed by pushing forward or backward, without the bunny hopping effect.   First thing I did in GTA4 was to be annoyed that I couldn't pick up and dispose of trash that was floating by. I just felt immersed and wanted to turn that emotion into action.  That's what these games have too little of: Interaction possibilities. They draw a beautiful 3D painting, then you're mostly whizzing past it in a vehicle, reducing your mental perception to the key information (traffic, next junction, ...) - You do see the full graphics with your eyes, but your consciousness in your brain isn't looking at those, it's looking at useful data. Many are not aware of this problem, because it requires you to be aware of your awareness, but you could also be aware of your awareness of your awareness etc., so where does it stop? Many seem to not be all that aware of their awareness.  Btw., I've noticed that walking slower in games (e.g. by crawling) gives a much stronger and more spatial impression of your immediate environment, e.g. when you're moving through some corridor in a shooter. If only more games had freely adjustable movement speed like the old Splinter Cell games. At least, don't force us to *hold* a slow-key to move slowly.   Even the cammer expected it.

EDIT: rather (365-125)\*3.5\*8 because weekends   Still on it. Good experience. Informative (I hope - am not American, don't know how accurate the information is). Gives perspective.  Some things seem wrong. E.g. half into the month, I have a cell phone bill of 75$. Why would someone low on money pick the absolute luxury space age plan? I had no choice here.  Later, I can get an Internet plan at home for $60 which is ridiculously expensive. Is it really that high in the USA? Costs about 30 in Germany. Also, I *do* have a smartphone, no? Those do have Internet access. Otherwise the plan wouldn't be so ridiculously expensive. So, whatever advantage the Internet-PC would bring, to a smaller degree I have that already via the smartphone.  Another thing that's unrealistic: Things are popping up out of nowhere. My decision whether or not to pay something (or what quality to choose) would be relative to what I can expect to happen next, e.g. "fee to get car road-legal". I could know these in advance and plan ahead.  Also, what about $1,500 to get your car back? I've been parked in the wrong place a few times in Germany, each time it cost me about 150 to get the car back.  I heard that many people in the USA have *two* jobs. While that's a harsh fact, a person as much attacked *from all fucking sides* with bills as the guy in this imho a bit exaggerated game would consider taking two.  After one failed attempt, I made it through the month with unpaid car registration pending. All in all, an appreciated product, informative etc., but it left me wanting, and I think it's exaggerated.   My *very unpopular* way of handling this - so, probably better not take this as advice - is to befriend the null. Instead of trying to avoid it (which can't work in all cases, anyway), make use of it as a meaningful expression of information whenever you can. This way, your null-checks are not a protective measure, they are just part of your normal situation evaluation code, and you will also be completely aware of the fact that something can be null at all times, you won't forget it.  I can't think of a good example right now, though. But I've done this often.   Man, will they *EVER* fix this subreddit's style sheets? The line numbering is completely useless.  To go through 6 guesses, you need to assign "6" to your guess variable and decrease -- it by one directly after your if-block. Then you need to wrap the lines starting with `int number = in.nextInt();` and ending with the decrease line into a while loop that keeps running as long as your guess variable is above 0.  But you also need to move `int randomNum = 1+num.nextInt(100);` up outside the loop, you don't want this number to be recreated every time.   I disagree. Extending JFrame and such should only be done if it brings a considerable advantage or is required, because those objects come with a ton of methods. So even if an IDE lists one's own "custom" methods at the top in the autocomplete list, it's still an impure solution. There are no hard reasons that speak against your suggestion, though.  On a different note: If OP can use Java 8, they should make use of Lambdas. IntelliJ and other IDEs automatically suggest such a change, so they teach a programmer about those possibilities. Example:      public static void main(String[] args) {         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {             public void run() {                 new Main();             }                    });          }  becomes      public static void main(String[] args) {         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Main::new);     }     I had the very same problem yesterday, if I understand you correctly: Every step was digital, a teleportation from point A to point B, except there were no grid places between A and B.  This was ok for the relatively fast (and crappy) action game I'm making, but then I had the great idea to not show the whole level at all times but to instead only show a local excerpt, giving a weak "1st person" and mystery exploration feeling. It did wonders, but the whole screen was now stepping. Solution: See what chiguireitor said. Except I do those usually with an adjustable scaler. Example:      currentPos = (targetPos + currentPos) / 2  is the same as      currentPos = (1-0.5) * targetPos + 0.5 * currentPos  If we use a variable for the 0.5, we can adjust the smoothness.      currentPos = (1-movementSmoothing) * targetPos + movementSmoothing * currentPos  `movementSmoothing` is a value between 0 and 1. If it's e.g. 0.9, then the position resists the change but eventually gives in. 0.99 and such can also make sense.  I applied this to the *whole screen*, so that it scrolls considerably softened while the player still moves in steps. Works very well.   E.g. while the download connection is being established.   Here, I turned the photo into something much more presentable:  https://i.imgur.com/8HEQBwB.jpg   Even *if* you were just making this up: On a planet with 7.2 billion people, it's almost *certain* that someone out there had an almost identical experience. So, we might as well treat *your* account as the real one, for the sake of discussion. Anything else is unproductive/unreasonable. It's not like you're getting free blowjobs for this.   I think someone pondering something and coming to a conclusion is less crazy than someone who does not dare to challenge themselves on these questions.   (OP [took](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3dzgg5/a_few_days_ago_someone_tried_to_rob_me_it_has/cta7i10?context=10) the knife away. This knife, at least.)   At the time Frodo said that Gollum should die and when Gandalf said "Rather nope.", Frodo still had a part of his path ahead 1) that Gollum's death would not have spared him 2) and Gollum greatly helped with the completion of that path, *probably* made the completion possible in the first place.  So, Gandalf, to me, seems to have been exactly correct.   Possibly because we have more than one sex.   It is entirely proper to state truth. If you disagree, you fight for evil.  I am God, by the way. You have expressed that you would go against me, so I demand that you give up your position as moderator.

Have you ever felt the heat of the sun on your face when you stepped out of a shadow?   Those struggling with infinity should make an effort to replace the brain's substitution of infinity with "A DAMN LOT!" instead with "Always *more*." because "infinite" means "with out end", so in the case of e.g. space or numbers, it would mean "ongoing".  Once this is done, one's mental dealing with "infinity" starts to change into a more useful form.    Changing diet (going from herbivore to carnivore or vice-versa) is a huge evolutionary change.  Does that imply that being able to eat both (Being omnivore, like humans.) is hence a significant evolutionary advantage?    Honestly, I can't think of any arguments for binary over ternary beyond "one took off, the other didn't".  Here's one:  https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ds1oa/why_we_use_binary_numeral_system_instead_of_more/ct9mcdd?context=10   There is one threshold between two values so you need one comparator. To differentiate between 3 values you need 2 comparators because there are at least two thresholds. But with 2 comparators you can also process 2 bits.    Why?   Didn't know the term (but the thing). From the Wikipedia article:   Not invented here (NIH) is the philosophical principle of not using third party solutions to a problem because of their external origins. False pride often drives an enterprise to use less-than-perfect invention in order to save face by ignoring, boycotting, or otherwise refusing to use or incorporate obviously superior solutions by others.  Though "reinventing the wheel" isn't necessarily a pride problem or somesuch. E.g. I always see people in /r/javahelp and /r/learnjava using Scanner(System.in) and struggling with the intricacies of using methods other than just .nextLine(). I never use those methods, so I don't have to ponder all that for a second. I just use .nextLine() and do any required parsing/checking in utility methods that I made over time.  Another example are cases where you just prefer to do things a certain way, but the available libraries do it differently, so either you adapt (which might not always be easily possible), or you make your own. Also, there might be solutions that you just don't happen to hear about.       if(liveOn) {     } else {     }    Both sound like something HR would say.

The detonation mechanism is also simpler.   To make it more expensive, they could custom-program a game that the kids attending the wedding can play over the projector on the cake. Something making good use of its shape.   Reminds me of my Java Steam game library ("SlaloM"). It automatically reads the whole Steam library from HD, and within its little sandbox, you can tag games, filter the tags with AND/OR/NOT (in that filter-order), there's a complete second such tag system to manage the primary tags, you can *rename* games, it shows the Steam screenshots prominently and with original colors etc., can launch games, can trigger uninstall, can call the store page, shows AppID, keeps track of game time (in its own crude way), allows sorting by "last played" or "date first seen by program", file format is ascii so you could kinda adjust values ...

Rather looks like a knock-off movie cover.   Also, the passenger might use that very phone, which they can't if it's locked.    A phone is less distracting than separate devices each doing their own thing.  I don't disagree with your general stance, but I think you're wrong about this one. The station buttons and volume knob on a built-in radio are fixed in 3D space - always in the same place, they don't go away behind a different screen and have to be retrieved, and they also don't move around with your hand/phone.  That's just one device example. Though there might be others that go in the opposite direction, and who knows what you had in mind (e.g. setting the multi band equalizer via menu and other buttons), so this argument goes both ways. But for general radio use, my point stands.    You can't make a system built on shitty posting anymore worse than it already is. It isn't possible.  This is broken on so many levels that I just comment this here and turn off Inbox responses. Everything you said in this post is so *wrong* ... you are a phenomenon.

"Feeding" people who don't deserve it - yep, I agree, that's not quite it. But what you describe sounds to me as if the *opportunity* for the average person to prosper - not to rise to the top, but to prosper - would be taken away, leaving you with slave ants ruled by nobles. I would find that abhorrent.   Yes, and nothing in the source code either (in case you didn't mean that).   Oh. Well, then I guess you have no choice but to put them like in your screenshots. (And I disagree with the idea to hide "competing" effects, because not only would it be confusing but what if the effects are of different strength? E.g. their power might fade out over time.)  I think the solution is to simplify the symbols. They "look too good", they are too fancy. They should be as simple as symbols used in traffic signs, and they shouldn't use more than one color. Ideally, all colors would be the same, but I guess that adding a fitting color to the effect (stronger = green, weaker = red, ...) does make sense.   In case you haven't yet, you definitely should watch the animated movie [Ratatouille](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/) (2007) by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava.   A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great French chef despite his family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau.  It's a very entertaining movie, and it might give you a deeper emotional grasp of the onset of your game idea.   I think you could place them at the bottom of the screen, horizontally centered.

What's funny is that the innocent left Sodom Gomorrah before it was smitten from the sky. I suggest the same should happen here.   It's easier to justify why someone is an atheist than why someone is a Christian or Muslim or Mormon etc., because being atheist or non-atheist is just a choice between "not sufficient evidence" and "sufficient evidence".  However, being a Christan/Muslim/etc. is a choice of the very specific type of theism, and all of these have the same amount of evidence speaking for them, plus the majority of religious people share the religion of their society which suggests a good level of arbitrariness regarding the "choice".  In this light, not only can an atheist say "I didn't see sufficient evidence.", they can even say "I couldn't decide which religion to follow, so I followed none of them."

One of the most interesting bits of information from the poll is that, of those Latino voters that do know who Sanders is (about 32% overall) opinions on him are split: 16% view him very/somewhat favorably and 16% view him very/somewhat unfavorably.      Van Jones (CNN commentator) tweeted a link to a statement from MoveOn that succinctly highlights some of what got BlackLivesMatter activists and a lot of black Americans upset about their responses. It reads, in part:  Similarly, while economic and racial justice issues certainly intersect, and reducing economic inequality will benefit people of all races, portrayals of racial injustice as merely an offshoot of economic injustice or the implication that solutions to economic inequality will take care of racism represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how race operates in our country."  Unfortunately, it seems that some Sanders supporters did't quite understand how those responses were perceived to be dismissive of their concerns (and in turn, it may have seemed like Sanders and O'Malley were being dismissive of those concerns or their importance) and have themselves come across as dismissive of the concerns of the black Americans that participated in and got the  #BernieSoBlack (edited this because I accidentally wrote the hashtag as #SandersSoBlack) hashtag trending on Twitter for hours. Some of them were tweeting in what seemed to be a very patronizing "I (or in this case: Sanders) knows what's best for you" kind of way--at least judging by the arguments I saw earlier on Twitter. It obviously inflamed passions, but at least the tweet have turned a bit more jocular than they were earlier on.   Hello, I'm in the US (as is the my niece who I want to purchase a desktop for). Her family's old computer gave out and her parents don't want her using the new PC for anything other than homework and web browsing so I said I'd purchase her one she could use for her PC games. I'd prefer not to spend more than $500, if at all possible, but am willing to spend around $600-800 if absolutely necessary (she's an amazing kid but spending that much on a teenager seems kind of extravagant). I don't know much about PCs but from what I've read simulation and strategy games aren't necessarily that most graphic heavy/detailed games, anyway; especially older ones. It would be great if she could play them at the maximum settings since I think the look of the games and detail is what drew her to video games in the first place (and I want to encourage that even if I'm not too into it myself). She mostly plays strategy and simulation games like the Sims and Civilization. I'm assuming newer games have higher graphical detail and the newest she owns are: Civilization Beyond Earth and Civilization Starships, The Sims 3, The Sims 4, and Cities Skylines. She owns older versions of similar titles but I assume that any desktop that can play the newer games at maximum settings can play the older ones at maximum settings with no problems. The old computer's monitor and keyboard and mice are still usable since the family's new computer came with those things so all I need to buy her is the gaming desktop itself. I want to buy it online from a reputable store (Amazon, etc...) and have it delivered to their home. Thank you in advance.   Been looking for it myself because I want to show it to some people but I saw both of them and Clinton's was better I'd say. She was more passionate than she usually seems to be during speeches and even though they both spoke about similar things Hillary seemed to connect better with the audience, even though her audience was many times greater in size than Sanders'. If I find a link I'll post it here.  Found a recorded video of it (The one labeled Monday Luncheon; she takes the stage near the end of the recording at 3:14:44) there was a delay so she took the stage later than planned and people had to stay in the room or risk losing their seats--was really tough for people that had to use restroom!: http://original.livestream.com/nclrevents/video?clipId=pla_578dee51-f9d2-4c13-9c9f-548083d44ad4 utm_source=lslibrary utm_medium=ui-thumb    According to the CNN article on this, the union met with Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley and union members chose Clinton by a three-to-one margin. http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/11/politics/hillary-clinton-american-federation-of-teachers/index.html    	6

I don't like the author's use of the phrase 'ill afford'. However, I believe this may interest some and provide food for thought.   Newar Buddhism is sometimes accused of being a confused mixture of Hinduism and Buddhism. Given he social and political situation of the country, it is perhaps inevitable that there would be a certain blurring of the lines between the two. However, the contention is based on the debatable supposition that there were at any time in India clear-cut distinctions between the two at the level of folk religionsthat is, at the level of the religious practice of the laity. Later innovations in practice and doctrine were, no doubt, largely introduced into Buddhism and interpreted in a Buddhist sense by the teachers of the age precisely because they were current among the masses. Moreover for the last six hundred years in Nepal there has been social and political pressure on the Buddhist community to conform more to orthodox Hindu customs. As a result, this process, which was an ongoing one throughout the history of Buddhism in India, has continued in Nepal. Festivals, images, customs, and the like were adopted and given a Buddhist meaning. Finally, there is a great similarity between the yogic practices and the iconography of Hindu and Buddhist tantrism. The philosophical differences between Hindu and Buddhist interpretations of even the most fundamental tantric concepts are profound, but once the spirit of scholarship began to decline the differenes were no longer so clear. hence the seeming confusion of the present situation is due rather to a decline of scholarship and the incarnation of Buddhism in Indian religious culture, than to a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism peculiar to the Valley of Nepal.  The opening of Nepal in 1951 to the outside world, the passage of a new legal code, and the spread of educaton in the valley have brought the Buddhist community of the valley to a juncture. The legal code has removed restrictions of caste, a social phenomenon having no justification in Buddhist teaching but with tenacious vested interests in the Buddhist community. The educated youth are drifting away from old rituals and practices as their world becomes increasingly secularized. The economic situation of the valley is changing from a purely agricultural one to one in which more an d more people are engaged in business, government service, the tourist industry, etc. The result is that the ancient round of feasts and festivals is becoming an economic burden and a sacrifice of time people can ill afford. The youth of the Buddhist community are devout and the social force of their religion is still strong, but the social structure is weakening and they are looking for something more relevant. At the same time the level of scholarship among the Vajracharyas leaves them withouth proper guidance. At least some of the younger Vajracharyas are aware of the problem and have recently formed a group to face the present challenge and adapt their traditions.  ______________________________  'Newar Buddhism at the Crossroads' from the chapter 'Present-Day Buddhism in Nepal' by John K.

Consider this:  **A + B  B**  Increasing the number of stages in the food production process by eating animal products, rather than plant matter first hand, creates waste. According to Joni Seager et. al in The State of the Environment Atlas, In cycling our grain through livestock, we wasted 90% of its protein and 96% of its calories. An acre of cereal can produce five times more protein than an acre devoted to meat production; and legumes (beans, lentils, peas) can produce ten times as much. Thus the greater the human consumption of animal products, the fewer people can be fed.  An omnivorous diet wastes resources that the world just does not have. Faced with a growing population, we must use our resources as efficiently as possible so as to avoid famine, conflict over scarce resources, and climate chaos.  **Land**  According to a UN Food and Agricultural Organisation 2005 report The State of Food Insecurity in the World, a varied vegan diet only needs a fifth of the land of a typical European omnivorous diet. The animal industry has a devastating impact on the land. Expansion of livestock production is a key factor in deforestation. In a process known as hamburgerisation cattle graze on cleared land, moving to yet more land once they have destroyed the fertility of the soil. World Resources Institute assessments suggest that 20-30 per cent of the worlds forest areas have already been converted to agriculture. To feed animals in order to eat animal products will not satisfy humanitys food needs.  **Water**  Animal production uses huge quantities of water to grow crops for their feed, for them to drink, and during the processing of their carcasses. A study financed by the California Beef Council found that the production of one kilogram of beef uses 3700 litres of water, the equivalent of 40 baths or 300 toilet flushes. A different study from Cornell University put the water usage for one kilogram of beef at 100,000 litres. For comparison a kilogram of maize uses 77 litres, wheat 119, and barley 2174. With more than one billion people already unable to access enough safe water to meet their needs5, and this number likely to rise, we must prioritise a sustainable diet over a meat-based one.

Something tells me you haven't read the article.   This is the article the Independent's piece referred to:  **A 15-year-old dies but the war goes on. Why wont we make drugs legal?**    The world is not the same for me now, says Anne-Marie Cockburn, whose 15-year-old daughter, Martha Fernback, died after taking ecstasy. But if someone like me can pave the way for change, that would be good.  Ms Cockburn has hauntingly beautiful eyes  the fact that her only child had the same eyes makes the pictures of them unbearably poignant. But she is unusual in another way too. As a bereaved parent, she is not demanding some kind of crackdown. She is asking  quietly and sombrely  for drugs to be regulated and legalised.  When Martha Fernback died, it was not the first ecstasy tablet she had taken. What her mother has painfully had to accept is that perfectly normal teenagers take foolish risks. High or dead? she says. No parent wants either, but one is preferable.  We have all been teenagers. We have all known the attraction of doing something illicit, dangerous. Yet the whole war on drugs is predicated on a wilful misreading of human psychology: the insistence that criminalising drugs will stop people taking them.  On the contrary. In the latest British Crime Survey 16% of 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK admit that they have dabbled in drugs in the past year. Given that respondents are admitting to something illegal, the true figure is likely to be higher.  The same thing happened under Prohibition in America in the 1920s and 1930s. The ban on liquor increased the number of hard drinkers, even though alcohol prices soared. It also created a criminal class of bootleggers, whose financial interest lay in supplying alcohol and encouraging their customers to become addicted.  Todays bootleggers, in the drugs trade, have made this into a fine art. With their sports cars, tattoos and jewellery, they are role models for many kids on bleak estates. They offer free samples. They evade the police and customs. They know how to stealthily upgrade their customers from soft stuff to hard. Cocaine has moved up to crack and cannabis to skunk, concentrated forms that are devastating. And they increase their profits by cutting drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine with other substances. The inquest into Martha Fernbacks death heard that the average street-level purity of ecstasy is 58%. These products can be more dangerous than the pure forms of the drugs, as any A E doctor will testify.  Britains equivalent of Prohibition was the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. Before that, addiction was treated as an illness, and heroin addicts were prescribed their drugs by their GP. There were very few addicts, and no crime associated with heroin. The effect of the act was to hand these people over to unscrupulous gangs who had every incentive to turn more people into junkies  and many of those turned to crime to feed their habit.  The result is that, in 40 years, Britain turned roughly 10,000 addicts into something more like 250,000. The resulting misery affects not only those people and their families, but all the people whove been threatened and robbed. The cost of drug-related crime in England and Wales is estimated at 14bn a year. Then theres the cost of keeping people in prison. About 10% of the prison population is there for possession or supply, but most need treatment, not punishment.  No other industry of this scale is unregulated, untaxed and in the hands of criminals. Drugs are now the second-largest revenue-earner for organised crime, with profit margins sometimes higher than those on luxury goods. Those profits fuel all sorts of other nasty crimes, including trafficking. The Sunday Times has recently exposed the fact that cannabis drug lords are trafficking Vietnamese girls to work in UK nail bars.  Legalising production, supply and consumption could put paid to the whole, vile industry. Putting the market in the hands of licensed sellers would make the supply safer. And going into the corner shop, rather than sidling up to someone on the street, might make the whole act of purchase less glamorous.  Admittedly, if buying an ecstasy tablet became as easy as buying a pack of cigarettes, usage would probably rise, at least at first. And the state is understandably uncomfortable about appearing to condone a dangerous habit. But the annual number of deaths from alcohol and tobacco dwarfs the annual number of deaths from drugs.  Licensed drug sellers would also pay tax. Together with the 2bn spent on fighting the drugs trade each year, this money could treat addiction and fund education campaigns. Overcrowded prisons would be relieved of people who are desperately vulnerable to drugs while inside. A doctor recently explained to me how random drug tests encourage inmates to move on to harder drugs: unlike cannabis, which stays in the body for weeks, opiates can be sweated out in two days.  Big cracks are beginning to show in what was once a solid wall of global prohibition. In defiance of the UN-mandated war on drugs, more and more countries are beginning to experiment. Last week the Jamaican government announced that it will decriminalise possession of marijuana. And the drugs policy charity Transform published a report on Portugal, which decriminalised the possession of all drugs for personal use in 2001. The report finds that drug-related deaths have decreased. And while lifetime drug use has increased slightly, use seems to have declined among the 15-24 age group.  These moves from prejudice to evidence are hugely cheering. In Holland city mayors are lobbying the government to let them supply cannabis to coffee shops. Uruguay has become the first country to regulate cannabis possession, production and supply. The US states of Washington and Colorado are doing something similar, and Oregon and Nevada are likely to vote soon.  It is time for British politicians to look again at what is being learnt around the globe. Once you accept that people have not been deterred from taking drugs, policy can become more pragmatic. Holland has walk-in labs where users can test the purity of a drug they are about to take.  Responding to Anne-Marie Cockburns comments after the inquest this week, the crime prevention minister Norman Baker made the following statement: The UKs approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities, help dependent individuals through treatment and wider recovery support, while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply.  Those last three words give the game away. We are not stopping the supply. We have lost control of it.  As a Liberal Democrat, Mr Baker should be challenging such an illiberal policy. It takes a brave politician to overcome the hysteria that occludes this issue. But the fact that the war on drugs has failed is demonstrated by the fact that a middle-class girl in a north Oxford school has died. Her mothers courageous plea deserves a proper hearing  and a more coherent response.   camilla.cavendish@sunday-times.co.uk  *^Camilla ^Cavendish* ^Published: ^15 ^June ^2014              You're welcome.

 As an aspiring chef-to-be, I'm working on incorporating world food cultures into my repitoire. I want to know how history and everyday aspects of life shape and develop your cuisine.  I want to know how neighbouring nations, religion, gender roles, family, changing populations, etc., has carved out your distinct culinary lifestyle.  If you can help me out, Reddit, tell me about your food.   My grandmother has a toaster that was a gift for her second wedding 40 years ago, that bastard not only still works but does the just better than anything you can get at sears or wherever people get small appliances.   I pay a premium for 270 mbps connections. Seems like Canadian internet is faster than a lot of places, and doesn't go to hell every time it rains (I've gamed with a lot of Americans who'd mention things like "oh bad weather coming, might lose connection")   I find it rather awesome that veteran actors pass the torch to newer blood.  Even with the wave of reboots lately, not all of which are great, I still enjoy it.  Anyone who hasn't seen the Tom Hardy Mad Max needs to correct that immediately.   Every cook develops hands that don't respond to heat as much, and every cut isnt a cut, but a future "chef tattoo."  Also for the aspiring cooks out there, if you're nervous about knives, take this advice. Every minor cut will heal, so stop worrying about princess hands. Same for hot stuff, burns heal too.  At any given time I have at least 2 little cuts and singed fingertips.   I enjoy some good classic Family Guy, especially the Star Wars parodies, but I never felt like Bojack was anything like it.  Yes, it starts dumb, what adult animated doesn't? Then I got further in and the characters roped me in.

Never had an animated show (and verrrry few live action) teared me up like that. 10/10 would recommend.   Any action you take while drunk or high is 100% your fault.  I used to have a good friend who got drunk, had sex with her boyfriend, regretted it, and tried to get police involved.  If you can't hold your liquid or drugs, dont take them.

So I'm in the kitchens with my buddies, and people are ordering their food from the servers. Well most of these servers/hospitality students come from overseas to learn. So whenever there's a bill that has an "ask server" note, they come over to explain.  I'm all for cultural diversity, but if the head of the kitchen doesnt understand a fucking word the servers are saying, you shouldn't be in that job until you learn the local language.

Jess has depression and thoughts of suicide. Her best option is to relocate 1300 kilometres away to her nearest family.  I am a cook and in my second year of college with 9 months left. We both know I can find work in any city in the world.  Most of my life has involved psychiatrists and I've only had a somewhat normal life for about 2 years. Jess feels this has left me unstable still, and is thinking we should split and leave me behind.  We have all the strong feelings for each other though, and we're looking for advice on the subject.  Personally, I prefer any advice on how we could make the relationship stable and work, but I'm open to all advice.  TL;DR; girlfriend moving away for health, should I follow and make work or end relationship?   Replace coworker with girlfriend and yup.  I'm very clumsy...

He wanted to repair some damage done to this country, but now he's stuck working 90 hour weeks testing asphalt quality in the middle of nowhere.   I heard that the latest statisic showed that raising a child to 18 will cost roughly $1million over the course of those years. Idk about you guys, but I don't have the time or energy to work enough to live in something better than a box, drive to work, eat, and raise a kid at $30000 a year (assuming the cost is split with a partner). As it is, I'll probably only be making $30000 a year for the next 5-10 years after college.   ISS is truly a testament to human ingenuity.  A statistic I read somewhere suggested that the US military budget accounts for appoximately 50% of the combined military budgets internationally. One country spends half the world's military spending.  The above 5% figure proposed is hardly a drop in the bucket. US military could easy thrive as the major superpower with even 30% of the international budget. That would free up 8% of American funding, or 312 billion (using requested budget expenditures figure for 2015 fiscal year). 312 billion would build two more ISS satellites (up to 2010 construction).  I'm not saying that we need more research stations orbitting the planet, but that American priorities may be a little (or in my opinion vastly) skewed in the wrong direction.   One of the first times I blazed, was watching Dude Where's My Car? and browsing, decided was a good time to make an account.   That's because when you rave you're supposed to see with drugs, not your eyes ...   Beware the mystery meat...   Pearl Jam sued Ticketmaster over this issue in the 90's because they have a monopoly on ticket distribution, and adding all these fees makes it impossible for many of their fans to afford their concerts and support the band.   I don't know if there's any Princess Auto's in America (they're kinda like Menards for shop equipment, electronic accessories hardware, etc) but last I saw, 10' hdmi cables were $7 after taxes. Cheaper for shorter.   AVG Free and Avast is all anyone will ever need. I've been using those for years and never had a virus. Many attempts to access my computer were tried, but one or the other cleaned it up before anything could get through.   For us Canadian brothers up here, NCIX and MemoryExpress are great sources that deliver to Canadian postal codes.   What kinda ghetto crap is that? Standard high speed in Canada is 120-130mbps, economy value speed is 50-60mbps. I had more than 3mbps on dial up.   Well he did kiss his sister, but I think the other stuff weighs a little more.   I really don't care that I wasn't the first for my lady. She's experienced, we have a lot of fun, and what matters is that I'll probably be her last.   To be fair, I haven't played League in a while, so I'm not entirely sure if the smartcast bug is fixed or not.  For newer Rumble players, smartcasting his ult can be trickier to time.   C is for credit, that no longer exists!    /political advisor   I don't care if my team is tripping halfway to Jupiter, if they land the hits right that's all that matters.   I've actually never had the chance to play Viktor, unfortunately.   I agree with everything here, Rylai's is also a powerful second non-boots item. After that I'd go Death Cap then whatever the hell you want because it's often GG Rumble's winning 1v5s.   If you can get your jungler to feed you an early gank or two, Rumble snowballs out of control. Its his early laning phase that you gotta be super careful with.  Also, don't smartcast his ult. Bad times.  Edit: Rumble is my favourite top laner.   That "rule" only applies to about 40 words in the English language.   I really don't care that it's considered a sci-fi staple, classic, masterpiece, whatever.  Could not for the life of me will myself to finish The Fifth Element. I have no specific reasons, just overall it wasn't for me.  Normally I'm good to go for sci-fi, seen enough Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate, and Terranova to last multiple lifetimes, still didn't prepare me for this film.   Scratchers, rashers, rinds, all the same.   To add to this, smoked salmon and an artisan grain cracker. That's what I eat when I drink Stella.   Us guys don't know where they come from, they just show up in the wake of women pasisng by, usually discovered when you step on them.   You need to spend a week in my city. If you're lucky the bus is either 5 minutes early or 15 late. Countless times it just doesn't show up at all.   And this, gentleman and ladies, summarizes every independance of a colony.   I think counsel in my city should hire a few civil engineers. I don't think theres a straight road in the city (pop. ~700,000) and nearly every major road needs to be redone every year.  Also, flood control doesnt seem to exist. The only thing protecting our city from flood water from the states is one dam that is forced to flood thousands of acres of farmland.   Our government has now made an unconstitutional law so vague that protest is now "terrorism."  The bill won't last. Nearly every court case wil be thrown out because it is deemed unconstitutional.  Edit: example, I could be charged under this bill for something as stupid as posting an article I wrote online about Nazi Germany or terror cells.   My college's policy is if you miss 10% of class time, you fail. The demand for spots in my program is rediculous, so no one who doesn't want to be there is there.   In culinary school. We punch stoves, not pillows.   That last paragraph was beautifully terrifying.   Well, there goes Nebraska...  	51
 What are some organizations dedicated to the promotion of literacy, via book donation, in regions of the world where literacy is scarce?       His book *Ghost In The Wires* is well worth the read. It is both exciting and humorous.   I may be able to have my doctor take a look at them, but I have some moles that need inspection. One is exhibiting a bump on it which is new. The others aren't but I would feel comfortable having them looked at.  	4

                      A remarkable and poignant account of a self-aware young woman and her indomitable sister. Beautiful, sad, heroic, despairing and hopeful.      Older.         Phrasing it as 'talk, talk, talk' dismisses it as useless, whereas some kinds of talk can involve reflecting, realizing, challenging.  Racism is not going to diminish without talking.       Talk, talk, talk.  Reflect, realize, challenge.   A powerful reflection on the ways black survival has depended on white comfort.      This is an in-depth interview with a man who has a deep grasp of the tenacious and widespread persistence of the effects of the institution of slavery.                     This is an interesting perspective from a folklorist who studies traditional culture, exploring the ways in which these symbols continue to affect us.               A historian of race explains the meaning of the Confederate flag in the context of history and reaches a damning conclusion.

What a cast of characters: Pitts and McCulloch, Bertrand Russell, Norbert Wiener, John von Neumann.  Of Pitts and McCulloch the article says: Thanks to their work, there was a moment in history when neuroscience, psychiatry, computer science, mathematical logic, and artificial intelligence were all one thing, following an idea first glimpsed by Leibniz--that man, machine, number, and mind all use information as a universal currency.

    It's in Blue Ash, a small city outside Cincinnati, OH.    Yes, it is a potato latke, also very delicious!          I don't think Saul is dead, yet. When Saul asked to speak to Carrie on the phone when he first escaped, he made her promise to take him out if he were to be captured again and Carrie failed to keep this promise. She had to deal with the emotions that followed that decision. I think somehow Saul gets "captured" or taken again by Haqqani, thus Carrie will have to deal a similar decision of killing both Haqqani and Saul, OR there is a possibility of Saul taking his own life while killing Haqqani at the same time. Either way, I think Saul's capture really took a toll on Saul not only physically but mentally and morally. When it comes down to it either Carrie "pulls the trigger" killing Saul and Haqqani, or Saul does it. Either way I'm ready for the new episode now.   Sitting in class when I opened the post, instant goose bumps   	7
 May 2nd. Just me and The People's Champ The Rock   I will admit living here in nh it is a bit tougher to get really good squeaky curds.   They were pretty good though   Haha.   You are too funny you know that   I love the woodland creature analogy.   And I don't listen to rap because I'm not a teenager from the 90s/early 2000s (the last time it was relevant)   Actually I did look them up and I still don't know who the fuck he is.   Some random flavor of the week rapper??  So guess your comment is fucking wrong.    So now with ambrose and harper in the mix it's two Internet vs an Internet and one wwe   Who the hell is Future?   I said cheese curds in my comment describing it more.   Are you fucking serious?!?  Because he has literally had a handful of matches on the main shows.  He is still in the very early stages of his career in the WWE.   I wish his character either had more depth or they just pushed him as an asshole that can have a really good match  He is literally that.  He is an asshole that has had amazing matches.    The whole "I KICK ASS" gimmick  Is not his gimmick.  His gimmick is a guy who is doing everything to provide the best life for his family.  And if that means being an asshole and kicking some ass to get the accolades to provide the best life for his family, then that is what he will do.   I know he does a lot of scouting for the company.  I feel like he is viewed as a loyal employee and an asset to them.   True... although it is tough to sell properly when the kicks were so poorly timed on Brie's part.   You mean like Brie's amazing selling from last night?? lol  Man that was pitiful.   Cooked chicken breasts with onions, carrots, celery, and jalapenos in my crock pot on low for 7 hours.   Pulled the chicken and took the stock to make chicken gravy.  Thin sliced potatoes and baked them with oil salt pepper and garlic.  Topped the fries with the chicken, cheese curds, and the gravy.  Amazing stuff.      Hell will freeze over before Vince admits he was wrong about certain wrestlers/things   I was thinking of that Sweetness move he did that was similar to the Zig-Zag.  He has changed moves too many times to keep track lol.   yes... which rarely happened lol   it was like a spinning headscissors into the armbar   yeah... and while we are at it let's get rid of DDTs, Powerbombs, Superkicks, etc etc etc.  Oh and by the way, the Zig-Zag is in no way an STO.  Same goes for Slater's.  They are neckbreakers if anything.  Sister Abigail is a spinning reverse STO and it looks damn good and devsatating.   [This](http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/34759_large_You_Keep_Using_That_Word_Meme_FP_Wide.png)   Diva's tag team match for me   I know right... it's not like they made special note that he was out there.  Plus it also ties into the whole HHH backing him thing.  HHH  gave him opportunity and he is paying him back for it by helping.   Honestly I enjoyed last night's show.  But then again I usually do when others piss and moan and whine about them.   Damn, who forgot to pay the troll toll?   Everything from that one moment, to the other one, and even that other one, and those ones too makes it totally worth watching   ...HERE COMES THE MONEY! !!!!!!   I do not like over-sell man. ..

FOUR FUCKING MOVES  You're damn right and they are:  EAT!  SLEEP!  SUPLEX!  REPEAT!   Kevin Steen   Undertaker is deathly afraid of cucumbers.   ...is Carmen SanDiego!  Sorry I couldn't help myself.  Probably lying on the side of the ring or made his way to the back.  You'd run too if you got hit with the Taker lights.   You could easily discuss it in one of the 20-30+ other posts saying the exact same thing.  But instead you make a new one and clutter up the sub.   I realize this seems like a foolish question  Then:  a. Why the fuck did you ask it?  b. Why the fuck didn't you bother to see others have asked it?  c.  WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ASK IT?????!!!????   https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3dz6ik/was_spoiler_suppose_to_be_a_heel/  Literally posted 4 minutes before you   He got in more offense than Cena did in his match with Lesnar at Summerslam.  He was going at him good and starting to weaken his leg.  Honestly since he beat the streak the only other person to make him look weak was Reigns.  So it wasn't as much one-sided as it was heavy handed on the Lesnar side.   Don't let the shit door hit you on the way out.   Not weak... chickenshit.  But when push comes to shove he can go in the ring.   Mulva?   But just a woman is ok, right Mr. Snuka?   1. Wyatt no because he is still feuding with Reigns 2. HHH yes because that seems to be the plan all along 3. Rock no because if anything he will be back for Mania 4. Reigns no (see Wyatt) 5. Shield Triple Threat no because it is too soon.  Mania maybe?   Damien Wyatt-dow   [SPOILERS]   It happens and making a new sub won't change it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3dyfte/spoilers_potentially_embarrassing_question/  https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/3dybck/battleground_appearance_thoughts_spoilers/   But Undertaker is not a mortal man.  Making him look like Rocky takes away the entire Undertaker aura   I am in no way a Cena mark.  I just hate people spewing them same BS rhetoric on here just because they think it is cool.  People just like to blame Cena but in fact it is many factors that go into people not getting pushed.   Because the act of losing to John Cena has really been the only thing that has put them in their current positions?  Wow you are fucking stupid.   Wow... there is so much wrong with that that my head hurts.    You have no clue what was intended for Rusev if he hadn't gotten injured.  He was supposed to be in the IC title match and there was a good chance he was going to win.   Wyatt has always been the character that wanders and randomly feuds with others.  This was happening before he ever started the Cena feud.  Also, the guy got to face Taker at Wrestlemania which is something someone who is doing poorly wouldn't get an opportunity for.  He is also in a meaningful feud with someone the company views as one of it's top stars, whom he also beat last night.    Not everyone can be in the title pictures so there will be feuds with others.  People automatically view someone not feuding for a title as they are buried and just losers.  There is too much importance set on the titles being the only way a wrestler is not "buried".  All of these people are still on TV and getting stories and feuds so yeah...   Did you not see the interview with him afterwards where he explained that tapping out was his choice because he didn't want to risk injury, ergo he could not provide for his family.  That hands down fits his character.  So before you make these statements learn all the facts.   [Here you go](http://www.somegif.com/gifs/13613441692075017293.GIF)   Bubs...

Greece accepted a loan of 30 billion Euros in 2010 and have been paying it back slowly ever since.  While they did use that 30 billion loan to bail out their banks, Greece still doesn't owe the IMF 242 billion Euros.   242 billion euros is what Greece owes to all of its creditors, Germany, Spain, the IMF, etc. etc. ...   I still think its fucked up that they had to take out an IMF loan at a usurious interest rate just to bail out the very banks that were engaging in criminal activity.   However, this title is still misleading. The original title doesn't even mention the IMF, but it does mention the 242 billion Euro figure, incorrectly suggesting that Greece owes 242 billion to the IMF, which simply isn't true.   If I left your post up unchecked, without the Misleading Title flair, it would've made the whole sub look bad.          I've been waiting for someone to bring up Pennsylvania.

Well, that isn't entirely true, but you are making it seem like the north was against slavery, and the South was for it.  The north only freed the SOUTHERN slaves, so Britain couldn't side with the south for moral reasons. In fact, slaves in the border and northern states were still slaves. It wasn't until the 13th amendment that slaves were considered free.    Actually, I am trying to comprehend why someone would write something so full of shi-- oh! Let's shout racism again!   This pic old af. This means they are doing something more advanced now.    This is so full of shit, Idk where to start.   It's an old pic which tons of stories have been made up about.   Great!

U can boost to pretty much all these locations    You can use all weapons in competitive games. However, with many it isn't pheasible because of the cost. Low cost weapons are usually the best way to go, so if your economy isn't so good, you are still able to play with cheap weapons since you practiced with them.   Play DM with weapons that's you can use in comps. Ak, m4, tec 9, five seven, usps, glock, etc. An smg or 2 wouldn't hurt either.  Once your aim is on point, play a few M to see where you are stand I ng, your fall point will likely be your game sense.   To improve gamesense, you need to analyze how you and others play. You also need to know what your are looking for, which many people dont. Watch this:https://youtu.be/AyuJ7pIgCbM  That should help a bit.    Lost reference?    No   Dumbest shit I've heard...

Thanks for pointing out a flaw in my argument. I haven't played much BF, and most of what I remember from it is higher bullet precision.   That isn't as good of an analogy TBH, there isn't anything wrong with sterioids -- unless OFC you don't mind cutting a few years off your life.   I don't really see a problem with that. Although it is cheap-ish, he is still providing entertaining videos, and server management is approving of it. In CS:GO, he is doing something completely different -- not that he didn't cheat in DayZ either; when he goes and Bhops in CS:GO using scripts, no one approves of his behavior(apart from fanbois OFC).   BF and CSGO are nothing alike. In BF, wherever you put your crosshair is where the bullets will go. In CSGO, your bullets spray all over the damn place :P   Tried it out and it was interesting to say the least. At one point my thrust broke, and I could only rely on vertical thrust to fly around haha.   It feels very strange, especially having such a high sensitivity to your mouse movements, when compared to PS2. Flying doesn't feel much like Planetside, except for the controls I guess. It is a little too responsive, and you can fly backwards for ages if you just turn around.  Nice attempt, and I am sure that you could fix the issues if you put some more time into it. :D   Can't dispute that.   ...Airplanes don't run on windows    And "also, guns" was where you went full retard.   Most serial killers don't use guns you ignorant shit.   .....Really? Just now? What other reason would they ask for your location?   Took you long enough....   Ironically, America isn't a country....   Are you sure the wires are actually connected inside the connector?   Not always...   Yeah, I guess it is kinda surprising.   Planetside... classic.

 [Takenoko Collector's Edition](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1813947_md.jpg) is a giant version of Takenoko and can be yours for the low low price of [$299](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/193447)   If you can get it to the table a lot and you have the right group for it, **Sheriff of Nottingham** is a lot of fun and great value. But you *need* the right group for this. It's very dependent on people willing to play loose, get into the theme etc. It falls very flat if you don't.   For pure gaming, absolutely get **Castles of Burgundy**. It scales magnificently from 2-4, has tons of replay value and is loads of fun. Has some luck with the dice rolls but you can mitigate that with knowledge tiles and worker guys. I love the tactical feel at 2P of blocking your opponent and the more strategic feel at 4P of focusing/maximizing your own strategy first and foremost. All time classic.        Every sentence just seems so drawn out   unnecessarily convoluted; like it was written to appear as lofty as possible. I read my fair share of literary fiction, but this is a pain to get through and I feel like it greatly distracts from the narrative.   I'll be your friend.    [My comment reply above](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3e28tk/can_you_convince_me_to_buy_your_favourite_board/ctaxfsk).  Also, I paid $25 for the expansion. It's $35 now n Amazon. That's not ridiculous at all.    It's probably somewhere in the middle. Owner Covering His Ass vs. Anonymous Internet People Comments...either side has plenty of reasons to be dubious.    Read the owner's statement. She was kicked out, not for being in the women's bathroom, but for being in the bathroom with another occupant.   Couldn't have said it better myself.    It's a must buy. The new races are unique and totally offer a new experience for the game. You can play with just them, you can mix it up with the base races, play on either board. But the way the new races play just offers such a new experience. I think they're so brilliantly put together. If you like TM, even if it only gets to the table a couple times a year, it's a must-have.   If you don't buy **Terra Mystica** (and the Fire   Ice Expansion) I will punch you right in the mouth.    This. God forbid there's an attractive female anywhere near you while attempting to order a drink. You will wait. Forever.    Well I'm just going to flat out disagree with any list that has Ascension anywhere near a top anything list. Especially if it's a deck-builder list without Eminent Domain or Core Worlds.    I want to make a pun with silver or Ag. I can't think of anything. So, vAgina.    Well that was a question about board games to play in the car. OP here specifically said "Not boardgames"   Where else would you ask about not board games? [AskReddit Seems to Have Been a Good Place for This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2mveq3/whats_a_good_game_to_play_on_the_road_that_isnt_i/).

Dr. Ramsey?   Then don't watch it. How is this that hard?    Dodge Grand Cairavanditioner.    Link staying blue. Blue like the color of the crease his skate was in.    [Link](http://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/208629)   Blaine is a pain   1. If you want to climb up your grammar and English language pedestal, learn how to spell and use proper grammar.   2. You are correct, being an asshole and reading have nothing to do with each other. However, as I initially said, it's fairly obvious what OP was trying to say, without going out of your way to be a dick and take the sentence as literally as possible using his poor grammar.   3. Even with OP's poor title, there is absolutely nothing that would imply causation of Shaggy being Arab-American "BECAUSE" the guy who voiced him was Arab-American. Literally nothing.   4. Again, sorry for "you" education.    So $23.40 basically. That's half the price that it normally is. I don't know much about this game. Must buy at this price?   Unless you can finish reading the sentence and aren't an asshole.     When I'm board I like to paint Wood grain.  You missed a golden opportunity there, OP.    I don't think you know what a sphere is.   That's what OP was referring to: Casey Kasem being of Arab descent, not Shaggy. Poorly worded title, but still, it's not hard to glean the meaning.     Don't ask me silly questions  I won't play silly games  I'm just a simple choo choo train  And I'll always be the same.    I only want to race along  Beneath the bright blue sky  And be a happy choo choo train  Until the day I die.   Fuck you, I like Amy Schumer.   Ha. To be fair, looks like OP added "University" in the title so it's totally original and not plagiarized.    All I want to trade is fortune   Glory and no one wants it :(   Did you learn that because you've seen this TIL on the front page so many times?   Thank god he turned down the Sabres 3yr/$15million offer. That was crazy money for him.    You can buy a Lane Bryant gift card at a discount. Then you can trade that to someone's mom for cash at a big discount. Then use that cash to put towards board games! I found the board games, everyone!   This is the correct answer. These things are a godsend. Setting up Le Havre? Keep each good in a container and plop them down in their places on the board. Same for Agricola and Caverna (damn you and all your pieces, Uwe!). Love these.    [Here's a list](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/186405/best-solosolitaire-games-bgg-2015-edition], but I'm guessing you've seen that as you named the top 3 on it. I also enjoy playing Agricola solo, although the set up isn't the quickest.    Option A: Spite them and keep winning  Option B: Intentionally lose for awhile to lull them into a false sense of security. Then continue domination at your leisure.   Not to be rude, but a pretty simple search for gateway games either here or boardgamegeek.com will give you more than plenty of answers.   Played this at snakes   lattes. we pushed the sticks all the way in and the balloon never popped. It was fully inflated, but the sticks were real cheap and kept bending. So much anxiety during the game, with no pay off. That's one big blue ball.    They've been there at least the last two years. So are some of those chains in the galleria mall. I hate that. Leave this to local restaurants only.       Pour frosty into everyone's order of fries.    http://i.imgur.com/iJlGi4S.gif   I believe the JCC has leagues. At the very least, I know they do for squash.   Yea, there were a couple times in the first third or half of the book as it jumped to a new chapter   date that I had to skim back real quick to remind myself which date I had just been in. But once you got into it, it was easy to tell.    I asked my SO if she wanted to play a couple of my unplayed games before my new ones arrive in August and she just laughed at me :(   Not directly, no. Tactics cards don't count for anything until they're actually put into play.    If a flag is (correctly) claimed, it cannot be unclaimed later because a tactics card would allow a wild or extend it 4 cards needed instead of 3. If the flag is claimed, it's claimed for good. Which is the reason for the "advanced" rule it offers in the instructions, that a player cannot claim a flag until the start of their following turn, so to allow a player to stop a flag from being claimed via a tactics card.    source: I asked this same question awhile ago here :) enjoy the game, it's great!   **Abyss** has absolutely gorgeous artwork.   **Tokaido** is a very clean, attractive looking game.    **Evolution** has beautiful, watercolor style art.   In **Fresco**, you play as a master painter and it's a very good looking game.   **Pictomania** is a pictionary-esque game so it's drawing based with a little bit more going on. Lots of fun.    /u/r2d8 getinfo   I thought Doerr's writing was some of the richest and beautiful prose I've come across. His descriptions of geographical settings, or especially the feelings/emotions/thoughts of his characters were astounding. I loved the long, detailed, textured, rich descriptions amid the quick, staccato chapters and asymmetrical timeline. The immensity for which I ended up caring about all these characters, whether minor or major left me not wanting the book to be over. Can't say enough good things about this novel.    Oh yea. I wrote above that our group's first game was Settlers. Then we got into Puerto Rico. Played both of those a ton as we got into the hobby. Settlers doesn't come out anymore, but Puerto Rico does from time to time. Love it.    Yep. One thing I liked too is that you can basically pick how long you want the game to be. You can start with a ton of money or very little money if you want a longer or quicker game.    It's fun. I have to play it more to give a better opinion. It was a newer purchase as well so I've only had a chance to play 2P once. So there's always that first play stumbling. But I enjoyed it a lot. I think it'll play better with 3 or 4 people.    Ha, I guess our mutual acquisition disorders unite us. We have steady group of 5. One guy doesn't really buy any games, another has a handful, and then the other 3 of us are the main collectors. Rounds the collection out nicely as our tastes reflect our collections. I think we have only have a few games that overlap.    In my gaming group, my one friend has a collection twice the size of this and another is close behind me. They have Glory to Rome and Innovation. Enjoy them both!   I've definitely had my eye on Roll for the Galaxy and La Granja. I'll take a closer look at Elysium and Marco Polo. I've had a bunch of recent acquisitions and the kickstarters coming soon, so I'll add them to my holiday wish list...if my acquisition disorder can hold out that long :)   I like Dead of Winter. My collection was almost all heavier euros, so I've been trying to round it out a bit to have something for all occasions, and getting some lighter games when the brain burn gets high. Which is why 1775 is so high on my favorites. It's definitely not Twilight Struggle. You're moving armies around the board and it's a ton of direct conflict with some dice roll (which is done in a really neat way). The 2v2 (you can also play 1v1 with each person controlling both armies on a side) aspect creates a great environment for the game. I love it. It's on the lighter side, it's not terribly long at all but it has great replay-value and a good amount of strategy and decision making. It's just fun.    [Imgur Link](http://i.imgur.com/7Hcaw2i.jpg)  I had gotten into the hobby 4-5 years ago when my friend picked up Catan, and we played that to death over the next year. Then he found Puerto Rico and that opened the floodgates for our group. A couple years ago I picked up Dominion Intrigue and Agricola to start my collection. It's grown and grown from there.

I have the Evolution + expansion   Mottanai Kickstarters coming in August (hopefully) so I'll have to get those played before the new ones come in. Fortune   Glory I just hate. Maybe it'd be more fun if I gave it more of a chance but there's just too much going on for me to make it fun for what it is.    let me know what you think!   There are a ton.

Near perfect condition  [W]  * Cash/Amazon $  * Roll For The Galaxy  * Keyflower  * Eminent Domain Expansions  * Core World Expansions   I know this game gets a ton of love here, but it just falls flat with me. I bought it while aboard the hype train after its initial release, and have played it about 10 times since. The first couple plays were fun, but then it just never progressed. My biggest issue is that I never get a real sense of completion. The castles seem small at the end, and there tends to be AP by the master-builder which stagnates the game at times. Each play, I'm just underwhelmed after.    You described **Eclipse**. Save for a little bit more and buy Eclipse.    Star Realms plays just like Ascension basically. You're not building anything. Just laying cards out. If you have to pick between Star Realms and Race For the Galaxy, it's RFTG every day of the week. Star Realms isn't on Race's level at all.    Bummed that Xia: Legends of a Drift System got shut out. That game is freaking awesome.    Please rearrange the top shelf so Terra Mystica Fire   Ice and Sherlock Holmes aren't in between much wider boxes. It's making me uncomfortable.    Other than that...great collection!   I get that for purchasing, but Costco still allows me in the building to see if a membership is something I'm interested in   If I have to create an account just to look at your website...f*** you, website.       I own **Five Tribes** and my best friend has **Istanbul** and **Concordia**. I would say, hands down, Concordia. It plays wonderfully with all player counts, the replay-value is tremendous with the randomized goods tiles, card order and now with the various boards. I love it.

Easy!   In my lifetime I was roughly 0-6375463549 in playing Carcassonne against my friend John. Each game, played out like the last: my meeples scattered in unfinished castles, starving along roads to nowhere, slaughtered in fields outnumbered two to one. I'd watch his scoring marker danced along the track, circling and circling the board. Adding expansions only made the misery more prolonged, more insufferable.    Yet I persevered. Then one day (oh this glorious day!), did the tiles fall into my favor. Square by square, I completed majestic, shielded castles. I built long, windy roads that had a beginning and end. I frolicked in the fields my opponent dared not enter. And I won. By the angels in heaven and the hammer of Thor, I won.    With my new found confidence and Carcassonne prowess, we reset the battle field so I could take back to back victories.    And I got killed.   But I will always have that one. That sweet, sweet one. Damn you, John.

I couldn't put it down. Loved it. The world he painted in this was so magical and rich and vibrant, you could feel it.   One of my favorite openers as well. From the first sentence you just know something is off about this world and are hooked.   Ha. Cloud Atlas was one of the books I knew I'd hate after the first page. I always finish the book I'm reading. I don't give up on the book, I just can't leave them unfinished...unless the book is Cloud Atlas   I've had this book on my shelf for probably 2 years now and haven't opened it up. Maybe I'll finally have to this summer.   Pinochle all night.    What drew you in about the book? Something with the character or a specific quote? The language and/or the prose? How did it go from there...were you disappointed at the end or did you still love it?      Playing battle line my friend took a flag with 345 straight flush. The cards played out meant I couldn't take this flag at all so he claimed it. However, later a tactics card came into my hand that gave me a wild 8 of any suit which gave me the ability for a better straight flush. Can I still play here and take the flag back or is it dead?    This looks very similar to Wits   Wagers. If this is a retheme of Fauna, can people familiar with Fauna shed some light on the differences between that and Wits   Wagers?   and if you run out of space, you can put the stuff from the shoeboxes into the empty game boxes.    [You're right. No jokes allowed on the internet!](http://i.imgur.com/EHZ5y6n.jpg)   [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/l7mScRq.jpg)   http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?q=power+grid restrict_sr=on   First...I own Domion Intrigue along with Hinterlands, Dark Ages, Guilds and the rest of my group has the base, Seaside, Prosperity. I've played it a ton. Don't let some of the poor artwork blow the game for you. And to the theme nuts out there...who the hell cares. It's a game where you use the 10 kingdom cards available to get the most VP's. And it works beautifully. With the wealth of expansions (and cards in each expansion) the breadth of replay value is, perhaps, unmatched. It's an easy game to learn, and one that also has a lot of depth and strategy (see www.dominionstrategy.com for that). Dominion has reached the status it has because it is great.   Secondly, I also own **Eminent Domain**, **Core Worlds**, **Trains** and **Star Realms**. I guess I like deck builders. Dominion will always be my favorite, but I love the mechanics of Eminent Domain and Core Worlds. They each offer unique experience (Eminent Domain with role sections and followers, Core Worlds with invasion types, worlds, etc). You can't go wrong. The only downside to Core Worlds is that you really need the expansion(s) to make it a complete game so it turns into a $60 game. If theme is important for you, which it seems to be, Core Worlds offers, in my opinion, the best theme of any deck builder.   Trains works well with theme as well with the enhanced mechanic of an actual board and pieces. It's pretty much Dominion with a board. You feel more of an experience like you're building a train line (even if it just little cubes).   Star Realms is fun for up to 5-10 plays.   DC deck builder is terrible.

The app randomizes this so each game is different. So you use the app to take a picture of two ingredient cards and it tells you what it becomes.    **Alchemists** uses an app as a core mechanic in the game.    **Alchemists** is a pretty heavy game. There's a lot going on there and the teaching/learning time is *steep*. It's a really great game, but if you're wary about dropping some heavy on your friends, you might want to wait on that. **Ca$h 'n Gun$** and **Mascarade** aren't really competitive. They're more just social party games and Mascarade offers some deduction elements.    **Battlestar Galactica** plays well with 5P if you want to go the co-op/traitor route. Take a look at **Power Grid** for a classic medium weight that plays well at 5.  **Kemet** is a medium-light game that works great at 3-5. It's quick, action packed war game and not too hard to get into at all. You can even combine it with **Cyclades** which is super cool.

All the meanwhile, you would be left with full reign over the regular gems.     News show with only positive, uplifting news.    Well, it would take awhile. You can only hold 3 cards at a time. And you can only get one wild at a time. Theoretically, a person could get 3 wild gems and then play one of their cards-in-hand with all regular gems, while holding their wilds, but that'd be hard to do. And not remotely efficient. While they're taking 1 wild at a time and not playing any cards, everyone else is getting 2-3 gems turn and/or buying cards   You can take 1 wild token when you stash a card into your hand. You can't have more than 10 total tokens in front of you at any given time.

It was a good hour of hearing about games I've never heard of that no one will want to play :)   During clan wars, I've been using a hog attack strategy that seems to be pretty hit   miss lately. It's especially miss if there are inferno towers. I use 38 hog riders (max), 10 barbarians (max) and 25 archers (max).    I typically send the hogs in at the same side side of the base, but slightly apart to form 2 close by fronts. For spells, I drop 4 heal spells for them throughout the attack.    I run into issues if 1. there are inferno towers, they destroy the hogs. or 2. I get unlucky and hit a lot of traps. If the base also has a good amount of upgraded wizard towers or archers, that gives them problems.    What could I do to tweak this attack to make it a little more viable and consistent? Thanks.    Ah, the ever motivational Gilfoyle.    No, still follow the rule. It adds a little strategy of blocking your opponent from grabbing 2 fairly easier. You'll still be able to grab 2 if you really need (I'd still advice grabbing 3 two turns in a row) fairly regularly as you or your opponent returns gems to the stack      Yep. Brain fart. Thanks for pointing that out   Is that as huge as it looks?  	129
 People need to seriously chill out with this nonsense. It was wrong for the biker to steal and damage someone's property.

I'm not an expert but this seems correct to me. It is probably even more ideal for the hormone secretion to be spread out around the body in this case. I would imagine that the implanted ovary fragments do not produce as much of the necessary hormones as a natural ovary but spreading out the fragments would help to mitigate this issue. Also with 11 fragments throughout the body if one fails to take, it will not significantly effect the overall procedure. The procedure would be more likely to fail if the entire ovary was grafted into a single location.   [Not exactly the same picture, but it is close.

This is actually the original article I mentioned it will definitely be helpful to give it a read again.      Ah OK, looks like I was remembering these multiple issues as one single issue with just one of the rovers. Thanks for clarifying! I'm sure the engineering team designing the wheels knew damage of this sort would be a possibility but I am guessing they either did not correctly estimate the likelihood of holes of this size appearing on the wheels or they missed some variable in the prototype design. Do you know what the weak point of the wheel is and if the engineers knew about it prior to launch and just decided it was an acceptable design limitation? Or were they kind of taken by surprise by the environment and stresses encountered on Mars?   I remember reading a very in depth and interesting article on the issues that have arose with the wheels of one of the rovers(not 100% sure which it was). Basically the back left wheel has accrued over the years pretty sizeable hole so NASA actually begun to only drive the rover backwards to limit the risk of allowing the hole to continue to get bigger and eventually to cripple the poor rover. I always assumed this meant some NASA scientist had to manually drive the rover backwards but I guess it does make more sense to just change the programming. Although I'm not sure this is the case because the sensors are obviously designed for sensing forward not backward. Do you happen to know if in this special case the rover is still moved autonomously?   But is it really? Don't you see something(maybe the cup the detective is drinking from) with the name Kobayashi on it implying Verbal just made it up. Isn't that the case for pretty much everything in the movie?  In the big picture though this is not really relevant I guess.   Don't forget the limp disappearing and him getting into the car with the lawyer(can't remember his name). If you watch the movie a second time around, there is a scene while Verbal is being interrogated where you can actually see him smile while he and the cop are talking about Kaiser Sose but the cop(also can't remember his name!) is behind him and can't see his face. Great movie. Great actor.   One of the biggest qualms I have with Christianity is that it is so unchristian to have someone go to hell based on where and when they are born. Human sacrifice was part of the religion of the Aztecs(or Mayan or both?) as well as I'm sure, many other cultures. Many people born in these times and places didn't really choose to be complacent with or actively participate in murder. They were born into a culture where it was an inexorable part of their religion. They couldn't have repented because it wasn't wrong for them. Yet according to the bible, although it is fairly ambiguous and up to interpretation, it is very likely they would go to hell for these kind of acts. How is that Christian?   Exactly IE a "confidential informant" never revealed to the court for privacy reasons or some other bullshit.    This is true.

During its descent into a black hole, an object will pick up a substantial amount of velocity due to the gravitation pull and this will be added to its original velocity before acted on by the black hole. I'm assuming that eventually after it merges with the black hole, the object will be brought a halt relative to the black hole. Where does the kinetic energy of the object go? Will the black hole accelerate in the direction of the collision due to the impact, if you can call it that? Is the black hole just too massive for this impact to have any substantial effect? It seems to me like the object would be accelerated to very high speed because of the intense gravitational pull. Due to the random distribution of objects entering the black hole, do the effects on the velocity of the black hole just cancel out because they occur in all directions?   Kind of related question, where does the kinetic energy of the mass being sucked into the black hole go? I assume when an object enters a black hole it stops moving so shouldn't the kinetic energy from its velocity just before impact be transferred to the black hole? Let's say an object the size of a star collides directly with the black hole, when the objects collide will be the black hole gain the momentum of the star and be pushed in the direction of the collision? Is the black hole just too massive for this to have any substantial effect?      Yes they literally charge your property. You even end up with an absurd case name like:   NEBRASKA V.

Found the answer to my own question actually. In case anyone else is wondering. In a litre of freshwater the oxygen content is 8 cm^3 per litre compared to 210 in the same volume of air.  A person breathes 7 or 8 liters of air per minute. Air is about 20% oxygen. But when you exhale, your breath is about 15% oxygen, so you consumed about 5%. Therefore, a person uses about 550 liters of pure oxygen each day.  So air has 26.25x as much oxygen as the same volume of water. That means a human would have to breathe 183.75-210 liters of water per minute which is ~12600 liters per hour and ~302400 liters per day. This is of course assuming the same oxygen diffusing rate in water as air. Oxygen actually has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water. This means you'd have to breathe about 2,100,000 liters of air a minute to get the same amount of oxygen. Damn fish have it pretty tough.

They designed android to make sure people would use their search engine on smartphones.      Yeah the way next gen sequencing works is you barcode each sample(in this case a genome) by adding a specific sequence of 4-8 nucleotides to the ends of the DNA fragments of that sample. By doing this you can sequence up to 96 samples simultaneously, all mixed together and sequenced at the same time. After gathering all the sequencing data, you simply use those barcode sequences(which will always be at the ends of the DNA fragments) to differentiate between the samples.   The barcodes often have to be specifically designed based on the genome you are sequencing and choosing and adding these barcodes to the DNA fragments is a major part of library prep. Also before adding these barcodes you break up the DNA strands(millions or billions of nucleotides) into much shorter fragments(usually 400-800 nucleotides).   During library prep, you have to copy the original strand of DNA many times and break it up at different points to ensure you get fragments that overlap. In the sequencing process you need these overlapping fragments to determine the where in the overall genome that specific fragment is. A lot of times in order to get a sequencing accuracy of 1 error in 1000 nucleotides(pretty good for most applications), each nucleotide will have a coverage of at least 30x meaning 30 of those fragments overlap on that specific nucleotide.   This is awesome, any chance you could link to one of these higher resolution photos? Can't seem to find anything on google.    Once the library(the reagents the machine will use to do the synthesis) is prepared it would take an hour to a couple hours of labor.    Just to let you know, part 2 is out and you can see it here. http://documentaryheaven.com/louis-theroux-by-reason-of-insanity/   Working mirror(with part 2 also!): http://documentaryheaven.com/louis-theroux-by-reason-of-insanity/   I think I wasn't really clear in my explanation. There is a lot of labor involved, but not as much as you might think. Setting everything up is the hard part, Library prep is more labor intensive than actual sequencing. In fact with everything set up, getting the sequences of bases requires minimal user input and is almost completely automated. You do need a trained professional to be able to carry out these sequencing processes, but it isn't that far removed from standard lab protocols every biologist learns in school.  What is costly for next gen sequencing is the limited sequencing resources; IE these are really damn expensive devices, you can only sequence a limited number of samples for a given time and increased accuracy of the sequencing data means a longer sequencing process. I hope that makes sense , I'm sorry I feel like I'm having trouble explaining all this because it really is very esoteric. [Check out this PDF for more in-depth information](http://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/illumina_sequencing_introduction.pdf)   This is really hard to say. Right now the bioinformatics and computational genomics fields have way more information than we know what to do with. Gathering sequencing data is currently much more straight forward than analyzing it.   For example I'll use E. coli, a prokaryote with a "simple" genome which is orders of magnitude shorter than a human genome. E coli is by far the most studied prokaryotic genome and yet we are still struggling to perfect something as seemingly easy as accurate gene prediction. The head researcher of one research team I worked on, a brilliant man and a pioneer in the field of genetics who currently does computational genomics work for the CDC tracking the spread and and evolution of various diseases, told me once he thinks we only have about 80% of E. Coli's genes mapped correctly. I'm not talking about gene function or anything complicated like that, I'm talking about literally just where the genes start and the genes end.This is a simple genome and the one we probably know the most about. It's an organism for which ethics are not a restraint if you will, we can starve E. Coli bacteria or subject them to various environmental stressors without any moral qualms. Studying E. Coli is much more conducive to the scientific process than studying humans and yet we still know so little about it. But I digress, I'm sure in the future we will unlock these enigmatic secrets of DNA and life that we don't understand right now. I'm sure we will be eventually able to take someone's DNA and accurately figure out their facial structure. Whether it will be in 5 years or in 50 I can't say.   I think you are correct, genetic phenotyping is very much a field in it's infancy. [Here's a great article in The New York Times that paints, in my opinion, an accurate portriant of the current state of the field.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/science/building-face-and-a-case-on-dna.html?_r=0)   The $1000 genome sequencing is possible with a device made by Illumina called the HiSeqX. This sequencing platform consists of 10 of Illumina's HiSeq devices, each of which costs somewhere around a couple million dollars. Illumina is basically the Microsoft of the genetic industry and the vast majority of all sequencing is done using their platforms.  The $1000 cost comes from the reagents and other materials that it takes to do what is called library prep. This consists of preparing oligos, short 4-8 nucleotide sequences that are used as barcodes to identify various DNA samples during the sequencing process. PCR is used to amplify the regions of interest and total quantity of DNA and there are a whole bunch of other steps to genome sequencing that are much too complicated to explain here.   I'll start with me, I work in the field of genetics. Genome sequencing capabilities are currently exceeding Moore's law. Just this year we got to a point where it only costs $1000 and a day or two to sequence a human genome. The human genome project(1990-2003) took 10 years to gather the data, 3 years to analyze it and cost $3 billion.  We can do crazy things now like genetic phenotyping where facial structure can be roughly (and somewhat rudimentarily) approximated from someone's DNA. This has applications in forensics cases. Fetal genome sequencing is becoming possible and personalized medicine and cancer treatment is no longer just for the extremely wealthy. We are without a doubt watching a biological revolution unfold before our eyes that will change the world just as much as the digital/information revolution has.  Note: I feel obligated to mention the $1000 dollar genome is sequenced with a machine costing tens of millions of dollars right now though.      I'll start with me, I work in the field of genetics. Genome sequencing capabilities are currently exceeding Moore's law. Just this year we got to a point where it only costs $1000 and a day or two to sequence a human genome.

How would the access to patient data work? Would it be proprietary where researchers can only access data on specific diseases they are studying or would it be entirely open for the scientific community or the entire public or would it be somewhere in between? Who would be responsible for creating, maintaining and paying for such a database?  How would an open access database of cancer patient genomes(for example) ensure that all HIPAA standards for patient privacy and anonymity are met? It seems to me that even if a patient name is not linked to the data, a sequenced genome or partially sequenced genome is something that is incredibly patient specific and personal, possibly to the point of offering patient identification or threatening the patient's health information privacy. Has this come up as an issue at all? I'm not all that well versed in HIPAA compliance so I may be completely wrong about this.

What we can do is extrapolate based on geological data and the like. This study makes the claim that direct evidence for the contribution of ocean acidification to this mass extinction up until this point was lacking. The authors then go on to claim they have been able to extrapolate the ocean pH during this period via isotope data and quantitative modeling and thus provide more definitive evidence. The substantial increase in the acidity of the ocean coincides with a "rapid and large injection of carbon" into the atmosphere which in turn coincides with geological records of marine fauna dying off.   The title is  pretty much just a summary of the study and really has minimal sensationalism. I don't understand what you're getting at or your argument at all.   The same person who Citizen Kane was basically about by the way.   This is exactly what I thought as well and I've got a degree in biomedical engineering and am fairly scientifically literate. The irony in that comment is almost palpable.    The next sentence in the abstract is  We present a high-resolution seawater pH record across this interval, using boron isotope data combined with a quantitative modeling approach.  In other words, the evidence for this event was lacking, here's some more evidence. This makes me think /u/so_I_says_to_mabel literally stopped reading after that first sentence. The is irony is palpable.   Yes but a lot of the times it's not an innate character defect, it's acquired because of the drugs and the feeling of not having them. Not trying to justify it but heroin can turn even the nicest sober person into a fiending junkie.      Collision is a bit of a misnomer in regards to what is going to occur between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies. I think merging is a more apt term, yes the galaxies are headed toward each other and will meet but the vast distances between stars means it is highly improbable that many stars or planetary systems will actually collide. This is especially the case for stars like ours that are towards the outer rim of the galaxies.   Instead the two galaxies and the majority of their stars will merge into a single galaxy. Some stars will be ejected into intergalactic space in the process but these are by far the minority. Chances are the life will be relatively unaffected by this event.   In terms of your first point, I think large and self sustaining spacecraft would mitigate the issue. Imagine a ship intended for generational interstellar travel with tens or hundreds of thousands of inhabitants. You set out and maybe your grandchildren reach the your destination. Relativity also means the faster you are traveling, the father you can go in, from your POV, a shorter amount of time. Maybe 100 years pass for inhabitants of the ship, while 1000 years pass for the rest of the galaxy. Would humans be willing to embark on such a voyage? Would they finally reach their destination only to find others already there due to some technological advance while they were travelling? I don't know but to me colonizing the galaxy or just other nearby stars seems possible at the very least.    I love all these armchair scientists that of course think their assumptions about how studies work are exactly how things are.    But why male models?   We must focus on camping, for in tents purposes.   Awesome answer, thank you. Hopefully I get to see something like this in my lifetime. Do you think this is feasible in the next couple decades?   Another question, we can determine the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere with less resolution than a 30x30 picture right? What does that require? I think I remember hearing finding a significant amount of atmospheric oxygen is very strong evidence for life because that wouldn't happen inorganically. Is that right?   If a large enough telescope existed would it be possible to see an earth-like planet like [Gliese 667 Cc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc) or [Kepler-438b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) in the visible spectrum in any kind of meaningful resolution?  Let's assume perfect viewing conditions IE maximum illumination of the planet relative to earth, correct plane, etc. and also that exposure time isn't a constraint. At distances like that, are there photons reflecting off the planet that even make it to earth or is it too far? How big would a telescope have to be to be able to make out an earthlike planet at the distance of 23.6 or 470 lightyears?  How far does something the size of a planet have to be before the probability of encountering a reflected photon with a large telescope is negligible?     Source?   Can't we actually thank Robert S. McNamara for that? He was the CEO of Ford when they implemented the seat belt. According to the the documentary The Fog of War, he is almost directly responsible for the seat belt.   By the way, watch that documentary if you haven't seen it already. McNamara was the secretary of defense for a major portion of the Vietnam War. He served under Kennedy and was fired/quit partially through LBJ's administration. The Academy Award-winning documentary, augmented by archival footage, gives the conflicted McNamara a platform on which he attempts to confront his and the U.S. government's actions in Southeast Asia in light of the horrors of modern warfare, the end of ideology and the punitive judgment of history.    Nope, inertia is why going from 100 to 0 mph in 2 seconds puts so much stress on your body(and the car). All that kinetic energy has to go somewhere so there is a massive force exerted on the car and anything in the car(you). It's the correct term in this case.   I live in Austin too and actually work at Chuys right now. Hopefully you know what that is, if not find the nearest one and go there immediately, it is the best tex-mex you'll ever have. Anyways the amount of morbidly obese that come in daily disturbs me, I serve multiple people each day that can't even be seated at booths because they simply won't fit. Our food is definitely not healthy and I watch them eat easily 4000 calories in a single meal. I can't help but feel I'm enabling them and it's kind of a moral dilemma for me. I really don't like watching and even helping people to shorten their lifespan 10, 20, 30 years.    I've always been skinny myself (6' and 155 lbs) and I'm lucky in that respect because I don't work out or really make an active effort to eat healthy. I just don't understand how people can let it get to the point of morbid obesity and don't think I ever will. I try not to judge people for it but its hard.      [This article ](http://ukraineatwar.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/analyzing-cctv-footage-that-seemed-to.html) has a pretty good analysis of the video and what it claims seems very plausible. I agree with it that it definitely seems the truck was in on it.   Need some porn? Bing that shit!   Gilgamesh is the main character of an Akkadian poem that is considered the first great work of literature in history so I'm sure its a pretty common username.   The ones at my college have a tolerance of .05mm  I believe so you print things fairly small. Still might have to make the beads a little bigger though.   Halt dein Klapper du Warmduscher.   Yeah, I don't understand the notion that even if life did exist on Titan we wouldn't be able to tell it is life. Just go to Titan and take a look at some methane under a microscope. Going one step further, filter out everything above a certain size(the size of a methane molecule maybe) and study that. If there is life I'm sure it will be significant larger than inorganic molecules regardless of if it is aqueous or not.   You don't have to know exactly what chemicals to look for necessarily. Just look for something out of the ordinary, something that shouldn't be there if the world is inorganic.   Example: Possible evidence for this form of life on Titan was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of Johns Hopkins University; a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward diffusion at a rate of roughly 10^25 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface. As Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects Chris McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present. The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by Chris McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms reducing acetylene to methane. While restating the biological hypothesis, McKay cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are to be considered more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a non-living surface catalyst enabling acetylene to react with hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.  [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry#Methane_and_other_hydrocarbons)   This is really not all that different from bioluminescence, both are electromagneticradiation and differ only in wavelength. I'd imagine it is possible but would be surprised to see it happen. Remember evolution has no foresight, nature isn't going to start producing radio waves randomly, there has to be a benefit to it.and it has to develop gradually. What would be the point of an animal producing EM radiation at a wavelength imperceptible to every other creature? A method of producing radio waves and an organ which could perceive it would have to develop concurrently.   DNA is a highly polar molecule, which has evolved over millions of years to be stable and functional in aqueous solution. Some organic solvents (methanol, formamide, pyridine, or dimethyl sulfoxide) induce unfolding and strand separation, or formation of toroid-like conformations,while others, such as glycerol or room-temperature ionic liquids, maintain the duplex structure. In one computational simulation of DNA in CCl4(fairly similar to methane at least in terms of polarity) the DNA becomes stiffer and the landscape is more frustrated in the apolar phases, meaning a presence of significant energy barriers for biological process. Compact states (likely fairly similar to the aqueous states of DNA) were observed if the DNA was neutralized, while more extended conformations are expected if the DNA maintains its ionic state in water.  [Source](http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/~gportella/pdf/Arcella_jpcb_2014.pdf)  In simpler terms, we don't really know because it very hard to study DNA in apolar solutions. Theoretical models seem to point towards biological processes being at least somewhat inhibited but nothing is conclusive. I would imagine the chemical structure of the methane-DNA equivalent would be moderately to significantly different from what we see with aqueous solutions.  	113

 My girlfriend gets stinging in her eyes more so when she cuts Red Onions than White, but I'm the other way around - White onions affect me more.   Explanation in the comments.      Woman   Hey guys,  My girlfriend and I are heading up to Cape Tribulation, hiring our own car for three days to get out and about - we plan to do Mossman Gorge and Solar Whisper cruises; what else would you recommend?  Thanks in advance!   She'd be able to do a great Rhinoa (FF8) cosplay...and/or Tifa (FF7)   - When Fitz loses Nighteyes - Lyra   Will's sacrifice at the end of The Amber Spyglass      "God your mean"  ...you're   u/LadyAzrael - I admire your compassion! Good work    Whenever someone says "Touch" I always like to follow with "...magic hallway."   Good for you! And good to hear    Based on the tiny cross-section of messages shown above- it's like he's baiting you to keep in contact with him. Especially when he repeats your "OK". Hope you can distance yourself properly sometime    Well done OP- that was frustrating to read, must have been so hard to stay polite.    I feel there's some extensive backstory here? Still, "I'm drunk" has never been an excuse for anything.   I seriously hope English wasn't his first language...there's bad typing and then there's this!  OP- sorry for pigs that don't understand what "no" means! Was frustrating to read, let alone experience!   Hi guys - do Etihad offer a fragile baggage service? I remember a few years ago my little brother bought a digeridoo in Oz and BA had a designated check-in area for it as it was fragile...it got it's own special bubble wrapping and careful handling - do Etihad operate the same service?  If so does anyone know the cost (whether it's based on size, weight or whatever)? Or can direct me to the part of their website that has these prices? I can't find it myself!  Thanks to any and all!   So basically I'm considering buying a ps4 out here in Oz because it's so much cheaper than back home in the UK. I know the plugs will be different, but that's easily fixable with an adaptor- just wondering if there'd be any other issues?      I never thought I'd be able to say it, but here it is...the fuck did i just read!?   Classy! /s   The broken English structure makes the comment about your "inner part" that much more sinister/creepy, even though he's (hopefully) talking about your personality!   Read your profile!? What stupidly high standards have you got, bitch! /s   I'm now rereading that whole message in his voice. It fits!   Oh...God...the grammar...the spelling...the lack of working English!! *headdesk*   Haha! "We're a good match because I like heels" - clearly missed a catch there OP /s   Personally, I think you handled this well. Unfortunately, there are those of our gender who (as we so regularly see on this sub) can't take rejection, and either backpedal immediately (like your example here) or go straight on the offensive. Keep on sticking to your point- it's the right thing to do, though by his reaction I think it might turn more negative if he doesn't bend his mindset more. Good luck!   You sure are popular with them! I enjoyed the straight-up "no" response best (Y)   No, on a working holiday visa we count as residents for tax purposes, as we technically live in Australia for the duration of our visa.  We've been paying tax the whole time we've been working- it's just claiming it back I'm not 100% sure about the process of.   Hey all,  We'll be going from Sydney, on or around the 23rd of September this year, there are two of us flying, and we'd like as much included as possible (all inclusive would be the best obviously).  I've had a look at various holiday package websites, but none of them allow you to search from a departing location without a specific destination. Cruises are allowable, but unfortunately they're pretty expensive.  Ideally we'd like something in the region of $500 total if possible. We've got a weeks gap in our itinerary that we need to fill, so any suggestions (links would be even better if you have them) would be helpful thanks!   Hey all,  My girlfriend and I have been living and working in Australia on a working holiday visa since November; we are currently working on a farm, and will be until the end of July.  Our question is, for the tax period that we'll be working throughout July, do we have to wait until next July (the end of the new tax year) to apply for the tax return, or can we do it once we've left the country (we're going home in November)?  Hope someone can help advise us!   If it happens again I'd report him.   Up voted for the awesome sarcasm!   On behalf of those of us who AREN'T pigs, do whatever pleases you- that's what we'd prefer :)   I'm sorry this has happened to you- I hate being in a game/group where this happens (haven't gamed for a while, but used to play WoW, LoL, CS all the time). There's really no excuse for it. Keep your head held high and your gamer score up! And don't take any shit from the small-minded pigs!   I cringe at the appalling grammar and spelling, am amused by the obvious obliviousness of this guy (see what I did there!), and I applaud your parting shot.   Yeah- "you're a liar" quick, block her so she can't respond and disprove my misplaced egotism!   Well done OP- a very nice display of how to deal with idiots! Also very entertaining :)   "Oh my god you don't like my ultra-inappropriate advances: you're a liar!!"   Wait...so this doesn't work!? /s   Damn, google translate was my fallback- we've tried explaining things slowly in English before (in regards to other, minor problems we've had), and they've nodded along and agreed but not taken any notice (I hope it's that they just didn't understand, and aren't just dicks).  Will try google translate to see if it gets the point across, and if not I'll speak to the Korean guy who runs our hostel- he might not want to get involved in inter-guest issues, but he may have to!   We're in Australia; it is winter and rains 1 out of every seven days, but there's still enough heat during the daytime to dry clothes here (I feel for you in NZ!).  I'll try and use google translate to make sure they understand.   I know it isn't specifically a Korean issue, but they have trouble with English as it is, and I didn't want to confront them without knowing if just coming out and saying it would be ruder than saying it in a certain way (IDK).  I agree - the food labelling is just because we're already riled about the other stuff; as I said, the only reason that it feels really insulting at all is because they seemed to have suddenly decided to do it, we've lived for six weeks together without it being a problem *shrugs*.  We only do our washing once a week, in one big load, whereas they wash a small amount every single day - once again they've changed their behavior. The first couple of weeks, on the one day that we washed our stuff and used the clothes line and rack, they'd hang their small load from the bunk bed in their room and/or the dining room chairs - but now they just move our wet stuff into a pile. It boils down to the same as the music - the lack of consideration.  Thanks for the feedback both of you- I'll see if I can explain to them how it is from our point of view.   Glad to hear it! It's when these idiots get in people's heads that the madness starts.   Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place to post, if not please advise where to go!  We (my girlfriend and I) are currently living in a hostel-owned house with an Italian guy and a Korean couple.  We've managed to explain issues of shower usage to them, so that we all can have hot showers after working on farms, but there are still little issues cropping up here and there.  The main two are personal property and respect - for example we got up this morning and started listening to some low-level music in the living room (quite late in the morning, so not disturbing anyone by any means); the lady of the couple came down to start cooking lunch (the kitchen/living room is one big room) and put a tv show or video on on her phone and turned up the volume loud enough to smother our music. Similarly they put on their own music when they come down to cook or just sit in the living room and turn it up to cover our own without asking us to turn ours off or if we mind - there seems to be no form of respect or consideration in this respect.  The other is to do with washing - we have to share our drying rack and washing line outside, and they wash their clothes without checking the availability of the drying facilities - if we have clothes out when their washing finishes, they'll pile it up on one end of the drying rack, even if its still wet, to hang theirs out instead. Again there seems to be no consideration for others.  A smaller issue is labelling - we've lived in the same house for almost two months now, and two weeks ago the Korean couple suddenly started writing their name on EVERYTHING they own food-wise. The Italian always eats out, and doesn't bring any food home with him, and my girlfriend and I have plenty of our own food and have never used anything of theirs. As I said it's a small issue, but it seems insulting almost, as if they expect us to take their food (we all have our own cupboards/fridge/freezer shelves, so there's no chance of accidentally taking something not belonging to us).  Sorry for the rant; as I said, what's the best way to approach them about these problems? As they seem to have no clue that they as people can affect others (though seemingly they're very aware that we can affect them). Hope someone can help!   "What crawled up your ass!? I'll leave you the fuck alone......I miss you."  Yeaaah...   Fantastic ending comment, 10/10 would read again.

 He also sold tractors as well.   *because, once you ride a Mason, nothing else cuts it.. Vroom! Vroom!*   You were one of the good ones Hank..  But your son's a jackass.    "What's a Vole?"  "Dunno, let's find out. Falcon! Bring us back, a Vole"  "Huh!, so Bill's a Vole"      Not according to this article..   http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/apple-loses-us62b-in-minutes-as-shares-crash-on-disappointing-results-20150722-gihqz0.html   Could this just be a combination of people waiting for the iphone 6s, and the Apple watch not moving as expected?      They're some good looking kids, for 2 ugly people...  Another classic nerd moment for Hank - "yep, you have 4 power outlets and theyre all grounded"   I'll be honest, I don't believe you.  One of the fastest tablets I've ever owned or used, yet, somehow yours is unbearably slow.  Get it replaced for a new one.   Honestly? I would've been OK with $349 AUD for the 32gb model I have.   Enable OEM unlock in developer options..   Unfortunately, giving them away is the only way Google will increase the numbers of the Nexus 9 out in the wild.  It's a great tablet, but not worth the money I paid for it.   We should do this at least once a week!   When it comes to full sugar, I still lean towards coke, but when it comes to sugar free, Pepsi Max smashed coke Zero and Diet in every way possible.   For science, check out these 2 sites and tell me which one you think is owned by Rupert Murdoch..   Www.Smh.com.au   Www.News.com.au     Ha! Hopefully it will be running android.. I'm sure I can get root access, install a custom ROM, and make it show everyone at fault.  I better make a nandroid backup in case I get the car stuck in a boot loop.   Am I the only one admiring his lawn?   There is always a light at the end mate, not sure what it is or when we'll get there, but we will.  You doing / taking anything to control it? Don't let it get the better of you    Is it just me or is it blurry as fuck?   Pulp Fiction.  Every part of that movie could be a ride.   You have to be a firm 'cunt' in my role..  I try not to bring that attitude home with me.  And yes, IT role.   Could be mate, but I'm not really one to be diagnosing that for you.  You going through anything in life at the moment that could be causing it?  I was going to add that in there, but I didn't really think people felt that way just because I do. I've had a rough 2 years and get that same feeling, bud.   You're not alone.   Out of curiosity, are Chinese restaurants still a thing in the US?  Down under, they are closing up daily, Thai restaurants are the new 'in thing'   Because you probably feel like you're drifting apart from them and they don't share the same interests as you.  Another could be tbat they are friends of convenience, but you're at a different stage of life.   Being at work, thanks for the NSFW tags, I'll wait till I get home.. :)   Not really argue worthy, but I have seen "what to do" many times on /b/, and never as a meme..   it's always some stupid picture with "you walk in and see your .... doing....., what to do?"   Well, I'm in it more for the 'Service with a Hug'  Then there is also the propane tanks that have been freaked by Jo-Jack.   You were one of the good ones Hank.  But your son's an Ass.   well.. keep in mind, Bobby lost his marbles when Bill told him he will forever be alone, trying to get Connie back with everything he could.   As soon as I read it and seen the "what to do" I knew it was fake.  It had the typical /b/ written all over it.   Jokes on you, I watched a McDonald's and and didn't even press skip.   Was kind of hoping the OS was Amiga workbench  Or at least have the boot up screen as being the hand holding the blue disk   To OP's credit (even though he is a bundle of sticks until proven otherwise) you wouldn't post your own selfie in /r/trashy   I'm using the istick 30w and it has been great.  This is something for all to consider - no one will get onto a forum and start a new thread going on about how well their product has been working, but EVERYONE will go on there and complain about how bad their one is.  I'm sure there is a few lemons out there, but the majority are working fine.   This is the main reason why I've moved away from Mech mods and have gone back to Regulated.  Although the iStick might be a crappy device to most on here, for me it does the job perfectly, and it has Micro USB charging.   No matter where I am, It's not hard to find someone that has an android charger in their car or around the office.    So Hank, are you going to meet with him again?  - it was just a one time thing with a guy in a parking lot.   It's come to the point where I read all of the responses in their related characters voices.  I still love that her ringtone for Redcorn "She's my cherry pie..." and the photo of him posing on the screen.   Where can I find a L pipe?   Maybe he really was there the whole time to be close and spy on Dale?..  All that Alien urine must have tipped them off.   Nexus 5 is my backup   I think M will have a lot to do with Battery life.  Now that we can restrict apps from accessing individual functions, I'm going to disable every single app from getting even remotely close to the GPS chip.  Anytime GPS is used, it's an instant killer.   *Sigh* Where would I find a Hammer?!  ps, I HATED BUCKLY SO MUCH!   I never really understood it either, but all the same it was a twist that you never expected and really they didn't have to even include it in the episode.   It was a way of giving the audience a quick piece of closure, that people didn't even really think about too much.   Weird though,   Hank - Propane at Strickland  Dale - Exterminator at Dales Dead Bug  Bill - Barber at the Army Base  Khan - Systems Analyst / Car Wash Tycoon  Peggy - Teacher  Minh - err.. Homemaker?  Nancy - Weather Reporter for a news station  Boomhauer - ???????? nothing at all till the last season.    Definitely no Cotton in that episode.   There is Hank's Mum though.  "Dad, can I have permission to say Hell yeah?"   He's a Texas Ranger..   Makes some of the conspiracy theories that he's there solely to spy on Dale, more credible and funnier.      Legend, thank you   That's a erfect story to tell.   Gribble is going to need that spoon to go with his knife.   Sirloin for sure,  The episode didn't have as much Dale as I would've liked (hehe) but the ending was superb.  Hank could never relate to Bobby, and as much as he loved his son he always missed that special bond.  Peggy always tried as hard as she can to create that bond although it was a fruitless effort.  At the end, it wasn't sport, or beer, it was meat.  That same meat that clogged his colon in the first season is the same meat that brought Father and Son together.  What better way to cook that meat, than on glorious propane and propane accessories.   You're doing God's work, son.   This song was catchy as anything, even though I don't understand a word of it.  Juanes - La Camisa Negra   https://youtu.be/kRt2sRyup6A   Blocked in Aus too.   "Reddit jumped the gun"   This sounds all too familiar..   No Ad Blocker needed, and works on mobile.  Enjoy my KOTH friends.  http://kisscartoon.me/Cartoon/King-of-the-Hill   I see your point, it's frustrating though.  I sit here with my Nexus 6, great screen quality and large display, but its all meaningless if the battery dies at 1pm    With every user complaining about battery life of phones, you think they'd concentrate on that before screens.   There is only really so much the human eye can pick up on, and how much media are you really going to consume off a ~5 inch device.   Well said.   Why?  In all honesty, Why?   This should be interesting, I've always appreciated the effort BlackBerry used to put into their devices and how they used to dominate the corporate world.  Their biggest mistake was continuing to make phones for companies rather than the individual.  With Android and BlackBerry teaming together, I'm hoping for a near Nexus experience using vanilla Android, but with all of the BlackBerry secure traits written in the background.  Not sure about a physical keyboard as I hate them, but horses for courses, release 2 versions where one is all touch and one has the Keyboard.   That'll do me, thanks mate.   I'm genuinely surprised.. The sport here is what needs attention and crowd funding, well actually, it just needs crowds.   My Google play services is always at top, even higher than screen usage.  Fucking Google play services.  Your app might have locked up and was sucking some serious CPU juice, was the phone warm?  I use Reddit is Fun as well   Is there a TL;DR?   No problem at all,   No one got in contact with me at all over it, it was stuck at Alexandria for over a week and I had to wait it out.   Usually I get my order in 2 weeks from Nicvape but that one time it took 3.5 to receive it.  Mine wasn't through FedEx it was sent via USPS then delivered locally, so not sure who did the scan, but I'm guessing it was customs.   There were no updates, no calls, no anything, it just said that it was at Alexandria and that was that..   I'm guessing each shipping company will have their own tracking and comments that they release to customers.   Looks like your parcel was selected more than likely as a part of a random sample to be inspected.  When / if they contact you or you could contact them, let them know that it's for personal use in your e-cigs.  Yours won't be the first or last bottle they come across.  My bottle was picked up and they had it for a week before I received it. You could tell that the package was opened.  Mine didn't come labelled as being nicotine so I'm guessing it was caught in a scan.    I bought mine off ebay for 220 Aus, it was more of a taste test for Android Wear and whether I would like it.  I had it synched to the iphone and it worked fine for me, The biggest issue was the lack of auto reconnection.  My goto watch is still my Tag Carrerra :)   You, I like.   Don't wanna be 'that' guy, my Moto 360 let's me read the full email and then delete it as well.  I can see why you'd be pissed.  For me, the smartwatch wasnt meant to be so much of a companion device, but a device that meant I didn't have to pull my phone out.  Having a Nexus 6, and device that means I don't need to fumble around with this gigantic device is a winner.   That was my risky click for the day      Your username a throw-away? If not, you should keep it   I love this notion of Australia being a country of rich, where everything is easy to get cause of how much we get paid etc..   Until you've actually experienced it, you'll have no idea.  The one thing I love about this country where a developed nation such as the US has royally fucked up, is healthcare.  But then again, we also pay another subset of taxes for that as well.   Yes cockface, but everything else costs triple here as well.   Its comparative.

There is another one in Sydney based in the Sutherland shire.. Probably better you didn't include it.  Imagine a shop that sold the worst of the worst clones from Fasttech at original model prices..

 I usually read in well lit areas. Today, for example, I read at work during lunch at about 1130...started falling asleep.   As for a more interesting book, any suggestion for someone who used to read a lot of fiction stuff?   I am trying to get back into reading regularly. Most times, I prefer print books over ebooks but whenever I read I start to fall asleep regardless of the book's content. If anyone here has also experienced this, is there a way to combat this? Will ebooks perhaps keep this from happening?   There isn't any save data in the cloud since this particular PS account doesn't have Plus; another user on the console has it.       Thank you very much.    Thanks for the info. We don't have any assets together. We have only purchased small things that, to me, are inconsequential. There is a child involved however. She's three and I was there when she was born and have raised her since yet she is not biologically mine. My name is even on her birth certificate so I fear this could complicate things a bit.    Well, neither of us has a lot of money and we don't have any assets together. She has told me in the past that she wouldn't want anything from me and I believe her considering the state of our relationship currently. I had figured that our individual incomes and debts would be unaffected.    Do you happen to know how much it costs to file it yourself? I would love to avoid lawyers; I don't believe that we need one considering we wouldn't really be arguing over anything.    Over the past couple years, we have been in a slow decline. Various things happened that dampened our feelings for each other until, now, we are more friends than a married couple. We have been thinking about uncontested divorce, or as it's called here in Illinois, a dissolution of marriage. Does anyone here have any experience with this and know how it works in this state?

 "Im positive He dead" Django Unchained   Vanilla Sky?   Smoking Aces?   Thats interesting. Thanks for the reply   So why does the 1st ed say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10? Does it lose the 1 if its a 2nd ed to look like 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10?   Damn that blows. Yea im happy, i love tolkien and at the very least i got the map which is a must. Would have been cooler to have the 1st ed but i know its old and an early ed for sure   I was so excited for a few minutes there. But thanks for all your help im forever grateful   Maybe i have no idea how this works. It has so many common factors with a 1st ed too, but dont think it is   Damn thats a bummer. Got the map the dyed pages and the offset on 229   Yea 0-395-25730-I(or 1 hard to tell)   Actually i jumped the gun its says first american printing but no first ed above. Futhermore on this page the 1st ed has at the bottom printed in the usa 12345678910 mine says printed in the usa 11 12 13 14 15     So what do i  have?   Maybe not, no period missing on page 330 line 4. But does meet requirement on others guys link   Map still in it too no book cover though. When my ipad charges ill load a pic   Just cause you took time to post links, i do have one. Pretty cool for 4$   Yea i will, from the last link the guy posted i do have one, its got the offset on page 229 and everything   Im not looking fort he silmrillion exclusive but how in general to find out. No need to be a drag, you can avoid the thread you know   You didnt read the edit did you?   Hell yea. Says First American edition dont know if that counts and actually the latest date is 1977, no book cover old but in good condition.   Its dated 1976 before wiki even says it was published.   You went bold adding Superman. I like it   Im pretty sure i just bought a 1st edition of The Silmarillion for 4$. But how do you tell its a 1st 2nd etc edition?   This had me dying, only thing be funnier if this was what you actually believed   Well said   My liver   There is a theory on /r/fantheories that makes a strong case that Robin is actually Jokers son. So heres what i suggest      Robin is fighting crime keeping Gotham in order. Bruce and cat woman living happy in london or where ever. Robin eventually finds out his dad is the Joker. Kills him at his trial, that way we never hear the joker so you could cast a lookalike. Robin then takes a turn for the worse, no longer being able to mask the anger hes always had inside, the anger he tells Bruce about.      He forces Batman and catwomans hand. They come back to save Gotham. After a long struggle, Robin kills Batman. Then an epic battle between robin and catwoman transpires. Catwoman wins,barely, and returns to London. Where in the final scene we see her nursing a young boy, bruce jr.     EDIT: www.reddit.com/r/fantheories/comments/3dn1dm/is_john_blake_really_the_jokers_son_nolans/ Link for jokers son theory   I thought it would be cool to see what the movie buffs here could come up with. Nolan left alot to be desired in his ending, which was a great way to go out. But there could be more, so if there was a 4th film how would you suggest it plays out?   Lol ill repost   I disagree there, oscar worthy, no. One of the worst ever, no      Agreed   Idk, i love the part when Bill scars Amsterdam and he goes into hiding. Only emerging to lay dead rabbits in the street till the war. I thought that was brilliant. Although i thought the fight itself was a let down. Amsterdam only killing a wounded Bill was unsatisfing. I thought this scene could have been better. Maybe cutting the dance scene, the burning building they rob scene would have been better scenes to cut out imo   Why?? I thought she was good in the film, not everyday you see a hot blonde go red headed   Well said, would have to be the joker.    Gangs of New York. Great epic film, could have been a bit shorter   Of course it does, just as much as saying a story that happens on a different planet with aliens in the future is the exact same story as one that happens on this planet between the same species from the past. Godfather is the same story with oil using your logic   TWBB is just The godfather with oil, with that logic.   If you understand and think the same why call Avatar nothing but eye candy? I understand you think those stories are better but why then rip Avatar fot not having an original powerful story    A shame you dont see more in the story of Avatar. An avid film fan you seem to be, there is so much more than eye candy. It highlights the flaws of the human race, it shows a world that has evolved without technology, has a wonderful love story, great characters in the brainy female scientist, hardenered war Captain, and the handicapped rebel. Makes powerful statements on war and the field of conscinoues. But if you cant see its more than eye candy i feel sorry for you as its such a joy.     How can the setting not be more original? Pandora is an orignal world. Cmon now. The theme and conflict in TWBB are very much the same as the Godfather and endless movies about rise to power. The characters and acting(didnt mention) are better but one film has DDL one doesnt so that shuts the case on those 2 aspects.     Again i love TWBB, but wish you could see more in Avatar. People tend to get lost in the CGI and not focus on the wonderful story or concepts. Sling blade doesnt even come close imo    No i think it was a good film but i dont see it as a movie id put in my top 5. Considering your stance on Avatar i wanted to know your take on this film. But even if i did think it was a terrible movie i wouldnt than suggest you know nothing about films cause its in your list opposed to another movie   I cant tell if your sarcastic here are not but i found this conversation very interesting. Although unsatisified at what actual applications you were referring to?      But yes TWBB in my top ten, back half, but not top 5. To be fair most of my top five is not in the top 100 most successful so its clear im not worried about that.     I saw Sling blade in yours, whats the deal with that, what am i missing?   Argubaly Kip Thorne, who didnt write a book on Interstellar till after but wrote the script with Nolan   Yea i have conceded this point. It does look like the lab in the final scene but there is an earlier scence that shows its in a theater. But as the edit says im leaving it up due to the few suggestions there were 2 machines   Cool. Thanks for this, ill probaly spend the next 3 hours looking at scripts i had no idea this was available   I like Interstellar better personally. But i love Contact and can see the case clearly that its better. I like interstellar more for it ventures into, or it shows us things beyond our planet where Contact doesnt. Thats my take anyway   Thats not why i like Avatar more at all. You said theres actual applications why your opinion makes sense all im saying its not based on sucess     I love TWBB, i think DDL acting is the best ive seen in many years. But Avatar is more bold exciting and has a less dark feel. So you dont have to keep explaing the movie i get it, i love it, its a classic. But to say your opinion has a better case How??   I think its pretty clear there is only one machine based on strong suggestions in the movie itself. But i hear what your saying. How do you get scripts? I would be very interested in looking at some   How do you measure that? Avatar was much more successful, and as far as orginality ive already debunked that.   Is your description of TWBB not a mirror image to that of Micheal in the Godfather?      I disagree with you on BBM. Avatars love story prevails over species, race, war, betrayal, and bodies. Not just gender. But you are missing personal opinion here. How can your views and opinion dictate my personal list? How can your opinion of BBM make my opinion of Avatar wrong?   Right i have conceded that, see edit in description. But you have cleary avoided your suggestion there is two machines or justified it???   Does not Tesla express fear in the machine?     Also it cleary shows Angier setting up the machine so of course the location of it wouldnt be the same. But it does look like a theater hes in not a warehouse upon closer examination.   I believe its a cop out now but back then it was the only explanation   Ok fair point. Where do you get the idea there is a replica machine from?   Thats my point on a "replica" machine   Where do you get there is two machines from?     When did Angier get a warehouse?   There is no replica machine, Angier is given the Machine. Im not really following the logic here   Correct? Where did this replica machine come from? Angier only books a theater because of the trick which was in working order long after the 1st clone is shot.   Angier shootingt he clone in a lab thats been burned down already.   Im just pointing out the flaw in the scene and asking if 1 2 or 3 is the best explaination for it.   Ok, thats weird to me but i dont watch hockey often. Can you break down the points, how much the shooter gets and how much the assitor gets?   The end speech between Borden and Angier. Angier begins to tell Borden of shooting the first clone but there is a major inconsistency.     Angier is all alone in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. There is no Tesla or his assistant, as to imply they have already fleed Edisons men. But Edison burns the lab down that night. Only after Tesla flees does Angier have solo use of the machine.      Angier couldnt have gone to the lab alone beforehand, due to the electric fence. Nor do we ever see him there without Teslas company. So he couldnt be there alone beforehand alone and he couldnt be there after the machine was given to him, the lab has been burned down.     There are 3 possibilities.      1)Ive missed something here and someone can make sense of this inconsistency.(possible although unlikely)      2)Nolan made a mistake.      3)Its a clue Angier is lying in this moment.      Lmk what you all think or what ive missed.     EDIT: i was wrong it does look like the scene is elsewhere than the lab. will leave the post up to rebutt the crazy suggestion there was two machines   He doesnt even have enough fingers for all his rings LOL. He had a commercial a few years back with him in a darkened bar that was hilarious. If you or anyone else could post a link to that id be forever grateful.   I agree this movie was not a slave to its twist. I will always view Goodfellas as his best with Gangs of new york and the departed being 2a 2b   Get a life, and i see you are determined to get the last word so have it. I will not respond anymore but just knowing i mind fucked the shit out of you is enough for me. Good day kiddo   You havent been making sense for awhile. You got all defensive and childish because you were wrong so....   Avatar is in my top 5 and a few others here. The story of Avatar may not be totally original but neither is TWBB, which is very similar to the rise of power and unthinkable greed seen by Micheal in the Godfather.      Avatar had a great concept, badass action, top knotch effects, and the most powerful love story of recent times. I love TWBB but Avatar is personally a better film to me   Well you arent but if you were a child handles adversity like that so......   No doubt.   Well said. Although Teddy realizes he is a monster. He knew something was wrong with his wife and ignored her cries for help. Which lead to his kids death and murder of his wife. Which he only accepts at the end, which is why he chooses to die. He is also haunted by the horror of war. Your post is well stated but i dont see it that way at all.     Thats what makes a great movie, imo, as you stated   A childs defense system in the working, im clearly wrong but cant express it though sentence formation so ill just type meaningless words   Thats what happens to children, youll learn how to deal with that better as you get older kiddo LOL   Both the assistor and shooter? Thats wild. Why so?   Exactly.....although you are clearly childish i hope you take away something from this exchange   Yes you do. When you consider yourself right when you are clearly wrong thats a childish thing to do. Its not about your missused burning ship analogy, its about someone coming along and correcting your mistakes. When they do you accept the mistake, learn from it, and move on. You dont hold on to your mistake and now treat it as truth.      This is the way mature people deal with mistakes. But again like a child you want to hold on the notion im "righter" Lol. Unlike me i saw my mistake and said yep i stand corrected, grow up a little and accept the idea you will not always be right, you wont. Even Einstein was wrong, alot.   No you are wrong, but if you cant admit that good for you. An idiotic thing to consider yourself right when you are wrong, but youll learn that when you mature some   Yes ive already stated that but you want to hold on to the notion you are right. The premise that makes me wrong is the exact premise that mskes you wrong. At least i can admit to being wrong, you are still trying to be right though Lol   Ok, but neither are remakes so even your original assumption is Technically wrong. If you would have said the thing has not been remade you would be right but in every way you are technically wrong with your original assumption, Lol nice try though.    You get points for assist in hockey?   I dont like sticking my hand in the toliet, its the way ive always done it as well. Its more of a squat but im not sitting on the toliet. It gets the job done, if i had unfavorable results i wouldc hange   Actually you are right about the prequel, thats interesting. I might give the movie another shot on that basis, i stand corrected on that.      But to the 51, 82 versions they are not my rules. Its not considered a remake, look at the wiki page and other sites.   I stand   Bill Russel 11 rings   Go into Space.   Idk i think he has fallen insane though much of the movie. He seemed to be running from his memory. Every time he had a flashback he seemed to grow more insane. Only when he faces them at the end does he come out of it.    But ill have to watch again for your suggestion   The thing(JCs version) is a stand alone film. Its not considered a remake of "The thing from another world". Its based on that movie along with a book wriiten in the same era but IT is NOT considered a remake.       My point still stands, the older version of The thing much better than the new.   I thought it was great. A nice change for Scorcese as well.      I saw it as Leo was really crazy. His partner was his docter,etc, and it was an attempt to try and cure him. At the end he realizes he is potentially cured but instead of living with the pain hed rather be lobtomized. He says something like, "Live as a murderer or Die a good man." I believe his relapses dealt with him running from the pain of his murdered wife and kids. Thats how i saw it.   Have you not heard of the movie or you think the shitty remake is better?   I dont know if Interstellar is even his most ambitious. At least it deals with things that are in the realm of possibility. We dont understand everything touched on, but the major concepts are possible.     As opposed to Inception, The prestige, Batman.   Partly agree with what you say. I disagree with it being a cop out, people truly believe it. But i do agree with your age old conversation. Religion seems to hang on to early conversations where science is having new ones.   The differnce between science and religion explanations is science grows. It thrives on being wrong, thats how progress is made. Religion shuns any notion of this.    I dont believe Interstellar is Carl Sagan, Contact is but Interstellar is based off kip throne   The Thing   Not top 5 though   Exactly my point.......   What you mean?   Goodfellas is the best, great list. I think wolf of wall street might enter my top 5 soon as well. Its got the besr rewatch ability of any movie in the last 20 years imo   Your whole speil on work ethic job searching and names wasnt bias racist crap?   Explain this scene then   No prestige?   Lord of war, Hell yea   You have no argument. Ive offered stats that directly contradict your premise. Your only response was some bias racist crap that made no sense, and directly reflects the type of mindset whites still have in this country as proof enough AA is nessicary. Mindsets, like yours, will always lean whites like me to support AA as the majority of this country does. Then you come back with i didnt say any thing racist LOL. There is a debate to be had on this topic but you are too childish and make no logical rebuttals but see it as you want.   You are an idiot.    Now your racism is becoming clear. But if AA is stealing all these jobs from whites and hires less qualified minorities why doesnt it show in the numbers?? You see how you are contradicting yourself      Someone has to be a minority someone has to be the majority. Its a technicality you are hanging on, if blacks were the majority AA would apply to whites. Its a number of population of race thing not a color thing.   First off, its color blind. It helps minority period, whatever race or gender that may be. Second after slavery was over there were years of unequal rights. Mainly blacks and women.     So if AA is so unfair, why are whites still the least unemployed but most of the population?   No it has to do with minority, yesterday you had no idea it lent itself to women. This country is the most diverse we have to incourage equal opportunities. So 50 years is suppose to even out the 200 years minoritys didnt get to vote work, or were slaves?      If you were to employ every black person in America that would only leave 2% of whites unemployed. Yet with being a majority whites have the least unemployment, hence level the playing field. If we have 100 people 70 are white 30 are black 60 whites are employed only 10 blacks. Thats are country break down, to imply this is level is ignorant and just wrong. And this is with 50 years of AA lol   Its to level the playing field. Blacks are still the most unemployed, women still make less than 1$ average than males for the same job. This country has only recently given equal rights to these groups, so outside help is needed. This policy has evoked positive change in culture and mindsets. You do realize it has very little to do with race. If whites were the minority it would serve them. Furthermore we are not the only country to adapt this policy.        Nice!!  im just finihing up. I heard there is another one coming out next year.   	106
    If not making new designs, I'm imagining new designs for the next project. If not that, I'm reading books about designs for ideas. Pretty boring huh. And I am not helping you out, am I? I think I have more serious problem here.          I read once that war persists to exist because some powerhouse from rich countries are manipulating poorer nations to go to war for their own financial gains. Who do you think can produce those high powered guns and fighting tanks? War is an expensive conflict that oppressed the poor and benefits the rich.    I totally envy this dude for the friends that he has. I can't even have one due to busy schedule.       I agree with you there, mate. Never believe everything you read on the internet. It is a very dangerous world especially for the young guns.    Whatever happened to the international laws against child trafficking and child labor? Where are the authorities responsible for these issues and what are they doing? And if I may say, it doesn't only happen in Asia. It happens in Europe, too. Let us not be partial here and condemn only the poorer countries. That's one reason why richer countries can get away with their crimes because many of us turn a blind eye when it comes to bigger countries.       For a lazy and impatient eater like me, this won't do. But I admit that he has some skills there developed through years of practice for sure.    Always the view.

 I will try to keep it short:  We started dating in Jan 2013, she was diagnosed in August 2013 (she cannot be cured, but it is currently under control. Nobody knows for how long though).  We stayed together until April this year. We had lots of ups and downs. However until now she always managed to pick herself back up.   I don't want to go into why we broke up because my version of the story is of course biased. In any case, we did not work. By the end of our relationship we argued 24/7.   She decided that she does not want to talk to me anymore. I did not like that but had to respect her wish. Yesterday she called me and was saying that she can't bear it anymore (the pressure, the emotional pain, being alone). The few friends she has do listen to her, but there is no solution to ease the emotional pain she is in. She keeps saying things that make me believe she might be about to harm herself. Also she has no family she can rely on.   I want to help her, but I must know what the best way is to deal with depression. How can I make life seem worth living to her?   Any advice on how to support her would be greatly appreciated.   Does nobody mind that the gif cuts out when the plane seems to be falling overhead?   I don't mind it at all, because it's just the way you pour your beer. But I bought a German beer the other day in a bowling alley in London and the waitress scraped off the foam. I was very close to screaming at her      Ask an English guy if he thinks that is the perfect pour. They fucking hate foam.    Indeed   Yes, but it feels like it should be more advanced than that...   I firmly believe that the concept of duty is bullshit.   Why does a soldier have to feel a sense of duty? It is a job. He is risking his life so pay him a lot. Don't tell him: Hey look, we can't pay you very well, but it's an honour to fight for your country, so you've got that going for you."  If a worker is supposed to work better, more efficient, etc, increase his compensation. What is wrong with that?    When people say: "It doesn't matter what others say: You be who you are."  It is not ok at all not to question yourself every once in a while.    Exactly. Cut off both of my arms. Doesn't kill me if I get help, but for sure does not make me stronger.

I am sure by now you can skip half the steps  1. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-0-1-5-77-generic-t3012378  2. Flashed the first available Lollipop rom as soon as it was available pre rooted. I had to reinstall custom recovery though.  3. then I flashed this: http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/d5803-lollipop-5-02-odexed-pre-rooted-2-t3090505. When you do this, make sure to flash the dualrecovery after flashing the rom. Otherwise you lose the custom recovery again.   I am sure this is nowhere near a good enough step by step guide. But you can find everything you need on XDA.  Edit: This is a good guide. http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/how-to-root-backup-drm-keys-t3013343  Again, something easier might be available by now.       I just watched the episode in season 4 yesterday where Daniel is kidnapped by an Unas. So it was easy for me to make the connection.    I flashed a lollipop rom and I have 0 issues. What are you worried about specifically?   So far everything is perfect. Xposed works, I've got viper4android working. I'm super happy.   Well actually I've got two problems:  1. Sometimes apps just force stop. But it's rare and really doesn't bother me.   2. Very often the screen turns on in my pocket and changes settings, pocketdials, or does something else. But that is not a lollipop issue. That is a it's too hot and me legs are sweaty issue.    Does it hold?    He ded   Is he doing that because they were mean to him yesterday?    If you like to feel hope when you know it will be crushed...    I thought the i3 comes with one?   http://de.pcpartpicker.com/p/rqTRxr  I'm going to install this in my room at my mother's. I am only there every 4 month for the weekend. I just want to be able to browse the internet and play Diablo 3.    To be honest, I don't mind that there is chaos for 1 day, I can totally live with that. But I find it unreasonable what they are asking for based on this article.       Doesn't change my point though. Thery make it seem like you can look at the DHD and say: Yes, I can see that they went to Chulak. But that is not the case I believe.    A Stargate address is a coordinate system used by a Stargate to determine the position of a target gate in the Stargate Network. They are composed of a series of glyphs, at least seven depending on the intended destination, which when entered in the correct order allow the Stargate to establish a wormhole with another gate at the destination.  Here is more info:  http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Stargate_address   How would it be possible to guess an address by looking at the DHD  of an active Stargate. They do this all the time but I think if you look at the DHD all you get is 7 symbols. Obviously you know which one will be last, since you know which world you are on. But how could you know the order of the other 6 by just looking at the DHD?   Sorry, what is good about BB10?   I'm saying I have never been to India so I can't judge based on the few Indian women I see where I live.    What makes it good?    Get to the point man. I'm really interested in your article and the topic. But I don't want to read half a book as introduction.    Not sure that answers my question...  Are you tired all the time?   Sorry, my explanation was not good. I have all the birthdays saved, but I do not receive reminders from Android.    I would like not to add reminders but to simply turn on the "permanent notification on a day that one of my contact has his/her birthday".   This would be much appreciated.    Never seen an Indian woman like that on the street. Where are they hiding?  In India I guess...   No Germany?   I am speechless.    Seriously? I work out 3 times a week 1 hour each time. No wonder you look a lot fitter than me.   Don't you get tired?   Never heard Kings never die. Thanks for that.      Yep, you're right. But that song is really dark compared to Phenomenal.

Other than Lose Yourself of course      Einem Ordner von Bayer ins Gesicht geschlagen.    Ja, ich verstehe was du meinst. Aber er ist ja nicht davongekommen. Er wurde entlassen und gesperrt. Ich glaube auch nicht, dass er jetzt die dicke Kohle beim HSV verdient. Und anstatt Champions League geht es jetzt gegen den Abstieg. Der ist auf jeden Fall nicht davongekommen.   Zumindest habe ich nicht das Gefuehl.   Edit: Und ich finde nicht, dass der nie wieder nen Job bekommen sollte. Wie soll man sich denn wieder integrieren, wenn man keine zweite Chance bekommt.    Ach ich weiss nicht. War natuerlich nicht korrekt von ihm aber jeder baut mal Mist.   nichts. Jeder hasst den HSV sowieso. Alles richtig gemacht.    She's German, isn't she?   That was a very good idea I must say.    The delay between the ball going off screen for the last time and coming back on is not long enough    My what?!       My reply to those people: don't like reddit? Don't use it!   What the fuck guys. For all we know there was a good reason to fire Victoria. People make up their mind about something they don't know anything about    Food is key.    My grandfather (who already died years ago) was 15 when he was sent to Russia to fight. If what my family tells me is true he got there, was brought to the front unarmed and was captured. He spent the next years in a Russian prison and came back when he was 20.  He was fucked in the head. He never got over the hunger he experienced in prison so he would never share food and he would always have tons of food in the freezer. He didn't sleep well and never talked about it. He beat his wife and children.   He received a pension but that is it. No mental support, no therapy. Nobody thanked him or was proud of him. Nobody gave a shit basically. And to this day when people talk about him, nobody gives a shit that he was sent to fight      Good to know. If you've never been to the US and don't actually know what it's like, the Internet paints a pretty bad picture.    I swear outside if the US nobody needs shit like this.   I lived in Germany most of my life. I have never had any problem with police even when we were causing trouble.   Uninstall   Great work.   I just want to point out, that you were not skinny fat.

Don't do it   Same, but I was prepared for it.    I was waiting for train to really fuck him up...   I was not aware.    It really isn't. It is a fun to watch episode, but does not add anything to the overall story.   Come on!     The English in the article is so horrible.    *Goa'Uld *Stargate   Are you rich and white?

And they will be ignored    Fair enough. I get your point and I don't think you are wrong. I understand that many people rely on artists like Swift to make a living. I also have no numbers that show Apple provides more welfare than Swift's label.   I simply think that (even though I really dislike Apple) if Apple manages to provide a service that many people will use (iOS and Android) that will further limit piracy and will be providing better/similar performance and user experience that current offers (like Spotify) provide and if to do that and to penetrate the marker they regard it as necessary to offer 3 months free trial, then Swift should stop complaining that she is not getting paid for 3 months.     What I mean is she said artists don't get paid. There is no information about whether or not the labels won't make any money. It actually says that the labels expect a positive long term effect. The people are not employed by swift, but by the label. So her not getting the money should be acceptable if the apple secures jobs and the labels expect it to pay off in the long run.   I hope this is understandable. I can't put it any better.    Do we know the meaning behind this?   She won't vanish, just because she doesn't get paid by Apple 3 months. Also she is only saying artists don't get paid. She doesn't give a shit about jobs    Every time I read something like this I am shocked. In Germany, where I am from this just doesn't happen. We have a social security system that will in your case probably pay you benefits for being an orphan, your rent (if you flat fits the maximum size allowed) and some money to eat.  It's all good that America is the greatest country on Earth but this is unacceptable.    The only thing the bothers me about what she is saying is this:   Swift hints that Apple can easily afford to eat the costs of paying out to labels during that period  Yes, they can, but so can she. The only difference is that Apple is a company that provides jobs for many people and therefore I'd rather they have the money and pay their people well.   I don't think there is any problem with Taylor not getting the money for three month. This is not even considering that if she does not put her music on there, she also doesn't get any money.      Step 1: clean the bathroom every day.   Thank you for watching!    What about z3 then? Same phone just bigger and 1080p. Battery life is also great on that.       I don't. I'm assuming something. If I'm wrong it's all good    I'm not saying that. But I don't think they should do it. I want to be the one to open the package first.    I actually mind, that they are playing around with them, putting them back in the box and then selling them as new.   Or am I misunderstanding something?   So pretty. Love it   What? It's a good haircut, but the black stuff looks like shit.   Android chrome looks the same   Passive aggressive    I totally get where your question is going.   All the answers make sense and try to show you a way to get out of an awkward situation.   However I would like to recommend something else.   If somebody has a certain budget and wants to spend that, that's fine. To that person it won't matter if they can get the same quality (considering their level of skill) as with one that is below their budget. So if you actually have the knowledge, recommend a camera that is good and is within their budget. Who are you to say that their pictures will turn out like shit and they don't have the potential to actually make use of the camera.  Now the important part is manage expectations. Try before buy is the motto. Who buys an expensive camera before taking it for a spin? If you have the time, let them take a few pictures with your camera. They'll see what they look like. If you don't have the time, tell them to ask in the store. Of course you should tell them why they should try the camera first and see what pictures they end up with.   But you shouldn't feel bad and it should not be an awkward situation. If you recommend something and they are too lazy to try it first: their fault. They don't have to follow your advice.   And for the guy who complained after: why don't you show him the kind of picture you can take with it.    So, I had the same problem.   I bought a cable though, no adapter.   I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EI41K26?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) cable and had the exact same problem. Would not detect the cable and I did not see anything. The cable has many good reviews so I guess I just got unlucky.   Then I bought [this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00965EMF4?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01) and I am super happy with it.   What I am trying to say is: Maybe your surface is faulty or settings need to be changed. But chances are you got a shitty adapter. I tried a different cable and that worked for me.     I really wonder how many potential customers:  - Don't give a shit about thickness and want a decent battery life - Don't give a shit about specs, just want a flashy phone  Seems like the industry believes number 2 to be the majority   Why do all these low budget smart phones have huge batteries? Why would they not put them in the flagships? Why do they believe that flagships don't need that?   Sorry, I was joking. Did not come across I guess    ...Spoiler Alert   I know right. I love that episode because there is little action but it's still such a great thriller.   Thank you very much. That means it's close almost finished Season 1 last week.   Can't wait for that episode   If they would always show that in bigmacs, I would pay a monthly fee for it.    I think that is one of my favourite episodes.   That's fair enough. Actually I am not sure, but as far as I understand fantheories are just alternative versions of the truth within a story, that would also fit with the facts of that story (I hope that makes sense).   So I think my idea would make sense, but I understand that that is not the actual intention of the writers even though I would prefer it to be.    Taking this opportunity I would like to express that this is one of the few subs that I am active on that does not ever frustrate me. All the responses are always cool and respectful and on topic. Really appreciate that.

Man I hate those things they're always bad news.         On 10 May 1945 over Okinawa, Marine Lieutenant Robert R. Klingman and three other pilots of VMF-312 climbed to intercept a Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu ("Nick") twin-engined heavy fighter flying reconnaissance at 25,000 feet (7,600 m), but the "Nick" began climbing higher. Two of the FG-1D Corsairs ceased their pursuit at 36,000 feet (11,000 m), but Marine Captain Kenneth Reusser and his wingman Klingman continued to 38,000 feet (12,000 m), expending most of their .50 caliber ammunition to lighten their aircraft. Reusser scored hits on the "Nick's" port engine, but ran out of ammunition, and was under fire from the Japanese rear gunner. Klingman lined up for a shot at a distance of 50 feet (15 m) when his guns jammed due to the extreme cold. He approached the "Nick" three times to damage it with his propeller, chopping away at his opponent's rudder, rear cockpit, and right stabilizer. The Toryu spun down to 15,000 feet (4,600 m) where its wings came off. Despite missing five inches (13 cm) from the ends of his propeller blades, running out of fuel and having an aircraft dented and punctured by debris and bullets, Klingman safely guided his Corsair to a deadstick landing. He was awarded the Navy Cross.  [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_ramming#United_States)      That is a beautiful vintage ride. Check the tank for rust, if the tires are old they'll want replacing, be sure chain and sprockets are in good shape. Old carbs can varnish, consider a thorough cleaning. The shocks are likely shagged, this era motorbike never did handle well-consider replacing, and the forks need at minimum new oil if not rebuild.

The service dept at my local Honda dealer (who are a great bunch of ~~guys~~ mechanics) would love to look over such a great old bike-the first year of production was '72.   Most important are tires, chain, brakes, swingarm and steering bearings, controls (brake/clutch/throttle). [Here](http://www.msf-usa.org/downloads/T-CLOCS_Inspection_Checklist.pdf) is the MSF checklist.  Do yourself a favor and get a shop manual. Even if you don't do the work yourself it's a great way to learn more about your ride.  If sound, yes that old motorcycle will run all day at 70 mph-you'll wear out before it will.

I saved enough to buy a beat up, used lawn mower engine, fixed it up (I hate rebuilding carbs to this day) and put it in a used minibike frame. I'll never forget the day I got the centrifugal clutch and took my first ride.  The first real motorcycle I bought was a Honda 90 in the late 60s. Then a 450, a 750 and so on but that minibike was my first taste of freedom on two wheels.   A drunk friend. We were riding from Mojave to North Hollywood. Bastard kept falling asleep.

 I stopped watching the new Bond trailer halfway through. Usually, I don't care, but it seemed like overkill showing me every action scene and important female line in the movie. [When I heard](#s "He's protecting someone and then saw the blonde woman,") it just *hit me* and I decided that was too much info for how sold on the movie I already was.  Does anyone recut trailers to save movies from their marketers? Do they, maybe, have a low ^/medium ^^/high content threshold for people who want different amounts of spoilage?  One could argue Bond movies have always given away a lot, but that doesn't mean they have to now.   I only watched half.

I'm for Rand Paul, but will inform you his budget proposal has been reported to cut NASA funding. He takes the approach that America needs drastic fiscal change, but is up agains tthe hawks and can't touch defense spending.

When we discuss externalities in food production, we can talk about the effects on resources, animals, food products, consumers, and the competitive market. I hope to be able to find someone who can communicate clearly the weight I place on social matters as externalities, or develop that message myself. It is one thing to remark on industrial animal farms as inefficient, but another to say when they replace more local food production it has more human detractions. The second message may win us more friends, allies, and converts.  (edit: both books are available on Amazon.

The empire-like holdings the Ridgley family had control over dipped heavily into early industries such as ironworks, mills, quarries, and armories which eventually supplied much of the cannon ordered by the Continental Congress for the revolution.  I would say you are correct. The multiple large cities in the area greatly improved the market for inorganic materials and processing services which have a faster rate of return than farming.  It would be interesting to see if there was a difference in marketing for the local tobacco versus the more southern tobacco. I think the southern product was exported overseas, while urban Marylanders would enjoy the bounty of their neighbors. Marketing overseas includes great risk and overhead, meanwhile the Ridgleys could sell to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Wilmington, and settlers headed west.   Sorry that happened to ya. None of that was Catholic, however. You may have been wrapped in the paraphernalia and prayers of the Church, but not its teachings. I expect any priest would have taken the situation very seriously if they learned about it.

This isn't a reform looking backward, but forward.  2, 3. It depends how successful any movement is, whether or not bureaucracies will fall.  4. I don't think I see any direct comment through that article's content.  One of the problems with mental health is that in the past we have not had many cases of people being "cured." The terrible situation where once a person falls into a problem, they never crawl out. This is as costly as a lifetime sentence in prison.  Today we have the benefit of improving nutrition and finally have real empathic counseling. Not every patient has a chance of full recovery, but many cases of depression and anxiety can be relaxed by giving people the strength to return to normal life and the lessons to remain with us. We are leaving behind the inhumane and despicable "treatments" of old.  One of the "trusting" aspects of saying *if one political faction makes changes as they see fit, what will happen* is that you have to trust the economy will get better. We all think our way will make it better, so I would extend the same hypothetical to any other suggestion. When an economy gets better, people have more time for personal projects and family, a greater possibility of gaining capital, and less-tight budgets.       the libertarian solution to our mental health crisis?  1. Tort reform to repair us to a "loser pays" system. This enables little guys who have a definite winning case, but no money, to take on corporations with legions of lawyers.  2. FDA told to let all medications meeting basic, fast, approval onto the market. Doctors and consumers should be responsible for using healthy treatments and [private associations can be formed to guarantee product quality.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvxT7fryE3Q) This enables products excluded by the cost of FDA approval to come to market and allows new products to take on old ones without lobbyists preventing the FDA from approving.  3. The VA would stop automatic prescription of psychotropic medication. Our vets need real, personal, mental health guidance. People can be counseled out of darkness, it isn't a chemical imbalance. [There is no evidence of a chemical imbalance causing emotional or mental changes in a way like we hear from pharmaceutical companies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARZ2Wv2BoFs) (By the way that ain't some internet quack)  4. (Presuming a libertarian government is making more decisions and cutting government spending) Reduced taxes and maybe even a restored currency would enable more charitable giving and investment in philanthropic ventures. Families living in fear of siblings or children would have more options for where to send their troubled relatives for help.  This is off the top of my head. I wonder if #2 would help stop family physicians from being barraged with commissions from pharma companies to prescribe quotas of psychotropic drugs. Doctors would also be responsible for commending and recommending patients to mental health facilities.   Really, we'd rather have less taxes so we can contribute to these things charitably. We had a great deal of mental health services available until funding was massively cut - There are tons of abandoned centers for treatment all over the US. I wouldn't trust the government with it, again, because legislators will just forget and cut funding again (possibly driven by private prison lobbyists).   A more "green" or "sustainable" thing to do would be to restore the soil and forests which retard the flow of water across the landscape.

That doesn't mean I considered it the end-all be-all. Obviously, since we are still discussing it.   The dichotomy between Keynesian and Austrian capital models come to mind very quickly.  Those are different understandings of a single reality. There are similarities and differences in the understandings and since we are not omniscient, neither one can be proven - though parts can be disproven (As Keynesianism/ use of econometrics has been on a philosophical basis by Austrian Econmists).   unique moral priority to their culture  I find that humanity has a single morality. Different cultures have different traditional responses to their environments which color morality (espiecially in the absence of Christianity).   Capitalism fitted the people with a yoke akin to slavery.  As I said, G.K.C. created his own definition of good, pure capitalism (distributism) and relegated the term "capitalism" to crony capitalism in his work. Businesses profiting by use of the force of the state to oppress and repress workers and competition being akin to a yoke of slavery? That I agree with and think he did too - but that is referring to a political mess not a system or quality of economics.  I am a hopeful anarcho-capitalist, though I realize that future is troubled and dim at present. I hold a county-level party position in the Republican party and a leadership position in both a state-level and county-level groups partial to Ron Paul, though nonpartisan.  I am not nice on the internet. Don't know why. Maybe I'm too nice in person.    But I still find it interesting that the Nazi's base of power was in Munich and Bavaria (largely Catholic), but that the locals there still did not support them in large numbers  If the NAZI party tried to base somewhere more mild to their views, rabid supporters like one finds in a minority would not be present. Rather, there would be the diffident reactions one expects from people who agree but are not surrounded by people holding ideas they dislike enough to value activism over working or family. In Bavaria, Hitler probably found people who despised the local norms and made sure to turn up at every event. Supporters from other parts of the nation who were strong enough lent what they could. Disrupting the norm gave them national acclaim.  I am hypothesizing, not dictating from research.   dn dn dnnnnn         Does the Democrat party support any crazies?    Its not really unsafe as long as you cook it after.   Obviously don't leave raw meat in warm water for hours, but just to defrost? Its fine.  These two are tied together. If meat is left in the bacterial growth range of temperatures too long and then cooked, it isn't the bacteria you have to worry about - but the toxins they leave behind. If defrosted horribly incorrectly, a meat can still be unsafe when cooked.   "always"  is the important part.   [Cory Booker and Rand Paul have worked together on this](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-cory-booker-reform-the-war-drugs) for some time, already.   By reducing the number of laws describing criminal offenses, sometimes by making them into civil offenses.   Yep. Meanwhile you have Rand Paul, who actually does want a smaller government, and who has been teamed up with Cory Booker on this for years.   Art project.   The question now is... What was Steven Segall doing in Mongolia?   What would you call an appeal to authority? Everything I have posted is not backed by citations because these people wrote books - which you can buy or find in libraries if you want the knowledge.  There is no such thing as "an expression of capitalism." Capitalism is not political. Capitalism is the use of savings and trade. Chesterton did accept this definition - though he wrapped it in much discourse - but then he liked to be the person making the definitions rather than using someone else's. His main problem with economics was how few people had capital instead and how many had wages because they had no capital. Distributism solved that voluntarily. But that is the thing - a true free market is created by and regulated by voluntary action. Chesterton made Distributism to give free market capitalism a new name, to scoot out from the influence of governments.  "We are so horribly unjust..." Who is horribly unjust? The small business owner who has to choose how to split up 60 hrs of work per week between two employees? The daycare owner who has to comply with mandated regulations and pay legal insurance because tort is unreformed? Can we even *really* blame the corporations for lobbying the governemnt to control and capture our legislatures and regulations, respectively? A corporation is a protected class of private organization only possible thorugh governemnt law and corporations only want to lobby because the government has power over their sectors and industries... so maybe the solution is to remove power from the government at various levels and return a large degree of subsidiarity to our nation?  So that last comment wasn't so much ad hominem as particularly broad. You are making nonsense statements and need more grounding in the background of the development these ideas underwent from different sources than you are used to.   My argument is that you are spouting gobbledegook and need to re-take core curriculum classes with capable professors.   I would group it into the "dirty future" style.

Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclairs allegations, some of which they labeled as willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact, atrocious exaggeration, and not at all characteristic. ](http://fee.org/freeman/detail/29-upton-sinclairs-the-jungle-proved-regulation-was-required)  Same article -   According to the popular myth, there were no government inspectors before Congress acted in response to The Jungle, and the greedy meat packers fought federal inspection all the way. The truth is that not only did government inspection exist, but meat packers themselves supported it and were in the forefront of the effort to extend it so as to ensnare their smaller, unregulated competitors.  Same article -   In the end, Americans got a new federal meat inspection law, the big packers got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation, as well as new regulations on the competition, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.  Same article -   To his credit, Sinclair actually opposed the law because he saw it for what it really wasa boon for the big meat packers.  Enjoy.

It is a men's interest article with colorful language.   I respect that opinion and think it applies to so many things in American life, but who is getting the money and how?  1. We know how we got here and who did it. It may have been a conspiracy to snag McGovern to the anti-fat side, but that seems about it. Corporations got in bed with narcissistic scientists, which gave them sway over legislators.  2. The "broken window fallacy" describes how causing an expense in one place does not simply create profit in another. If you break the baker's window, the glazier and judge get a payday but the miller and shoemaker go without. Although we live in a nation whose economic policy has been crafted by people who do not understand this phenomena at all, and sometimes applaud when nature breaks windows, I personally would not lay the blame for a bloated sector on outright government action. Rather, it is known that pharmaceutical and agricultural corporations lobby to preserve the status-quo.  IMO it isn't about keeping people working but keeping people sick. People working is a result of people being sick. A bad economist would say that keeping people working is the goal (to increase economic action) but a good economist would realize that the added expense of healthcare slows the economy and wastes people's money, forcing them to support the added expense while making them less able to do the basic productive acts at all levels of industry.  There is always going to be a fuzzy line between required expenses, subjectively desired expenses, and expenses mistakenly required. All these expenses mistakenly required by government advising an improper  diet are funds siphoned off and straight up handed to various industries: Agriculture, healthcare, diet foods, and exercise. It doesn't matter if someone has a job now because of the misallocation, they would have had a better one if the mistake had never been made. We all kinda had other plans for that money.   He is relating personal experience. The fact in the article is that he doesn't use shaving cream anymore and recommends that to everyone.

It is the proteins which trigger inflammation and rashes. Refined oil has no proteins and hence, no smell or coconut taste.  In the case of dairy, are you saying you have classic intolerance? I have that, as well. Pills only go so far, but I recently got my hands on some raw milk and it has made me tolerant. The effects are probably temporary.

It is one of the more frustrating frayed ends of a contract. Actually I would call it a kafkaesque representation of legal condition. To command property to be under control of a dead body that stopped caring twenty years before passing.   How hard would it be to change the character of a subdivision at that point?

I donlt even want to read this but its breitbart so it has to be true. just wtf!?   Alternate history exposes the character of real people who we only ever hear about what they did, not what they might have done.  Peter Turtledove and Newt Gingrich and the Shaara family taught me that.   I got interested in all this from listening to a three-hour lecture by Mark Shepard. He specifically embraces capitalism to the extent it is the way to do business.  So here is something interesting. There is another movement: New Urbanism. But if you ask some of the more conservative people they will take the buzz word and scream AGENDA 21! AGENDA 21! So that leaves Andres Duany out of the picture. Andres, along with his wife and some others started it right out of college. But their exposure is limited. This engineer in the midwest, Chuck Marohn, gets fed up with creating bad environments and finally sees their stuff outside the left/right spectrum. He heads a group called Strong Towns. Together - and they are well known to each other - one or the other can get into any town or city in the US.  *They are both promoting the same thing.* Serving people, restoring economic rationality.  It is the same, everywhere. Even with the Papacy! Back and forth. Distributism! But property rights are central! Social Justice! But remember that social doesn't mean government. The earth has to be preserved... We want something and we all think we know how to get it... but we swim in anarchy. That is the reality. Society, markets, and the individual all interact but have different rules on the inside.  Permaculture is kinda like a ruleset for anarchy in some ways.

Catholics have contributed massively to the understanding of anarchy and objective morality.  I want more than ever to find another Catholic who wants socialism and would explain why they are allowing of government intervention, theologically.  Don't get it.   Some people would say the amount of bread in each of these is too much. The marinara sauce has a surprising amount of sugar. Being of this camp I think the balance of price, fat, and protein is good.  On the other tongue we have people who would say the fat content is not low enough.   HA! Figured out that meatball marinara a long time ago. Makes me feel good I was right about that.   Then I started packing sandwiches, then I got married and we bake 5 chicken breasts a week for lunches. We take it in with frozen veggies and microwave it at our offices. Less carbo - more savings.   Endgame? Ever heard of EVE Online? ;]  But seriously, I think all those things are solvable. It takes a creative bunch to manage a game by being a part of it (following the owners, like I said) but it would be interesting.  The way I see it is the objects can be given a lore of disappearing in various situations, this gives the observation team an out to make items disappear.  I see armies and chaos and lonely gods coming out of this.  	143
       Easy speaker replacement   Okay, I was wondering what was going on.   Are you able to install Avira to just do scans with no real-time?   No, actually mostly adware. It has found some trojans as well.   I run AdAware in it's second line of defense mode so it just scans, no real-time protection. I've found that it finds more than the paid version of BitDefender. The downside is that the scans can take longer than other AVs.   *Humans kill more humans than any other animal.   The free version of Ad-Aware has found way more viruses than my paid version of Bit-Defender. You can install Ad-Aware as a 2nd line of defense by having Real-Time Protection off.

I know several people who've personally worked with them and their grasp of Satanism, real applicable Satanism, is far more impressive than most trve kvlt black metal bands.      Pride can balance greed, appreciating what you have and honoring it. Note that LaVey makes it clear that all indulgences should be balanced with rational self-interest. This is what keeps a sin indulgence and not compulsive. In his later books he actually criticizes modern American consumerism as greed taken to a compulsive end. I would say the same thing can be said about various ecologically damaging practices. LaVey blamed those issues on overpopulation, and offered solutions to quell that.

[From aviator Robert Ing](https://scontent-lax1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11407139_10206756097486149_7683785373126515778_n.jpg?oh=5765e48b13efce51042ca103cb65f575 oe=561AA2BB)   Hello, official Church of Satan representative here, and member of their administrative staff. What /u/Ragnar_Santorum states is partially true. We do make an effort to keep the definition of Satanism consistent, but this isn't a matter base egoism (though nothing wrong with that). We get calls, e-mails, letters on a regular basis from press and law enforcement who are covering or dealing with cases of vandalism, violence, and harassment from people who commit these crimes in the name of "Satan" or "Satanism". More often than not, when researching the cases, they'll refer to material found online from one of these devil worshiping or occult based groups, and often find themselves contacting us. To the mainstream, Satanism is a throwaway term, it can mean anything from someone skipping church on Sunday to a Jihadi militant. So it's in our best interest to clarify our definition of Satanism with a sense of authority, one we belief we've earned from doing this for 50 years.    We do welcome others to come out with their unique interpretations of Satanic ideas, but competition does not mean laying down, but exchanging ideas with sharp reason. At the same time, we must consider the value of our time and resources. Sorry, but when many of these organizations have little to no real world presence will we won't bother.    When the Satanic Temple first started out, we weren't totally opposed to them. This was well before anything about this statue was revealed. Certain individual members voiced their differences, but from an official standpoint we were content with just saying, that's not us, that's them, and directed press accordingly. Unfortunately the tone changed, I suspect this was due to a certain media consultant TST was using at the time, and the message directed towards us was more confrontational. At that point we decided to put out our differing and critical opinions (after being asked more than enough times), and even settling on accepting TST as their own form of satanism. Keep in mind that the Church of Satan is an individualistic organization, we do not bark orders from above to our members and expect them to fall in line. Any beef individuals may or may not have is their own.   Very nice!    Rarely. What good would it serve me? Always ask yourself, who benefits?    And to balance it out, here's [a Satanic critique of Objectivism](http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php).   Excellent insight!   That might be part of it, and probably something to do with mental healthcare.    Not sure about other Cons but there's a group out here in San Diego that shows up at just about every public event, and on many busy weekends at Balboa Park.    There's a lot in both Native American and Mexican mythology and symbols that could be useful for you as a Satanist. Study up on them, for example the Trickster/Coyote myths or Quetzalcoatl, and see how you could apply their symbols and metaphors into a Satanic perspective.   Everything here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php      Pretty good documentary. There's quite a bit of that Santa Muerte worship in the neighborhoods I've lived in and in the West Hollywood area. But the thing is, it's all understood to be a business. You pay a guy to put a curse on someone or to gain wealth, and it's done... kinda. Need blessing? They'll pray to Jesus. Need money or a curse? They'll pray to Satan, whatever, just make sure your money is on the table. It's a big racket, and the documentary makes that pretty clear. These towns a pretty poor, so they depend on the tourists that come looking for witches and magic. Each "high priest" tries to out to each other, each one just throwing in more and more saints, demons, devils, symbols, costumes, etc. from whatever sources, doesn't matter. It doesn't make any sense really, but the tourists don't care, they just want a big show, and the peasants are desperate and just want *anything* that can help them. The film also mentions how they'll extort people. Hey, Satan has a curse on you... 500 pesos and I'll lift it. Done.    And that's the real Satanism in all of this. There's a sucker born every minute.   The Morbid Anatomy Museum and Stephen Romano are excited to announce a curated exhibition opening July 18 in recognition of the museums first year anniversary.    This milestone will be celebrated with an all day Festival of Arcane Knowledge followed by a Devils masquerade party. The exhibition will be comprised of a blend of historical, Outsider, and Visionary art, as well as contemporary works, vintage books, vernacular photography, folk sculpture, spirit photography, and many surprises. As with previous exhibitions curated by Stephen Romano, the design and content of the exhibition will be in constant dynamic motion throughout the course of the exhibition, adding, taking away, reflecting the synergistic relationship the curator has with the collection.    This exhibition is composed of works from Stephen Romanos esoteric personal collection, as well as works sampled from the collections of associates and the inclusion of some of the most highly respected and recognized contemporary artists of our time including Kris Kuksi, Kymia Nawabi, Martin Wittfooth, El Gato Chimney, Rithika Merchant, Pulu Zhao, Rene Allain, Matthew Dutton, Lizz Lopez, Joseph McVetty, Barry William Hale and Hunter Stabler.    The exhibition examines the place the visionary occupies as the "HYPNAGOGIA, defined as the experience of the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep: the hypnagogic state of consciousness, when mental phenomena such as lucid dreaming, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis occur. This threshold consciousness phase is in this exhibition linked with the visionary artists creative process which empowers the artist with shamanic powers. The works presented are implied to have been created while the artist was in a similar state of heighten awareness through their own pursuit of creative fulfillment.             What if we just replace "Council of Nine" with "SS", and "Order of the Trapezoid" with "Gestapo?"    Shrug. Sure, abide by your fetish I suppose. I wouldn't do that myself though.    The Council of Nine is the ruling body of the Church of Satan. Do with that as you will. Every board has a chairman. Can a chairman be replaced? I suppose, if the person running it turned out to be a failure. Guess what? That's not the case. Far from it. Here's some facts, in Gilmore's time as High Priest he has conducted more interviews than in LaVey's lifetime. He has multiplied membership (especially internationally, half of the interviews sent my way nowadays are with European journalists and writers) and fostered critically important relationships with academics, journalists, entrepreneurs, and freethinkers. When people look back at Magus Gilmore's legacy, it will be of one where he turned down the stereotype of the black-clad morose Satanist who's all talk with no real accomplishments. If a member attended the Year 50 Conclave they would have seen this in action, as our presentations were more along the lines of TED Talks than spooky posturing.    Dozens? You do realize what dozens means right, multiples of 12? I could probably count on one hand somewhat notable individuals who left in the past 10 years. And half of them would hate each others guts. Maybe a bit more if we extend it out the *15* years that Magus Gilmore has been the High Priest. People tend to forget that, like this some kind of recent development that they're still trying to come to terms with. Get over it, especially if you don't consider us relevant to your own beliefs.     I think we ultimately agree. Race is a real thing, with real effects. Is it the whole picture? Absolutely not. Is it justification for bigotry and wholesale discrimination. Fuck no. But to say "all people are the same" is just scientifically false, which I know is not what you're saying but tends to be the case with egalitarians.    Satanism is not a "democratic" philosophy, so why should the organization be? And even if it was, how would you know? Are you a member of the Council of Nine or Order of the Trapezoid? Does not knowing the inner workings bother you? Tough. Most people who have left the organization have done so on good enough terms. The few who haven't have their own axes to grind, most of the time purely personal. Ho-hum.    I do wish more people used Dashwood's "Fais ce que tu voudras" or kept the original carnal, Rabelaisian understanding of the motto. Unfortunately the co-opted use by Crowley (rhymes with holy, not crowley, that rhymes with fouly) is mostly the nonsense I deal with.  Since you ask, yes, most of our Priesthood use their real names, and for all members it's a requirement to register with your legal name. How they wish to publicly present themselves is up to them. Let us list the real names... LaVey, Gilmore, Nadramia, Slaughter, Rose, Sprague, Bonner, Paradise, Campbell, Gray, Antony, Waytz, Mitchell, Harris, Williams, Cassavaugh, Baddeley, Palmer, Moynihan, Byrd, Gausten, Broderick, Filan... And those are just a handful of our public representatives. Yes, Aquino used his real name, what did that get him? Years of abuse allegations and getting processed out of the Army. Sorry, unlike some Muslims we are not interested in martyrdom.   As for the rest of your commentary, I'll let others judge rationally.   It's Nadramia, not Mrs. Gilmore. They may be married but she kept her family name, one that she's proud of. And if you think nominal one-time fees, which are not promoted and at times discouraged, covers the expenses and labor required to run a growing international organization then I strongly discourage you from any business ventures.  Sometimes I wish Satanism was on the decline so that I could catch up with my Netflix queue! I've never had so many intelligent correspondences with our growing membership and supporters, especially since our Conclave, so I can't really complain.   Yes. I recognize Satanism as the carnal religion and philosophy formalized by Anton LaVey and publicly represented by the Church of Satan. I have not come to this conclusion through "faith" or arrogance, but by thoroughly examining all other attempts to redefine the term Satanism by theists and other atheists. "Theistic satanists" lack the cosmological and theological coherence to be taken seriously as a metaphysical belief system. A first year student of the Torah can wipe the floor with any writer of "theistic satanism". And recent attempts by atheist activists to take a couple of aspects of LaVey's ideas and incorporate them with a collectivist form of Secular Humanism has proven to be little more than a game of politics. I get it, they need mass appeal to gain political traction so they need to drop all the dangerous elements of LaVey's work so your friendly neighborhood liberal won't run screaming. I'm comfortable referring to such efforts as neo-satanism. This is similar to Wicca being recognized as a form of neo-paganism, but not an actual pagan religion.   1. You aren't purchasing anything, you are giving financial support to an organization that upholds the Satanic religion and philosophy. We offer you the opportunity to network with other members but what you get out of that is up to you. When I joined it was out of respect for LaVey, Gilmore, and the work of other Satanists I was in contact with. From there our relationships grew and I've been involved in a variety of projects, some public, many private.    2. First of all, it's not all that high for lifetime membership to an organization. Many religious and secular organizations charge continuous dues that quickly surpass $200. Secondly, the price is a barrier to entry.

No. We want a few good individuals who feel it worth their while to give a nod to others of their kind.    I call him a paranoid narcissistic lunatic because he murdered a person out of fear of being attacked and jealousy. But now that I think of it, he's probably autistic. This is based on both my personal correspondences with him and comments made by other people who have met and worked with him. I believe he told my friend that handicap children should be murdered and the parents should just fuck again right away to replace it. I think he accompanied this with a laugh and pelvic thrusts.     All that said, I look forward to the pen   paper RPG he's working on.   http://miamivalleyskeptics.com/episode-34-raul-antony-with-church-of-satan-satanic-scare-and-how-to-be-a-skeptic/       http://atheistairwaves.soeq.net/atheist-airwaves-24-satanpalooza/       http://www.maximummetal.com/interviews/intresults.asp?ID=erikdanielsson_watain idBand=1489  I was also interviewed and filmed for a documentary called "Satanism in the U.S." by the Dutch BNN network. Hasn't aired yet. I'll also be going to Los Angeles in a couple weeks for a live radio interview in Universal.      The only reason some people think there are so many different types of Satanism is because we live in a time where anyone can create an online persona and spew garbage without any substantial basis. Press them for details, sources, or consistency and you'll be met with something along the lines of "dude, stop being such an asshole. Do what thou wilt*, bro."     *Protip: Do what thou wilt does not mean "do what you want" and it's actually an anti-Satanic statement. It means find your "True Will", so that you achieve spiritual enlightenment. No thanks.   I didn't say I was against equal rights. If the state is doling out "rights" then they should apply to all law abiding citizens. If the State should be doling out rights at all is a whole other matter.     I've actually corresponded with Vikernes for a while when Rainer was actively communicating and forwarding letters to him in prison. I'm also very good friends with the authors of Lords of Chaos, who spent quite a bit of time with him and his writing. In all, I think the man is a lunatic. He's a paranoid narcissist at best, a sociopath more likely. His ideas on race are delusional. I have a hard time taking anyone who believes that Europeans descended from a literal Atlantis, from literal aliens that mated with humans to create a Thulean race seriously. Additionally, Varg completely rejects Satanism in any way, shape, or form. He's more about family and homeland than burning down the halls of Valhalla.   Did you actually read that article? Nicolas Wade is one of the leading writers willing to honestly say that there *are* biological differences between the races.    "Analysis of genomes from around the world establishes that there is a biological basis for race, despite the official statements to the contrary of leading social science organizations."    And yes, this is part of the Satanic philosophy.   First off, Christians didn't invent Satan. Satan in LaVey's philosophy comes from the Hebrew verb (not noun), which means "to obstruct, oppose". We take the title of Satanists to mean "the accuser" or "the adversary". While some of the symbolism and theatrics of early Church of Satan material plays on the Christian bastardization of the word "Satan", our philosophy and principles are built on top of the original Hebrew definition.    Personally, I don't really care too much about Christian "tyranny". I'm a lot more concerned about the tyranny of egalitarianism and mediocrity. ["Welcome to Costco - I love you"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-bYsEnnIUo)   I don't really think there's that much confusion, or at least it's on the decline. I've done several media appearances and interviews over the last five years and more and more Satanism as a non-theistic religion is pretty easily understood. It's my observation that the "confusion" mainly comes from people who wish there was a "confusion".    In a nutshell: Satanism is a religion and philosophy based on rational self-interest, indulgence, and a glorification of material and carnal elements.    To the Satanist, his or her only responsibility is to acknowledge yourself as a carnal beast with an evolved ability for self-identity, therefore to identify yourself as the God of your own subjective universe. In order to achieve that godhead, your base carnal needs need to be met. To this, the Satanist views himself as an individual, with his own will first and foremost. Satanism is the most radical form of individualism. This is bedrock, everything else in Satanism is built on this very principle. And this isn't an arbitrary thing LaVey just through in there because he felt like it. This is the most basic principle of all Left Hand Path traditions: to not only reject God, but to become God. So if a Satanist recognizes himself as a god, and what good is it to be a god other people your equal? If so, then how are you a god? You need to deliver the good. That's where stratification comes in. Satanism is a brutally honest understanding of who people are. Some are predators, some are prey. Some are strong, some are weak, some are smart, and some are marks. It's not wrong or right, it just is. The Satanists recognizes this and uses it to their advantage. And that's why ideas like equality and egalitarianism are inherently incompatible with Satanism. Not because we have some fetish for authority, but because without it you have no self-deification and contradict everything else that follows. So exploit your strengths and to acknowledge and mitigate your weakness in order to live a fulfilling life. That's applied stratification, that people are not blank slates, and we play the genetic hand we're dealt.    Why am I a Satanist? Because that's who I am. It's innate in the way way I live my life and how I understand the world around me. I take the title of Satanist because anything else would be hypocritical.     I honestly don't have too much of a problem with Christian followers, mainly because they are on the decline. My problem are with who I call "secular" Christians. People who reject Christianity's theology, but accept and propagate the moral and collectivist teachings of Christ. People who say, I like what Jesus was saying but I don't dig creationism. That's pretty much what I get from most Secular Humanists, and even some activists groups today who operate under the guise of "Satanism". We must speak for the downtrodden and oppressed, they say. Sounds like they're just trying to out Good Guy the Christians at their own game (Proverbs 31:8).       Got your request, but only have mobile access at the moment. Will respond later tonight.   [Original Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/355983472668/photos/a.10151996985672669.1073741826.355983472668/10152098060192669/?type=1): I call this one 'Book Signing Party'. It features Corbis, the Ram from THE DEVIL'S RAIN 1975, the Goat of Mendes from THE DEVIL RIDES OUT 1968, and Lavinia the witch from CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTER 1968.      As they should be. I understand what you're trying to get at, that we somehow support the idea of "the strong crushing the weak" as an ultimatum. We don't, that's taking one piece of our philosophy and disregarding the rest that puts it into perspective.   Maybe, not sure that's working out for them though. Such a move would be political and social martyrdom. The strong may overpower the weak, but the clever rules over all.   I've switched over to [PCGamesN](http://www.pcgamesn.com/) a long time ago.            Satanism does away with spirituality. LaVey was a militant anti-theist: "Satanism is not just an atheistic stance but a anti-theistic stance. We prefer destruction of mystically-oriented religions through active opposition rather than simple non-participation."    You say meditation and mindfulness gets "mixed up" with Buddhism, but those things are important parts of Buddhism. It's part of what makes it what it is.    Because we believe ritual, dogma, ceremony, and symbolism to be an important part of the human experience and resolved by having a religion that satiates these needs in a productive manner.   No it isn't. The organization doing this "trolling" calls themselves Satanists in order to have legal standing on religious grounds. The large majority of organized Satanism, represented by the Church of Satan, actually is opposed to many humanist positions. The Church of Satan does support the separation of Church and State and have done so via individual acts of activism and financial backing for several large secular organizations since the late 1960's.   Because rationalism isn't a religion, and Satanism is a religion that employs rationalism. Along with the base philosophy we have shared iconography, symbolism, metaphor, dogma, meta-culture, art, aesthetics, and critical theory.   At a base level we believe magic to be a form of self-hypnosis, using psychodrama, aesthetics, geometry, etc. in order to induce a state of mind that can be primed with productive goals. Some of us do think there's something more to this, something akin to psi phenomenon. We're open to that idea, and welcome our members to explore it with an open mind and healthy dose of skepticism, but we do not believe any of this to be outside of the realm of the material world. If such things are possible we hold that it does not require any belief in gods, spirits, etc.     Instead of completely abstaining from such instincts (and causing psychological damage), we use rational self-interest to balance these drives and focus them towards productive, life-affirming ends.    Not sure if joking or...    Part of our idea of ritual is the use of certain techniques similar to self-hypnosis in order to move past emotional baggage that may be harmful. For example, hatred for a person who has hurt you or someone you care for may be distracting you. Hypnosis and other techniques like this require some level of susceptibility. If these methods worked for you in the past, but then you disregard them, you'll have a hard time getting it to work again.   The primary purpose of the Church of Satan was (and is) to educate interested parties on what Satanism is, how one would apply Satanism in the real world, and to serve as a cabal of loosely connected individuals with which to network and coordinate with.    Secularization is certainly one of our desired applications of the Satanic philosophy, but we do not make any moves as a collective. That was never the idea that LaVey had for his organization, so we're staying true to that. We are an individualist organization, so we encourage the efforts of specific members, many of whom are active in other organizations such as the ACLU, Center for Inquiry, American Atheists and others. We support those individuals with various resources and help them coordinate with other members when necessary.   Sure. I'm a representative of the Church of Satan and LaVey's philosophy. Not here to debate TST and what they're doing but to clarify the difference between the groups since it seems to be a common misconception.   [TST also strongly rejects the LaVeyan fetishization of authoritarianism. We believe this is antithetical to Satanic notions of individual sovereignty. Further, while LaVeyan Satanism is atheistic  in that it rejects the notion that Satan is a conscious entity  it is still supernaturalist. TST does not forward supernatural theories of the universe and finds little value in LaVeyan edicts such as those that instruct one to acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained. (From the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth, Anton LaVey)](http://thesatanictemple.com/?page_id=23)   No, LaVey actually rejected many Humanist positions. He did not believe in the goodness of human beings, altruistic morality and distributive justice. Most of his writings are actually directly opposed to those positions.   You can join the Church of Satan if you think you'd benefit from working with other Satanists. We do not require individuals to join to call themselves Satanists or anything, but we do not recognize attempts by non-members to try to represent us or our philosophy. That said, many of our members do not coordinate with others or publicly announce their membership. They join for their own personal reasons.    The Church of Satan are not the ones behind this activity, and in many ways oppose it. The Satanic Temple is often confused with the CoS due to them being atheists.    Source: I'm a Reverend in the Church of Satan.   The Satanic Temple does not represent these statements. They do not adhere to any of LaVey's doctrines (besides some basic secularism).  	131

Makes you wonder if in the future our present science will be viewed similarly primitive, if despite all the development and refining of scientific method (our present science may seem almost perfected) we have overlooked/didn't consider something.

 My understanding is pets are a luxury.  Something you have to feed and spend time taking care of.  As such most societies did not have pets except, perhaps, the very upper classes (i.e. royalty).  That is not to say peasants and such did not keep animals.  They certainly did but those animals had to pay their own way (so to speak).

In this manner you create a loop of carbon out and carbon back in.  Better still you can build this in the shittiest places in the world (e.g. the middle of a desert...maybe use wind and solar to help run it).  Land's cheap and not being used for anything else anyway.  There is a lot of potential and, better still, this should prompt economic growth and not restrict it as new industries pop up to provide these products.    Nah.

Jon Whiten, a deputy director of New Jersey Policy Perspective, said long-term statistics show that tax rates do not cause the rich to flee.  "If millionaires were truly trying to flee NJ's top income tax rate, we probably would have lost a lot more when the rates were higher," Whiten said. "But during the 2000s NJ almost doubled the number of tax filers above $500K at a time when the tax rate was increased on them, twice."   Space is definitely a "thing" as proved by Einstein.

Why do you think a lot of spicy dishes come from hot places, such as Mexico or Thailand or India?  Ever think of that? Huh?  When you eat spicy food all sorts of things happen. Your body decides to cool off. Blood vessels close to the surface of your skin, especially on your face and neck, expand so the blood can throw off heat.  Your internal temperature goes down while your skin temperature goes up. You sweat, and as the sweat evaporates it cools you off.

You should see inside right before they leave port.  They cram food in most everywhere they possibly can (within some reason).    Sounds great but the chart tells the story.  Wages have been held down for decades on all but the executives despite increased productivity.    I'll just leave this here:  [Wealthier New Yorkers Arent Fleeing the City for Tax Havens, a Study Says](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/nyregion/wealthier-new-yorkers-arent-fleeing-the-city-for-tax-havens-a-study-says.html?ref=nyregion _r=0)    Maybe so.  Regardless the workers deserve to share in the new found prosperity too.   The issue is that while [productivity of Americans has risen over the past 30+ years](http://i.imgur.com/9L4MlB1.png) wages have not gone up and remained nearly flat.  The CEOs and top 1% are siphoning that money into their pockets.  Think of it this way.  Imagine you get paid $10/hour and can build 100 widgets per hour.  In time, through hard work, longer hours and so on, you improve to be able to build 200 widgets per hour.  Except you still get paid the same and the CEO takes a pay rise.    Not all media is saying that.  Have a look through /r/politics to see many stories posted about Sanders' improving chances.  That said some media outlets do not think anyone can seriously threaten the juggernaut that is Clinton's campaign for the Democratic nomination.  She has a lot of money and a deep organization.   I play a shit ton of game on my PC too.  I have near 200 games in my library.  Most work fine.   That said there have been some distinctly bad ports.   While I am heterosexual it is certainly possible for me to choose to get a blow-job from a guy.  It remains though that my sexual impulses have it that I get titillated by women and not men.   The recent Batman debacle made me wonder this.  Here is an example of what I am talking about:  **PS4: PC-like architecture, 8GB RAM delight developers**   What a difference a generation makes. Cerny's run-through of the PS4's specifications marked the end of the way of the PS3, with its befuddling Cell processor.   snip  "The console itself is exactly what developers were hoping for. The familiar PC architecture means we can fast track our focus on the content rather than navigating the system's complexities which will surely result in better quality titles for players across the board."  [SOURCE](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-22-ps4-pc-like-architecture-8gb-ram-delight-developers)  And...  "Ultimately, we are trying to strike a balance between features which you can use day one, and features which will allow the system to evolve over the years, as gaming itself evolves," said Cerny. The "supercharged PC architecture," that the team has come up with -- to use Cerny's term -- is designed to offer significant gains the PC can't, while still offering a familiar technological environment for engineers.  [SOURCE](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php?print=1)  I understand that the PS4/XBone are not exactly just modded PCs but it remains that they tried to get away from weird architectures that would allow developers a familiar platform to make development simpler.  So why all the problems with ports?

The more mass something has the harder it is to change its speed.  But then it also has more stuff for gravity to pull on.  These two things balance out.   I'm 48 and when I consider things I got to experience that later generations missed out on Looney Tunes is near the top of the list.  That said a later generation got Animaniacs which was outstanding so not all was lost.       Customer support is expensive and Steam has no competitive reason that would force them to improve customer service so instead they keep the money rather than spending it on improved customer service.     The chips in computers are designed to operate on only a few volts of power.  A static shock can be in the neighborhood of [20,000 - 25,000 volts](http://www.livescience.com/4077-shocking-truth-static-electricity.html).  More than enough to fry a chip designed to run on 1-2 volts.    You just have to aim the probe carefully at Jupiter to skirt around the side of the planet.  As the probe approaches the planet it speeds up.  Once it passes the planet the gravity slows it down but if you aim the probe with care it slingshots around the planet and steals a bit of the planet's angular momentum increasing its speed. (gravity assists can be used to slow down too)  New Horizon gained about 9,000 mph from the slingshot maneuver which decreased its travel time to Pluto by about three years.  It also got some [nifty photos of Jupiter](https://www.google.com/search?q=new+horizons+jupiter+flyby+images biw=1680 bih=911 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCPeu-Yqp4MYCFcsrHgodh9cEkw) as it went by (because why not as long as you are there anyway).    The probe got its speed from conventional rockets.  In space once you start going you keep going so it got an initial push then coasted the rest of the way.  Additionally the probe got a gravity assist from Jupiter.  Basically it used the gravity of Jupiter to speed itself up as it "fell" towards the gas giant.  As for its nuclear battery the probe uses a [Radioisotope thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator).  Basically there is a lump of plutonium on board and as the plutonium decays it gives off heat.  The generator uses thermocouples which convert heat into electricity.  Since it takes a long time for the plutonium to decay it can generate electricity for a long time.       I pay a $100/month for 50 mbps but no data caps (in Chicago with Comcast).  I have heard rumors they are increasing it to 75 mbps but have not seen that yet.  It is business service so more expensive than residential service but I have yet to figure out why the extra cost is better.      You're completely right but I am tired of voting for the lesser of two evils rather than a candidate I like.  Given a choice between Clinton and (say) Trump the choice is simple (Clinton) but I'll hold my nose while doing it.  And therein lies the problem.  Clinton (and her staff) are well aware of this.  As a result she knows she does not need to pander to the more liberal side of the party because she knows they won't pull the lever for the conservative anyway.  So she can safely tell them to all go fuck themselves and what are they going to do?     They can't because there is no sole owner of these companies.  Shareholders are part owners in the company and they all get a say.      ELI5 answer is because the US is spending more than it collects in taxes.  You cannot point to one thing and say that is the culprit because it is all the things the US pays for combined.  In short it is low taxes and high spending.  It [is not entirely fair to pin blame on Obama](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/is-obama-responsible-for-a-5-trillion-increase-in-the-debt/2012/05/15/gIQACA0QSU_blog.html) for it but he does bear some of the responsibility.   While my company does pay its interns (and pretty well too) it should be noted that interns in general cost us more than we ever get in work from them.  The time it takes to train them is time lost doing other things and their productivity is kinda crap (no fault of their own...they are new and learning) and the time it takes us to fix their mistakes is yet more lost productivity from salaried employees.  If they were unpaid it'd still be a pretty good deal for them for the experience.  As I said though we believe in paying them and I think that's the right thing to do (and we pay well above minimum wage).  It's just not (necessarily) fair to characterize an unpaid internship as ripping off the intern.     The Eastern District of Texas does not directly make a lot of money from this litigation. Only a $400 filing fee per patent case, and some more for admission of attorneys to practice before the court. Nothing earth shattering. BUT, my having a big docket of cases, they can get a bigger share of the budget for federal courts.   Companies are sued there so often they now pander to the residents.

Greece went on a borrowing binge.  Essentially borrowing way more then it could ever reasonably expect to be able to pay back.  It got to a point where they'd borrow just to pay on their already existing debts.  Eventually the EU got wise and tightened up their requirements for lending.  Greece was no longer able to borrow money and so were about to default on their loans (not pay them).  The EU started making arrangements with Greece to implement austerity measures (i.e. belt tightening measures) in return for loans to continue paying their debts.  These austerity measures had the effect of smashing the Greek economy causing massive unemployment among other problems.  The people voted to stop the austerity measure but the EU told Greece it was that or default.  They fought about it a bit but looks like the EU prevailed and the Greek government has agreed to another round of austerity in return for new loans.    Charter schools win.  Neighborhood schools not so much.      Modern humans (i.e. the species we all belong to today) came on the scene around 200,000 years ago (not 5 million).

That is a reality I have never forgotten: today, there are many millions of families who are living under the circumstances that we lived under.  snip  In Chicago, Sanders threw himself into activismcivil rights, economic justice, volunteering, organizing. I received more of an education off campus than I did in the classroom, Sanders says.

He became leaders of an NAACP ally called the Congress of Racial Equality at a time when most civil rights activists were black. He was arrested while demonstrating for desegregated public schools in Chicago. (No big deal, says Sanders: You can go outside and get arrested, too! he jokes. Its not that hard if you put your mind to it.) He once walked around Chicago putting up fliers protesting police brutality.

There is a risk the borrower is lying.  That stuff is priced into the interest rate on the loan.  It is up to the banks to do their due diligence and investigate the borrower for credit worthiness and to not make loans so large to one entity that a default by that entity constitutes a threat to the solvency of the bank.     Lending money to a first-world country that's a member of the euro doesn't sound like it should be much of a risk.   Nevertheless it is *their* risk and not ours.  That is the name of the game.  It does not matter whether they thought these were good loans or not.  They are privatizing profits and socializing the losses.

Truffles are cultivated: http://www.truffletree.com/cultivation/    It absolutely did not deem that money=speech. Please show me where in the opinion is says that money is speech?   Here is a [better explanation](http://www.amendmentgazette.com/how-spending-money-became-a-form-of-speech/) than I can provide here.  In short it started with [Buckley v. Valeo](http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_B.shtml#buckley) and culminated with Citizens United.  From Buckley:  A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.  This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in todays mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorates increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.       I agree free speech needs to be diligently protected but Citizens United put corporate speech on par with individual speech and deemed that money = speech.    Therein lies the problem.   Doesn't really matter.  It remains you cannot yell "fire" in a crowded theater when there is no fire and expect protection under free speech.   By law people in the public eye have far less claim to being slandered than your average Joe does.  In addition:  There is a unique rule of tort injury law that protects news entertainers Rush Limbaugh, Bill O' Reilly and Sean Hannity from liability from nearly any slanderous remark they make about any private citizen or public figure.  In tort law a plaintiff cannot bring a libel lawsuit against a defendant with a public reputation as a liar.   The legal reasoning is that a known liar cannot damage the reputation of anybody, because nobody will believe the slanderous remarks of a known public liar!That means that Limbaugh, Hannity and O' Reilly have made so many inaccurate, misleading and untruthful remarks about various people that they cannot be sued for libel because any reasonable person would never believe anything they said. So goes the precedent of law.  Therefore Limbaugh, Hannity and O'Reilly are practically exempt from tort actions and the more they slander people the harder it becomes to bring a lawsuit against them.  [SOURCE](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/01/09/288674/-Why-Limbaugh-or-Fox-News-Are-Never-Sued-for-Libel)  Add to that Fox has battalions of expensive lawyers so suing them would be mighty expensive and difficult.  That said they do get sued for it.  Most recently [Lindsay Lohan has sued for defamation.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsay-lohan-mother-file-defamation-lawsuit-against-fox-news/)     No rights are absolute.  They are all circumscribed to one degree or another.  For instance the right to free speech is limited in a number of ways.  You cannot slander someone or yell "fire" in a crowded theater (when there is no fire) and claim free speech as protection.  So, understanding the unique role of elections in a democracy and seeking to maintain their integrity is a worthy goal and one the state has a legitimate interest in.  Citizen's United threw the door wide on corporate spending in elections.  The majority argued that the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on the identity of the speaker. Corporations, as associations of individuals, therefore have speech rights under the First Amendment. Because spending money is essential to disseminating speech, as established in Buckley v. Valeo, limiting a corporation's ability to spend money is unconstitutional because it limits the ability of its members to associate effectively and to speak on political issues.   snip  At bottom, the Court's opinion is thus a rejection of the common sense of the American people, who have recognized a need to prevent corporations from undermining self government since the founding, and who have fought against the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electioneering since the days of Theodore Roosevelt. It is a strange time to repudiate that common sense. While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this Court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics.  [SOURCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC)   If they make a clear, public and *legally binding* commitment I'll believe them.   EDIT:  Spelling   Dunno why but it is hard to see her as a her.  Maybe it is just bulldogs having a male vibe.    Regardless I wish I could pet her and hold her.    I am pretty sure this is sarcasm but it is worth noting here (as people reading this may have cause to enlighten some others) that the Civil War was absolutely about slavery from the get-go.    Lincoln was fighting (initially) to preserve the union and said if he had to let slavery continue to do that then that is what he'd do.  But for the southern states it was always about slavery and the thing is they were pretty explicit about it:  *...an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery...* SOURCE: [Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp)  They actually go on quite a bit about slavery in that document.  It is absolutely the central issue for them.  And then there is Mississippi:  *Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.* SOURCE: [A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp)  So yeah, it was about slavery.    That or the publisher said, "Here's $100, do the best you can.  You've got a week."  Iron Galaxy's reputation is on the line.  Either they suck at their jobs or they did as well as anyone could within the restrictions they had (time-frame, budget, etc. imposed by the publisher).   Yeah.  This is what I don't get.  Was there no oversight from Rocksteady?  Did they just hand it off and hope everything just went to plan?  Did no one test this before it came out?  I mean, there is always someone who will complain a new game doesn't run right upon release but when this many people are complaining it is hard to imagine how this was missed if there was anything like quality control.    I had it work the other way around.  I got my card a week before Batman was added to the deal.  I contacted Newegg (who I had bought the card from) and asked if I could get Batman added to it.  They were totally cool and did.  As a result a few weeks later I bought all the components for my new computer from them as my way of supporting that great customer service.   Actually I got the Witcher AND Batman so can't complain.    Unfortunately (or fortunately depending how you look at it) I got mine as a promotion whey I bought my last video card.  I can't return it but then it technically didn't cost me anything.    To be fair I'd hardly call a 970 "puny".  It's very nearly as good as a 980.  970 is probably the 3rd fastest card of the last 6 months and only barely at that.  Doubtless some people will nitpick but bottom line it is not "puny".        If that weren't the case, the system would be bleeding money, because let's get real, bankruptcy at age 22 to erase 20 to 100K of loans is an option that a ton of people would take.   This is the story the banks want you to believe and what they were peddling when they first lobbied to make it impossible to discharge a student loan through bankruptcy.  Stagflation was sending an unprecedented number of Silent Majority members into bankruptcy, and the bank lobby was fighting back with a propaganda assault that scapegoated counterculture student delinquents who were allegedly taking loans with no goal of paying them. As Shuchman and others explained in hearings, only about 4 percent of people who filed for bankruptcy protection in 1975 had student loans on their balance sheets, and of those, fewer than one-fifth did not have substantial other debts motivating them to file.

She cannot afford an attorney.      So it is a matchmaking thing?  If you have a higher tier ship you are matched against better players?    I am with you on not ganking noobs.  Way back in the day (in a different game) I had that happen to me in the noob starting zone.  Was not a fan.  I won't do it here.     Possibly upload a replay, so people can say what you're doing wrong.  Is there a simple way to record your game play in WoWS?  I suppose I can use Nvidia's thing but have never tried it.    In my case I pretty much get owned left and right using the Tier-7 USS Sims yet rock-and-roll with the Tier-5 USSR Grenaschy (sp?).  Both are destroyers.  Both seem to be sort of equivalent but holy shit...I have a great time and reasonable success with the USSR destroyer and regularly achieve nothing with the Sims.  What gives?  I mean, I know no one here has seem my gameplay (probably) but I cannot imagine why there is such a disparity.  NOTE:  I am NOT blaming the game and calling for nerfs or buffs.  99.9% certain the fault lies with me.  Just can't figure out where.    This.  I have launched wide spreads and tight spreads from as close as 3km (2km in one case I remember) and had battleships dodge them all or, maybe, take one hit.  Long range?  Forget it.  The only time I get any torp hits at over 5km is by sheer luck.  Add to that the torps do not do a whole lot of damage.  They should be among the most devastating hits in the game but four hits on a BB barely takes it down by a third of total HP.  To think any BB can soak up 12+ torps (from a ship, not planes) before dying is ridiculous.    I think the issue with a DD surviving a 16" gun hit is over penetration of those shells.  They pretty much go right through, poking a hole in the ship without exploding.  And I can guarantee the secondaries on a BB lay on plenty of hurt. Unless the BB drivers want to make DDs literally worthless they have it pretty good already.  You can ignore a DD (except to evade torps) and leave your secondaries to put on the hurt.  A DD has to get into your secondary range, well within it, for any reasonable chance at a successful torp strike.  DD guns are literally worthless against a BB.  It is torps or nothing (so much so I never even bother shooting guns at a BB most times except out of boredom).  All-in-all a BB has it pretty good vs a DD.  Watch the list at the top of ships (green and red) and almost always the first things dead on the field are all the DDs.  That hardly speaks of OP destroyers.  ETA:  [Here is a carrier dodging multiple torpedoes in a single strike](https://youtu.be/mCzFMMXcEc8?t=1066) from close range.  Before you think you have it bad consider a miss rate like this from point-blank range.   Good.  I really do not want to see a Clinton coronation.  I'm not sure yet who I'll vote for but I expect all the candidates (Clinton included) to work for my vote.  If she figures to skate by and coast through the primaries I guarantee she will lose at least my vote.  I realize she probably does not give a shit about my vote but then she made that mistake running against Obama and by the time she got serious it was too late for her.      I live in Chicago and just dumped Sprint for Verizon.  Sprint's network here is painfully slow.  I could only barely browse the web without giving up in frustration most times.  Add in dropped calls were a regular occurrence.  I can never remember having four bars on my phone (well, sometimes it would show four bars but as soon as I'd do anything it'd immediately drop to one or two).  Verizon is more expensive but so far the service has been lightning fast in comparison.  EDIT:  Here is my current speed with Verizon.  This is faster than my home connection by a fair bit:  [71.6 down and 41 up](http://i.imgur.com/kBMAk3s.jpg)   It's also how phone calls find you.  The SIM identifies you to the system so when a call for you comes in the phone company knows which tower to route the call to.   That is a greatly simplified picture.  For instance, Pluto's orbit is elliptical enough that occasionally it is inside the orbit of Neptune and Neptune is further away from the sun (last time it was like this was from 1979 - 1999).    All orbits are ellipses.  A perfectly spherical orbit is in theory possible but the details of the two orbiting bodies (mass, distance, velocity and so on) would have to be *exactly* spot on which is highly unlikely (not to mention other planets and whatnot can perturb an orbit so it likely would not stay perfect for long).    Paul and his ilk are operating under the assumption that progressive taxes are somehow unfair.  As it happens, when you account for ALL taxes people pay (which is a lot more than just income tax) and measure the *effective* tax rate (what people actually pay versus what is advertised), then you can see [the tax rate across income groups is pretty flat](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/just-how-progressive-is-the-tax-system/?_r=0) (except for the very poor).  A flat tax as he proposes would be highly regressive.  He'd be dramatically lowering taxes on the rich and dramatically raising them on the poor.    In short, put the burden on the people least able to bear it.        Hard tacos or soft tacos?  This is important.   Watch this 16 minute bit on [Predatory Lending by John Oliver.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDylgzybWAw)  (NSFW language) It explains the issue well and is funny even though the topic is anything but funny.   It is not censorship.  Germany has a copyright system in place that is even more screwy than what we have in the US.  They are very aggressive at taking down stuff they think is "owned" by someone else.   It has often been noted that the line between bribery and lobbying is very thin.  Technically a bribe is an outright quid pro quo.  You give person-X money and they will do whatever it is you ask.  Lobbying on the other hand is not technically a quid pro quo. It is merely going to talk to your representative about a particular issue and to try and convince them your way is the right way.  On the face of it that is fine.  However, "talking" to your representative may include flying them out to a 5-star resort and giving them a 3-Michelin star meal after a round of golf.  Add in a donation to their re-election fund.  The representative is not obligated to vote they way the lobbyist wants but they know where the good stuff comes from and so are likely to vote favorably for the lobbyist.    Hence the Asterisk!  *Still in existence, by barrel weight.  The video says this cannon weighed 100 tons which equals 200,000 pounds.  As noted the Iowa battleship guns weighed in at 268,000 pounds.  The battleship Iowa also still exists.  You can go see it [here.](http://www.pacificbattleship.com/page/directions-)    This is not the biggest gun.  Not even close.  - The [Paris Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Gun) had a barrel length of over 111 feet and a range of 81 miles.  Some say the shells likely arced into low earth orbit making them the first man made anything put into space.  - The [Schwerer Gustav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerer_Gustav) weighed in at 1,350 tonnes, had a barrel length of 106 feet and a range of 29 miles shooting a 7.1 tonne shell.  - If we want one still in existence (as in you can go see it and it, in theory, could be fired again) see the [Iowa Class battleship naval rifles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16%22/50_caliber_Mark_7_gun)  Almost 67 feet long, weighing 268,000 pounds throwing a 2,700 pound projectile 24 miles.   Because Palin was clearly a moron.  Warren is clearly not a moron.   It may be trite but I think [this bit](https://youtu.be/zemrWBIc_hE?t=63) from the movie "American President" sums it up pretty well (at least the part I linked to).   The simple version is the computer uses something called the [North Bridge and South Bridge](http://routermatrix.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NorthbridgeSouthbridge.jpg) to move data around.  Basically the CPU needs to talk to other parts of the computer.  System memory, the hard drive, peripherals and so on.  The north bridge is a chip dedicated to managing communication with with things that need the best performance (fast) so it would connect system memory and PCI-Express slots.  The south bridge would handle USB, SATA, PCI and other slower peripherals.  So, the CPU would need something and tell the appropriate chip to go get it for them.  Then that chip would handle communicating with the outside part and pass the info on to the CPU.  Of course all these items are on a motherboard and interconnected.  These days some CPUs have taken over the north bridge and put them on the CPU itself to be faster.  The south bridge is still there though.    Run for public office as a republican.   True but it is paving the way to 1933.  1924 is recent history to the people of 1933 and certainly was a factor in the rise of the Nazi party.   Really old:  [Populous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJPlseI57o)  Very old: [Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IDFLndcC0g) (not to mention the earlier ones but this one really blew my mind...wish someone would do something like this again)  Semi-old:  [Black   White](https://youtu.be/edccqcxVJ_M?t=133)    It was an effort to pay reparation during the Weimar Republic that led to hyperinflation in Germany.  Germany turned on its printing presses to print money in an effort to buy foreign currency with which to pay their debt.  That led to pictures [like this](http://www.wnd.com/images/washington110625.jpg) of people carting around money in wheelbarrows.  The exchange rate eventually got over 4 trillion German marks to the dollar.  Obviously that was ridiculous and untenable. Germany fell back into a barter economy for awhile there.    Don't forget tax reasons.  If the hospital charges $1,000 for a band-aid and you don't pay the hospital gets to claim a $1,000 loss and write-off on their taxes.   In general the courts take a dim view of discrimination based on things you cannot change (gender, skin color, etc.).  Hygiene is distinctly under an individual's control and can be rectified to allow you to eat there.   The brain does not record memories like a hard drive.  You actually reconstruct memories as they are needed.    Because of the way memories are encoded and stored, memory recall is effectively an on-the-fly reconstruction of elements scattered throughout various areas of our brains. Memories are not stored in our brains like books on library shelves, or even as a collection of self-contained recordings or pictures or video clips, but may be better thought of as a kind of collage or a jigsaw puzzle, involving different elements stored in disparate parts of the brain linked together by associations and neural networks. Memory retrieval therefore requires re-visiting the nerve pathways the brain formed when encoding the memory, and the strength of those pathways determines how quickly the memory can be recalled. Recall effectively returns a memory from long-term storage to short-term or working memory, where it can be accessed, in a kind of mirror image of the encoding process. It is then re-stored back in long-term memory, thus re-consolidating and strengthening it. [SOURCE](http://www.human-memory.net/processes_recall.html)    He was but a lot of rich people were "making"money with Madoff.  In some respects it didn't matter if the money was there or not.  They could go to banks and get loans showing their account with Madoff as collateral.  No one wanted to admit the emperor had no clothes so they ignored it.    A lot of very wealthy people and others had a lot of money invested with Madoff.  They all had paperwork from him that said they had $XXXX in their accounts.  These people have attorneys and know people in government.  When Madoff could not make good and give them the money he said they had these people called their attorneys and congresscritters.  As early as 2001 a fellow named [Harry Markopolos was trying to warn the SEC about Madoff.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal#Bernard_L._Madoff_Securities_LLC:_1999.2C_2000.2C_2004.2C_2005.2C_and_2006)  Despite many attempts over the years the SEC ignored him and his (considerable) evidence.     Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme.  Basically they are promising big returns on your money that aren't really there.  The scheme works as long as people put money in but not a lot goes out.  As long as people think it is working the money flows mostly into the scheme and not out.  As it happened in 2008 there was a financial crisis.  Many people, taking losses elsewhere, went to Madoff and tried to withdraw money from their accounts (money they had been told was there).  Thing is the money was not there and Madoff could not make good on these requests.  That is when the whole thing fell apart.   	141
 I can get my hands on Pet Semetary today. What do you think about that book?   Alrigh, will pick up that one today. Thank you!   Oh man. Which one should I go for then since it's my first Stehphen King's book.   Now I am really torn between Mr. Mercedes and Pet Semetary. No freaking idea which one I should go for.   Which writer/book would you rate highly that is quite challenging intelectually so to speak.   Can I read Pet Semetary without any knowledge regarding his previous books?   What do you think about Pet Semetary?   So far, only you have recommended Pet Sematery. Is it worth reading thst book first over Mr. Mercedes?      Can't get my hands on 11/22/63 tomorrow since I have to order it first, but I figure'd starting with Mr. Mercedes wouldn't be too shabby.   I already have fallout 3.   Coming as a huge fan of Jo Nesbo, I'm interested in crime/mystery books. What do you think of Stephen King's book 'Mr. Mercedes'?   Are there any other good mystery   crime books nowdays that are absolutely a 'must read' ?   no thanks, have fallout already.   Would you say that he did a good job regarding **Mr. Mercedes**?     I recently stumbled upon some of his books, and I'm torn apart whether I should start reading him or not.  Coming as a huge fan of Jo Nesbo, and seeing how Mr. Mercedes, Stephen's 2014 book got awards for best thriller and mystery, i'm eager to just purchase it and try my luck.  What do you guys think of Stephen Kings and his writings? Which books would you rate from his collection? Which books are a 'must read' from him?      Any chance for a deadpool this week?    the other guy gave me hope 2-3 days ago :((   Any chance for Deadpool showing up soon? :(   Nothing here unfortunately, sorry.   Price?   I will pass on that   Sure, offer me what you had on mind?   I have gtx 970, i5 4690k and 16 GB of RAM.

P.S. - it's not my video, but almost the same thing happens to me on PC.   I completely agree that batmobile puzzles with riddler were good, and tank battles weren't THAT bad imo. It's just that there was too many of them, so essentially it got dull after a while. I still enjoyed them, but I think they went over the top while trying to show off new feature.   I've been playing a lot since I beat Arkham Knight last week.   First off:   **Witcher 3** - I'm really enjoying the game and the story overall, but it's so overwhelming, and I must be one of the few guys that don't go out of their way to pick up a quest. True, I do side quests since they are somewhat interesting and unique up to certain point, but I don't really go to a particular place just so I could take a quest with me. For now, I paused my Witcher 3 gameplay since I wanted to wait for new patch - (1.07). I was experiencing ocassional pop-ins regarding NPC-s and some stuff wasn't rendered properly, so I hope this patch fixes most of these problems.   **Wolfenstein The New Order + The Old Blood**   Played both, finished both. First one is better than the standalone 'mini' expansion, but I liked them both equally nonetheless. Second one has it's own charm, and I enjoyed the story for the most part. However, it felt rather short to me, or maybe I just didn't pay attention to time at all. When people say that it's 12-16 hours long, do they mean with both storylines including Fergus and private Wyatt or what?   **Assassin's Creed Unity**  Thankfully, I can run this game smoothly on 60 FPS, and I really like new running mechanics and all, but I can't stand NPC pop-ins and their clothes appearing out of nowhere. Other than that, I'm enjoying the game overall but I'm probably just around 4-5 hours in so I barely touched the surface imo.   I'm playing all of these on PC, and next up is Dying Light and wrapping up with Witcher 3.   I missed a lot because I couldn't run these games up until 2-3 weeks ago when I got my new PC, so I'm kinda catching up with stuff during this 'dry' gaming period.   on max, 1080p game usage is 3 GB. no idea what you are talking about ...   I didn't get shit, and I heard you get World of Tanks code for buying i5 4690k. I got nothing but oh well, didn't buy hardware for that anyway.   any NPC pop-ins?   I beat everything except riddle challenges. Fuck that man.   Same here man, clothes popping in out of nowhere and glitching as hell man. Running smoothly overall but that bothers the shit out of me.   I didn't get a code for my either games (batman and witcher) and I purchased my gtx 970 gainward 2 weeks ago. Is it possible to redeem codes via serial number and receipt?   Yea, it truly is good imo.   Did they fix NPC pop-ins and texture pop-ins that happen occassionally? (At least on PC, that's the case)   Alright, good that I'm not the only one to notice it. Really breaks my immersion to be honest but oh well.    What about pop ins? Do you have issues with textures and NPC pop-ins?   Framerate wise, it's fine, solid 60 fps on very high with gtx 970 and i5 4690k.  Problem is, a lot of NPC-s texture pop-ins like clothes and such + is draw distance really terrible since some textures do not render completely until I come closer.  Any solutions? Texture popins really annoy me unfortunately.   Have all of those, thank you for listing them on top nonetheless, everyone should experience these fantastic games :)   I'm still waiting for Deadpool, anything worth mentioning from this sale that stands out?   That's rude.   thanks for the insight, I appreciate that.   any chance of deadpool being on sale?    post offers below please.   thanks.   Same here man, 2 problems that bugged the shit out of me.   No, you don't need that much.    you don't need an expensive PC to match console quality + to play on 60 fps ;)   shocking on PC? oh, it's shocking to play on ULTRA with all extra features and 60 fps which consoles do NOT have?   I know it's shocking for you, but you'll get over it man, don't worry!   Price?   I got that for 2 keys over at dispenser.tf/train_subject9972   7362   Yes, witcher is better on PC, educate yourself a bit.    What? Why would I want a 'decent console game' when everything is better on PC?   confirmed   Rocket League is on PC too...  nice try tho.   Yea, I can pay in csgo, offer?   Can you accept me so we can talk on steam?  edit: I need only 1 copy anyway   https://www.indiegala.com/store/product/dying-light/239140   I'm looking for that, in tf2/csgo keys. Post your prices below and I'll add you if it's reasonable.   Good thing it's raw.   that on demand?  edit: added you to discuss.   While we are at it, do you know if it's possible for me to switch to Intel HD Graphics 4600 while browsing, and that it automatically switches to my gtx 970 when I enter the game?   While we are at it, does anyone know if it's possible for me to switch to Intel HD Graphics 4600 while browsing, and that it automatically switches to my gtx 970 when I enter the game?   Not the OP but what would be the max normal temperature for example on gtx 970? Is 85 a lot?   I've been getting a lot NPC pop-ins, stuff pop in out of nowhere, texture appear from the sky, and I noticed that A LOT of NPCs have familiar faces that I've seen before already. And I'm talking about side-quests NPC-s, merchants that you free from bandits / free from cages, and game is glitchy as hell somehow. It really breaks my immersion.   I'm playing on gtx 970, 16 gigs of ram and i5 4690k, 1080p ultra,  60 stable FPS and I don't know why is that happening. Any help?   Is there a singleplayer campaign/ split screen coop for singleplayer?

Simple as that, have both TF2 and CSGO keys. Leave your prices below.   I'll check with a really small game and see how it goes. Thanks for your input I appreciate it.   Damn, alright.   What if I download it on my first laptop/pc and transfer it to my second PC, then go online?   Will game get recognized immediately?    I have a laptop/pc where I can download stuff from. In this particular case, I'd like to download a certain game from steam on this laptop that has internet access, then transfer THAT game over my second PC without internet access.   On my other PC, I already run game(s) in offline mode, so that's not a problem.   Will steam recognize the game?     the 970 has a fan off mode  every 970 or just a particular one?   I'm pretty sure mine gainward at IDLE where temperature is 31* uses its fans.   Do you know if it's possible to [Spoiler](#s "activate knightfall protocol") before finding every single riddle?    Props to you man, I'll do all the side missions except finding all those trophies. It'll take me forever it seems.     I would love it if L2 for Battle Mode were a toggle instead of a hold,  You can switch it in options menu so that BattleMode is a toggle instead of hold, although it'll be on R1 I believe. (at least it's possible on PC version)   **Batman Arkham Knight** - PC  I just got a new PC, and I guess I'm one of the lucky ones who can run the game on 60 fps with few fps drops here and there. My question is for the people who had already beat the game:  [Spoiler](#s "I got the first ending where you lock Scarecrow up. I want to get second ending where Bruce 'fakes' his death, but I wanted to ask: Do I have to 100% the game (find all riddle trophies) in order to activate Arkham Knight Protocol? Or 100% is for the third ending?")  I've been enjoying this new Batman, best game in the series for me, no doubt.   Same here.   6 for metro redux bundle   https://youtu.be/P8EgXDHHrcI?t=45s  Top left corner, is it MSI burner or HWiNFO or which one?

Ori is not just pretty. Its story is overall solid and gameplay is great.   Fuck Olly.

Please answer here.  **If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**  I'm looking to max almost everything out on 1080p with steady 50-60 FPS constantly.  **PC Specifications**  **What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**  My budget is around 1000-1200  Please answer here.  **In what country are you purchasing your parts?**  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Please answer here.  **Motherboard**: MB Gigabyte GA-Z97X Gaming 3  **CPU**: CPU Intel i5-4690K BOX  **SSD Kingston HyperX Fury**: 120GB SATA-6Gb SHFS37A/120G  **GPU**: VGA GTX 970 4 GB Gigabyte  **RAM**: DDR-III 16GB PC3- 1866 HyperX Fury  **HDD** WD10EZEX 1 TB, SATA-6Gb, 7200rpm, 64MB  **Case**: Thermaltake Element T  **PSU**: FSP Hyper 700 W  Also gonna add Cooler Mugen 3 for my CPU so I can overclock it later on.  What do you think of this all? Any input is very appreciated and welcome!       29 keys.   Feel free to ask prices about CSGO, Prison Architect, Chivalry Complete, which are few games that are cheapest in EU2 region.   State the game that you'd wish to purchase,  number of copies, and type of keys.   10x csgo - 33.5 TF2 keys  20x L4D2 - 34 TF2 keys   those games are cheaper in other regions mate :R   Chivalry Complete - 28 tf2 keys / 25 vanilla / 24.5 uncommon  Prison Architect - 36 tf2 / 32.5 vanilla / 32 uncommon    yea  edit: thanks for the trade   20 csgo in **vanilla** csgo keys - 58 keys   20 csgo in **non vanilla, for  example chroma 2 - 57 keys    State number of copies, and type of keys.     Feel free to ask prices about CSGO, Prison Architect, Chivalry Complete, which are few games that are cheapest in EU2 region.   State number of copies, and type of keys.   thanks for the trade   confirmed.   Can I add you in case I need something to buy later during the sale? And do you accept bulk orders?    They said 6 weeks - 1 episode actually, so yea, it's delayed :)   I can deal with delayed release and all, but what annoys the fuck out of me is lack of communication from telltale. If you are late, just say that you won't be able to hit the deadline and that you'll try to release the game in following 1-2 weeks or so. Just a pure communication would be fine, but not even that.   Around 64, but TF2 are really low, below 2 currently :(   no problem, cheers.   Around 56, but then again, keys are really low right now, so I'd strongly suggest waiting out till tomorrow if you plan on buying csgo copies in hopes of them recovering over night.    Will this ever happen during this sale? Given that they placed CSGO on 'daily deals' , I reckon the discount and the price will stay the same throughout the whole sale.   Correct?   Hi.   I can sell CSGO from my store for 3 CSGO keys / 3.5 TF2 keys depending on their current value on the market. I'll try to get you closest to the actual price, without taking 'large' profits.   Feel free to post here or add me directly.   R9 290? Who's talking about R9 290?   same here.   confirmed   I can do that  EDIT: Thanks for the trade!   Title.   Feel free to just add me and we'll discuss the price and games that I'm looking for.   check PM if you can.   I'm stuck on the same problem :R    http://v1t.su/projects/steam/webtools/  This extension is not listed in the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge. Learn more.  That's what happens when I try to use Developer version of Chrome. Chrome Canary   I think that's the same one.   edit: nevermind, guy doesn't know what he really wants.   why are you 100% sure it won't be cheaper?   ?   I'm expecting this to hit the front page tho.   http://store.steampowered.com/sale/cs/   If it does, you really think they'll put the same discount?    I'm also wondering, since the game itself isn't on daily/flash sale, just a regular sale.   4 csgo keys for Metro Redux Bundle.

I have around 25+ hours clocked on it, and it's in EA. I'm waiting for them to release new dungeon, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the game, it's amazingly good. :)   I can vouch for NBA 2k15 and Darkest Dungeon.

 Sure, [i love adding new folks too](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28108653-jash-comstock)   I am a goodreads user, as I am sure many of you are, and I am trying to up my review game. I want to contribute and participate in quality and thoughtful dialogue about the books I read. What makes a great review? What format tips, content tips, or other suggestions would you make to someone trying to improve their reviews?   Jesus was not a politician. In fact he tended to stay out of political discussions altogether (Matt. 22:21)   In the tsp website (not my pay). Once you enroll you should get a letter outlining how to log on   This is the answer I was looking for, thanks.   I realize it is already diversified, I never said it was not. But there is a spectrum of funds to contribute to, and I was just curious if there is any value to contributing to more than one.      Either would be fine with me   Can anyone recommend books documenting U.S history from a multicultural perspective? Something that explores the various influences that melted into the pot of our melting pot? Specifically African and Hispanic influences on early American thought, history, and culture.   I am a progressive Democrat and I agree with you. Background checks and registration are about as far as much gun control as I support. I am a proud gun owner myself.   Arguably it was FDR's fleet of weapons that saved England from being captured. They were pretty much done for on their own.    And if they had been occupied, I sincerely doubt that it would have meant global domination for the Nazis. The U.S. was not even in the picture at that point, FDR and the Russians likely would have routed the Nazis even without the help of England.   The zombie apocalypse has come, but you are able to teleport any world leader from the past or present to take charge of your nation to respond to the apocalypse. Who do you choose and why?   Considering the ridiculous gaggle that is the Republican party, he might not be as done as you think he is.   One of the things I admire the most about Bill Clinton's legacy is his emphasis on a peace-oriented foreign policy. Hillary seems to have a more hawkish legacy, support for the Iraq war, a hawkish time as Sec. Of State.     What do y'all think?    As a working class Centrist Democrat I have long felt my party was moving away from me, Jim Webb inspires my optimism. I know he is unlikely to win against Clinton, but it is nice to know that my party isn't totally progressive.      Donald Trump   From what I understand the Army used to have two enlisted promotion tracks, one for leaders/NCOs and one for technocal experts (spc4 etc)  Why did we stop? Has pushing all soldiers into a leadership track had a serious impact on the NCO corps? Do you think we should go back to that practice?   Weird question I know. I do not see them as much anymore, but in old photos I always see Democrats wearing flat round straw hats (kind of like Barbershop Quartet straw hats) to conventions and stiff, usually with a patriotic band around the hat.. Can anyone explain whether this is strictly a Democrat thing and where it started?   Also, grouchy ass soldiers typically are preferable in the field to relaxed and comfortable soldiers. Ain't nothing wrong with a few bad attitudes every now and then   That he served with the [7th Infantry Division](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Infantry_Division_(United_States))            Afghanistan. Totally different culture, and totally different experience being in a third world country   Dude is lucky to have a girl who trusts him against such accusations!   I'd like to participate!   I am interested in history, gardening, fiction/literature, travel, and writing. I am fairly friendless (though not exactly antisocial). Anyone want to be my friend?   Depends on what you mean by "check out". Finding a girl attractive is totally natural, and appreciating it is totally ok in my book. Slobbering over her like a piece of meat is something else altogether.   I am a 22 year old bookworm and very shy with women/females and just want to expand my friend base to include more women. I thought perhaps reddit would be a good place to overcome my lifelong shyness with girls. I hope I am not coming off as pathetic/creepy, just looking for friends..    I am very shy with women/females and just want to expand my friend base to include more women. I thought perhaps reddit would be a good place to overcome my lifelong shyness with girls. I hope I am not coming off as pathetic/creepy, just looking for friends..   I love firearms. I go to the range, hunt, and other firearm related hobbies.    I am also a huge gearhead, I love working on my motorcycle.      Take a dance class. There are no downsides.  1. You will be more confident.   2. Ladies generally find dancing attractive.   3. If you are single, dance classes are often a great place to meet other singles.        Whenever I talk to most kids near my age I think *god my generation is a bunch of fucking morons*.     I do not like to identify as a millenial.   Short answer; because Turkey has been at odds with the Kurds (the folks fighting ISIS) for a very long time. Many of the Peshmergas that are fighting ISIS now were fighting Turkey not long ago.     They want ISIS to beat the Kurds (though they won't admit it)      One of the soldiers I serve with is originay from Sri Lanka and will not stop bragging about the country. This has really made me want to see the place for myself, but I do not hear about a lot of Sri Lanka tourism.    **Length** Around a week.    I love exploring Buddhist sacred places, and love seeing places that are out of the typical tourist paths. I have heard quite a bit about Sri Lanka's tea and spice production, this would be interesting to learn about first hand. I love food and am a lretty adventurous traveller.    Can anyone speak from experience about travelling to Sri Lanka? Any recommendations or warnings? What about websites, books, or articles about Sri Lanka that would be useful for my travel research.?    I do not think English as a major was a mistake. College was a mistake. I have tons of debt, no job, and I am only now getting trained in a trade that can actually profit me. Many college grads are unemployed, while certified and unionized allied trade workers have phenomenal jobs. College is not for everyone, and do not let anyone tell you that you need to go to college to be successful. You need to have skills to be successful. There are other ways to procure those skills than college. Trade school, apprenticeship, the military etc can all make you *way* more successful than college and are way cheaper..    It is something to think about.   Yup. American high school kids are pretty much told that success= college. Blue collar jobs are seen as last resorts  by many. The truth is certified, unionized blue collar jobs make phenomenal money. Trade school is cheaper than college. Employment is way steadier and almost guaranteed in many areas.   I took all the basics, focused on tons of English and lit courses. I went to college (worst mistake of my life) for English, and I have been in the Army for the past four years... finally paying off debt. I wish I would have pursued trade school or an apprenticeship after highschool, college only gave me debt.      1. Who is your favorite Democrat President of all time?  2. Who is your favorite Republican President of all time?  3. Explain your choices.   I think it is significant that nearly every post 9/11 vet in the house and senate is a Democrat. Nearly every veteran caucus is a Democrat majority caucus.     Most vets benefits were initiated by Democrats; the Montgomery G.I. Bill, Post 9/11 G.I. Bill.... And then uou have the so called "Fighting Dems" who took the Hill in '06, all Veterans, all critical of how Bush handled the GWOT, all Democrats..   I just do not understand why vets would support the hawkish right...   Thats awesome, I just saw the 173rd flag and was curious   Did you serve with The Herd?   Your father sounds like an amazing man. Thank you for sharing!   That is awesome!            You made some really great points. I had never thought about how lower income people spend more money on things that actually benefit the economy, while higher income people are more likely to spend their tax cut on luxuries..     I am not entirely sold on the idea of progressive taxes, but you certainly gave me some food for thought to chew on..   Politics are not allowed in /r/military   Veterans overwhelmingly support Republicans. It has been this way pretty much since FDR.. As a veteran myself, I see many of my brothers vehemently opposed to the Democratic party because of assumptions about our patriotism etc.. What message should our party extend to vets to let them know we are looking out for them?   The growth of a language as an international language is an organic thing, not something socially engineered by a board or anything. I am a native English speaker, and I agree that it is not the best language for international business use, but it is not something we can just change. It rose to power when the US spearheaded the growth of global economy. The organic nature of things like the languages people choose make it difficult to change.   I believe in a flat tax system, where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in income tax. I do not believe in a progressive tax system where richer people pay a higher percentage than poor people. I am a working class democrat, but I do not see a progressive system stimulating economic growth. It seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class.. On the other hand, I believe a flat tax based would be fairer. Rich people would pay more (because 15% of a million is higher than 15% of 35'000) but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the US economy instead of finding ways around the tax code... Can someone make a solid case for a progressive tax system directed at a working class guy like me? _____   *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Or Wet T-shirt Contests   The best you can do right now is look at their records I recommend [on the issues](http://www.ontheissues.org/default.htm).  Most of the candidates have not laid out clear cut policy stances yet, its too early in the race. For now they are just gonna talk about vague things like income inequality, climate change, etc without clearcut solutions.   u/ornitholoqy101 doesn't like boobs?   Neither did Stalin you commie bastard.   The typical chain of unit sizes goes like this; **Platoon** led by a Lieutenant and Sergeant First Class, **Company** led by a Captain and First Sergeant, **Battalion** led by a Lieutenant Colonel and Sergeant Major, **Brigade** led by a Colonel and Command Sergeant Major, and **Division** led by a General and Command Sergeant Major.   A regiment used to be the equivalent of two battalions, but now it is used by various sized units.    An Airborne unit is a unit that is made up of Airborne Paratroopers, that trains to deploy via parachute into combat when needed.   Even in my dreams you blind me.  Not the kind of blind that takes away sight;  But the kind of blind that, taken breathless by a sight   Attracts attention to that great sight in such a way   That nothing else can be seen  For your colors are the only true colors.  Your contrast stands out against the blackness   Like a veritable sunshine of bright eyes  And waves of hair that compete with the ocean in grace.   I stumble around unsatisfied  For in having seen a sight so blinding  My vision remains imprinted with you.  Now, neither in this world or the one made of dreams  Could I ever have an unclouded view.  For you pump through my veins   And leak from my pores  And my vision is blinded by you.         1. Emma Stone  2. Michelle Rodriguez  3. Rachel Ray (my parents never understood why 30 minute meals was a favorite show of mine)  4. Kim Possible.      I have often heard the phrase uses in reference to the IWW and sometimes the ILWU, but have never understood it. Can someone explain it?   Nothing like a little Bohemian Rhapsody.

Can someone explain it?   Of course she has pubic hair. They are water moccasins. They won't turn a man into stone, but will make him rock hard... if you know what I mean.      It has been a day of sad memories, and I honestly just want to drink deeply from the bitter cup. Can y'all recommend the most melancholy songs you know? I want to be swept away by blunt force lyrics and sad, slow songs.   Never convicted, I was typing on my touchscreen.          You obviously have no clue what Capitalism is. None of those nations have free and unregulated economies. They are mixed economies.    Workers own the means of production in those nations through cooperatives, and are backed up by very strict economic regulation from the state. None of those nations have government planned economies because as I have been saying all along *not all forms of socialism advocate state run economies*. Communism advocates state control, many socialists do not advocate for state control of the markets. Hell, Anarcho-Syndicalists and Libertarian Socialists are against the existence of **any state at all**.     For the record, I am neither a Socialist, or a Communist, I am a Laissez Faire Capitalists Libertarian. I just don't wrongly represent people I disagree with.   As I understand it, Marxists advocate for a moneyless society.    What about non Marxist socialists? what role would money play in a socialist society?   You are using poor examples of Sanders' Democratic Socialist line of thought. China is nowhere near his radar. China is in the Marxist line of thought.   Sanders advocates Democratic Socialism, as found in Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and other European nations. Contrast the living examples of these Socialist nations to China (and more extremely North Korea) and you can see in living color the difference between Democratic Socialism and Communism.   I am not down voting you, maybe the community just thinks you are wrong.   Democratic socialism is reformist not revolutionary. They do not want to overthrow/abolish the state and monetary system, they want to reform the state.   He is a Democratic Socialist,  not a Marxist/Leninist. In policies he is more of a progressive.   He advocates worker control of the means of production achieved through democracy.    Communism advocates participation in class revolution culminating in the abolition of class, state, and money.   They are two totally different things.   You just have to come to terms with the fact that your brother is a different person than you, and entitled to his own choices and lifestyle. Do you, and let him be him.   What is your ideal end state for U.S. policies on immigragion?    What realistic reforms would you like to see implemented after this next election?   The President is obviously for it, but many unions are very upset about the fast track in the TPP.   1. What are your thoughts on the TPP?  2. Do you think Democrat support for the TPP could affect the traditionally strong bond between organized labor and our party?       Which specific policies?   1. When has he ever voted against his declared opinion?   2. Which specific socialist policies?   3. He is a social democrat not a communist   If you think Bernie is a communist you are an idiot.   He is a social democrat.   What about Sanders?    1. Would you vote for Bernie Sanders over Hillary?   2. Would you vote for Bernie over Rand?   Why or why not?      I named that legislation because you wanted proof that he supported worker control of means of production.    It is more than a label, it is a perspective he actively embraces and one I reject. If he really is the socialist he says he is, I worry about his end state goals because I do not support the economic end state goals of socialism or social democratism in the slightest.     I would prefer a candidate more in line with Clinton's third way approach.   It does not boil down to this specific legislation, it is the outlook of socialist economic policy. I just don't think I am comfortable supporting someone whose economic outlook is that far left.   First, that is the very definition of a socialist, which he identifies as.   Second, [here is where he actually presented legislation supporting it.](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/recent-business/worker-owned-businesses-2014)   Mostly socialist insistence on worker control of means of production. My outlook on economic issues varies from his, I support a freer economy with a strong federal infrastructure.     That being said, I don't hate Sanders. I totally support his stance on civil liberty, marriage equality, foreign policy etc. I will also add that Vermont has some of the most lax gun laws in the nation, which I support as a second amendment loving Democrat (who said deep blue states have to hate guns?)    I just don't know if I would support him over Rand, who has pretty identical views on civil liberty, foreign policy, and the like but an economic outlook I am more comfortable with.    Socialism's main goal is worker control of the means of production.   Progressivism is a philosophy pursuing a mixed market  "third way" economy.    There are some pretty strong differences between the two. I am neither a socialist or progressive though.   Registered Democrat. I align more with Blue Dogs/New Democrats.    Rand is not Ron. I don't believe he would destroy welfare, state education, the IRS etc. His goals are more geared towards dismantling the NSA's power, hopefully supporting marijuana legalization, and other civil liberties.      Yes, I would vote for Rand over Hillary.    I would not vote for any other republicans, they are all GOP establishment    [Yes](http://nypost.com/2015/04/28/bernie-sanders-to-run-for-president-as-democrat/)   So in your opinion the only true populism is one in which the party "for the people" remains exclusively revolutionary?    Yes, I would vote for Rand Paul.   In what way? What information?   Depends which Republican.    Because I am not that far left. I am a moderate/centrist Democrat. Believe it or not [less than half of Democrats identify as "liberal"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx).   Not all of us are as progressive as Sanders.   Do you view the rise of Syriza in Greece as a good thing, or negative thing for Socialism?   What about the rise of Left Wing Populism of parties like the Citizens Movement in Mexico, and even candidates like Bernie Sanders running for the U.S. presidency as an open Left Wing Populist?         I am an Alabama resident currently stationed in NY. So much for Republicans sticking up for Servicemembers.   Mine would be Jim Webb, though I know it is next to impossible. As a Veteran, I respect his service immensely, his Centrism aligns with mine, his proven record as senator  and Secretary of the Navy. I think he would make a phenomenal President.      No, I did not   80% Democrat, 37% republican   A government that does not spy on me, start useless wars, and does not infringe on my civil liberties   Are the blue dogs still around?   Ok.. I didn't come here to argue about gun control. I do not mind background checks, but I oppose legislation that tries to ban guns and magazine size.   Yes, I am a Sanders fan myself. But isn't he an independent?   I used to be a moderate republican with some libertarian leanings. I have just gotten to the point where they have totally ran away from me. I have voted Democrat in the past, and am thinking about becoming a registered Democrat. I thought I would ask for advice finding a place in this party.    I support civil liberties totally. I support drug decriminalization, marajuana legalization, and marriage equality. I support drastic immigration  reform. I consider myself a Square Deal Democrat. I advocate for total transparency  in government, demilitarization of police forces, prison reform, and an end to mandatory minimum sentencing.     On the other hand, there are a few issues I worry would put me at odds with the Democratic party. I do not support gun control. I generally prefer the state to stay out of the markets (though I am a not a rabid welfare hater or anything).    What do you say? Am I at odds with the party? Are there any factions/caucuses or anything that I might be able to connect with?   Has anyone heard of other vets joining Americorps? I know many volunteers are fresh out of college. I have been in war, been shot at, done Army stuff, but I am looking for a new way to connect with the world and serve. Would I be out of place amongst other volunteers? Would my services put me at an advantage? I would really prefer volunteering in urban areas affected by heavy gang violence, or something that can really use my skills is there something like that?   Has anyone heard of other vets joining the peace corps? I know many volunteers are fresh out of college. I have been in war, been shot at, done Army stuff, but I am looking for a new way to connect with the world and serve. Would I be out of place amongst other volunteers? Would my services put me at an advantage?   Are you comfortable with the state of human rights within U.S. prisons?     Incredible, but sad discovery.         I don't believe in a 1984 media conspiracy, but I believe most of the media is bent way beyond any hope of objectivity. The media is controlled by vapid and sensationalist western culture. This is why guys like Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, The Reid Report etc exist.    I tend to get my news from NPR, Reuters, and BBC.   1. What  do you see as the ideal endstate of prison reform (how would you like to see the U.S. justice system ideally operate)?    2. What realistic steps would you like to see taken now to reform the prison system?      Freckles   This is why the rest of the world hates us. We act like 2 year olds.   1. Was Santa Anna a particularly oppressive leader?  2. What events caused Texas to declare independence from Mexico?  3. Were there many in Texas who remained loyal to Mexico? (Like the Tories in the American Revolution)    1. Was Santa Anna a particularly oppressive leader?  2. What events caused Texas to declare independence from Mexico?  3. Were there many in Texas who remained loyal to Mexico? (Like the Tories in the American Revolution)   Bite the Buffalo   Not all Muslims do those things, Islamic Extremists do. Just like Christian extremists during the Holy Roman empire murdered thousands of "barbarians" at the sword for not converting, Mormon extremists took child brides (statutory rape), Japanese nationalist extremists killed themselves in Kamikaze strikes at Pearl Harbor.    Extremism takes on many forms. Blanketing an entire demographic with the actions of a few nut jobs is unfair and unAmerican.   Have 15 wives.   New officers think they are kings, when really they are dumber than privates.   *American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson* by Joseph J. Ellis   Join the military. I have a successful career, good pay, steady work, and good employment opportunities when I get out.   Gotten married, gone to Afghanistan, lost good friends, became a leader in my field. I am nowhere near the same kid I was five years ago.  	144
