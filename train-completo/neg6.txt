                                                                                                                                                                                                          The problem is Google has often fudged those numbers by blurring Google+ usage with Google account usage in general. So it's hard to know how many of those 300m were there for the juicy Gmail alone.                                             Just finished watching and I can't but help feel I missed a great deal of significance by never really knowing what scenes were in Denmark and which in Sweden.                                                                 	104
 Hmm.... This logic does make sense. I shall be scared no more! I will wipe with confidence on my next outing!   I'm scared the more TP I use, the higher chance of me clogging the toilet and having it overflow.   I was in class watching Pearl Harbor, the movie. This happened when I was in 11th grade. I am one of those people that laugh all the time and have a hard time pulling back my laugh. So as we're watching, the scene where the Japanese are attacking Hawaii there's a part where they drop a bomb near a guy who's hiding behind some sandbags. The bomb doesn't explode and the guy yells, "It's a dud!". And a second later the bomb explodes! My friend just turns to me, and says in a stupid tone, " So it wasn't a dud?". I couldn't hold it and I start cracking up. The whole class is serious while watching the movie, and I'm over here laughing while people are dieing left and right   That toilet paper looks like it's two-ply at least! Better than Disneyland and their thin stuff I'm currently using!    That was a freakin nice pass! The way Perry recieved the puck without slowing down was perfect!   Condoms! Condoms the size of hefty bags!    Haha I didn't forget, those just happened to be my favorite ones :3  	7
 Some outlaw wanted to live out his Wild West gun-boi fantasies, and he wound up getting his fondest wish.    Because ***the black helicopters are coming!!1!!one!!1!***   How else can they keep the abortion issue alive?  Republicans fear nothing more than losing their #1 wedge issue.  They know they can't run on their 30+ years of failed "trickle-down economics." They need a rage issue to continue to divide people, and abortion is their huckleberry.   They just wanted to talk to her about Liberty.   But why? Why must we kiss the corporations' asses day in and day out to hold the country together, or so we've been taught?  Isn't the burden of proof on them to show it *isn't* a dangerous practice?  I think the Founding Fathers would puke themselves inside out if they could see how Americans cringe and grovel on their knees before the throne of today's new Monarchy of Profiteers.    Shouldn't We the People know what is being injected into our land? Don't we have a right to know? Are we scared of hurting the poor -widdle-petroleum-cortorations-fee-fees?  Or do private profiteers "trade secrets" take precedence over our safety? "What they don't know won't hurt 'em!," right?   [The Only Moral Abortion is My Abortion.](http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/anti-tales.shtml)    Because i've been around it for the last 2 years and know what i'm talking about.  Translation:"My paycheck depends on defending fracking."     Why won't the industry disclose what's in the fracking fluid?   This, much like Bruce Springsteen's *Born In the USA,* again proves that Republicans should actually ***READ THE LYRICS*** to the songs they misappropriate for their jingoistic rallies.  "Rockin' In The Free World" by Neil Young  There's colors on the street  Red, white and blue  People shufflin' their feet  People sleepin' in their shoes  But there's a warnin' sign  on the road ahead  There's a lot of people sayin'  we'd be better off dead  Don't feel like Satan,  but I am to them  So I try to forget it,  any way I can.   Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world  Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world.   I see a woman in the night  With a baby in her hand  Under an old street light  Near a garbage can  Now she puts the kid away,  and she's gone to get a hit  She hates her life,  and what she's done to it  There's one more kid that will never go to school  Never get to fall in love,  never get to be cool.   Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world  Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world.    We got a thousand points of light  For the homeless man  We got a kinder, gentler,  Machine gun hand  We got department stores  and toilet paper  Got styrofoam boxes  for the ozone layer  Got a man of the people,  says keep hope alive  Got fuel to burn,  got roads to drive.   Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world  Keep on rockin' in the free world,  Keep on rockin' in the free world.   What a foul desecration of an amazing song.      So some outlaw wanted to live out his Wild West gun-boi fantasies, and he wound up getting his fondest wish.  What's the issue?     I've been continually amazed how many American Catholics worshipped Benedict and despise Pope Francis.  American Catholicism needs to free itself from its poisonous alliance with American Evangelical Fundamentalism.   Christian Nationalism been the unidentified elephant in the room of American Politics for nearly four decades now.       The American Right doesn't give a damn about children, especially once they arrive.  But relentless exploitation of the ***"ZOMG ABORTION!!1!"*** issue sure is a useful tool to manipulate the votes of Christian Nationalists. Anti-abortion hysteria gets many Americans to vote in complete opposition to both their own interests and the best interests of the country.  Does anyone actually believe the Republicans want to lose their favorite wedge issue?  That's why today's Republicans will ***never*** allow abortion to be banned in America. The abortion "debate" brings the American Right Wing too many votes.      If there's one thing that defines Christian Nationalists like Santorum, it's pride in their own ignorance.   Sounds like another act of Duggary.   But... but... he heard it on AM radio!   Oh, Cliven.      When has consistency or reason ever been applicable to the politics of Christian Nationalist Republicans?   True. It runs about 17%-20% and is already calculated into the purchase price of goods.  It confuses the hell out of Europeans when they come here and an item marked at $5.00 is suddenly $5.45.   Kansas: the Kochbertarian Paradise!   He lives in the Republic of TeaBaggia.   Translation: "We were scared to death of political repercussions from the Christian Nationalist zealots of Colorado Springs, but it looks like the coast is clear now."   "In fact, I would gladly give him my last bottle of water."   Do you have enough jerky stored away in your Revolution bunker? Maybe you should go check.   Clearly it's because they love "LIBERTY!!!1!"^TM   Another fine representative of "the Party of Personal Responsibility."   America deserves better than a third Bush disaster.   Sorry, NC. You can't use the force of the State to subject women to ultrasonic dildo rape.      Why do people still fall for it?  Sometimes, I almost believe there's a subset of poor Republican voters that just flat-out enjoy the continued degradation and the humiliation.  Even today, the sharecropper still forced to lick the boot of Master still fancies himself higher than a slave. For some people and some voters, maybe that's enough in life.  Nonetheless it seems clear that this pathogenic belief is some foolishly clung-to remnant from the psychology of the European peasantry of centuries ago along with their love/worship of the very hereditary Monarchs that oppressed them so relentlessly. That attitude was transferred to America in the form of the class and caste structure of Antebellum South, and we fought a war that killed 740,000 of us to free ourselves of that remaining horcrux of the Monarchy, the landed gentry of the Plantation Class of the Old South. America all but destroyed itself to liberate itself from that deep-rooted poison.  150 years later, I see little difference in how so many still vote in complete opposition to their interests and that of the nation. It's not "the Gub'mint" that's the threat to our Nation; in fact, "the damn Gub'mint" is the only thing standing between the relentless privateers of capital and commerce who seek to own all for themselves and their families at the expense of all others living in unending servitude to our new Monarchs, the Monarchs of Capital.  So those who who join militias with the intent of "restorin' the Constitution" and "fightin' for our Liberty" should not be at all surprised when they wake one day to find they fought in "the Great Struggle" just to make a Koch their King.*  American stubbornness is not a virtue when it is so relentlessly self-destructive.  *See Libertarian Adam Kokesh's call for "the Final American Revolution" on July 4 a couple years back, or the continued self-delusions of the Sovereign Citizen/Bundy Ranch Milita zealots who fantasize themselves "Patriots."   "Why did non-wealthy American voters keep falling for it?" This is the question political historians of the future will ask.  How did the United States  a nation that survived the Age of the Robber Barons, the Great Wall Street Crash of 1929 with its ensuing Great Depression, and the Financial Meltdown of 2008 and its ensuing Great Recession  not learn the lessons repeated again and again within each circumstance?  Hell, let's pre-empt the political historians of the future. I'll ask the question now: "Why do non-wealthy Americans (and in many cases, dirt-poor Americans) keep falling for it?"   Republicans have been playing the "the liberal media are persecuting us!!1!" myth-lie ever since Nixon introduced it in his "Checkers" speech.  [Here's the "Checkers" speech on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqjwBDH-vhY) Give it a listen and hear how Nixon whines and whines and whines about persecution just like the Republicans, Libertarians, and Republitarians today.  Highlights: when Nixon complains that (unlike liberals' wives) his wife Pat Nixon doesn't wear a fur coat, but a "respectable, *Republican* cloth coat" and also invokes the namesake cocker spaniel "Checkers" and how "we're never going to give her back, no matter what *they* say.  It's a masterpiece of self-pitying whining that the Republicans have looked to for inspiration for over 60 years now. Watch it -- it's really worth your time.    Ellis!   The Kochs' father was a founding member of the John Birch Society.    fuck that entire family.  That will just make more of them.    Are there *still* Americans nave enough to consider tripling-down on the failed Bush Family?  On second thought, don't answer that. :/   Josh Duggar?   Poe's Law, or RWNJ?   Luxury! In LibertyWorld, she'd also have been charged with bleeding on the tracks.   The Iowa GOP straw poll was doomed the moment the 2012 vote-buying schemes of Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann came to light.   The multigenerational self-delusion continues; the resentment poisons us to this day.      That's been a struggle in society since there has been society: mutual suspicion and resentment between urbanites and rural residents.  This has to end. Our lives are all intertwined and interdependent. We must acknowledge this if we are to have a chance at taming those who profit from the exploitation of each of us against the other.      Hahaha, this guy doesn't know Republicans. They will just double-down on the stupid, blame Obama or the nearest Democrat, and profit.  I still can't understand why  is it simply spite on the part of these lock-step voters? If they can't have control, they'd prefer to run the ship aground for all of us?  Why is it that these self-declared "Patriots" and flag-worshippers, America's *de facto* Nationalist party, seem so hellbent on burning our nation to the ground?  Republicans, Libertarians, Republitarians of Reddit: what's the motivation here? What's your endgame?   Stopping Reconstruction (at the demand of the South) was even worse.  The War to Preserve Slavery that the poor white sharecroppers were sent to fight killed 750,000 Americans, all for a cause that was already doomed years before the Confederates fired the first shot.  The descendants of these same poor white sharecroppers have misdirected their contempt at Washington DC ever since. It's probably just too painful for many of them to look in their own backyard and realize that they destroyed themselves to keep the Plantation Owner class in power (even a century-and-a-half later after it spat out their dead and broken bodies on that Fool's Errand.)  As always, war is a rich man's quarrels via the suffering and death of the poor, who are sent to fight the battles.   It's abortion, the gays, and violent video games.   Another "tacticool" weapons fetishist.   Luntz' evil genius.   Or Moderators decide to declare it "Not US Politics," Off-Topic," or "Rehosted Content."  Somehow, *Breitbart*, *CNS*, and *WND* are just fine, but *Salon*, *MediaMatters*, and *Talking Points Memo* suffer under de facto censorship.  That's information that you and I aren't allowed to see, thanks to the intervention of self-appointed Censorship Mods who act in complete opposition to the Reddit creed of "user-driven, user-curated content."   Yeah, the whole Lawrence crowd has been starstruck since *The Day After.*   So you'll vote out of spiteful opposition at a random anonymous person "smug"?  That's sure giving a lot of power to the "smug" person over your life.  Why cut off your own nose to spite someone who you don't know and will never meet? Seems pretty self-destructive.   The GOP is utterly and evilly brilliant at exploiting wedge issues to get Americans to vote against themselves.   He's speaking of restaurant chain/fast food chain workers.   Hey, those "Small Business Owners"^TM and "Job Creators"^TM will spare no expense to serve their customers!   And then the very same scamsters rushed back in and bought those same properties for pennies on the dollar.  Uncontrolled capitalism is far more dangerous than any monarchy. That's the great irony of the United States: having been founded as an independent nation in opposition to the very concept of Monarchy, we now live on our knees before our new Monarchs: the Titans of Capital.      As someone who grew up in one of those "Christian" churches, I can attest that they hate democrats as much as they hate black people, women, and homosexuals.  But why? I'm continually baffled by this.  From whence does that virulent hatred come, and when did it start? Are they still sore over the Civil Rights movement? The New Deal? Richard Nixon's cocker spaniel?  Is their compulsion to inflict their destructive spite against their fellow Americans so great that they are oblivious to the grievous damage they inflict upon themselves? And if so, how can they *possibly* claim to be "followers of Christ?"  Maybe the Evangelical Protestants simply *believe* they're following Christ when they've fallen prey to a scam by "the Great Deceiver." Given the aura of hate, fear, divisiveness and greed that right wing politics has promulgated in America in the last hundred years under the cloak of "morality," it's an idea that merits consideration.    The people doing the tax cuts, aren't the people feeling their ramifications.  The ultimate question: why do so many of the people who suffer the worst under the Republican's trickle-down economics so readily and zealously lick the boots of those forcing the suffering upon them?  Yet more confusing: how/why do the poor boot-lickers getting stomped the worst insist that they are "the freest people on Earth"?    The working class became the working poor and we are all in debt the ultra rich. That doesn't spell prosperity to me.  It does to the Kochs and their ilk, who bestow names such as "Americans For Prosperity"^TM on their Astroturf front groups.    *tap tap tap*   I wonder how Bob Dole feels about what Brownback is doing to his home state.     How to destroy a country, one State at a time.  Koch-onomics!     Explanation: "It allows us to scam votes."   Sorry, Bernie would never never have anything to do with right-wing extremist charlatans like the Pauls.  Conversely, the kind of people who worship the Pauls (White Supremacists, Neo-Confederates, Militia wannabes, and conspiracy theorists) would never have anything to do with Bernie.   But... but... what about the JOB CREATORS!^TM ???   There isn't any such thing as a "moderate Republican" anymore.   How has the American economic abortion known as "trickle-down Reaganomics" continued to hold sway with so many for so long?   ZOMG teh TYRANNI!!1!! WE needz teh "LIBERTEH!!1!"^TM  [Send me your worthless fiat currency and I'll send you a newsletter 'splainin' it all!]   "Social Justice Warrior" is the new "statist;" everyone that uses the thinks they're brilliant, insightful, and "in the know," but everyone who hears it is laughing their asses off whilst rolling their eyes.  Yes, Libertarians and Republitarians, this means you.   Rasmussen, haha!  might as well go back to citing "unskewedpolls.com" as proof that Romney was going to sweep in 2012   Who should we call if the government is infested with Southern Avengers?   Well, it's not a *completely* lost cause.  After all, Rand can keep fleecing the rubes that fell for his dad Ron Paul's "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM schtick in 2008 and 2012!   Well, after Rand's dad Ron Paul quit his 2008 campaign, he threw his support for president to Dominionist preacher Chuck Baldwin of the Constitution Party.  Maybe Chuck will return the favor by nominating Rand for his VP this time around?   He's going to fleece paranoid right-wing rubes, just like Dear Old Dad trained him.   He's yet worse  a Republitarian.   The mouldering corpse of Murray Rothbard.   I nominate Rand Paul's son William Paul as his chauffeur.  William Paul is also well-versed in how to handle flight attendants should they get a little mouthy and/or cut off his drink service.    What's controversial about Lew Rockwell?   Sy Sperling!   Adam Kokesh.   Lew Rockwell.   Also, while we're at it, get rid of the bogus "Not US Politics" and fabricated "Rehosted Content" lies that have been used to censor our community for the past two years.  Reddit is meant to be ***USER***-driven and ***USER***-curated; *NOT* ***MOD-DICTATED*** or ***MOD-CENSORED.***   How about you guys stop censoring us with the bogus "Off-Topic" and "Rehosted Content" lies?   You guys don't have to answer to the Gunbertarian-Authoritarian censors anymore. Why mimic their old patterns of systematic censorship?    It's one of the favorite tools of the Censorship Mods, though they don't pull it nearly as frequently now that the Gunbertarian Mods who seized power a couple of years back have been forced into exile.  It's generally used to kill content they deem "liberal." The "Rehosted Content" lie is another favorite excuse to censor our community.   Oh look! The Censorship Mods have hit us with the "Off-Topic" lie again.  I guess that leaves little hope they'll do away with the "Rehosted Content" lie they invented to auto-censor submissions from Salon, MediaMatters, and Talking Points Memo, is there?    And I *did* realize I was dealing with a Tea-Gargler. Bye!   HARHARHAR DAE SOROS FOX NEWS RULZZ!!1!   "Screwing the poor harder shall surely make us all rich!"    your average RWNJ nose-cutting face-spiter.   Or maybe it's because his Dad Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann were both involved in cutting Iowa straw poll payola checks to create a false illusion of support outside their circle of RWNJ loonies.   He knows how hard it is to put food on your family.   Scott Walker is in Wisconsin, not Michigan. Nice RWNJ dodge, though.   The battle Scott Walker *should* be fighting: getting the Kochs' balls out of his mouth.   Why do so many of the Tea-Gargling Militia "Patriots" seem to head to Wal-Marts when it's time for their "Last Stand"?  Another fine example here:  [The Chilling Anti-Government, Cliven Bundy-Loving Facebook Posts of the Alleged Las Vegas Shooters: Jerad and Amanda Miller's Facebook and YouTube likes included the NRA, Rand Paul, FreedomWorks, and other right-wing championsand videos justifying the killing of police officers.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/jerad-amanda-miller-las-vegas-shooting-cliven-bundy-anti-government)    "Sovereign Citizens" are nothing less than domestic terrorists.  See Oklahoma City and the Cliven Bundy "Patriots."   This is what happens when you drink the Tea.  Don't Drink the Tea.   "...if you're looking to rile up a crowd of angry, ignorant Tea-Garglers."    From the ancient Greeks we know that you can't step into the same stream twice  Try explaining that to the poor fools who still fall for "trickle-down" Reaganomics.     Something in the way she moves   North Korean hotel fire is Best Korean hotel fire!    I fail to see how the closer you get to libertarian types you get more lemmings.  This is what's known as "tragic irony."     Why are they called Teabaggers?  [Example One.](http://mugsysrapsheet.com/4blog/teabagger_costume06.jpg)  [Example Two.](http://i1.wp.com/pleasecutthecrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/teabagger.jpg?fit=848%2C1024)  [Example Three.](http://i1.wp.com/samuel-warde.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/teabagger1.jpg)   More accurately:  they believe whatever the Kochs (who founded and funded this phony Astroturf "movement") tell them to think.   Or elected Governor.   No doubt this character will start a "GoFundMe" to score some Wingnut Welfare.  "I'm a good, God-fearing American persecuted by the damn liberals fixin' to ruin what's left of this country. Send me money!"   -- Spock   Just wait until the Koch moola starts to hit.   And the Ron Paul campaign's Kent Sorenson payola scandal.   And somehow (I *promise* you) it will all be explained away with some derivative of the eternal "it's those damn liberals trying to tear a good man down" meme.   try /r/MRApersecutionfantasies   "Domestic disturbances" are the type of call where responding policemen are most likely to be shot dead.    What if people named "Jim" violate my religious beliefs?  Then you would not be a fan of St. James.     Does this mean that we won't let fundamentalist snake-handlers dictate public policy anymore?   She isn't always right.  She'll be right exponentially more often than any remaining Reagan/Bush/Cheney "Supply-Side" cultists out there.    "Look, sir  droids!"   So they can spot each other easily while hunting womp rats.   The Empire's been cutting costs. No more reimbursements for dry cleaning.   Or maybe they just overstressed the binary load lifters   She really pissed them off when (as an act of self-defense) she threw her Tattooine VitaMix Boiler at them.    So it's illegal to be a meteorologist in Wyoming?  There's really no point anymore because HAARP.     America's been taken hostage by right-wing extremists, and many voters suffer from Stockholm Syndrome.   Science is just for Damn Commies anyhow.   Most Americans have little vacation, and what little we do doesn't afford most Americans the ability to ever travel overseas (to say nothing of the expense of international travel.)  We're a perfect little prison colony of compliant slaves, if only because we've never known anything else. America's permanent leisure class intends to keep it that way.   I've never understood why Americans scream so much about how the US is the only place on Earth that has "FREEDOM!"^TM even as we let the permanent leisure class rape any remaining human will out of us.   Also, does anyone else remember when California bars and restaurants argued "ZOMG teh bans on teh indoor smoking will utterly destroy us and kill ***ALL*** teh buzinezzez!!1!"  That was over two decades ago. Shockingly, California still has bars and restaurants.    we would most likely see a hefty dip in the stock market.  ZOMG we couldn't *possibly* dare to trouble the passive, profit-harvesting investor class, could we? We must work and work and work for them until all those who seek their profits from the exploitation of the labor of others feel that they *finally* have enough to achieve personal satisfaction.     The fact that I KNOW the GOP will be against this makes me feel like I live in bizarro world. You'd think everyone would be okay with this.  It's truly startling how many Americans vote in complete opposition to their own interests.  The Kochs and their leisure-class cronies make no such foolish mistakes. In fact, they fund disinformation campaigns specifically designed to keep Americans from voting in their own interests.    This is why it's so important for the many negative-knowledge voters who currently vote Republican/Republitarian to begin voting in the interests of themselves, their families, and the nation instead of for the sole benefit of their leisure-class Masters.  America's extremist, regressive right-wing must be brought to heel lest America return to the horrors of Victorian-Era economics.   Much of the South (and Americans in general) just can't seem to escape their "there are Lords (us), and there are Peasants (everyone else) who just won't learn their proper place" economic worldview.  Such belligerence, arrogance, and greed caused the Plantation Lords of the Old South to launch what remains the bloodiest war in American history, in which over 700,000 Americans were killed.  The sad thing is that so many of the poor, undereducated sharecroppers who are inevitably sent to fight and die for the Master Class will *still* defend those Masters to the death and call their devotion "Patriotism." It's almost as if they have been conditioned to expect and enjoy their own exploitation.  *Maybe* someday they'll snap out of it and actually begin to vote and work in the best interests of themselves and our nation, rather then spending their lives on their knees cringing before the Bossman  but American history teaches us to temper any such expectations.          According to one survey  CATO or Heritage Foundation?    And just look at the fight we had to put up against the Republicans for even that simple accommodation way back in the Clinton Era.  "Pro-Family/Party of Family Values" my ass.   Please go into as much detail as possible. What would you see as the positives of such an abortion ban? Would there be any negatives?   Yes, that's what's makes it all the more frightening.  Nationalistic fringes bent on moral crusades will self-justify any behavior to reach their goal.  An excellent novel that addresses similar issues is Margaret Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale.*      More Republican pandering to their right-wing fringe.  Kowtowing to such extremists rarely ends well.   With nasty, big, pointy teeth!   There's a lot of rumbling, grumbling, and chest-puffing coming from the White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate/Gun-bertarian Militias in recent times.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if these groups have seen an uptick in recruitment due to the "ZOMG JADE HELM 15!!!1!" paranoia they've managed to promulgate on the Internet.   Agreed, but Rand would never chance his toupe flying off on camera.     Is mocking Rand's drunken, car-crashing, flight attendant-assaulting son William Paul OK?    What happened at Digg that was so awful?

 I bought Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon but I haven't started it yet.I heard that it is a pretty hard one to read.So,what's your suggestions about reading Gravity's Rainbow?   What is your e-mail adress?  	2
  Too stupid... Too pretentious.  Ignoring how oxymoronic that statement is, what did you think was pretentious about Death Proof? You made some great points about the characters and the dialogue, but I'd like to hear more about this.  I love Death Proof, but it is - by far - his weakest film he directed, but it's way better than Planet Terror.   I don't think it's underrated, just forgotten.   Everything Henry Jackman has done. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was dismissed by critics as just copying the music from the first one which is so inaccurate it hurts. He made the bar fight in Kingsman even cooler and made the emotional beats of Big Hero 6 really land.  [This is my favourite song of his](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgU1HzqtX-E), but if people are looking for something to listen to whilst revising or showering or whatever, definitely go over the Winter Soldier soundtrack.   I knew which song it was before I clicked on the link. It's a truly excellent song.   I'll PM you.   Something... Something... Fire gasoline...  Why's Bowie saying Gasoline anyway? He would call it petrol.   Absolutely. Well, just not on Earth. I'm down with the other realms.  It's kind of a shame as my two favourite Thor runs are Aaron's and JMS'   Sarah Jessica Parker as Beta Ray Bill   This should give you a pretty good understanding of the entirety of the MCU. You'll need to Google some of the reading orders.  * Dr Strange - The Oath * Captain Marvel - Brian Reed's run * Thor - Ragnarok, JMS' run or Godbomb * Blanther - Christopher Priest's run or Secret Invasion tie-in * Guardians of the Galaxy 2 - [This epic saga](http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg) * Infinity War - Infinity Gauntlet * Captain America - Brubaker's run on Captain America and, for the love of Thanos, don't read Civil War * Inhumans - Paul Jenkin's run * Jessica Jones - Alias * Iron Fist - The Immortal Iron Fist * Luke Cage - Bendis' New Avengers * Punisher - Greg Rucka's Run * Ant-Man - The current run was only commissioned so they'd have a trade for the new movie, they're just lucky it was really good. Different Ant-Man, but I really enjoyed The Irredeemable Ant-Man. * Daredevil - Frank Miller's Run (including Born Again and The Man Without Fear), Daredevil: Yellow, Battlin' Jack Murdock or Bendis'/Brubaker's runs. * Iron Man - Demon in a Bottle, Armour Wars, Doom Quest, Fraction's run, Extremis * Hulk - Planet Hulk, Hulk: Gray or Hulk: The End * Shield - Hickman's or Waid's run * Hawkeye - Fraction's run, Lemire's run or McCann's trilogy * Black Widow - Brubaker's Winter Soldier * Avengers - The Ultimates I   II, Busiek's run, [Bendis' run](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m815zi24Ga1rpok63o1_1280.jpg) and Hickman's run  Get yourself Marvel Unlimited as well as it's the only possible way you could digest all of this.  Edit: I forgot Spider-Man - Ultimate Spider-Man, JMS's The Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man: Blue and Kraven's Last Hunt (which the third TASM movie was going to be based on).   I must add though, JMS' Spider-Man is the definitive 616 run for me.   Spider-Man's is the only one I really like. I'm not really a fan of Rogue's Galleries, I prefer a couple great recurring villains and one-offs.  Edit: I forgot The Flash's. That's the definitive set of rogues for me.   Is Walt really a psycho? Fucked up sure, but I'm not 100% on a psycho.   Lord of the Rings - please don't downvote me as /r/movies always does. If you'd care to hear why ask and I'll PM because I'm fed up of receiving abuse for not liking three movies. Same for Jurassic Park and Jaws.   Ehh. I find he goes too over the top and the frame is too hectic it's unclear what's going on and that bugs me. Also the editing is typically too fast too see much.   thanks.    One? I think you mean five.   You've made me reconsider and you're right on all accounts, but your point about Bucky is null.  Bucky was brought back with the intention of becoming Cap and had 30-odd issues of development before becoming Cap and was a more nuanced and clever character than Captain African-American who was ill-thought out.   It is somewhat for Doom, but it is exactly the kind of thing Magneto would get upset over (pre-Morrison). Doom crying is more of a symbol than anything else.   I love the Falcon. As a POC, Falcon really meant a lot to me. Since becoming Cap he's been boring and two-dimensional outside of his own book and his own book is only average. Captain African-American is an insult towards the creators and editors who thought this was a good idea, not Sam Wilson, a character I miss dearly.   Read it before you judge it. It's an excellent story that doesn't exploit or pander anything. It is surprisingly politically neutral and very poignant. The point of is that nothing really matters in the wake of a tragedy like this.  Also I think a creator trying to pay his respects should be admired not accused of pandering.    I'm not sure if they ever faced off in a one to one capacity.  Does the first arc of New Avengers count?   Demon in a Bottle and The Runaways   So like Warren Ellis' interpretation.   That's cool - I respect that and easily see why. He's just not for me.   And New Jurassic Park.   I actually really like it. I find it charming and Spielbergian. If it had Spielberg's name on it and it was made 25 years ago, it'd be a classic.   Can You Dig It? is the song's name and it is awesome.   So I take it you're a big fan of The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, The First Avenger and the Thor films?   He's always sucked. Snow and Heart of Ice are Two good stories with him in. Anything featuring Mr Freeze out of the 90s has been pretty poor.   He's a pretty good villain, but I can't think of any of his stories I enjoyed him as the primary villain.   Recommendations? Oh boy. I just went through my collection for this. Bold = As essential as anything else up there.  * **The Cult** * Snow * **Gothic** * **Venom** * Dini's Run * **Strange Apparitions** * **The Mad Monk** * **Tower of Babel** * Made of Wood * Shaman * Gotham County Line * Turning Points * Haunted Knight * **Faces** * **The Monster Men** * Untold Legend of the Batman * **Under the Red Hood (watch the movie, it's better)** * Ed Brubaker's Catwoman * Trial of the Catwoman * Dixon's Robin * **The Joker's 5-Way Revenge** * Ego * **Mad Love** * The Last Arkham * Penguin: Pride and Prejudice * The Eye of the Beholder * Prey * Batgirl (with Stephanie Brown) * Red Robin * Gates of Gotham * **The Black Mirror** * Rucka's Batwoman run  New 52  * Batwoman * **Batman** * **Batman and Robin** * Detective Comics (from #30) * Catwoman (from #35) * Grayson * Batgirl * **Batman Incorporated**  Elseworlds  * **Joker** * **Earth One** * Noel * Gotham by Gaslight * **Year 100** * **Red Rain** * Black and White * Thrillkiller * Nine Lives   Oddly, Bay does these the best. I can't stand much of what he does, but these I love.   Lex is the only one there I really like. I've always considered Darkseid a Justice League villain and always thought of him as a force of nature and he isn't particularly compelling. His Marvel imitator is much more layered and complex. Brainiac doesn't really work for me - not sure why, but he's never clicked well with me. Doomsday is the epitome of 90s excess had he not killed the bastard he's be quickly forgotten about like Spawn, Nate Summers and the Savage Dragon. He's the worst kind of Superman villain - the one who Supes just has to punch into submission.  Edit: I still love some of Supes' other villains like Zod or Bizzarro.   Superman and Batman.  All of the best Superman stories are about exploring the idea of Superman and what he truly means to people and only three of his villains really help show that - Luthor for obvious reasons and Zod and Bizzarro as their perverted takes on Supes.  Anytime a story just involves him punching stuff I get really bored.  Batman has some colourful villains, but most of them should have been left in the silver age. The Penguin is a crappy substite for an actual mobster like Falcone. I find Poison Ivy kind of boring and gimmicky and - once you get past his back story - I feel the same way about Mr Freeze. Catwoman is poorly written more often than not, which is a shame because in the right hands she's really interesting. Bane had an excellent first appearance, but has fet a bit pointless in the last twenty years and I can't think of another great story with Bane as a villain. Ra's Al Ghul is kind of a nice look at an alternative to Batman, but it feels like no writer has known what to do with him since the 80s. Man-Bat is just an excuse for a cool action sequence or two (see: Grant Morrison deciding that Man-Bats made for suitable grunts for the League of Assassins). I can't think of a single Ventriloquist story I like. Same goes for Killer Croc, but I did love Earth One's take on him.  The funny thing is, most of this characters have faired really well in adaptions (particularly in the cartoons). Mr Freeze earnt Dini and Timm a very well-deserved emmy.  The greatest Batman villains are one-offs, James Gordon Jr, Deacon Blackfire, The Court of Owls, Nobody, The Black Glove and Mr Whisper are my favourites.  Like Superman, Batman has three truly great villains, the Joker, Two-Face and the Riddler. I love a good Joker story, but currently I'm so sick of the character. Well over a quarter of Snyder's run has featured him and I'm just kind of fed up of reading about him. Two-Face doesn't really work that well as an enemy of Batman, but he works because he's such a compelling character. Half a Life, The Long Halloween, The Big Burn, Robin: Year One and A Lonely Place of Dying are all fantastic stories that really dig deep into what makes him tick and I find that fascinating and very entertaining. I used to kind of dislike the Riddler, but after Zero Year and Earth One he's in my good books.   Both great stories, but I can't think of a single Mysterio Spider-Man story I enjoyed.   Love the costume BTW.  You just need to ask two questions - is it important to Grant Morrison's Run or is it a defining moment for one of the Robins or Barbara Gordon? If yes, the important element is in continuity, but nothing else is.  May I ask what you read?   Does Batman count?  He's nowhere near the smartest, but I think Dexter is a pretty clever cookie. In the first four seasons he weaved out of so many problems so brilliant, only to be let down by his conscience.   I say good time travel movies, you immediately think of X.      Same boat: I'm trying to read through the canon of great graphic novels and read a tonne of classic Batman stories whilst also trying to catch-up on the X-Men (6 years behind) and Avengers (4 years behind) on Marvel Unlimited. Then I get distracted as Image release a new TPB for some charming new series and Comixology's recent sales have resulted in myself purchasing 38 issues of Hitman and Steam is having a sale and I want to play the new games I'm getting and complete my old ones. Then I have TV series and Films.   Oh, and homework, but that's not important.      Should try and keep reading Ultimate Spider-Man, Bendis has done some of his best work on Miles.   Is this a Matt Fraction issue?   Being explicit is one of my big pet peeves. I love subtlety. There are points where being explicit kills shows like the Walking Dead or the movies of Christopher Nolan - things that I'd otherwise enjoy a lot.   I imagine a little bit of things like that will leak through, but they'll skip most of his origins like Daredevil.   I understand. No one take offence - he's not calling you disrespectful - it's just that a lot of people worked hard to make a movie and by sitting through the credits you're acknowledging the hard work everybody did.   How about the Sentry? The complicated backstory and identity issues make him quite interesting IMO (although, not nearly as interesting as Superman).   I imagine it'll be like Daredevil. It starts crazy grounded then the fantasy elements start leaking through in the second half. Season Two will probably drive straight into the mysticism.   The thing that truly surprised me about Season Two is how complicated the relationships between all the factions are. You've got Shield, Hydra, Real Shield, Ward, Cal and the Inhumans and there was lots of weaving and character moving in and out of each group.  It was like this; it was super easy to follow and I didn't really realise how well balanced it all was until I stopped and thought about it. L   RemindMe! 1 Day   Scarface   Really? I enjoyed the film, but it felt like the exact thing the novel was mocking.   I don't now whether many people like Agents of Shield on this sub, but I feel that having 22 episodes helped the plotting quite a bit. They divided the series into three distinct chunks - Search for the City, Skye Dealing with Power/Real Shield and the Inhumans - this meant there was room for some pretty complex plot webs and character work. People who were previously kinda boring became interesting thanks to having episodes dedicated to expanding on their character (looking at you Ward). The cast is also too big to deal with the 15-odd characters in 13 episodes. Coulson, Fitz-Simmons, Skye, Ward, Mack, Hunter, Mockingbird and May all got pretty decent arcs in Season Two and most of them would've been forgotten about if there was a 13 episode season.   Managing to tell three stories actually makes it similar to three four-issue comic book arcs which I guess is quite faithful to modern comics where everything is quite decompressed and it takes a while for things to pay off. This is kind of the opposite of the Flash which had a Silver-Age meets Claremont  plotting; one wacky conflict every week with some soapy elements and foreshadowing future episodes. Agents of Shield tried this in Season One and it didn't really work, but come Season Two's more serialised plotting, it was a vastly improved show (helped that they got some decent directors and fight choreographers too).   The Flash was pretty decent for 23 episodes, but if they tried to tell a more serialised story in the first fifteen episodes, it would have completely broken down and would have needed a reduced episode count.   Succeeded in Punisher MAX.   Days of Future Asst   I really like it - if it is a bit derivative of Green Lantern (which Nova is anyway) - but I think I'd prefer him brutal and war-hardened than some kind of Space Indiana Jones as we already have one of those.   Jim Lee bore this with a sort of humble patience   I love Invincible, but I've found it's lost a lot of momentum for me recently. It's a shame because everything up to the Viltrimite War is great.   CG isn't as big a problem for Robbie Reyes, so if they went down that route - which I'd quite like - Netflix could handle him. A redesign would be pretty simple as well - you can just tone down the fire.  I don't want a Netflix Ghost Rider series though - I want all of the Netflix series to stay relatively grounded for a while. If they do a phase with Moon Knight, Blade and such, then they can have Ghost Rider.   Wait! Other people have read Tech Jacket? I fucking love Tech Jacket!    Miles Morales and Kamala Khan. At least not yet.    Damn right. These are two of my favourite Marvel characters at the moment - or at least two of my favourite Marvel book, Miles is a bit bland - but a lot of what makes them great is how they've both slotted into their uniquely well-established worlds.  Although, more diversity is always a good thing, you can't force them, otherwise you end up with Fem-Thor and Captain African-American who have both been flops in my opinion (which is a shame as I love both Aaron and Remender).   Is it any good?   Not just good, those were excellent. It's in my Top 5 Ultimate Spider-Man arcs.   Unless it's, you know, Microchip or even himself.    Greg Rucka, Tim Seeley, Gail Simone, Jason Aaron, Matt Fraction, Brenden Fletcher, John Layman, and even Brian Michael Bendis   I love most of these writers, but you listed 7 white guys and one white girl. While I admit, they all do an excellent job of writing people who aren't white males - although I can't think of many great female Aaron characters, hopefully Southern Bastards will change that - I wish there were more minorities working in comics.  This isn't really a response to you, honestly, more I'm just not that fond of the way the industry has shaped up. I can only name a few creators that are racial minorities or female and I feel the same way about film. I don't know whether I can blame DC or Marvel for that, but I'd like to see more.   Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, Spider-Men and Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man   So you've read one volume of Ultimate Spider-Man? Why not try the rest of it?   Did you read all of the Miles Morales stuff?   I didn't like this arc, I thought it was a bit of a let down after the excellent Jim Starlin.   That may be a while. Right now, it looks like it may go on forever.   It might be that the writer spent years constructing the first season and only one on the second.   I dunno, he must watch a lot of crap.      John Oliver   This is probably the weakest of the three. The banter wasn't very entertaining, the action lacked impact, the animation had no weight, Trevor reminded me of a Cable-esque 90s hero and their relationship was kind of cheesy.       That's reserved for the Hawkeye/Daredevil miniseries.   It's like DC's Ultimate Universe. It modernises and redefines popular characters.    shh! They're onto me.   I love it.   Agreed, but I think those parts were there as a service to the actor.    Could you please post the next page?   Will the wait for vol. 3 be as long as it was for vol 2.? Johns left some interesting ideas open and I'm dying for them to be explored.  Are DC planning on expanding their Earth One universe further? I love the idea of lots of graphic novels being released each year.  Are the other Earth One books worth reading?  And most importantly, what does /r/DCcomics think of Batman: Earth One and it's alternate takes on characters?   Fuck the bastard that stole it.  Edit: Sorry this isn't very helpful or constructive, it's just how I feel about arseholes who pull shit like this.   The visuals in The Raid 2 are very good. There's a really gritty sense of style to all of the action scenes. The choice of colours in the production design and lighting also helped make the talkier moments much more enthralling.   Pretty much, yeah.   So whoever is posted first gets an almost guaranteed place? L   Is there a  particular franchise you've wanted to score for?   Francis Manapul and Jeff Lemire.   Miles Teller, Nicolas Hoult, Idris Elba are all big ones I agree with.   I'd like to throw in Kate Mara and Iko Uwais.   For a second I was all like, "Frank Grillo? I fuckin' love that guy." Then I read Taylor Kitsch.   Oh dear lord. This will be shite.   You're going to be so disappointed; the director of The Expendables.   Funny how you compare an Alan Moore movie to a movie inspired by the works of Frank Miller.   The Killing Joke is too short. It'd only inform half an hour of a movie.   The Raid is one of my absolute favourite franchises. I can't wait until the US remake butchers everything I love about it.    Just like 80% of Grant Morrison's run...   Because it's an unpopular opinion that could be viewed as contrarian, especially considering I didn't really give any reasons why I didn't like it. It's equivalent to defending Marvel Movies or saying you don't like Lord of the Rings.   Does anyone know if the comic is as good?   Angel Savadore and Beak's weird, deformed babies.   That's what I get for being too dependent on my phone's spell check.   I watched Jurassic Park for the first time last night and I must say I was underwhelmed.   Fast 5. When they decided they were turning too many people off with the car talk and decided to focus on action.    Punisher/Doctor Strange   Bendis' White Tiger - the ex-FBI lady who gets hold of her uncle's amulet.   Michael Cudlitz and Marc Warren.   I'm not sure Shakespeare shared Morrison's love for the silver age, but I can see that.   I don't want to turn this into a "how bad was Civil War" thread, but how fucking bad was Civil War.  [I actually wrote a review of it.](http://thelatestpull.com/2015/02/marvel-monday-civil-war/)   There were some decent tie-ins (I particularly liked Front Line and New Avengers) but reading it all was killing me.   I can't imagine 616 Cap doing that. Civil War isn't exactly Millar's best work.   I really hope not. Doomsday is the epitome of 90s OTT comic trash. In the comics he was severely underwritten and most of his appreciation comes from the design - like a lot of 90s comic characters (Venom, Lobo, Savage Dragon, Spawn). Some characters - like Cable and Bane - have redeemed themselves in later stories, but Doomsday really isn't one of them.   I don't think Lex will be a villain at all. I'm imagining a motally bankrupt antihero.   Come September, the only founding Avenger still around in their original persona will be Iron Man. Being a founding Avenger is not as a big a deal as people make it out to be.   Y: The Last Man movie or a Batman: The Black Mirror movie, but starring Dick as Nightwing, not Batman.   I'd love to see Spider-Man as a mockumentry made by MJ.  	116

HAHAHAHAHA"  You're watching a movie with a T Rex in it and you're complaining that the protagonist has heels on?    ,  ...    3edgy5moi   Fuck off you cadaverous little cumspitoon.    I get that. I was just making a joke. But it stands to reason that a person seeking out a park bench doesn't need to be told to run at that given moment. And that's kinda the point of ambient advertising. To deliver a message to people at a specific moment, where that message might be motivational, or aspirational, or just clever and helpful. The only specific moments I see arising from this are bedraggled workers looking for a bench to have their lunch on, only to find a benchless bench with Nike telling them run.       Jesus. Nobody is debating the relative ease of being a presenter vs construction worker in Qatar. I'm just saying it's a shitload harder than it looks, and it takes a lot of skill.   You can't commit a crime in retaliation for a crime, Sir Lightbulb. And get your shit together with those contradicting Z's and S's.   Pretty retarded if you ask me. What's the message here? Run instead of sitting down on a park bench? Those two activities have nothing to do with each other. I just want to eat my sandwich and enjoy some fresh air during my lunch break, not have some holier than thou shoe company tell me to fucking run. Run where? Back to my cubicle? Fuck you Nike.   I've seen fellas like you in court A LOT      It's not as simple as just reading your lines because the camera picks up your eyes moving. You have to look into the teleprompter and read with your peripheral vision. I invite you to give that a go without looking or sounding like a moron.    Or just ignore it and add assaulting a police officer to the charges.   Oh Heidi.... You tried, hun. You tried.   Former TV news presenter here. She deserves more than props. Karl throws her a segment ahead of time and she goes straight into it and delivers her lines straight into the camera, with only a brief glance at her script, before realizing the teleprompter is showing the script for different segment.  To break down the skill that involves: she's got her lede lines memorized, the composure to deliver them at any given moment without tipping the audience off, and the awareness to be reading the teleprompter, which would be showing Celeb Buzz's script, while delivering completely different lines.  There's a reason I'm a former TV presenter.... shit's HARD.   My home of Bermuda is famous for a few things: shorts, that 2spooky4me eponymous triangle, and tax avoidance. But the biggest mark our tiny archipelago has made in the history books can be found in every marina across the globe: [the Bermuda Rig.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_rig)  The rigging allowed us, and subsequently the world, to sail upwind with precision around the reefs that claimed so many ships in years gone by. The design was so transformative, within a few decades of its popularisation, King Charles II would soon be sailing one.   A poem published by John H. Hardie in 1671 described Bermuda's boats such:    With tripple corner'd Sayls they always float,   About the Islands, in the world there are,   None in all points that may with them compare.  I've always been curious to know what the wider implications of the Bermuda Rig were in the world of sailing, beyond piracy and competition. Did the ability to sail upwind alter shipping routes, or naval war strategy?  I'd love to learn more about my island's sailing heritage, especially with the America's Cup World Series coming to our shores this October.   Wait what? How do you not see that the definition of harassment is what FPH was doing to Imgur staff?   FPH put pictures of the entire Imgur staff on their sidebar. That's pretty harassy    And that, friends, is the secret to good advertising.   My grandfather, William Stevenson, wrote the non fiction spy novel 'A Man Called Intrepid', which was subsequently turned into a TV miniseries starring David Niven.   [On IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078649/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co) it says NBC was the US distributor, along with the list of production companies that made it, but I can't find anything on who has the film rights.  Can anyone point me in the right direction, or could someone with IMDB Pro have a deeper look at the film's details?  I'd very much like to look into reviving his book for the big screen, and I need all the help I can get!   Just curious to know where people are meeting women that display such "common" traits.

The number of people who put their feet out to somehow assist in braking is ridiculous. So many crashes.   Can't say I've ever encountered a girl that likes assaulting people, then specifically gets defensive when she gets assaulted back. You've met so many of these women, you can say confidently they're 1 in 15? Wow. You must come from a pretty shitty place if that's how people act.   It really annoys me when people bitch about product placement. Those brands funded a record breaking movie. A movie that you probably loved, although you'd never admit it here. Fuck them?    well pew pew to you too   Rosebud is his sled. The thing is, there was nobody at his bedside when he died. So how could anyone possibly know "Rosebud" was his last word? I never got that.   You need to hang around better women if you think that kind of behavior is "%100 typical"   I've always been curious to know whether it was the greatest, most skilled soldiers that survived the longest, or if your survival came down more to luck. If I am hell bent on surviving a battle, do I flee -- as the old idiom says -- or do I become as skilled as possible with my sword and mount?   Pretty sure this was on TIL recently. Mammal's distress calls are recognizable across species. So it's not so much that the scream is human, it's that human screams are mammalian.    a good background  hahaha yeah, just some casual listening really. nothing too heavy. Check out his Common Sense podcasts as well for his take on modern events.   I mean, the Supreme Court HAS ruled that companies are people, and because money = free speech this now means that companies can support political candidates. I don't know anywhere else where this can be done.   Dan Carlin explained the recent Supreme Court decision on this really well. You're spot on.      I didn't. And the only reason I did it was laziness. ADRIAN'S REVENGE!   The High Commission for Human Rights at the UN?   "Getting got" is slang for someone getting the better of you.  If lil Billy gets got by lil Bobby in hopscotch, Billy got got by Bobby. Got it?   Um...   all time recorded best. the true joy of the modern era is that we get this shit on record. the epic but insignificant fails of history are lost to the sands of time. I bet some hilarious shit went down. Horrible, horrible shit too. But also, occasionally... y'know, when someone isn't knocking down your gates threatening to rape all your women and erase all traces of you from the earth... I bet in between all... that... some funny shit went down.   Here's the thing...   Having an attachment to your work is never good. You have to be attached to working in that medium, just not the stuff you produce. Learning to kill my babies has benefitted me immeasurably in terms of my creative output.    Yeah, not a whole lot of thought going into this one   I love that you think niggardly is an epithet. Well done   thanks for actually answering and not downvoting and moving on   why is that?   I was thinking something along the lines of  #STARS WAR   Leave ME alone you scummy little shitstain    I'll do no such thing you slimy, dessicated fetus fuck   Fuck you, you cadaverous cumspitoon   And here I am getting freaked out when the gf tries a little stinky pinky   The hair was big and the hits were bigger.

What are some of your all time favourite 80's summer tunes?     You're being downvoted because the only accurate wording possible is saying that one car hit another.

It's called reporting the facts. You don't know the exact circumstances that caused the crash, and speculation about that could get you sued for libel.   Bless you. I hope you never have to meet one of these kinds of lawyers, but the reason the prosecutor is a dick is because the defense attorney has made an issue out of the definition of a photocopier, and coached his client into feigning ignorance.

 Classic, required reading for anyone who wasn't aware of this. It really was the beginning of BitShares.    Creflo and Taffi Dollar? If you wrote that into a movie, no one would believe it. This strikes me as a simple intelligence test; send them a dollar and you've flunked it.    I see. Lots of "1's" on there, though, and you have to wonder if some of those guys just lobbed in a bad ball by accident.       Do those stats count pitch-outs or wild pitches where somebody trips and bounces it into the plate?   Ferrell's stunt was great. Baseball should have more fun. Reaching out and appealing to new fans is critical for this game's long term success.   Spring training is the perfect time to try these things out. But honestly it is a long season and the games are long for many fans. I'd be okay if they pulled some tricks even in the regular season.      Wrong sub. This is "Not the Onion" and here you're posting about onions. Definitely not allowed!   If you pay half his salary, it's a deal.   A's have announced Ferrell's having Tommy John surgery. https://twitter.com/based_ball/status/576050370708815872    Clint's still talking to an empty chair.   Just declare martial law and get it over with. Democracy is a sham to these conservatives.   As long as they allow provisional voting for all the college kids, Wisconsin should end up blue again.    The Committee on Committees will study these studies and report back with its conclusions.    Duane Kuiper was on the radio in SF yesterday. He said that Huff, Pat Burrell and those 2010 veterans have basically been saying the same thing about Pablo "off the record" for years. This was the first time he's seen Huff go public.    Elitist jerk.       Very cool. I'm glad he remembered to write "Mariners". Do you think he'd do the same thing for any Yankees, Reds, Rays, or Cubs fan?            Iran...isn't that near San Antonio somewhere?   Welcome! Looking forward to this.    Terrific suggestion.      Hopefully not while they're driving.      I know. How to energize the donors AND the foot soldiers, plus win the primaries AND the general election...it's quite a gauntlet for the wannabe GOP nominee to run.    He will get ripped and I think he knows it. Ripped apart? He's Jeb Bush so he may well survive that. If he really believes what he said about the GOP candidate who wins primaries not being able to win a General Election, then maybe he's willing to put his money where his mouth is. That would mean taking his hits for some more moderate stances (like immigration).    They'll have to go triple-digit pretty soon.    Good for him. I hope Jeb runs toward the middle somewhat, even in the primary. It would be good for his party, and for the country, to have less extremism. Jeb and Hillary may both be big enough that they can dictate some of the terms and not have to cow-tow quite as much to groups like this.    It's often a business deal much of the time, so...when one deal fell through, another one was struck.    Okay, I tried that too and it does indeed show my correct BTS balance. Thanks.   Making progress, perhaps. My balance is still all over the place. I think I had around 1 BTC worth of BTS in there. A few days ago, it was showing I had 6 BTC worth and now it shows I have 0.2 BTC. So I can't join you in saying the balances are correct, but more coins do seem to be listed on there now.    That's awesome! Many of us thought it would be a big year for Bitcoin. The infrastructure has just been slower to come around than everyone hoped.    Stark beauty. I wonder how long those dead trees have been there. At some point in the not-so-distant past, were they actually able to grow in this environment?             The light client is being tested and the web wallet just debuted.

Definitely report it.   	42
    People who torture animals.     Republican ideas and philosophies. I do like a lot of people that are conservative, but I really resent their political view.  I just will not talk politics with them and everything is alright.                  I quit two years ago and I have almost two years of recovery.  Being a recovered alcoholic takes a lot of time and energy because you have to invest a lot of time into maintaining your recovery and make sure that you do not fall back into alcoholic behavior which is a precursor to relapse.  I go to about three to four meetings a week, participate in twelve-step service commitments, and also attend a Unitarian Universialist church to work the spiritual portion of my program.    You can do it on willpower but if you are doing that, I would live in a sober living at least for the first year.  If you go the twelve-step route, you will a better shot of recovery as long you can accept a program of self-improvement to deal with your drinking and have some form of spirituality (which does not require a belief in God unlike a lot of people in AA will tell you).  You also should to attend some sort of rehab program (inpatient) as well.  If your insurance does not accept inpatient programs, than I will check the providers that the drug courts use for their clients because usually their rehab costs are usually 75%-85% cheaper than most inpatient programs that the insurance companies pay for.                                                                                                                                                             That thing has been eyesore on my bus ride on OCTA Route No. 56 (which I take at least a few times a week) ever since I moved to the Santa Ana, CA in 2012.  I always wonder what the backstory on that building is and now I know.                                                                              That is why it is so hard to convience a Congress person to vote against a defense spending bill because it is a gravy train for local economies that depend on Defense. And I was part of the gravy train until I drank myself out of my job.   Defense spending is a really a jobs bill for local politicians.  Except the goods go to the military instead directly to the people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The only problem that I do not like about the tax law is that it will cause a distortion in accounting for financial earnings and tax accounting.   DOA with me.  It fails to properly account for the recapture the cost of the asset over the useful of the life asset. It also "creative accounting" allowing the companies to have higher profits for Wall Street than actual profits that they when it is reported to the IRS.  Again, creative accounting.                                                                                         	194
 Everyone ranged from 24-26. Photographers idea on that pose. Got better ones if anyone cares.       Social convention.  People can't handle things thay go against "social norms".

 Seems like there is a ton of opposition to this idea and I don't know why. Vader in the black suit ruling the empire with Palpatine in his evil prime between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope would be pretty sweet. Lots of meat there.      Something I've never been able to find online and I don't think it's on the DVD's either is a sketch from HBO's late 90's 'The Chris Rock Show' called "Explosions". It was a parody of disaster movies like Armageddon or The Core where random explosions are happening all over the World and Chris Rock plays the president. At one point he yells at his cabinet saying something like "We gotta do something about these explosions!" And it was just hilariously perfect. But it seems to be nowhere on YouTube, however his similar fecal themed disaster movie trailer "Shitstorm" (which may have inspired "Sharknado" for all we know) is relatively easy to find.   You were watching Drunk History over memorial day weren't you?   2" front. 3" or 4" rear. It's kinda low stock. http://imgur.com/kBxvkld   I dig it. Gonna drop my GMT 400 Tahoe Limited soon. Needs shocks and bushings anyway      I know there are plenty of Mexicans/Latinos in American metal bands like Deftones, P.O.D., Suicidal Tendencies (Robert Trujillo now in Metallica), RATM hmm who else?      I won't call it shit, but Be Here Now did kinda sound to me like it was 'regurgitated' from the first 2 albums to use Noel's favorite word. Sounded great, but was more sizzle, and less steak. You know what some might say... ;-)  	10
 Couldn't agree more. Its like Cormack McCarthy and SK had a literary love child   Who's a sad American now? This guy.   Worst part about moving from New Hampshire to Maine. I still don't know how much anything costs or how much I get paid.   Harry Potter would be pretty cool   Upvote for the giants glass.    I just got got this sweet mini-disc player! Nah man, forget your new iPod crap, this is going to be big!   I have to be honest, as a "gun nut" I am shocked that this is just now a thing in Texas. It is like this in New Hampshire, the 'Live Free or Die' state; as it should be. Someone who physically, emotionally, or otherwise abuses anyone, let alone a partner or family member clearly is not responsible enough to keep and maintain a firearm. That person needs help. While it is difficult to say whether they have less of a right to defend themselves I have to say, in these instances yes, they do have less of a right. They lost that right when they abused an individual.   You'll have a much easier time with cats than a dog. Like everyone said, just ask. This should go without saying, but, if your emailing: proofread, use complete sentences, and be professional. That goes a long way. Our current place was no pets but they allowed our dog based on an email. Our landlord said it was an indicator of being a respectful person an renter   This American Life did an awesome episode with something very similar but in Freedom NH. Look it up and give it a listen if you need some inspiration.    I don't dislike all books that have religion. Like I said, I find theology fascinating and extremely fertile ground for excellent stories. What I dislike is authors who treat religion as "I believe this. This is the truth" rather than "I believe this; what do you think".   I guess what I am trying to say with the 'ideals' comment is that I would like the freedom to interpret a story for a meaning that I can resonate with. I am a huge Stephen King fan; in a lot of his books he has religious undertones, etc but he uses them in a way, that while possibly representative of his beliefs, they are open to interpretation and are non-alienating. What I dislike is authors who treat religion as "I believe this. This is the truth" rather than "I believe this; what do you think".    What gets to me is when the book  is used as a vehicle to propel an individuals ideals. The Shack for example was a great concept for an excellent novel, but was essentially a sermon. While I am an agnostic (I admittedly lean towards atheism) I respect and support all religious beliefs and will continue to do so until there is empiracle evidence one way or the other, and will always respect an individuals believes regardless of their validity. I find theology fascinating and see a huge amount of potential in it as a tool or topic. I become turned off when the story feels cheapened because the author writes it to talk about his religion. Those are typically books I'd avoid, but that's difficult in instances like The Shack.   As an aside I do become agitated with false logic. As a scientist I have the obligation to remain open minded to all possibilities but also an obligation to laws of nature and logical reasoning. There is a book titled something like 'Why science can't disprove god' which sets out to say god must be real because science can't prove otherwise. That's wrong on several levels - primarily in that the burden of proof lie with the accusor (If you say something is real you must provide the evidence; I.e Bigfoot) and that **science is not an enemy or religion**. We simply cannot test it so we move on and concern ourselves with things we can.   That's exactly where I was going with the religious thing.   What things can you just not get through the moment it is brought up. For me it is religion; it just kills a book dead in the water. For some reasons I have an easier time believing and accepting in Westeros and Hogwarts. Prime examples are The Shack (Young?) and Cronins The Passage (Incredible book; what saved it was him leaving it open to interpretation rather than saying God is real).  So what kills an otherwise good book for you?   Excellent post. I will say, however, it feels very much the heart and soul of Numenera... Check it out if you haven't yet.    Whoa, what do you think you're doing? Only Garth and I get to make Wayne's World references!   This studio we recorded in had this clock that would play Westminster Chimes (you know the tune if you hear it) ever hour. We heard it so often that our drummer would subconsciously pick up a guitar and start playing it at random. It was a pretty good laugh   YouTube - I have been listening to Audio Books at work for the last year (Got tired of exhausting podcast archives). I have almost always found what I was looking for on YouTube.    Be careful of letting people over hype it - I hated Avatar because I was expecting something magnificent and earth shattering, not just a better, blue Pocahontas. That being said, I didn't read it until I was 23 and it kicked my ass. I typically love dark books (Cormac McCarthy, Stephen King, etc) but HP series managed to keep me enthralled through all 8 books; took me through the entire emotional spectrum; AND delivered to my tastes for the bleak. The continuity is air tight as well. Great series.    Over production. I had to stop listening to Stephen Kings 'Insomnia' because of the music that would play intermittently OVER the reader. Admittedly it was a pretty cool lead but too distracting.   	20
 I've lived in PA my whole life and haven't ever heard that term before    Thanks for the tip! I was just kidding there, but I'm actually very experienced with good old dexter and always choose something without acetaminophen    Or just chug that shit and enjoy a real mind fuck   Growing up and not having much of anything really sucked, but looking back it was such a great thing for my future. Now I'm working full time, about to get a second job. I think growing up like that really made me appreciate money a lot more. Just having extra money to spend on basically whatever I want was, and continues to be, the biggest shock.   dt;aj   As boring as that sounds, imagine a dream where you paint a wall. That's right, just you, a wall, some white paint, and a paint brush. Happens at least once every few weeks -_-   I'll definitely listen to some of their stuff tonight, thanks for the suggestion!    I agree with you on that. I feel like dxm slows music down and allows me to focus on more parts at one time, which comes together to make music sound fucking great.    Wish I listened to that while actually on dxm. Thanks for the link, I'll be using that song in my next trip for sure!    Just wanted to share what I believe to be out of body experiences with you guys! For starters I'm very experienced with dxm, and this is very common on my average dosage (~950). Never considered it to be an OBE until I was telling a friend about it and he suggested that it was indeed an OBE.   Here's how it goes: once I start peaking I wrap myself up comfortably in blankets and sit on my bed against the wall. Once I close my eyes I feel my body start lowering through the blankets, through the floor, and downward into a void. I don't see anything per se, but it's a very clear and obvious feeling. Then I begin accelerating, faster and faster, almost like I'm climbing the initial hill of a roller coaster. Once I reach the top of this climb, I take off. My body is blasted through the floor, through the ceiling, and into space.   I can make this last as long as I want, and can basically do it on command. It feels very similar to the salt and pepper shaker ride that they have at fairs. Anyone else have similar experiences on dxm, or any substance?   Tl;dr take pills, fall through floor, end up in space   Had a serious debate with a friend over that dress. It is definitely white and gold!    Shampoo is the urethra is the worst pain known to man   Haven't heard of it. I'll look into it next time I order seeds. Thanks for the suggestion!    Also I've been using ginger capsules to kill the nausea. Really does the trick!    Yeah hbwr, shoulda mentioned that. And I've considered the exact, but my water is actually  chlorinated, which kills the lsa. Haven't gotten around to buying bottled water yet. I'll definitely give it a try next time.    Oh sorry! I used hbwr seeds    Lately I've been experimenting with LSA  and have noticed an extremely different set of effects based on regular dosage vs high dosage. When I took 15 seeds I had an insane night of extreme euphoria. It was honestly one of the greatest drug experiences of my life. However I have come to notice that when increasing the dose, it just becomes an extreme sedative.   I still get the effects on time, where it seems to pass slow as hell, but instead of the euphoria I just get tired as hell. And instead of the afterglow that lasts a few days consisting of a great mood, I just get a good night's sleep. No after effects at all.   The change in dosage was 15 seeds for euphoria, and 22 seeds for sedative effects. Anyone else notice this?   Edit: gonna sleep, as I took the sedative dose around 8:30. Looking forward to responses in the morning!    I tend to black out and do weird shit when I mix the two haha    As much as I love a good robotrip, the hangover the next day just hasn't been worth it to me. I've been experimenting with LSA lately, and that really won me over. Ginger caps or tea before hand has eliminated the nausea for me, and the euphoria is like nothing else. I'd suggest giving it a try, really great time.   Usually 650-800 if I'm going for good visuals   I should also note that I do get negative effects from this, mostly just being unable to form any sort of understandable words.    Honestly I just enjoy taking it and waiting for it to kick in. I've never had so much fun staring at a wall waiting for something to change. Other than that, I really don't get the scary hallucinations that I do often read about. Usually just see weird opaque blobs slowly flying around my room. So in short, the visuals.    I love listening to floyd's album "Animals" when I'm on dexter. It's great sober, but so much of the album is guitar, so it is damn amazing when you're tripping on dxm.    Unfortunately not, though I plan to once I find a dealer that sells more than bud. And for me, pink floyd is where it's at. I'll play an album all the way through, and the difference between it then and sober is incredible. I've also listened to a lot of trap whilst on dxm, and that's always a good time.    My favorite part of every dxm trip is the music. I've taken huge doses just because I wanted to listen to an album or two during the  peak. Haven't quite experienced anything like it with any other drug.   	24
 I've already forgiven him...         That's it!   Yeah, the houses on the otherside that's my neighborhood. You can actually see my house (or what's left of it) clearly from 35 now. It still doesn't feel real.    It's the best form of therapy.   For now , we are staying with my boyfriend. The house will be rebuilt eventually and I do have coverage on it's contents. Most will be replaced, but the memories attached to certain items and all the keepsakes, trophies, they are gone and I can't get them back. My car was totaled as well, It really wasn't worth very much and I'm not sure what I'm going to do there. Thankfully I do have insurance. My neighbor has no coverage on her vehicle or contents. She now has to start completely over. She's also a single mother of two. Through it all she was still trying to give me some of what she was able to salvage. It breaks my heart.    Thank you!   I don't have a roof, but the garage and kitchen still had a ceiling at the time. No refrigerator sized holes in either.   Yeah, my house was hit by a tornado.    Thank you so much!!! It's been hard, but then there's people like you that have made this process so much easier.   Thank you so much!The amount of support I've felt has been surreal... Right down to all the volunteers going through my neighborhood and handing out water and gatorade as we try to salvage and clean up what's been left. Had I been 2 houses over, I wouldn't have anything to salvage. I lost my entire roof and so much more, my house is a complete loss, but I still have some to take away from it. The rest of my neighborhood was completely flattened. When I came out of the storm shelter, there was nothing to my left.... Nothing. My children are safe, and I found all my pets, so many were not that lucky. My heart hurts for all the children and innocent lost in this storm. I don't know if I should feel guilty or relieved.    No shit!!   Risque...   Aren't they just beautiful!?!   I'm ridiculously impressed... It was a bitch to get the damn thing in there. Kinda glad I don't have to worry about how I'm gonna get it out now.   One fantastically delicious bottle!!! (I had three.) And thank you.   It definitely fucking flies...   A-FUCKING-MEN!!!    It still had my wine inside, so I'm pretty sure it's mine.   Thank you! I am just really thankful my neighbor had a storm shelter put in last year! It amazes me to see how the community has come together for all of us. I don't know what I would do without people like you.   Yes, just across I35 from the Warren and Medical center. My house is a total loss and the neighborhood was completely obliterated.   *her      I'm not that kind of girl...  	25
             Absolutely, but My argument is to be careful who is adding the context.                        I believe that all sides should be taught with the caveat that it's true. Ideas like manifest destiny and of a religious nature have no place in American history, i.e. intelligent design.       It's not a good idea to compare atrocities between nations during WWII as a defense for not teaching about an event. Robert McNamara developed the plan for the fire-bombing of Dresden, and later admitted that if the US lost the war, he would've been indicted for war crimes.                                 Good answers...as a society, the US public has placed barriers between itself and the dead. This wasn't always the case. If you currently live in an old house that has a parlor and dining room, the parlor was originally intended as the viewing room for the family of the deceased. More importantly, children were often tasked with the task of euthanizing a family animal. A good example of this is found in the book and film *Old Yeller*.                                                         welcome      But it's also correct that a WC in Europe is a toilet, or water closet.      WC   Achy Breaky Heart - Billy Ray Cyrus. It's also the reason for M. Cyrus.   Doubling up makes it twice as nice.                                                                                 This is a no-brainer - it's [Michael Faraday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday), the inventor of the motor and the first person to understand that magnetic fields could be used as a power source. Everything in our modern world falls apart without Faraday's achievements, and he believed them so important that he refused to patent the processes.                                                                                                                                                                                 A reminder: the US supreme court ruled that black americans weren't really people but an inferior race that needed a paternal hand. The supreme court isn't "supreme" because it's not interested in the people's rights but that of corporate america.                  Florida - come for the weather, stay for the crazy.   That's because I gave you the context for my trashiness; I'm just saying I give people some slack because I've been there before.   Robert A. Heinlein short story that I never thought would get made.   If you want to enjoy the movie even more, Brian Greene does this wonderful series called [Beyond the Cosmos](http://www.primewire.ag/watch-2733300-Beyond-the-Cosmos-online-free) that explains in simple terms the relationship between time, gravity, and space. It blows my mind that the farther away from Earth that a person travels in space, time runs slower for them. The arrow of time runs in only one direction for humans, however, in physics and quantum mechanics the arrow of time is malleable and can move in both directions. It almost appears as if the writers of *Interstellar* wrote the movie after watching Greene's series. If you watch his series, Interstellar takes on a whole different level of pleasure and awe.                        That's not being trashy, that's being naive.      For example, I grew up extremely poor and joined the military right out of high school. Because my family was so poor, I'd never eaten in a restaurant until a very pretty girl asked me to dinner at *Ye Olde Oyster House* in Boston. I was stationed with the 10th special forces group at Ft. Devens, Mass. and I was excited about my restaurant visit. She ordered a drink and I ordered an ice tea; when tea is served in the south it usually came pre-sweetened, but this Boston so it was without sugar. I promptly used every cane sugar packet on the table to make the tea sweet enough. The waitress brought cornbread to the table as a snack while we looked the menu over. The cornbread I'd grown up with was thin, bitter, and a type of hard tack, but the waitress had brought what appeared to me to be cake. Without saying anything to my date, I flagged down the waitress and told her she'd brought us desert before the meal and that we'd not ordered any cake. Both the waitress and my date assured me it was cornbread. As we ordered, I didn't recognize anything on the menu when I spotted a dish made with eggs that looked edible. So I ordered the quickee, which made the waitress giggle and my date blush. It was actually quiche, and I didn't eat much of it. After this affair I never heard from or saw my date again. While this may have appeared trashy to anyone watching, it was simple naivete.      When I see poor people acting inappropriately, I understand the reasons behind their action.       Most of the replies sound like things poor people do or wear, so I guess all poor people are trashy.            The OK gop's stance on history is an attempt to revision the nation's past. It expected parents to agree with such a patriotic version of history, but miscalculated. Now its trying to walk-back comments made by a member by claiming the legislation was poorly worded.   Do you believe in god?                                                            I knew it wouldn't take long before the comparisons about safety between pipelines and railroads. This accident will be used by the republicans as an excuse to push the Keystone line for the Koch brothers.   The early 20th century was a dark time in addressing mental health issues, with chemical and physical castration a common practice in its institutions. They believed the practice would keep homosexuality from spreading.      edit: I'm arguing that US christians have already implemented a version of sharia law in this nation and it needs to stop.   Not murder, but there was chemical and physical castration, imprisonment, and placement in mental institutions, all sanctioned by the government and the supreme court.                  Isn't restricting access to rights shared by all Americans a form of punishment?   You and me both.                                   	199

I knew there'd be jerks but I kinda assumed there'd be more folk to read it   be smart about it.                  there are plenty of good writers covering individual teams, a print subscription magazine coupled with a free alt digital version would really be a boost to the fans.

Carolina, SA,   Ft.L all have fewer players on their rosters than Jacksonville. Just means contracts aren't official yet, plenty of signings to come for all teams      the vast majority of NPSL players are college players so they can't get paid due to NCAA rules. nearly every NPSL team has a couple of semi-pro guys, older players or foreign players that are looking to keep sharp   move up. the costs for a NPSL club are mostly grounds, staff,   kits   this is a good pick up, he's the kind of forward that could really excel in NASL         superb signing. the attack looks really strong, but I still worry about the defense         I also found Goodreads to be a great help   I prefer rather subdued covers, but I understand where you're coming from. Check out my blog for more info on the book, and I'd definitely be will to do a review swap. Drop me a line                     he did. I was really surprised to see that but I suppose Ambersley   Taka will be good veteran influences on the rookies that'll make up most of the team. do we know what team St. Louis is affiliating with in MLS?                  agreed. I'm seeing Ibarra following a path similar to Luke Mulholland's   solid addition to the defense   on the side that the team was the weakest. as a former captain, he should be a good influence on the pitch         actually, it's about ethics in gaming journalism                                 great project idea! looking forward to getting it.                     I don't mind unbalanced halves of the season, but it just feels like this number is well below the minimum.   hmm, still feels too short of a first half of the season. think I want to see a 12-14 game half                              quibble         no worries. I was a literary editor for ages on my own book review magazine. Always read smart work from smart people littered with typos   glitches. Just have to comb through it with stranger's eyes.  it's difficult to express just how embarrassed I was/am that I sent him such a lousy copy. and now it's stuck with the book. I take refuge in the fact that he did rather like the story. I mean, 4 out of 5 stars is rather okay.   I get entirely what you're saying   Andy was more than fair to point out the glitches. The perils of writing entirely by-oneself is exactly this. You get blurry-eyed. But, again, with this book it pretty much went from November to building up the courage to self-publish to making it available for others to read.  Hopefully I'll be able to have edit readers for Book II. I always find that when I do draft folks into reading a manuscript they don't give the nuts   bolts kind of edits I asked for, they just hand it back with "looks good" or a series of 'edits' that are really their own rewrites of the entire story.  Thanks so much for the suggestions though, I truly appreciate the engagement!   I enjoy books that prompt me to look things up, so that's the kind of book I tried to write. I know it's not for everyone, but I enjoy it   Will do better in the future. A cleaner edition than the ARC given is what is available. Though the manuscript was a NaNoWriMo project   for a once through, I thought it rather good enough to share. And then there's this: http://www.wired.com/2014/08/wuwt-typos/           	137
 Most definitely. They must have forgot they were supposed to be there when shooting and added them in for continuity sake. Although personally I think it would have been less jarring to just leave them out.   The reason they changed it originally was that they weren't allowed to show boobs. (Yes even cartoon boobs.) Funnily enough though they kept the boobs and just took away the woman. Censorship is weird.  And then the Halloween one is a female skeleton with boobs. Which was allowed.   So basically on television you are allowed dead skeleton boobs or floating boobs.   Curb Your Enthusiasm has a lot including Paul F. Tompkins and Scotty Aucks himself.   Especially since he went to see it.   And of course Hollywood Facts. My favourite of Scott's fake quizzes was when David Cross didn't realise that Hollywood Facts was a bit and he started arguing his answer was right. I think that was one of the last ones.    And of course: Alive Or Dead- Dick Wolf? Answer: Dead. His dick was eaten by a wolf.      And in at least one you die in the next 5 minutes. Who knows which one it will be.    Yeah, "trigger" trigger people who are sensitive to gun talk.   Below the what????   I have to say the idea of Dan doing Minecraft videos is a very strange but also comforting feeling. Especially considering he seems to want to do Tutorials rather than Let's Plays. The fact that somebody who has a career in television still wants to take up a hobby in Internet entertainment tells a lot about the feeling doing that stuff does to people.    Nope. There are not yet any plans for the future.   She was an extra for that season though, right?   This is what I'm going to go with. She panicked and needed somewhere to hide the card so stuck it into a part of the van.   But just put the plastic over the top of the bottle.   I'd watch a Weekend At Bernies type idea with the president. The president dies and the others politicians have to convince terrorists he's alive.      I quite like If I Were You with Jake and Amir. Featuring earwolf guests like Ben Scwartz and Thomas Middleditch.   Sounds like there is going to be an origin story.   Downcast tells you what day a podcast uploads.   Imagine if they did that though. New extreme if remake.   Does this actually happen in real life to people? I've seen it in so many movies but I've never seen it in real life.       Did you listen to the Season 3 writers room? I sort of want a weekly podcast where it's a new writers room for a different show every week.    Art Of Discourse is one of my favourites. It has my favourite Troy and Abed plots.    I actually have a genuine Torque question I want to ask.   This thing is going to be a lot UTU2TM references, which honestly I'm fine with.   Listening now!   I guess they don't have it anymore. They've been saying there going to let us pick flair for a while now so soon hopefully.      Can anyone confirm? I don't currently have US Netflix.   I think we have the plot for Justice League here.   Hitrecord.org could be an easy place to do this.   Nope second season. Bill Hader and Fourvel were the guests.   He put vhs effects on the cuts but not the actual video. It's not hard to run a video through a vcr. All you need is a vcr, a DVD player and a AV to USB cable.   Oh around the 20 minute mark. Unfortunately no uhh-ing but it is a little kid.   Cmon it's Jurassic Park, there is more than one famous line. Which one do you want?   Yeah maybe he got mixed up or he meant after they got the second season on ABC.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scrubs_characters#Recurring_characters  I can't find any characters missing from the 8th season on this. Are you sure it wasn't the 9th season?   Well I meant the best Lizzie McGuire one.   It's first year to the end of fourth year I think.    The downvotes are especially rude considering she seems to be trying to answer as many questions as possible.    I heard that the lines in the "kiss" scene in JW was improvised. Also that there were other versions of the scene. I was wondering what happened in them?  Also shoutout to /r/earwolf!   Nah you can have a cunt if it's a lighthearted one.    That's the best fan theory I've ever read.   I feel like "NOT Farts" is going to be number 1 no matter what episodes come after this purely because of how much we loved Harris. Sort of like when the Oscars give an award for an actor who has died's last movie even if it wasn't really for that movie but the actor themselves.    You just made me realise my problem with Spontaneanation. It takes me a while to realise what's happening in the scene if I stop paying attention for a minute. Improv4Humans doesn't have this problem because of the short scenes.   When the stream went down as FIFA finally ended I lost it.  	47
 What an adorable little theocratic despot.   Yep. I don't know where they expect poor cripples to live. The streets, I guess. Fuck us.   God, it would be great if more places had handicap accessible housing.    I can't wait to find out he's in the poorhouse. Tell me he's in the poorhouse.   You make a solid case.   You'll hear no argument from me on the whole basic income thing. I've seen the science and sociology behind it. You're preaching to the converted.   I'm not sure about your approach to mental problems however. Gradual reintroduction facilitated by a clinic system would likely be a better solution. This way, those who cannot be reintroduced are given a safe place to be treated and kept out of harm's way.   Something stupid.   I'd watch that.   On the face of it, yes. However, government and charitable services in most areas have already got their hands full with the housed poor in public housing and section 8. Very few places have anything left over for the homeless.  Ideally, we should close tax loopholes for the bourgeoisie, cut military funding, and use the surplus to fund mental health clinics and social services and education so that the homeless problem can be dealt with in the long term; but the powers that be have decided that this won't be done. Therefore, I stand by my belief that feeding the homeless isn't necessarily a good idea. A short term solution is to donate whatever you can to your local homeless shelter and community centers.   Even with food stamps and disability, I'm still barely making it. Being disabled, it would be awesome to have better job prospects or single payer healthcare, but fuck the working and disabled poor I guess.   AMA or whatever.   To be objective, doesn't feeding homeless people regularly draw in more from surrounding areas, putting more strain on local resources?   Georgia Florida water war, as well.  Fuck your clams, Florida. Fuck em.   It Follows would've been the perfect name for a sequel to Stephen King's It.   What's the difference between good abstract art and bad abstract art? Honestly. Once art stops looking even remotely like things, it becomes impossible to critique objectively. Really, it's hacks like Pollock's fault.   THE KING THU'UMED HIS HEAD. LEFT HIM BROKEN AND DEAD.   Wheelchair user, here. Why not put some money into fixing ramps and the rest into exoskeletons? I'd love better ramps in the short term, but you know what would be fucking better? Walking. I'm not sure what kind of chair user wouldn't want to walk, but that ain't me or anyone I've ever met.   Isn't this the sort of shit that when it happens in Russia and China, we point to it as signs of their systems collapsing? You would think people would care more about this person's sacrifice.   Isn't your legal record under 18 sealed in most US jurisdictions?   Ah. I was looking at it through ImageZoom and the caption didn't go that far. Still, my point stands. I get that these are localizing comics to fit the context of the Indian issue, but why don't Indians just draw their own cartoons?   Yeah, I work self checkout. I never listen to the damned things. The voice on the machines just turns into a loud, continuous droning after a while. It's dreadful.   Is cheaper, but only KGB can afford rokk.   I'm an attendant on one of those self checkout things. When I'm not too busy, I totally notice. I just don't paid enough to care. Seriously, no one does. Also, we have like one LP person who is never there and she's the only one authorized to directly intercede, so even if I told a manager or something it would be sort of pointless.  Tl;dr Yeah, we know those aren't bananas. Enjoy your discounted produce all the same.   For real. Why not use the originals? These are all clearly stolen.   That's a small ass pic.    Atl standards  If a place in Atlanta isn't walkable by Atlanta standards, then it isn't walkable.   Well, healthcare really does have no business being a capitalist enterprise. It's madness to expect services which are essential to people's being able to live to be subject to market forces.   We can use the leftover John Wayne footage to start a talk show.   F-Faygo? You're the Faygo!   If anybody is still reading this, I'd like to take a moment to plug my friends, [Modern Front.](http://www.modernfrontmusic.com/) They're quite talented, I think, and they've got a lot of enthusiasm for their craft.   It's why I use 'the' for the Ukraine. Dropping it feels arbitrary and it honestly sounds a whole lot better that way.   So is the mother brain damaged? I think I missed something.    Because Poroshenko isn't just another corrupt, capitalist oligarch at all. Maidan wasn't a farcical waste of blood, sweat and tears, either.   Saying 'the' doesn't take anything away from their sovereignty. I mean, there's THE Philippines and THE United States. The insistence borders on insecurity, if you ask me.   The Ukraine sounds better, though.   Does anyone know when international tourists are going to be let in? As an American, I'd love to see Crimea.   Is it really annexing if most Crimeans have been wanting to rejoin Russia since the Ukraine became independent? I wouldn't call it that, personally.   Well, I don't work at THAT Kroger, but anybody who works retail long enough will eventually become death seven times on the inside.    Seems that way, comrade. Seems that way.   So much for regabiliting Murder Kroger's image. I work at Kroger and all that Beltline nonsense seems to have stopped floating around.   I had assumed those were newly composed Prometheans at the time. It's been a while since I played Halo 4 and I always thought the Prometheans were rubbish anyway, so I may be wrong.   Georgia, here, too. I remember Roy and Sunny's flag debacle all too well.   So sad, but you are absolutely right.   But they're both great symbols. We shouldn't let bigots ruin swastikas or rebel flags for the rest of us. We should stop being offended.   The Battle Flag didn't always carry such connotations, however, and that's what I'm railing against. It used to be a symbol of rebelliousness and of the South and then racists had to go and ruin it for people. I mean, look at how it was flown by US troops in WWII and Vietnam and you'll see what I mean. It wasn't always so hateful in the post Civil War era.   I'm with you there. Name me an ethically sound megacorporation and I'll show you a green dog.   Ah. For some reason I had thought that the Quebecois had a flag wholly distinct from the provincial flag. I was wrong. Anyway, the South should have a flag because we're culturally distinct from the North. We've got a distinctive dialect, cuisine, styles of music and more. We've got a rich cultural history distinct from the rest of America and in most places, that's enough to warrant a flag.   That you look down on the South as simply being distinct for slavery is rather telling of how much you know about us. I mean, by this *flawless* logic:   The only difference between the South and North was slavery, so any flag that separates the South from the rest of the country will be looked at with considerable disdain. A regional flag would be looked at as a desire to be separate from the rest of the country, which is a pretty shitty message to send considering the reason for doing it the last time.  German nationalism is a bad thing, considering what it caused *last time.* American patriotism is a bad thing because of what it's caused. The South deserves a flag just as much as the US and Germany do, I think. You've not given me a single compelling reason why we don't.   But don't you see! That's not ours to tamper with! Never mind that we're improving crop yields and increasing disease resistance! /s  (FWIW, Monsanto et al do have some pretty deplorable business practices.)   I thought some piece of post war canon said that the Ark survived. The ecosystem has been fucked beyond belief, but the structural integrity of the station as a whole is more or less sound. Given long enough, monitors and sentinels will likely get it back up and running and churn out Installation 04 C. I'm sure that's Forerunner protocol.  Also, as Prometheans are tied to the Didact, I highly doubt they're anywhere to be found but Requiem.    Hardly seems morally superior, given its history.  Besides, the South is a distinctive cultural region. Cultural regions typically have flags - Quebec, for example.    The inclusion of Ayers Rock makes it feel much more Australian. I don't generally like Union Flag replacements, but this one is solid. Good on you.   The Stars and Bars is the one I wish we'd go after, especially since it's seen by many states as a benign replacement for the Southern cross. I mean, it was the first symbol of the Confederate government - a group that was pretty objectively bigoted and awful. It just sort of sucks that the South doesn't get to have a flag that isn't mired in controversy.   I agree with many of these, but the idea that we can have clean, sustainable development in the short term without nuclear power is idealist and foolish. The key is doing it safely. It can be done, but oversight of the strictist nature is needed in nuclear plants.   Probably the latter. Time was that it wasn't so racially charged and was just seen as a symbol of devil may care rebelliousness. Ever see the Muppet Movie? In the background of the carnival scene, there are all these kids waving Confederate battle flags.  I really wish we could go back to having such a carefree attitude about it. Maybe push the negativity onto the Confederate *national* flag, instead.   If you want to work in the business, but don't want to work - just whine about sexism. That'll get you in.   You should post this to /r/fantheories   The warm embrace of Khorne, brother.   Fair enough. You're pretty much right on the money, for what it's worth, if you were imagining that I come from a Lost Cause promoting background. I still rather like the South and the Confederate flag, even if we'd function poorly as a country and we revolted over slavery. It's just a shame that we were fairly objectively the bad guys, there. I mean, the North were genocidal, imperialist terrorists; so I don't guess there are any good guys in that war.   Plenty of other people said exactly what you did, though. Pardon my curiousity, but it seems sort of unneeded.   Not to be rude, but this thread is days old and other people already replied. Why push the point further?   This. I don't mind kids at all if they're not obnoxious and behave themselves. I'd never have one or anything, but if they're well behaved and respectful of their elders then that's just fine.  Such children are certainly the exception rather than the rule, however.   Yeah, I'm calling bullshit on it too. You almost wonder if he had a street name like that because he knew court personel using the word nigger would set people off.   Not to mention whenever I see or hear "the N word" it just reminds me of when everyone's in kindergarten, you know? There's that one snitch who rats people out for saying "the D word" or something. But that's strictly a pet peeve.    Bloomberg is so slimy. I find this move hard to trust.   Agreed. I believe the government should help the needy and prevent discrimination. Beyond that, I want them to leave everyone alone.    In that same vein, /r/Sharktits.   Doesn't censoring the word just make it look like we're all afraid of it? We can say the word 'nigger' when we're condemning it. It's a word. It only has as much power as it's given. That it was censored so many times in the article struck me as childish.   Is this a Chriddof video?   [*Woooooooooooooooooosh*](https://youtu.be/W8gLCBEF348)   Enclave =/= temple   They're also too chicken shit to actually do anything about gun laws that need to go away (looking at you NFA classification laws) because then people might stop paying dues. I love guns, but the NRA can go right ahead and fuck themselves.   Odd, the connotation that liberal has. It seems like it should mean one who wants to be left alone to do whatever, not someone who believes in laws protecting equality and social safety nets for the disadvantaged. It makes identifying myself politically rather tricky, from a strictly semantic point of view.   This subreddit fills me with such hope for the human race.   If someone doesn't believe in a magic sky baby, they're clearly bad in the sack.   And a large portion would rather be Russian than gravitate towards Europe. That should say something, too.  Oh, and I believe they already had access to that infrastructure under the terms of the lease of Crimea anyway. I could be wrong.   Nah, that's too reasonable for this thread.   Siezing? Most Crimeans didn't even want to be a part of the Ukraine and wanted to rejoin Russia. That's been pretty widely known since at least 1992. Agree with the Russians or not, they liberated Crimea.   When will people stop trusting Ukrainian sources? They're just as biased, if not moreso, than Russian sources.   I'm going to share that one with him. It'll amuse the hell out of him, I'm sure.   True story, backed up by my grandma and his album of pics from the occupation in Japan: he made Tech Sgt (or some other rate, I can't recall which at the moment) three times. He would often fight and box off hours and get busted down as a reprimand when their unit commander found out. Made decent money at it and to this day has good bone structure, so I imagine he was really good at it.   So Hirohito had plenty to be afraid of.   That's a tough pill to swallow without reputable citations. Everything I ever heard made it sound like the man was against slavery.  Edit: meant to say 'without citation.'   My grandpa had me convinced that Japan surrendered not due to the Atom Bomb, but due to the fact that Hirohito heard he was coming. I was well into Kindergarten by the time I wised up.   I'm pretty sure he also wanted nothing but reconciliation after the war and had respect on both sides of the Mason Dixon at the time. I'm not sure OP is right about him not being a good guy. He just loved Virginia more than he loved the US and saw himself as raising arms in his state's defense.         So it is.   Seems I never heard their Republican anthem either. Damn, that's badass.   Nah. I've got one leg. It's nothing terrifying. I'm talking about his face. It's much more terrifying than I've every seen it on the show. That's a rape face.  Okay, maybe it's *as* terrifying as the show.   I'm not denying that Russia's helping them out *a lot* more than they're admitting, but I think that the rebel movement did indeed start out from within. After all, Russians in Donetsk have been campaigning for independence [since December, 2005](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Republic_%28political_party%29); so it's not without merit. People had obviously wanted it from within, so it really matters little if Russia is helping them out.  Similarly, most Crimeans wanted no involvement with Kiev since 1992. What Russia did there was liberation, not annexation. The people wanted it, so Kiev's opinion is really moot.  With all that said, Russia's play in Novorossiya is really quite difficult to predict. Many experts in the field of defense analysis see them as wanting to fuel a perpetual destabilization of the region, a-la Abkhazia, Ossetia or Transnistria, in order to keep the Ukraine as a buffer state, as are Georgia (which I really wish we'd call Sakartvelo in English, but that's another matter) and Moldavia. Others see Putin as a Hitler-esque landgrabber who will add every former Soviet republic back into Russia and cement his place amongst the Tsars and Premiers.  It's really hard what to tell. He's made a lot of moves in a lot of different directions. I believe he thinks he's doing what's best for ethnic and linguistic Russians all over Eastern Europe and sees himself as a protector and restorer of [Greater Rus'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Russia). There's no doubt that he's deeply patriotic and his strong moral initiatives, however deeply wrong and misguided they may be, show a deep desire to guide the future of Russian society.   My prediction is that if he could, he'd bring Russia's borders back to where they were in 1917. Since that's incredibly unrealistic, however, he'll likely be content to sieze parts of the former Soviet Union and destabilize neighboring countries as deeply as possible to keep NATO off his border while expanding the membership of [CSTO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization), the [EEU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union), and the [CIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) while expanding Russia's role and prestige within these groups for as long as he possibly can. The extent of that timeframe, however, is something I have no projections for.    Very likely. They're already listening to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJcXzoFhBmM), anyway. All three, however, are more stirring and inspiring than the dour and depressing (though admittedly, emotional) anthem of the Ukraine, [Ukraine is Not Yet Dead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzgViS4Rpf8)   But that sounds like rape.   A golden rock god?      Dennis looks absolutely terrifying.   I've always really liked the [National Anthem of the Donetsk People's Republic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL-_S_HH3pw) Many wouldn't consider it a real country, however, which is sort of sad to me.   I thought there was no better anthem than that of the [Donetsk People's Republic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL-_S_HH3pw) I was wrong. What is it with former Soviet lands and badass national anthems?   Well, if you have any suggestions on how to better run this sub, you're welcome to submit a mod message. You're rather quick to denounce us, but we care just as much about quality as you do, I assure you. The problem is that if we go about pruning posts and removing things, we inevitably draw the ire of groups like /r/subredditcancer and the like.   So again, if you have a better system, we'd love to hear it. Shoot us a mod message.    I don't see what's so awful about it. Isn't that how voting in user submitted content aggregators is supposed to work?   Maybe people just like guns? I don't know. Reddit has always stricken me as pro-gun. I'm not all that surprised.   Speaking of not surprised, I thought that this sub being mostly white was something of an open secret.   That's an adequate sentiment. I'm pretty sure camouflaging munitions flies in the face of some treaty or another, but I'm also pretty sure Russian armed forces weren't a party to said treaty.   Anyway, I wasn't aware of such a kill record for the Bradley, but considering how many of them we had in theater and how outdated Iraqi armor was, I could quite believe it.  And you know, thinking about it, a lightly armored, upgunned, high speed tank that could be dropped out of a low flying C-130 to assist airborne infantry in rapidly destroying hostile objectives would be a sterling idea. I'd quite like to see that. It would be much more persistent than CAS missions or drone cover and the psychological impact of tanks in infantry warfare would make it a splendid piece of backup to augment any air deployed mission.  The only problem I could see would be getting it past acquisitions without having them butcher the thing.  Again, armchair military enthusiast. You probably know more about such things than I. Thanks for your service, by the way.   Brigaded as fuck? The submission is sitting on 3,583 points! That's hardly brigaded.   Got any lines for The Master?   If it's getting upvotes, that means someone's finding it creepy. If it's awful, report it. If enough people report it, we'll pull it.   People complained, we removed it. If it ain't creepy, report it. If enough people report it, it's gone. In this way, we can all work together to keep things creepy.   It's fine as a light tank, I guess, but isn't its place in modern doctrine somewhat dubious? Light tanks aren't really a thing. Their role has been filled by so many other systems that the whole armor thing was surrendered to main battle tanks. Therefore, the Bradley hasn't really got a tactical niche available to it that it can really excel in.  At least, that's my completely unprofessional armchair general evaluation.   Sure. This is a widespread and well known fact.  http://rt.com/usa/230707-guns-minority-bloomberg-newyork/  http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/16/listen-audio-of-bloombergs-minorities-and-gun-control-remarks-from-aspen/  The guy is a bigoted loon and his remarks show what I think is great insight into his thinking. Oh, and when you consider that most gun laws in the United States were enacted as tools to keep slaves and freedmen from liberating and protecting themselves, it doesn't set the best moral foundation for gun control as a movement.  NINJA EDIT: Let's not forget that these anti gun campaigners have armed bodyguards and famed anti gunner Dianne Feinstein not only owns a revolver but even has a concealed weapons permit. I think they just want to keep guns out of the hands of common people, the same sort of people who just so happen to often be asian, black, brown, and of other non-white ethnicities. Gun control is far more racist than gun rights.   Get this guy ten percent more votes! Maybe he can summon Exodia for us.   Also, Michael Bloomberg - a famed anti gun advocate - supports disarming black people. OP seems to have misidentified the racists when it comes to the gun rights debate.   And there's no one there to raise them if you did.   Huh. Yeah, it's identical.   Thank you!   Kind of looks like something from Xenogears or maybe Sword Art Online.   Probably worked at a call center. I had no problem with making calls before I worked at a call center. Afterwards, I'd sooner dip my balls in molten lead than make a phone call.

Meanwhile, BMPs are still chugging along just swimmingly.   Miskatonic U! Good to see my old alma mater is still pushing the thresholds of man's sciences and drawing back the veil of ignorance.   Say, did the geology school ever release the report on that lost arctic expedition?   Nah. Star Insurance have been *so good* about letting people get to the game. I mean, it's not like it took us forever to get it rereleased, right?   Card paper, enamel, and bondo in my experience.   I really enjoyed this. I hope you don't mind, but as an aspiring voice over artist I wanted to try narrating it. [What do you think?](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0cN8uXOE2RH)   If you want to be technical, this difference is mostly academic to some Greeks. Indeed, many Greeks see themselves as the true and proper heirs to the Roman legacy. In fact, [an accepted ethnic self descriptor for the Greek people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_the_Greeks#Romans_.28.E1.BF.AC.CF.89.CE.BC.CE.B1.E1.BF.96.CE.BF.CE.B9.29) is Rhomaioi, which descends from Rome.   Shouldn't it say "returned" to Greek control? It was Byzantine before it was Ottoman, after all.   Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2v74dc/reddit_what_would_be_the_worst_2_in_1_product_ever/cof0qlr) thread some time ago.   There was anti-black sentiment everywhere. Still is. The South is just a lot easier to pin it on because it was much, much more visible here and because the Klan was founded here and lingered here a bit longer than it did in the Northeast. That's not to say that the north was free of racism, however. You've seen [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching#/media/File:ThomasShippAbramSmith.jpg) famous picture of a lynching, right? Marion, Indiana. 1930.   Further, Martin Luther King, Jr led a famous march against housing discrimination (again, the main form it seems that non-Southern racism seemed to take) in Chicago, delivering this quote:  "Northern blacks were forced to live in a white man's democracy, and while not legally enslaved, subject to definition by their race. In their all-black communities, they continued to build their own churches and schools and to develop vigilance committees to protect members of the black community from hostility and violence."  [Here is a Wikipedia citation that has further examples of yankee racism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#In_the_North)  Now, again, publicly overt racism did linger a while longer in the South and persists still today in many parts south of the Mason-Dixon. However, the stereotyping of the South as the only racist region of the US is tremendously unfair to the region and all that we've done to bury these outmoded social mores.  I'd like to wager that we've come a long way, at least in my home state of Georgia. We've had black mayors in Atlanta for many years, black politicians elsewhere in the state, many of our wealthy and famous citizens are black, and we also sort of gave the world Martin Luther King, Jr.   But this is all with somewhat scant research and just based off of conversations I've had with my grandparents about the era. While my expertise is history, I tend not to study social forces and racial dynamics as much as I study military history (principally of the US as a whole, the South, and Europe), so I will freely admit that I've got some details wrong. Therefore, you shouldn't consider this authoritative by any means. After all, I don't consider the Confederate battle flag by itself to be an evil thing and many take umbrage with that. (Note: the Confederate *national* flag is another matter and we really made a step backwards in Georgia by replacing our old flag with that.) That's another discussion, however, and I'm willing to bet that my premise of widespread racism is still quite certainly sound.    Ninja edit: wow, that ended up being a longer rant than I thought it would be.   They certainly did in the north. They seemed to have a problem with that everywhere. But they didn't seem to get upset with how much money they had as long as black people weren't near them or around them.   In the South, where pretty much everyone was poor anyway, it didn't seem to matter as much how close they lived - just as long as they weren't better off than white people *EDIT: or pursuing relationships with whites*. From what I've read and heard told, northerners were much more keen on keeping white parts of town white than that. But not knowing any old people from the north, I can't independently verify that. I just have my grandparents' stories to go off of.   Easy there, psycho.   I have heard it said that the north was just as bad as the South with racism, it was just expressed differently. In the South, for example, they wouldn't care how close black people got but it mattered how high they got. The inverse was true in the north.   But that's just what I've heard.    That it does.   I want a prototype Soviet bullpup. Those things look awesome.   Kiev Post  Reliable journalism  Pick one.   Still, it would be nice to see Novorossiya split off. They and Crimea clearly want no part of Kiev and the western half of the country's move towards the West. Why should they be dragged along? Slava Novorossiya. Slava Donbass.   And it's time for me to rewatch another show.   Not to mention that the Star Wars missile shield's efficacy is extremely dubious at best, at least according to several skeptical analyses. It's essentially a feel good tax pit. I mean, it takes the finest minds in rocket science to come up with solutions for taking out satellites with fixed orbits. That we could knock a MIRV ICBM out of the sky - fast moving, unpredictable missiles with variable targeting, mind you - is a very fanciful notion.   Many thanks. And good luck with your eye child, doctor.    Just another day. I've been on it since yesterday. It's not some sort of religious thing or anything, but my girlfriend is out of town and my own cooking is sufficient to make Chef Excellence himself retch, so I decided to see it as an opportunity to test myself and save the money that would ordinarily go to takeout for more constructive things.    It ain't a test of will for nothing, that's for sure. Many thanks!   And not a one of them was built before 1987. Shoutout to /r/RetroFuturism.    It's sort of the era when firearms technology wasn't *quite* fully matured, so we still saw a lot of experimentation and whatnot. Even cooler were some of the Soviet bullpup designs of roughly the same era. (Later, sure, but as I said - rough.) I mean, [look](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/TKB-011_rifle_1963_mod_Tula_State_Arms_museum.jpg) [at](http://41.media.tumblr.com/7a72e28a1515ba0c05c2bc27b8e75a19/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo5_1280.jpg) [these](http://41.media.tumblr.com/47a9c5766f8652bdc6973df59d3a0377/tumblr_mt4turqlda1s57vgxo3_1280.jpg) [fucking](http://i.imgur.com/XJiuspE.jpg) [things!](http://i.imgur.com/OWju4GN.jpg)   I sort of wish they had, though.

Has anyone seen any reliable sites crop up with Donetsk People's Republic, Lugansk People's Republic, or Novorossiya conflict artifacts? I'm interested principally in flags, patches, and medals.   As a side note, I've been looking for Transnistria militaria, too.   To be fair, we haven't totally phased it out. Yeah, it's in a DMR role now, but it's still used.

Out of almost 50 copies taken, I have received 3 reviews. This is actually higher than normal from my experience.  Keep asking, begging, and don't be too proud to throw a tear in there now and again. You need exposure, you have to fight for it.   I am taking a chance here. The link is for Past Jumper, for free, all I ask from you is a review. An honest review. After you have done that, send me a note, with your name on the review and I will send you a copy of books 1-4 for free. Unless of course you hate it, then you probably don't want the next 3 books.  Guess I am on the hook then. So, how about it? Want four free books?       Would be happy to!    I am taking a chance here.  The link is for Past Jumper, for free, all I ask from you is a review.

Send me a PM I will send you a free ebook from my works. You pick. I understand broke.   The Event - Jamie Heppner   It was written with the thought of...what happens if the hero doesn't win?   They are very dark though. Great reads yes, but you might want o start with something lighter.   Always one more.  I'm great at finding others mistakes, can't see my own for anything though. Need another look through? Let me know.   Thank you. I will think on your words.    I have come to expect it. If you even sneeze on a sell-able product near a Reddit post you will go down in flames.    Thank you.  The humor part. Well, I tend to have drier humor, so perhaps I should drink more.   Newspapers. In the internet age, I forget they are still around. Thanks. I will be placing a call or two in the morning.    You should see what happens when I actually do post links on Reddit. I have to pour water on my computer to combat the flames.    Exactly. And that is why I am in /AskReddit   And why I am asking.  With no links.  And why there is a Serious tag up top.     Such bitterness. Are you also, perhaps, a writer?   A failed writer?  I have met that kind of angst from those who have failed before.    I know Reddit well enough that if I start promoting my work on this thread it will be shot down in flames. I am asking for serious responses. As it stands I am getting a couple useful comments. And I appreciate them.  So the question stands, how do you push, without being pushy?   As far as the fame goes? Yes.   There is no such thing as bad press. Pretty sure someone famous said that. Heck...some terrible books have been written by terrible people, yet they sell.    I have blog sites, blog hops, local posters, word of mouth, giveaways, freebies, contests from readers, free review copies.  Google +  Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Goodreads  If there is a place for words, I probably have a post or 200 on it.     Ever posted to books?  I am asking Reddit, people who read. I am NOT trying to push my work. No links given. Not a one.   Again. I am here asking for useful information. Arms open wide. You are arguing the mental state of a cartoon character.   I can't agree more. And I would lie if I said my works were %100 error free. I have had limited success in looking for publication, but the timeline of my life doesn't match the reality of traditional publishing.  I have had works in brick and mortar stores, yet unless I was there to suggest them to others, they normally sat dormant.   I have spoken with many agents and the norm is for every 5000 applicants, one is chosen. Many great works will go unknown because of a simple typo on page 34. The selection process is that picky.    The reviews tell me I have written a good book. The 1k free downloads this month tell me that at least some people want it.   Brian Griffin is famous, I could do worse than to be compared to him.    If I thought I wouldn't get sued by someone for trying to ship a food product, I would seriously consider this as a real idea.    It's a book, if you read books you are already on the right track. What is it that makes you pick up a book by an unknown author? Do you?    Okay, so how is that done genius? Read the serious tag again.    There are literally thousands of great books out there. Unknown books. Those authors are in the same boat as me.    Did I give a link? Did I say who I was? This is a serious question.        My daughter just turned 8 and I am sitting here thinking about taking a promotion at work that will massively increase my away time. My kids are holding back my career and I am fine with that.  It's the lack of money that is going to get this family in the long run. The (Time vs Money) problem will never have a good solution.    Looks like no.   Telus in Trail BC, cookie clearing worked for one click and then right back to a no load. Looks like Telus has a major problem.    I have a free collection on Amazon for another hour and change, I will PM you the link, might be to your tastes?   Need a touch more info...    The first book is free via smashwords, but I can't have the collection elsewhere without Amazon getting cranky. I have tried, they got cranky.      You are welcome for the freebie, enjoy.         EXCELLENT!   That makes me think, I would be looking very close at this one.    It was a sample, an idea, I'm not trying to sell anything of mine.   I have my own ideas, thanks. Folder full of them in fact.   A pitch is for something already written.   Nope, not making me want to buy it. Not even a little bit...   (Here is an example)  It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.   One.   The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.   Two.   His arms stretched out, the magic building around him forming a bubble in time.   Three.   The scene of a potential deadly future burned themselves into his memory, even with eyes closed against them.   Four.   In an instant, a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.   Five.       Metal roof. I am getting one.    clatto verata nikto !    Mirror Thief by Jamie Heppner is a nice shorter read.   What about an e-reader though? Can carry 100's of books with ease.   As am I. Description is the lense flare in just that right spot of a picture. Or the sun just got in your eyes.    I did my 96k in a 6x9 with cream paper, glossy cover, and it looks great. Be sure to keep the font size down too. I average about 10 words per line as a good rule of thumb. You can also fudge the margins a touch to keep your page totals where you want them.    My ego is fine. I made an observation. You didn't like it. Nuff said.  You win at life, please collect your congratulatory ribbon on the way out.  *sprays troll-b-gone *    I made an observation, a valid observation.   You response?  No, you are wrong.   I step down.  You attack again.  I'm not going to respond again?  Shoo troll. Go back to your cave.      Again, I bow to your incredible skills. Or I could spout off things from google too. Regardless, i yo onl sin lik thi i wil soun wron.  And showing me how much money you make? Are you 12? Can your dad beat up my dad too?  Sounding like a troll here. Leave the young ladies thread alone or do you wish to attempt to prove something else to me?   Yes, your training as an industrial electriction obviously makes you an expert at singing.  At least in my first post I admitted I can't sing. Never once said I was an expert. All I say is that when you sing a word and you miss the last letter, it sounds off.   She sings great. I noticed she missed the last letters often. If I notice, odds are others will. But I forget I am dealing with an expert in the field so I humbly step down.   Sorry but THIS is not actual advice at all. In fact, it has no point. Listen to a profesional singer and notice they sound out the last letter of words. It was the first thing I noticed with this young singer and it is a very simple fix.   I can't sing worth a damn. You can.  Only advice I could offer is to remember that words have a last letter and it's important to make sure you sing them to. Keep it up, you will do well!      I have to agree. Over 2 years on the market and even with great sales my fantasy sits at 15 reviews. It's what I like to write but I have to wonder if there isn't another market that would be better to ply my trade.    02 Escape, and no it doesn't.    You may notice the mass down votes...this was on front page yesterday. Maybe playing a part in it.   My son might have been a twin, the doctors were never 100% sure. It was very early in the pregnancy.   I'm sorry. I can't feel your pain, but in a little way, I understand.   Switch the keys around on the keyboard.  Put a small piece of tape over the earpeice of their phone.  Tape down the receiver button under the headset.   Plug a remote mouse unto their tower and every once in a while drag it across the screen when they are working.     Awesome!   Whip or fork?   Mirror Thief - Jamie Heppner  That cat is going places.   I would wait until that exact second where the blue of the sky fades into the black of space. Just be sure to have a hold on something as the gravity will be pretty weak and you don't want to spin out of control and ask the oxygen recycler system.   Links - they make the funny fun   By days I work in sales. And not in a writing field. In fact it's so far from writing it's almost impossible for me to find anyone to talk writing to.  By night? I twist tales of action, adventure, time travel and zombies.   If you need help with the edits let me know. I have some work for others in the past.    You got it! And I should be having another freebie at the end of this month.

 I actually think that the Yugoslavian genociedes of the 90's show that a semi-industrialized country can be the site of a large genocide. That was a second world country, but still more developed than a place like Sudan.            2002 called, they want their Lancer back.   http://imgur.com/VHz5wOj   Seen a lot looking like this in NYC. They look tacky and sad, but I wouldn't be surprised if stance kids and hipsters start thinking this looks good in a few years. With the cost of running an old S class, I wonder how there can be so many like this. I still see some nice looking ones driven by older people in wealthier areas though.         Reminds me of GTA for some reason, particularly the older Vice City and San Andreas games.   I used to think the Jaguar S-Type and X-Type were really classy looking, but when I saw an S-type today, it just seemed kind of tacky compared to the new Jags.         Life size hot wheels car.      Hipster?      Looks like a guy.         Why Phoenix?   I would see it being banned first in Western municipalities, with entire states, provinces, and countries following suit years later. It would have to probably be done at a point where the Tobacco industry has shrunken from its current size due to public opinion and the declining population of older generations that were more likely to smoke.   Yeah, this guy wrote this like drunk driving and killing people is a normal thing to do.   Looks like Macaulay Culkin   Looks like something out of GTA.            Wet dreams      I'm wondering if OP is trying to make a racist joke, all this Somalia crap makes no sense.   For some reason, I only paid attention to the subcompact part of the question.   I would choose the S3 over it, but I still felt like saying the CT because even if it is a rebadged Prius, its very sporty for what it is.   Audi S3, ~~Lexus CT~~   BS moral outrage from people like Fox News, soccer moms, and Jack Thompson who will claim that this game is promoting violence in schools   God   I would like to know if she killed him or just wanted to treat a child who died naturally as if it was still alive because she was in denial of his death/couldn't handle the fact that he died.   This looks tame compared to GTA.   Edit: I looked this game up some more and am surprised that the school setting hasn't caused more attention.   She turned 18 in 2009 IIRC, so before then they would most likely be fake.      Then it was just a parade of square headlights and boxy, gigantic frames.   Which is why I wonder why so many people like W123s and W126s so much. That's the basic description of those old Benzes, yet there seem to be far more people who still desire or feel nostalgic for those cars. I actually like these MBs and the type of U.S. cars that are seen in these ads. The difference must be the availability of diesel, manual, and better build quality.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poser_Mobile   Nothing in that ad seems to fit together right.                  How did the other car look?   Wheels look like burnt orange to me, unless I zoom in. Should have written "Orange and Purple X6" because the pinstriping and door handles are far more orange than the wheels.      If self-driving cars become a popular mode of transportation, will some places just have to stick only to manually driven ones? I thought of this when I was thinking about my vacation to the Bahamas last year. This is a place where the roads are terrible, the rust is extreme, and there probably wouldn't be any easy way to fix one. The roads aren't well maintained and generally don't have any markings on them, the salty island air and heat makes cars rust and malfunction very quickly, and there aren't many people outside of Nassau, the largest city, who can fix cars or electronics. Because of this, the only European luxury cars you see are older models that have been junked, and the SDCs must be even more complex. I could just see a self driving car down there being a travesty that only a rich masochist would try. In less than a year, it will rust, then the electronics and mechanicals will be shot, the road conditions will ruin the undercarriage, and when it breaks you'll have to have it shipped for service unless you live on the main island.  Edit: Most of the people are also relatively poor, but these would still be issues if they made more money or these cars became cheaper.      "Poor guy" is the right term if you feel sorry for other people who fuck up because of their own stupidity. That said, I don't tolerate drunk driving and believe that penalties for it are not stiff enough in this country. Hopefully he's learned his lesson.   If that's your reaction, this is the wrong subreddit for you.         http://i.imgur.com/IXJrmhl.jpg - not my pic.   Hipster?      Bert did it.   I was expecting to see his super powers.   February 31      Lesbians, why don't you just think of men as hairy, flat chested women with big clits.   The last time anything bad happened there was in 1995.   69 seconds in a minute, 69 minutes in an hour, 69 hours in a day, 69 days in a week, 69 weeks in a year, and 666 days in a year.   February 31   You're probably white.   We saw Lady Gaga nude in 2009, so that's been debunked.   We saw Lady Gaga nude in 2009, so that's been debunked.      Whoever made the FB post. I read this reply as being in at least partial agreement with the parent comment, though oddly worded.   It seems like limos don't usually last much past 15 years.   Makes more sense since he is using cheap chrome to cover up rust, which must be 10x worse up there.   he obviously meant armed citizens... in that context I don't really see the point of your post.  I interperted him as just stating what was already said in the post on top. So, I see whoever wrote the post to begin with as having the weird assumption, not him.   Would look straight out of mad max if the paint job was primer.   Looks like it's wrapped in painting tape.   Kiss meets drag queen meets bestiality.   Hempstead?   FNAF in real life.   My boss used to have one. I rode in his once and found it to be a comfortable, roomy, traditional feeling car.   Your right, but the fact that it wasn't released to the U.S. market until 2011, four years ago, threw me off.   Looking at how ratty that Acura from 2002 looks and seeing the $500 price makes me feel old.   Around here volunteer firefighters can put blue lights on their cars to use when responding to an emergency.      It's going to autonomously cut other cars off when the AI finds out its a BMW.   This is creepier than a half shaved sheep.   The V6 equipped Impala now gets 29 highway MPG and is lighter than an old Caprice. Even if this example has downsized from its older counterpart, 29 highway in a full size sedan with a V6 sounds extremely impressive. Also, don't forget about hybrids and electric cars. Efficiency has improved, but I see your point.   Probably fuel efficiency too.   Example: the Nissan Altima of today is almost the same size as the Maxima of the 90s, same with the Mercedes C-Class of today and the E-Class of the 90s.   http://imgur.com/a/mcJqL   These actually look nice, if you're 12.  Edit: I'm not 12, but when I was I fantasized about cars that now look similarly shitty to my older eyes.   Communism delays progress.   Looks like something out of Fallout 3.   Looks like Jeff the Killer.   I always imagined the basement in my elementary school looking something like this.   Only looked creepy in the thumbnail.   I think he's in the middle wearing blue. This photo is from when he was a kid.   It is left hand drive.         At one point it had over 60 upvotes.   and 13 year olds.      Faces of meth   Reminds me of this: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334726/Conrad-Zdzierak-white-man-pleads-guilty-wearing-black-man-disguise-robberies.html      Virtual reality   I remember listening to it while driving to San Fierro for the first time with The Truth.   The graphics, AI, size of environment, activities, number of weapons, number of vehicles, and character customization in GTA has come a long way. What could we potentially see in GTA 6, 7, 8, and so on?   Years ago, my mom told me that she had a cousin who had mental problems and that he might be visiting soon, but he never did and I haven't yet seen him at any family gatherings. She basically described him as a man in his 40s who still wears diapers, eats paper, and is incapable of living on his own. A few times more recently, I used this description and asked her about him. She didn't know what I was talking about.      Salvage title usually means rebuilt after major accident, not abandoned project car.   What happens when someone who can't maintain a nice car gets one.   The background looks like Puerto Rico.      I've seen these types of mods on Civics, Accords, Integras, and Preludes for years, but I haven't noticed the CR-Vs until recently.   Saw my first one about six months ago, now they seem to be becoming more common slowly. Most are first and second gen. Seems like a surprising choice for the stance, rice, or tuner crowd. Usually they have BBS or Watanabe style wheels and other add ons such as roof racks and side visors. Why have they suddenly seen this increase in popularity? Hipsters who want to give a new image to a soccer mom CUV? Ricers who can't find any more Civics and Integras that haven't been salvaged, stolen, and beat?   Looks like what Barney the Dinasour would drive.   Grill looks like it came from a Volga 31105: http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/8136/2799/1600/IMGP0354.jpg      Here's  video of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c72CNTeoYRY   Sounds like someone with serious problems.   That looked like an E38 in the thumbnail.   I do think that our society does not update what we view as being outdated as frequently as we did before the 90s.      Yesterday I was in the computer lab. Across from me was someone who was humming very oddly. I looked at them and could only see from the side. It looked like a long haired young man with a light beard, wearing a striped shirt. Later I saw him/her get up and instead saw the face of a girl and no beard (obviously) when their face was in full view.      Does it smell like cats?   That said I don't see manually driven cars being banned in our lifetime. Seeing as its still legal to ride a bike or horse on the street.  I agree when you also consider that it is still legal to drive older cars that aren't equipped with seatbelts, airbags, or ABS.   Why would I do that?   Do you love it so much you would let 30,000 people die every year so that you can keep doing it?   Yes.  One day we may well think letting people control cars was crazy.  I don't see manually driven cars being banned in are lifetimes if SDCs begin to become common.    I'd like to clarify that by "time travel" I don't mean actual traveling through time, but instead I mean virtual worlds of this type that are meant to simulate a time in the past.      A woman clipping her toenails on the subway.   Sleep         I read this as "Buddy Guy his G55 today."      No, but I do believe that traffic fatalities act as a check to keep the population from getting too big. We need things in this world that result in deaths to control the population, since we can't exactly go around hunting and forcibly sterilizing each other.  Edit: What kind of abhorrent logic are you espousing?  [Malthusianism](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism)   Sure, they may save lives, but is that necessarily a good thing? More lives saved by self driving cars means more people around to pollute and use resources. Think about this, if 1.2 million people die of traffic fatalities, that will eliminate an amount of co2 emissions equivalent to that of a city and save a large forest because they won't be alive anymore to use electricity, oil, or paper. They will also aid in making the world more crowded.  Edit: Downvotes because you disagree?  Edit: Imagine if my opinion goes mainstream.   Looks like what a GTA version of the Mercury logo would look like.   That was the first thing I thought of watching this. This looks like video game driving in real life.   Thanks a lot for calling me garbage because you don't like my opinion, that's really mature of you. What I'm trying to say is that I don't think it is necessarily a good thing that self driving cars would save lives. More lives saved by self driving cars means more people around to pollute and use resources. Think about this, if 1,000,000 people die of traffic fatalities, that will eliminate an amount of co2 emissions equivalent to that of a city and save a large forest because they won't be alive anymore to use electricity, oil, or paper.    Actually, it is. IMO.   I wonder how the Feds haven't found them yet?      I hope this hasn't come to America yet. Hate seeing this since I have always had a soft spot for large Japanese luxury sedans.   Around here the BMW loaners I see are mostly 3s and X1s.   A pervy burgular with a foot fetish.   Saving Ryan's Privates   Is that Iceland?      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dag_(subculture)   Big Footed Shemales 69   There's a difference between justifying a killing spree in the name of population control and being against things such as laws that require drivers to wear seatbelts or require motorcyclists to wear helmets because doing so increases the population and keeps dumb people in the gene pool.      Yes, but I was saying that there has been a loose connection between the two makes for years. I know that the Fusion, etc. have also adopted Aston Martin inspired styling, but didn't know that the design team for them included a former Aston Martin designer.   The Aston Martin V8 Volante was inspired by early Mustangs and Ford owned a large minority share of Aston Martin in the early 2000s, so there is an established connection between the Mustang and Aston Martins.   Earlier today I posted that the current 7 series reminds me of a 70's Oldsmobile and posted pictures of both cars http://imgur.com/a/SCRvS. Nobody seemed to agree with me that the BMW also reminded them of an Olds. I also think that the [Rolls Royce Silver Spirit](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/1982_Rolls-Royce_Silver_Spirit_front_right.jpg) looks quite similar to many large 1980's American sedans.   I guess I can see why you guys don't notice the resemblance, but both this BMW and the Olds have big, fat, split waterfall grilles and quite wide bodies. That's why these two cars remind me of each other.  	162
                               I should think we can guarantee that particular exchange was Mike's biggest mistake of the entire discussion, and yet its' the bit the BBC selected to air. Mike himself openly admits that Ray is the better performer of the two of them, yet the BBC have essentially banned Ray from the airwaves.   Yet more BBC anti J4MB bias, not very subtle are they? Firstly note how the whole tone of the piece so negative and putting Mike up against his biggest opponent in the entire constituency. The whole premise is one of a feminist outraged with the very existence of a party supporting the human rights of men and boys. Plenty of people hate Labour or the Tories, but they don't simply restrict Labour in Rotherham to a grilling by a victim of the industrial scale child abuse there do they? Similarly even the BBC wouldn't put UKIP in front of a panel consisting 100% of Romanian immigrants  Where's the video showing him engaging with unemployed men or all the grandparents (male and female) denied a relationship with their grandkids? They're just constantly trying to put him under attack so he's on the defensive.  Mike also states that they interviewed his colleague Barry Barry, who is now a highly experienced and quite superb performer in such discussions. Naturally they shelved every minute of Ray's excellent performance and even give the last word to the feminist.   (when they went back to the studio after this piece they even named check the feminist again and failed to mention J4M B or Mike or Ray)      Yet more BBC anti J4MB bias, not very subtle are they?

Some studies show there to be more domestic violence in lesbian relationships than any other type. A shame that all these victims get ignored jut so feminists can bash men.

Well the comments have a real go at the Mirror's "journalism" so that's great. Also there's no other MSM source covering the story really and some people only like to read MSM content.  If they close comments or start censoring them then I'll happily delete this post. Here's an archive link for those who don't want to give them traffic: https://archive.is/UEdn1    Apologies for linking to the Mirror and a Mirror hit-piece at that, though it is at least MSM coverage of this story and I can't find anything else.  Obviously the article is pretty rubbish, not just in their bias but also in failing to challenge the BBC's misconduct. However, the comments are well worth a read.                  I was a day out, it was 8th March.   The Mirror is a feminist newspaper (and a tabloid one at that), they are running a smear campaign against him. That's not to say he's perfect, but his party is 100 times more trustworthy and honest than this source.  Even teh headlines is nonsense - the main issue was that teh discussion was about women's issues and thus the BBC was again marginalising men. He'd happily discuss his manifesto in front of any audience of any gender, but the BBC were clearly attempting to stop him from doing so by rigging the discussion format.    as it goes on it just gets more regressive, arguing for greater restrictions on abortion etc.  J4M B are pretty receptive to feedback. If you disagree with a policy area and have sources to back up your case then get in touch with them (and perhaps also mention which polices you also really like)   Pretty obvious that there must be some hardcore man-hating feminists at BBC Radio Nottingham. Anyhow, some good comments on that Mirror article at the moment, keep them coming.         Not hilarious when you're forced to do it though is it?      Try doing the same to any other group and see how that goes..   Well I'm pretty sure they have to, though they conveniently "forgot" to invite Ray Barry (the other J4MB candidate) from the debate with a mixed gender audience.    they are not going to invite him back if they know he isn't going to stick to the format  They don't have any choice thanks to the way they're funded. I'm sure Mike wouldn't have done this on a commercial channel.   Except that's the only BBC debate to feature J4M B seeing as their other candidate wasn't even invited to the BBC debate in his constituency.  100% of BBC debates featuring J4M B feature all female audiences. Thus men have been banned from each and every BBC J4M B election discussion.  There is not a single opportunity anywhere for any man to engage with the party that represents them on the BBC.   The BBC are guilty of interfering with the political process.   It occurred on 9th March 2011. No male writers were allowed to contribute a single Comment piece to the Guardian.  Udpate, it was actually 8th March 2011: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/mar/09/cif-women-only-international-womens-day   Not sure I agree with his tactic, though to be fair the BBC started all the trouble and he's just fighting fire with fire. I think his strategy could have worked with a little more practice.  The real battle is of course isn't that debate but in holding the BBC to account for what they've done here.   He wants to end special treatment at all stages, for example in training too.   It wasn't his best performance, though he was under extremely unfair conditions. Listen to some more in depth interviews with him or alternatively Google Ray Barry who's the guy the BBC wouldn't even let take part. He's a excellent speaker with a huge amount of  compassion and sense.   The Guardian even banned male writers for an entire day, so I'm not exactly exaggerating am I?  I should empahsise that as a private company they're entitled to do such stupid things,  and i support their right to be complete idiots. Completely different rules apply to the BBC, thus making this a significant scandal.   That's a lie, all J4M B want to see is an end to all special treatment for women and for all recruitment to be based 100% on merit. Read the manifesto: https://j4mb.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/141228-v7-general-election-manifesto.pdf    It does mean that media, in this case pro-feminism BBC, sets the rules, but I'm afraid there is no way around it.  Well the rules in question were almost certainly a breach of the BBC Charter and hence illegal. I'm sure he wouldn't have tried the same thing on a commercial outlet.   Well that certainly isn't J4M B policy and I'm pretty sure they take the same view as almost the entire men's human rights community who simply want women to be treated as adults instead of as children as is presently the case.   Surely it's feminists who treat women as children thinking they always need special treatment and dont' ever deserve to go to prison? Parties such as J4M B want women to be treated as adults.   I think there's a real gap in the market that your party could fill here. UKIP have already adopted the J4M B policy on shared parenting, and they win over a lot fo men if they continued to cherry pick a few further similar proposals from the J4M B manifesto.   in all fairness he was quite clearly shaken and upset by the blatant dirty tricks of the BBC. I think the point he was trying to make was that the BBC were attempting to marginalise men and he was just trying to do his own thing and not playing by their rules. I agree with your points though.   May not work if you're not in the UK.   Read the J4M B manifesto for all 20. A few off the top of my head:  * A sexist education system * Almost zero support for the 40% of domestic violence victims who happen to be male * Genital mutilation of girls is illegal yet is NHS funded on boys * Different prison sentences for teh same crime depending on your gender. * Zero rights for fathers, only responsibilities. * Huge inequalities in healthcare spending based on gender, even on condition with the same number of deaths: e.g. prostate vs breast cancer  As for your point about men in Parliament, well its women who voted to put them there and simply democracy in action. Who voted for the BBC to ban men from their audience, I certainly wasn't asked and I doubt the candidates were either.    I think he was just extremely angry at being stiched up by the BBC. he has invested countless hours campaigning, fund-raising, writing the manifesto etc, only to have his biggest media appearance ruined by a rigged audience and rigged line of questioning. On top of all that his party colleague was completely excluded from the only other debate too. It's a complete scandal and the sort of thing you'd expect the Guardian to do, not a supposedly neutral broadcaster.  Update - Mike now reports that the BBC attempted to justify the all female audience based on the fact that 52% of the electorate is female  Second update - **The Mirror have picked up this story:** http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mens-rights-party-leader-left-5571931  **Link to BBC complaints page:** http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/   It's probably based on all the women who give up completely on work to raise a family (and men's tendency to work long hours and over-time).  Edit here's one article making the same claim: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2532461/Why-having-women-doctors-hurting-NHS-A-provovcative-powerful-argument-leading-surgeon.html   They have an anti-male bias in terms of how they run the country and the laws and polices they introduce. The genitalia of those formulating such misandrist polices is completely irrelevant - both male and female politicians are guilty of discriminating against the male population.     They wouldn't need to flip it around because men are already catered to by the establishment: 74% of candidates running for election are men  Politicians happen to be male, but male voters are outnumbered by females and politicians are notorious for pandering to female voters. J4M B outline 20 areas in which the state discriminates against men and boys, with no one able to provide a single example of the state doing the same to women. Thus reality is the complete opposite to what you describe.     It will appear on the BBC website shortly (though often blocked for international viewers). Mike will almost certainly have it up on youtube and accessible to all within a few days.  **Update, it is now up on the BBC website:** http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc3mc   You'll be able to listen to a recording of the broadcast here:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc3mc   Note that BBC Nottingham also failed to even invite the other Justice for men and Boys to the debate in his consistency, so their only chance to make their case was an an event discussing women's issues.  Also bar in mind that the BBC has a legal obligation to be neutral and fair.  You can submit complaints to the BBC here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/   You'll be able to listen to a recording of the broadcast here:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc3mc  Note that BBC Nottingham also failed to even invite the other Justice for men and Boys to the debate in his consistency, so their only chance to make their case was an an event discussing women's issues.  You can send complaints to Mike Bettison, I think his email is Mike.Bettison@bbc.co.uk  His twitter is @mikebettison  And if you're interested in J4M B as a result of the debate then you can read the manifesto the BBC is so afraid of here: https://j4mb.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/141228-v7-general-election-manifesto.pdf            Program has started, Mike isn't taking any prisoners.   **The debate starts in 53 minutes, tune in here:** http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/player/bbc_radio_nottingham   I just posted the link, I'm not a member of J4M B.   An absolute scandal, they're not even trying to be fair now the election is getting close.  The guy in charge of BBC Radio Nottingham is Mike Bettison, **his email should be Mike.Bettison@bbc.co.uk**  Demand both an all male audience for a debate in future not to mention a full interview with Ray Barry before the election and also an apology.  You can also find him on Twitter.  Update, Mike reports that the BBC attempted to justify banning men **based on the fact that 52% of the electorate is female!**  Update 2, in addition to contacting Bettison **I strongly suggest people make formal complaints to the BBC. You can do so at the following link**: http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/         The purpose of the suspension is to enable the rest of the committee to consider what action they should take. They are still to decide on this.   and if a politician just told some nice racist jokes about killing black people that would be ok too?   You'd only need to look at bank and credit card statements really. Such women often flaunt their purchases on social media in order to annoy the father.       say the father pays $100 a month and the mother spends $150 of her own money on the child what happens to that $100? is that part of the $150 or is it not?   As long as spending on the child exceeds the father's contribution then there's no major issue. I'm talking about when the child has to go without due to the mother blowing child support on a luxuries for herself, something that can sometimes happen just to try to spite the father.  It's very simple - the law needs to state that chils support HAS to be spent on things that benefit the child.    the aspects of having that exact money solely being spent on the child is incredibly difficult to manage.   No it isn't, the mother would easily be able to demonstrate that all the money (and more) went towards things for the child.  You're missing the point, there should be something in the law that states child support is to be spent on raising the child. If the mother has designer handbags and 100 pairs of shoes (and no job) and the child barely has any clothes, toys, books etc then there's something wrong and it should be illegal.   Can you **please** delete that link and replace it with an archive. They don't allow comments so there's zero point in giving them any traffic.    child support is being paid, ultimately, to support a child  Child support is paid to the mother who's free to spend it entirely on herself. Ultimately, this woman did commit a genuine offence in failing to wear a seatbelt and thus could have avoided the situation easily. A walking cashpoint father who loses his job is 100% innocent of any wrongdoing yet can still go to prison and could have done absolutely nothing to avoid it.   The video notes that these are effectively debtor prisons and that they'll supposedly take people to prison even quicker than for not paying child support. However, surely many of those failing to pay unreasonable child support demands are also in prison for being poor.  Why is going to prison for not paying child support implied as being OK and ending up there for other debts such a scandal?    That's the name of her party, the "Liberal Democrats" is the full name.   So she just hates males now but doesn't actually want to kill every single one of them any more?   For her to admit explicitly that she hates men isn't exactly backing down though is it?   I agree, just trying to be fair and perhaps playing devil's advocate a little.   The only defence I can think of for the party is that they are known for being keen on due process. That said, senior figures could still easily have condemned the comments voluntarily instead of just burying their heads in the sand over this.   Well as a male she wants to kill me, so there's that for a start. This story is no longer about Noble anyway, it's now about how the Lib Dems deal with this issue and a lot of people are watching with interest.   Please remember to follow some of the Twitter accounts she's given level one block bot rating to for no good reason. It's important that this sort of thing backfires.   What about if they actually kick her out the party? Would that change your view?                        I expect the main reason is sexism against men and that the concept of targeting female abusers simply wouldn't appeal to a bloodthirsty audience, many of whom don't like to think females can even be paedophiles (unless the victim is female too).  They may be other factors too though. For example, most female paedophlies I've read about tend to abuse people they already know. It wouldn't be possible for catch a predator to confront all the female predators in our schools, nurseries etc, nor all those sexually abusing their own children or children of close relatives, so maybe the pattern of offending is different?           I've submitted a complaint to the author and encourage others to do the same.   Male extinction is a complete myth, very poor journalism from the BBC:  http://www.techtimes.com/articles/6070/20140428/y-chromosome-study-suggests-men-arent-going-to-become-extinct-anytime-soon.htm   The stat in the article has been debunked and either complete nonsense or at best a massive exaggeration. At the current rate of change men would be extinct in many billions of years.  http://www.techtimes.com/articles/6070/20140428/y-chromosome-study-suggests-men-arent-going-to-become-extinct-anytime-soon.htm            Isn't this the same Guardian newspaper which got a bunch of left wing Brits to contact random Americans to instruct them to vote Democrat so Bush lost the election?  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1474828/Guardian-calls-it-quits-in-Clark-County-fiasco.html  (a campaign organised by a guy who now works for the BBC).      Well it wouldn't be if the boys had a similar session the following week. However, I expect even if she a session existed they'd mostly be workshops on ho to stop yourself from raping and murdering females all the time.    So being a racist shouldn't be a crime?  Supporting ISIS is far worse than being a racist. Your average racist wants to deport immigrants they don't like, not murder them using terrorist acts.    She's given responses for both in the AMA  Not aware of any responses about their domestic violence lies as I didn't realise anyone had challenged them yet. Also her prison's response was unsatisfactory so she need to be confronted again really.   Can someone ask about their sexist prison's policy please.  Also maybe ask why they lie about domestic violence on their policy pages too.         I can't see the claimed explanation for their pricing policy. A very strange company.  Here's the original thread for those who didn't catch it the other week: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/31ragv/this_uk_gym_charges_men_60_more_than_women_for/      She has only been suspended. so that's still a real possibility.      KotakuInAction is the go-to place on Reddit for block-bot related news. The Lib-Dem sexism angle isn't the only aspect to this story.   True, but it can still be the straw that broke the camel's back. How they handle this is going to be very interesting to a lot of people and I do wonder how they would have acted had the gender's been reversed.   If it is indeed a "joke" within feminist circles then how come there are multiple feminist academics who genuinely want to eliminate most of the male population and are widely admired within feminist circles for their work?  And how come the rest of the Twitter feed contains contempt for men too? Is the entire feed and their role on 4 Lib Dem committees also just a joke?   It all depends on the outcome of the investigation really, though the silence from Lib Dem HQ may put equality minded people off voting Lib Dem too.    This is a single tweet  There's at least 10 of them all along the same lines, and that's without even searching properly.    Caving in when confronted by hysterical Breitbart witch hunts  The suspension occurred before Breitbart got involved - they're reporting on the suspension and didn't write anything prior to this action.  Even assuming the tweets are a "joke", then presumably is ok for other politicians to have joked about rape or cockle pickers etc?   And if we're truly looking at things in context, then we have to include the wider context of Noble's very clear dislike of men and their human rights.   He mentions her too much, but she's worth bringing up occasionally.  The fact that Labour left her out of a document of the history of women in politics in the UK tells you that feminists don't want anyone to remember her.   In defence of some Lib Dem bodies, it seems that many were unaware of her views before this. The local branch have now acted properly (or at least started to process of doing so), as have the Secular and humanist Lib Dems.  The problem is the other two Lib Dem committees - other redditors have expressed concern about previous goings on at the LGBT Lib Dems in particular. The response of Lib Dem HQ has also been hopeless, all I can guess is perhaps they have to leave things to Noble's local party or something?        **This story is currently the main feature article on the Breitbart London site!**  http://www.breitbart.com/london/  774 comments and counting!  also the 3rd most popular article on the whole of Breitbart.   Well with people abandoning the traditional players, they're certainly becoming pretty significant. I know there are concerns about the Breitbart US operation, but there's a hell of a lot of talent in their London division right now.  A lot of people moan when Breitbart links are submitted, but on so many stories recently they've been the only people actually doing the journalism and covering important issues.      Nice to finally  see some MSM coverage of this story. Wonder when the BBC and Guardian will feature it?      Great to see some MSM coverage                              I note that coverage of this story prior to the suspension was dismissed by moderators here as "a farcical non-story" and censored form this sub.  Anyway, the latest developments obviously debunk such a claim 100%. It's great to see the Lib Dems taking some action against hate.      There are some notorious misandrists working at Bristol university so this motion is no surprise really.               She's only on the policy committee so probably not even mentioned as its her least significant role of the four.   As we said before, it doesn't block abuse. In fact one of the admins is about as abusive a person you can find on Twitter!   Yes, but people sign up to it assuming it does roughly what it promises to do. They're being duped. Some idiot at the BBC even did a feature on it which implied it was useful and legitimate.   Just send an email if you want to hide your accent, though in many ways it would send quite a powerful message if the scandal is now getting worldwide attention.   It claims to block sexism, harassment, hate etc, but in reality it's just a tool used to silence people they don't like for any reason whatsoever.   Only suspended at present, not booted out, and that's only in relation to one regional executive committee. She still sits on three further Lib Dem committees (and of course remains a member of the party too for now).   yes but no one is censoring her political beliefs. "Kill all men" isn't much a real opinion or argument, it's the ultimate violent hate speech.  Furthermore, the Lib Dems are mostly quite a moderate party, so she's working for the wrong organisation. if she wants to make insane hate tweets she's free to try to get a similar role in the Green party or even labour where I'm sure she'd be welcomed with open arms.    She advocated genocide FF, all the tweets are blatant breaches of party rules.  It's not textbook SJW, I think we've been quite restrained. For one thing the SJW''s would definitely have reported her to the police by now (and they'd probably have arrested her)   As far as I'm aware, they're not paid positions. At a guess they probably pay expenses at the very most.  People usually volunteer to work in such position in the hope of getting a more senior /elected role later (which would be paid).  Quite frankly, if she'd have deleted the tweets the moment we exposed them and apologised then she wouldn't' be in such a deep hole today and non one would have pursued the matter. She's the one who's left the tweets in place and continued along the same path.   Just hijacking this comment to remind everyone to remember to contact the other executive committees who have yet to suspend Noble:  * http://lgbt.libdems.org.uk/en/page/executive * http://hsld.org.uk/en/contact * http://www.liberalyouth.org/people   Please remember to contact the other executive committees who have yet to suspend Noble:  * http://lgbt.libdems.org.uk/en/page/executive * http://hsld.org.uk/en/contact * http://www.liberalyouth.org/people   30K+ people have read about this scandal, yet still not a single word from the MSM.   Hopefully they're just following procedure to the book so she can't appeal on a technicality.   She's only been suspending to allow the investigation to take place. Doesn't guarantee she will actually be kicked off the committee.                  **NO**, that would be the typical feminist response and we need to be better than that. instead, simply debunk all the lies with facts and expose how sexist the posters are.  If the feminists have any decency they'll then take down their own posters out of embarrassment.         I don't see much sexism at all by MRAs. it's true they complain about feminists a lot and that's fine so you're correct there, though it's unfortunate when either side confuses feminism with women. It's great to attack the former and not appropriate to do so with the latter.      So we should just lie to kids now?  Amazing how sexism against boys gets spun into a good thing. Also I note the BBC didn't identify which teachers were the sexist ones. Did the report say anything further on this?   Many thanks, i thought you meant you'd posted it to her own Facebook wall. Totally forget that the web chat was today.   Hi, any chance of forwarding the link to this post please or providing a screen grab? We really like to thoroughly document every piece of evidence so that people fully trust our articles and work.                        Working for the Guardian doesn't prove she's a man-hating feminist and you will occasionally see good articles from the paper, even about men. However, Bennett was a senior figure at the Fawcett Society, and hating men is pretty much part of the job description for anyone working there.   On a similar theme to the prisons question, I'd be interested to know the following. What is the Green Party's source for their domestic violence policy which states:  *"it is acknowledged that a large majority of cases involve abuse by men against women".*  The UK crime survey is considered by far the most reliable source for such material, and that shows 40% of victims were men, a pattern that's been seen for years in study after study. Furthermore, such studies don't even usually identity the gender of the abuser, again suggesting their statement is extremely dubious and this looks like more feminist sexist to go along with the prions policy.    Defending prison rape? Really classy. How the hell is getting raped in prison in any way the same argument as working in a somewhat inherently dangerous profession?   In 2015 sexist feminists are the norm I'm afraid, and it's genuinely egalitarian feminists such as Christine Hoff Sommers who are the exception.  Feminism might have been about equality in 1960, but looking at the behaviour of most feminists then it's clear that isn't the case today.      Bennett seems to be the typical sort of sexist feminist, something that's all too common today.  If you read up on her background she worked for the Fawcett Society, an organisation synonymous with promoting special treatment and ever more privileges for women (whilst doing absolutely nothing to address any issues that impact men).   I'm sceptical about a lot of these supposedly expert reports, and the most important thing is often to uncover any bias (or stupidity) of the author or research it is based upon.  They tend to be a mixed bag really, for example the Stern review into rape was fantastic by all accounts, whereas the Norgrove report into shared parenting was based on complete lies and has since been completely debunked, with a researcher taking issue into a completely false interpretation of her work.  I imagine this research is more Norgrove-like than Stern-like and at best it only tells half the story. For example it's absolutely true that an awful lot of women who are in prison simply don't belong there (tv licence evaders for example). However, what the various researchers and pressure groups fail to mention is that such prisoners are at least matched and almost certainly outnumbered by the vast proportion of female criminals who benefit from bias in the justice system at every single stage (and therefore should currently be locked up in place of the other women).  Up to 20% of peadophiles are women yet there number in prison is absolutely tiny. Similarly, women are actually more likely to initiate domestic violence against their partner than the other way round and at least 40% of domestic violence victims are men, yet the number pf women actually prosecuted for violence and abuse of men is still very small, and the actual number imprisoned smaller still.  The entire present narrative on this issue is essentially a complete lie. The idea that the justice system overall discriminates against women is the complete opposite of reality, and we have judges openly admittng they'd have given harsher sentences to female criminals had they been male. Philip Davies MP gave an excellent speech in Parliament a while back outlining this, which I'd recommend to anyone interested in the topic.   Not a satisfactory answer from Bennett, there's absolutely no need to single out women if a term such as "parents" would be more valid.   many are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, many have mental health issues  All these things also apply to men, and men are subject to more violence overall than women too. I also note on the same policy page the Party blatantly lies about domestic violence, stating: "it is acknowledged that a large majority of cases involve abuse by men against women".  This is totally false - the UK crime survey shows that 40% of domestic violence victims are men, so the number of women who are victims is 60% at most. However, that survey ignores children  taking the number of women easily below 50% and that's still women abused by anyone. DV is particularly high in lesbian relationships so this amazingly specific crime of violence by men against women is smaller still. The Green Party i lying about domestic violence and then it uses this lie to attempt to justify it's sexist prison policy.  Anyway thanks for the link, I was already a firm believer that Greens needed to get rid of Bennett, and if she's also one fo those responsible for introducing such shockingly sexist policies then she really needs to go ASAP.   Seems a pretty indefensive position. Surely this blatant discrimination will alienate at least  49% of the electorate once people get to know about this?

It is    Love em, they look so surreal, like miniatures. The Las Vegas strip even reminds me of a motherboard    Today, yes. But do you really think the same laws apply in the fictional fantasy world they live in?  Are you also expecting they hand out j-walking tickets and battery charges too? It was just a different time..    I am the Dank Lord, Lord of Dank, and I sit at the top of the throne with my gold and silver laurel of hempen leaves and a regal emerald cloak with brilliant ermine trim and silver lining.  At the foot of my throne are my two most loyal protectors, the great and formidable knights Sir Maxime Le Bouclier, Royal Aegis to the Hempen King, and Sir Eric Faucille, The Righteous Eradicator. Both are inhumanly large and wear highly ornate steel armour in the style of late 15th century German Gothic plate.   As you may have guessed, they fight along side one another as a defender and aggressor, respectively. Sir Maxime bears a great bell mace and gigantic greatshield carved with all of the dope conquests of the Dank Lord, while Sir Eric wields a huge (15') halberd with a intricately carved axe blade on the top bearing the shape of a great hemp leaf. Both bear the kingdoms crest, a golden hemp leaf created using only the most sacred of geometry, upon their jet black tunics.  Beneath them is the Divine Cleric Aitor Laux, the greatest magic healer and sacred summoner in the kingdom. Very little possess magic, and he has been trained from a young age by members of the royal court to only use his magic for the good of the kingdom and his fellow subjects. He does not wear robes because even magic users find plate armour too dank to resist in my kingdom.   Finally, we get to the main army. At the top is General Staffan Auriculaire, who is at the forefront of leading the Royal Aurian Knights into battle. His right hand man is known only as Sigha, and is one of the most deadly assassins in the realm. He is not known to make appearances on the battleground, but will oft be found alone and outnumbered deep within enemy territory, only to return intact and with his mission carried out. He is one of very few in the Royal Order exempt from wearing the standard royal plate armour, opting instead for tight fitting and dark armour of fine shadowmail, doing little to impede body movement while still offering great protection and camouflage.   The Royal Aurian Knights are an order of dank knights recruited from every corner of the kingdom. In addition to the standard plate armour and kite shield, the lower ranking knights wear a great helm and carry maces, pikes, axes, and bows. The higher ranking knights wear an ornate bassinet helmet and generally are armed with greatswords and lances or rapiers and bucklers. In addition to the combat gear, each knight also carries a simple wooden gandalf pipe and a fat bag of loud.           Jokes on you! I had to buy my SLR for school waay before I got into mechs    yikes    when did Hobbes turn into a black kid?    but is it?    don't forget about the mech keyboards though!

This is just a rage/rant post so if you're looking for introspective discussion look elsewhere but damn. I'm a high str melee build and this place has made me rage quit like twice tonight. I haven't really had any real problems with DS2 yet but the bleeding from the aberrations + homing magic missiles combo in the obstacle ridden water proves too much for this heavy armour knight. If only I had the rusted iron ring...     Perpetually in character    "We want applicants who exercise at least 15 hours a week and watch less than 4 hours of tv per week"  Soo like time travellers from pre-1970?    At first i'm like damn I'd wanna live in a modern castle coding community! But then I read the rules and realized what kind of people we're dealing with. No thanks.    lol is this real life    tight man super cool!     Nice design but unless you have a really practical use for candles it's ultimately more clutter.    Strava bike app. I used to have such a hard time getting motivated on my days off to just go outside and exercise. Now with weekly goals and daily tracking it's like ongoing videogame stats and I'm hooked on exercise, even if it's only so there's no blank entries on the app.  edit: grammar      They don't even make it in the colour! Regular guys don't even have the balls to drive a car like that.   I like your style mate. Nice chair and keyboard.

Not so much a curtain wall as it was a fortress, but still..    Pretty sure it's a WoW reference    For me it was "A Dark Tower"   Lol I feel like thats why Dark Souls is so well received. It's a game about western fantasy tropes made by Japanese people, so they kinda fucked it all up in the best way possible. It has a certain degree of familiarity but the formula has also been shook up enough that you have no idea what to expect.   ugh she is the worst type of parent. Demonstrates she's a bad parent by leaving her kids unattended in public, then demonizes anyone who talks to them without knowing what it was about. Maybe that's the reason WHY good parents don't leave their children unattended.    I work at a game store and I have to be careful around the demo systems for this reason. Yes lady, the reason why i'm over here is clearly because I have the irresistible urge to molest your ugly little kid and not because he's fucking ruining our controllers and getting popcorn all over the store.      Love her and the movie. Only thing that irked me was the macbook.   Thank you! Looking at the structure I thought it was waaay too large and advanced for WWI era construction.    Word    I've always been enamoured with the nightlife of the future. I like techno a lot, and I imagine in the future techno clubs (not EDM, there's a difference) will be vastly more popular, especially in North America.   So while high tech automation deals with lots of the monotonous aspects of daily life, this frees up a lot of time for artists/musicians and party goers, leading to a more developed and sophisticated nightlife culture.    Looks alright but to be honest I can't stand that style of character design. Makes me feel like i'm playing a little girls fashion accessorizing game or something, just doesn't fit the genre.

 Recently I met an ESTJ and I cant believe how much they enjoy conflict. Whereas me I cant stand it one bit!  I felt a bit immature that I am incapable of dealing with constant conflict until I realized that our personality type doesnt like conflicts.   Dont get me wrong when faced with a conflict I usually try to calm it down but I dont want to be in a relationship where I have to constantly douse a fire.   Because back then firefox used up alot of memory   Divorce is and was acceptable in biblical times. Not for it. And Whose for adultery?      nope but at least its somewhat of a saving. i actually read the conversion wrong lol so fail on me.   Anyone else buying up flight sim addons because of the low dollar to euro price conversion?   I still believe that the Land we live in should abide but moral laws that are built in the Bible. (don't take it out of context)    Gay Marriage has been legalized in PA.  dammit!   Its a tough call but I think we have to look beyond just faith when it comes to elections. See what their agenda truly is.  I used to always vote by faith which usually resulted in a Republican party. But considering how the repubs of my state never cared for the city of philadelphia school district. Ive decided to switch to democrat. (i hope this was a good idea because partly i debate that wow maybe the school district might improve but at the same time gay marriage could be legalized, yikes!)   What can be done to improve the School District of Philadelphia? If the way the district is now then I have no reason to stay in Philadelphia in the upcoming years.   Why isnt our local, state or federal govt doing more?  And more imp why are we doing anything more about it?   Obama is going to need a break after all these visits   Yea i understand that. And guess what both types are very stubborn. So i think if were both on the same page then its a good thing otherwise we will hate each others guts. And since istj dont speak up well we get the short hand of the stick. And as a guy that just doesnt fly. Lol.   I don't network. :/   Lol my mom also kept me as a herbit so i dont get assimilated to the american system. Its amazing thar I have any american friends as i do (and im thankful that i do -- prefer them over indians any day).   As an immigrated indian who has lived here for roughly 20 yrs... Let me say that i can understand where they are coming from. Because i feel like that now too cause cause india is alot better now and well whats the real point of living here if ur culture gets thrown out the water in a few decades.    Something similar happened to me too. I was really excited to see this one girl. But when i went to their house for a proposal i found out that she is a younger girl and not the one we were originally there for. I was disappointed to say the least. Might come off as a jerk but hey this is how our culture has raised us up. Dont blame us.   nice. seems like you guys match well with introverted-intuitive people. cool.   Maybe and u guys are as cold as ice. Lol but obviously theres someone out there who can work with that. I was just disappointed that i couldnt but its probably for the better.   Im in the same boat.    As a guy this is so true. Lol what the heck is wrong with us!   I'll add that I'm being serious as I am curious to know who would match well.   I met an ESTJ a month or so go and as an ISTJ she was just very hard to deal with. I enjoyed talking to her but she was very stubborn and down right rude and disrespectful. Granted she was much wiser than me in alot of things and in areas she wasnt she just played it off as if it didnt matter (ugh!). Lol anyway my question to you is who the heck would marry one of u and actually be happy?   Me too. I rather read the scripture to get the concepts in my head than care about its linguistics.   NLT, easy to read, yet retaining what the Bible wants to get across. (Now if only I could stay focused)   Cool I can finally chime in on something.  So I grew up with a similar mentality. There is "one" girl out there for you. And you both need to find each other.  I need to follow Gods will. Letting Love dictate everything.   There isnt just one girl. There is one of many girls. Meaning you will find another.  Finding Gods will is not through superstitious signs but through applying and understanding Gods scripture.  Love is a feeling that dies out when life hits the wall. Its a great feeling but you need to move beyond that.  That said what happened to you was that you guys probably moved too fast. Marriage requires work in the long run, not necessarily perfection from the get go.  She seems similar to you and matches you probably well (im going off what ur saying, u have the final say). But she has a lot to mature in and so do you.   Its true that you both broke up but if you love her then be friends with her and work it out for the long run. Right now focus on being a friend/helper in helping her grow emotionally. She has some fears, anxieties that need to be worked on. So be there for her. She will see that you care for her and will be more willing to work it out in the long run. But if she doesnt then at least u helped her, right?        now i can finally know where that darn stud behind my dry wall is   I highly recommend this advice!  Get away from your parents nest and learn to live on your own. This will help create a safe boundary from your Indian parents and help you get along with new people because you will be forced to (roommates, etc). Take that from someone who is about to turn 28 and wishes he had done that so that he wouldnt be pressured to go to India for arranged marriage.  And honestly alot of us Indian immigrant kids are in this boat. We really have a hard time fitting in with the American culture. Mainly because of pressures from our parents, our own prejudices and upbringing.  I kid you not but im debating if I even belong in US anymore or should I go back to India. Because my parents keep us in 1995 india (the yr we came to america).  As far as making friends, it will be way easier to be friends with asian cultures or middle eastern. They can relate to us alot better. But i think making white friends is necessary because they have a charm and understanding of America that no one else has. And its one that Indians need to embrace.   lucky guy   Aww 3 where do I find one of you!   Ibis White for the win!   Sweet. I needed an emergency groom kit for work when you know some exec comes in and i havent groomed up for the day.   didnt realize how many philadelphians were no reddit @_meganlomaniac_  just went to a recent 76ers game against cleveland. first home game win so it wasnt too bad. :)   Just went through this... and am still confused.  1) A variation of how religious are you? 2) Talk about something that's on her bio-data. Like education, job, etc. 3) What are your hobbies? 4) what kind of music/movies/etc do you like? 5) If she is coming to US/uk etc find out what she knows about how to get a job there, etc.  Mainly try to gauge her personality as much as you can. See if its compatible with you.   As a guy that came from US to India for this. Let me just say that make sure you're ready for an arranged marriage. Meaning saying Yes to whoever and making it work rather than looking for someone thats completely compatible with you. I had no idea going in that in an arranged marriage you can have total opposite personalities and each partner makes it work. Its noble but from a US standpoint thats one of the dangerous things you can do. So my advice is that either go in with that intent or better yet take your time to see if you are happy with that person by seeing if you are compatible, can compromise on arguments, etc. best of luck. im still trying to figure all of this out!.   India has produced good tv shows back in the day.  Tarak mehta, office office, flop show, etc.  I hv been living in the US since 95 and recently bought Indian tv package. I was shocked by the # of saas bahu shows. And the comedy shows on SAB were pathetic. And the Indian news channels, its constant yelling of panel guests. Needless to say we stopped getting Indian channels.    It does help but it takes time. I have been going for about a year now and I still have a long way to go it seems.   I highly recommend going to it if you are stressed. Medicine is an option but I would highly encourage trying therapy first.   Therapy is def. stigmatized in our community but honestly our community needs it more now than ever. And honestly. I think its a sign of maturity that someone is willing to go to therapy and take care of themselves. Our parents generation would have been way better off if they had went to therapy rather than sticking it through.  If you want to talk about any of this then shoot me a message. If anything I can just help you relate, I know I wouldn't mind sharing my issues to you.    It will just be another saas-bahu show. I guarantee it!   Thanks for that insight.    Hey man. Id also recommend the advice to go seek a counselor. I did that this year and it helped me alot in understanding whats going on emotionally. I wish I could tell you that I was able to have all the strength to be assertive against them but I dont, not yet.   My recommendation to you is that I am glad you are seeing this at your current age. You still have your whole life ahead of you so right now is a great time to make a plan.   For example, moving out and living on your own is the easiest way to help you get to where you want to be. By moving out you will be able to associate with american friends and share their hobbies and culture. And being away from your parents will keep you from being psychologically down/depressed. So how do you go about doing that is on you. If you cant afford that now then do it after college. But if you can do it now then do it! Your parents will def. give you a hard time and belittle you but walk into that conversation with a mental shield so that whatever they say you throw it out of your mind. You do this by sticking to "i am moving out to improve my identity and my future", etc.   Best of luck. Im 27 right now and looking back at it I wish I had just moved out of home right after college. Right now I am being pressured to get married via arranged marriage. And its not fun...   Ooh burn   So best time to buy oil futures would be now? Or when it hits $70   He actually climbed up that high? Man...   Comcast Sucks   Find a Brook Brothers outlet store. Pick a black and/or grey suit. Get it tailored. And thats it. You're done. Or if you can spend more than 400 then go to a retail brooks brothers store, but beware those suits can cost 900. But honestly the best suits ever.   I've had it for a few years and honestly I would recommend against it. What they cover is usually minor fixes which would have been better to pay in cash rather than having a couple of thousand dollars worth of warranty. So my advice would be against it and just have a "car breakdown fund"   i dont have to.. but i might... but if you love audis then go for it. but your parents are right about investing for a house rather than a car.    Dont do it. Audis require alot of maintenance. And it doesnt cost cheap.  But they are fun to drive. So like others have suggested... Get a b5, b6 and play around with it. Or better yet stick to your honda.  Honestly, im thinking about making the opposite switch to Honda just because I'm not sure if it makes sense for me to own an Audi anymore. I'm in the low 80k and stupid issues are popping up. But we'll see... I love the car too much to let it go but like i said better to get rid of her now while I can still get some money back.   I think you nailed everything I needed to know about the Sq5. Good job! Now bigger question... Why do u have michigan license plates in cali?  	45
    It's cloudy a lot. Seriously. Seasonal Affective Disorder.   God, fuckin' soccer players, every goddamn time. So hot.                                                                                 The bus terminated its route at 8:30pm, and it was the last bus? Is this a true story?                        Plenty of redditors don't like this quote in particular because the arms industry manufactures the firearms that they love. That's part of it.  The other part is that reddit doesn't like religion very much. The pope is a religious figure.  Another part is that the Catholic Church has caused plenty of deaths in its time, and is hardly a pillar of moral superiority.  Another is that it's just sort of obvious to most people.  That's why the comments are so hostile. Luckily, it seems that many more thousands of people think it's a fine quote, by the vote count.            Great write up, but just to point something out about the idiomatic phrase in the beginning, it's "makes my blood boil" not "makes me boil my blood." For future reference.                                   	53
 It honestly doesn't make me excited at all. There's so many angles I see in it that look all too familiar to other cars. More specifically, I see a mix of the P1 and La Ferrari in the rear, the quarters are from a Hyuaraurauara, the front end is from a Marcos, and the roof and windshield is from a Agera and the list just goes on. I'm not a Ford guy but I mean come on, it's just ridiculous. It just looks like another generic rendering to me of a supercar.    Yeah, god forbid you go against the r/cars circle jerk. The OP asked a question, and I answered it with my opinion, yet it's still wrong.   Yeah that's basically it, the 360 and 430 are just... Wrong. They don't look proportional to me. I think the 355 is the last of the beautiful Ferraris.   I can't say I have    To be honest, I really don't know why I don't like it. I think it looks cool and everything, but there's just something about modern Ferraris that makes me feel bored.   Ferrari 458   That's what happened with my CSR pedals. All the pots got dirty, so the pedals wouldn't be recognized at all. From what I read, there's an auto-calibrate in the wheel, and if the pots are dirty the wheel won't see the pedals at all. The only way I could get it to work before I realized I had to clean them, was the repeatedly unplug and plug in the pedals.   That's true, I may just settle for CSRE   Dayum, TE37s?   I'm going to Japan this summer vacation. Is there anything around the Tokyo area where I can catch some drifting? I've always been fascinated by their drift scene and I really want to check it out. Also, if for say there was a gathering one night, how friendly are they towards spectators? I really don't want to be that guy that shows up uninvited.    I wish haha, that still may not be enough    I'm torn, I can either buy brake pads for my 944, or buy Clubsport pedals...   Looks awesome, I've always loved A-Bodies. I've always had the Oldsmobile bug ever since I can remember. My dad has had his 1971 Cutlass since high school.    Pics of the Oldsmobile?   Hi all. I really don't know much about rocketry except for they go fast and go boom. But being that you are all college undergrads and it seems like you've made some awesome progress. That being said, how close are your ties with other big companies such as NASA and SpaceX? Edit: Hi Joe    His shocks are heavy, his wheels weak hood rotted. There's oil in his coolant already, blown gasket. Snap back to crimpers, oh there goes busted solder joints. Oh there goes my 8 gage wire, he's shorted.  He's so fiery, he explodes. He's so smokey but he won't burn out that easy. Edit: Happy cake day!   Knees weak wires spaghetti   Hi neighbor!   I'm pretty new to autocross and racing in general, but if I'm off the line, is it bad to leave it in first for ~5 seconds if it's held at about 3,500 rpm? I feel like I'm putting strain on the motor, but I also feel if I shift into second it's just going to bog down. It's a 1986 944 if that helps.   I'd say Anywhere But Here, I really like the part where it says "So I dropped out of a mile race, a race with no finish line, no first or last place." But that's just my 2 cents    Politics and tipping intensifies    I thought about changing it, but nah   Cage my 944   There's plenty of places that will do ~100 stickers for around $30.

I can only speak for myself--but, early only (and thankfully) I got involved in AA, mostly because I was afraid of what I mistakenly imagined AA to be--a bunch of old men shaking over styrofoam cups of coffee on folded chairs presided over by the Jayzus-cult.  I was so willing and open minded at that point in my life I was willing to try anything to get and stay sober.  So AA meetings worked for me--and, it was at an AA meeting that I encountered the idea of getting a sponsor (mine's like a Big Brother) and more importantly I found the [AA 12 Steps.](http://silkworth.net/aa/12steps.html)  Working with my sponsor and support network I "did the Steps" which is a systematic way of addressing guilt, shame, misdeeds, and my fears about my damaged relationships.  Oh, and I didn't catch religious cooties--in fact I suspect that to the consternation of some in AA meetings when I hear too much God-talk I aggressively shoot down the notion that belief or non-belief in anything or any God-like being is prerequisite to successfully working an AA program--it's not.

Congratulations, friend, I just added you to r/dinos--you were long entitled to membership.   That's great!      When I got sober I utilized ideas that [I summarize at a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  What this entailed was extinguishing old reinforcements to my former drinking self and creating new reinforcement for the SOBER person I became. Early on this meant dry people in dry places.     This would only happen to me if I wasn't HONESTLY trying to stop drinking.  The way I was able to stop drinking and get sober first required that I get HONEST.   Cravings are a powerful desire for (in this instance) alcohol.  By definition a craving is an emotion which if I give into it, I reinforce.  The way to combat a craving is to substitute other reinforcements--like recovery meetings, socializing with dry people in dry places (coffee houses), pursue an athletic endeavor or other interest.  If I don't give in to a craving, the powerful desire will disappear over time.     I am not responsible for my disease, but I am responsible for my recovery,  You got good sober time in the past, /u/saltwatermonkey -- you can do it again.  Don't drink TODAY.   Great post.

Personally, I treat every day, no matter the occasion, no matter the event, no matter the friends who are there or not, no matter who's drinking or not--as one more day in which I will make a decision not to drink TODAY no matter what AND doggedly persist in the commitment to myself.  It is not lost on me that many of you are struggling, maybe even obsessing over this holiday weekend (it's Independence Day in the US)--that's natural in early sobriety.  But if you can win the daily SOBER victory future holidays, or upheavals will be much easier to handle.  Let's celebrate our independence from alcohol this weekend!  Who's in?   Let me be clear--life is not BORING.  Boredom is a common *emotion* in early sobriety that with sustained time sober most of us get over.  My experience is that we are well-advised to be on guard around all of our emotions in early sobriety since our alkie-thinking can use any of these sensations as an excuse for relapse, especially anger and resentment.

Thank you for being part of our community. ; )   It takes practice but I try to never borrow tomorrow's concerns.  In fact even in the midst of a shit storm, if I can find the presence of mind to inventory my exact situation, I can manage pretty well.  I'm not perfect, but a lot better than I was just a few years ago.  It's how I handled being criminally prosecuted for tax evasion, how I handled being sentenced to prison, how I handled prison and the aftermath.  I can handle the challenges of  TODAY, sober.   Hey /u/sweetpea122--my 4th of July plan is to go to bed sober tonight, plan to commit to staying sober all day tomorrow and I will deal with July 4th on the morning of July 4th.   Hey, /u/fr0ver84, been there did all that AND my wife and I continue to recover and reconcile and we are relatively happy.  Of course, all relationships are different.  Don't drink TODAY, plan not to drink tomorrow and your consistent sober actions can turn your life around.  By not making my sobriety dependent on the outcomes in my relationships, my relationships recovered with my consistent sober actions.    The dead-on smart but UNPOPULAR recovery advice is: 1. dry people and dry places; and, or 2. avoid relationships during the first year of sobriety.  Your honest post illustrates the reasons why this advice developed early on in the history of the recovery movement.        Most of us feel better by day 4, although some feel generally crappy for a couple of weeks.     For me it all boiled down to REMORSE.     Here's what I would do: I would not drink TODAY and plan not to drink tomorrow, too--and, through my consistent sober actions make all of the fear and concern about my alcoholism misplaced.  BTW, alcoholism is often defined as an obsession in which the compulsion to drink is but a symptom of our mental disorder.  Put another way, my drinking was only slightly less concerning secondary to my thinking disorder.  Sustained time sober changed all of that.   Congratulations, I had faith in you.  Good work.  Now let's go for 89+1+1+1+...   At the root of nearly every resentment or feeling of anger, is my fear about loss of something.   Good for you.  The nice thing about the 90 day challenge is that the time involved really seems to grant you considerable clarity.  Please keep posting and updating as you go along.   Yeah, most of us with bad withdrawal really struggle for a couple of days.  But, here's the good news: don't pick up the next drink and you NEVER have to go through it again.   I will not drink TODAY in solidarity with you.  Good work, my friend.     When I make the daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what, alcohol is out of my movie for the day.  What other people do, what other events occur, good news or bad--none of it matters to me in terms of alcohol.  I made a commitment to myself this morning, end of story.  And as far as I am concerned there is NO FREE BOOZE or beer--somebody always pays.  The alcoholic pays with body, brain, and sometimes immediate tragedy.  I am not going to drink TODAY.   Congratulations!  Yay!  But, 'Rocks is a hermaphro...?         The drunk in the back of the cruiser is the Sheriff's deputy.                 I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; this is the start of my time off in Cleveland, for the 4th of July holiday and I plan on a SOBER holiday!  Have a great day, my friends!   I lived in Germany in the 1970s and it was HUGE.  In fact the great collector boxes are from Bear Family Records a German record company.   Great job.     My friend, as you well-know by now, I am in hot pursuit.  Congrats on the upcoming 6 years.     This question is not one I normally respond to, not that it gets asked all that often, but often enough.  Still today I saw a very funny Stephen Colbert interview of Eminem on a local Michigan cable access channel.  Very funny, but guess what Eminem was wearing?  [At the link, but a trigger warning as there is alcohol in a couple of the segments not involving Enimen.](https://youtu.be/rVPlMM_aSn4)   Welcome /u/WootTurnt to r/stopdrinking. I like to welcome the newcomers with [the link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is my way of answering the implicit question: now that I'm thinking about stopping drinking, what do I do next?  The Baby Steps are what I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.  Good luck to you.   Welcome /u/BoilerKing to r/stopdrinking. There's a saying in sobriety, no one comes through the doors of recovery doing cartwheels.  I was in a similarly very dark place, in fact at 14 months sober I did a short federal prison sentence.  So this is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober:  [the baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) Many of us on /r/stopdrinking got early traction by doing the things I lay out there.  Good luck to you.   Good for you, /u/turk_turklton.  Keep doing what you're doing.         No.  Marriage equality laws are closer in kind to decriminalization of pot and recreational drugs since each implicates personal liberty.  The GOP thumbing their noses at the SSM is bigotry and worse, is merely pandering to bigots for political purposes.   Which reminded me of this [story from the Bad Lawyer blawg.](http://badlawyernyc.blogspot.com/2009/11/when-you-make-closing-argument-with.html)               The SALIENT point, is this point.                  Great post and comments, all I can add is my best wishes on moving forward and keeping sobriety a priority.               I am so sorry that you are dealing with this illness but the recommendation of Al Anon *is not* a meaningless gesture.  It works.  Let me explain how it worked in my life as THE ALCOHOLIC.  My wife started going to Al Anon meetings without saying one word to me about it.  I could see and sense some sort of change come over her that I didn't understand.  When I did confront her about where she was going and what had changed she explained that it was Al Anon meetings.  Amazed and genuinely clueless, I asked her who the alcoholic was?  When she said, "You." I was floored.  The seriousness of my situation had in an instant become real to me.  And while it would be some time before I finally got sober, I could never shake the message.  In her actions to take care of herself, she communicated what ultimately I needed to hear--the unshakeable truth.    Good luck to you.   Welcome /u/short_n_stubby to r/stopdrinking.  Here's where I started stopping--[the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) These are simple sober actions anyone can do if you're willing.    Good luck.        I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; let's keep hump day SOBER all over SD world!               I have been in far darker places in my journey including federal prison, and the disciplinary court of my profession.  What did I do?  [Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) back to sobriety and life.  I feel like I turned it around, you can you.  Start TODAY and let's see what tomorrow brings.  We will be here to support you.   Have you read the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) When I was lost, the simple sober actions that I describe at the Baby Steps gave me a path forward.  Good luck.   As a rule I avoid "tests."  The only test I need to pass is the one where I decide that I am not going to drink; and I persist to bedtime.  On the otherhand my wife drinks fine wine (although she kept it out of the house for 10 months or so after I got sober again in 2009) and my wife's enjoyment of her glass of wine at supper 4-5 days a week is fine with me.  After I make my daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what--alcohol is out of MY movie for the day.  Others drinking has NO impact upon me, and if it did I would leave the vicinity.  Nothing is going to change that today.   Good for you /u/5tossit23 and welcome to /r/stopdrinking.  Hey, it sounds like you got a good running start but I'll offer you the link [the Baby Steps post, anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It's what I did to stop drinking and to get sober and I share it as sort of a starting place for our newcomers.  Good luck, I hope you're here for the long haul.   Congratulations, my friend--I'm not going to drink TODAY,  you are showing the way.     Some of us experience[Post-Acute-Withdrawal Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-acute-withdrawal_syndrome) also called PAWS.  You can read up on it at the link.  The good news is that for most of us it is not a serious or longterm issue.        Good for you!  Keep doing what you're doing.   Of course, my Plan A is to find an AA meeting near where I'll be.  I've been to many cool out of the way AA meetings over the years.     Have an awesome time, you so deserve all the blessings after the hardwork you did over the last year and half.  I'm so proud of you.  Please stay in touch and remember, almost anywhere in the world there is an AA meeting close by should you need that feeling of being connected face-to-face.   For me boredom was an emotion I had to learn to dispel which I was able to do by finding new activities and sober reinforcement.  I got all of that and a path through the ups and downs of sobriety via AA meetings and activity.   Rule 8.4 of the ABA model rules:  It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:  (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;  (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;      The problem with your thinking about this is that you are denying the clear meaning of his words.  He would not use this language unless he fully intends his audience to infer that they are free to ignore the supreme court ruling that they disapprove.                  Nice!   Lawless, lawless...         [Here's my first AA meeting link from the /r/alcoholism sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/2v573a/the_where_why_and_what_should_i_expect_at_my/)   Every day, a personal best!   Lovely!  Keep doing what you are doing.   Yikes, so true.   There's a "personal story" at the back of the Big Book called "Acceptance Was the Answer" which brilliantly makes this same point in our recovery context.  [At this link, scroll to p. 407.](http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_bigbook_personalstories_partII.pdf)  This is actually a brilliant and funny story containing one of the classic passages in recovery literature.   Yay on 8 days SOBER!  Time to get badged-up and really become a member of our community.   Real peace is an inside job ; )    I've tried AA but hey I'm a queer, transgender Atheist....AA isn't exactly my comfort zone.  In my neighborhood here on the westside of Cleveland, being queer, trans, and atheist might land you in anyone of 40 regular weekly meetings.  So why not consider finding an AA meeting that is close to what feels comfortable then creating an LGBT/atheist meeting?   I can feel this, /u/Sober_Kosh -- but AA meetings met this call to create new and effective social relationships and reinforcers for my sobriety.   I am an ex-drinker and when I recognized and accepted that fact, I abolished cravings.   Well-done.  You know how I shut down the alkie thinking?  When a thought occurs to me, I go: oh, yeah, but not TODAY because I made a commitment not to drink TODAY.  For me it's about that daily decision not to drink, and as my pal /u/offtherocks said, dogged persistence in keeping the commitment.      I think this is a great idea.                           The GOP is not racist, but it's number 1 with racists.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Tuesday SOBER all day!               I confess, I relish stories of BigLaw Firm misconduct and criminality.  IMHO they do shit like this all the time but are rarely caught and prosecuted for the vermin that they are.        	191
 Prefer metric dimensions.  Building shelves between two stud walls. I want the bottom shelves to be a bit bigger for any oversized books, but not sure if all the shelves should get smaller as they go up. So, from bottom to top:  * 30cm, 30cm, 28cm, 26cm, 24cm, 24cm, 24cm, 24cm * (= 11.8", 11.8", 11", 10.2", 9.4"", 9.4", 9.4", 9.4")  or   * 30cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm, 26cm * (= 11.8", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2", 10.2")  [shelves are 2cm (~0.8") deep]  [Floor to ceiling = 244cm (~96")  [First shelf will be 10cm (3.9") up (mid way up skirting)]  [Last shelf is 30cm (11.8") below ceiling, but will probably not have anything on (28cm for second option)]  Thoughts?      An interesting survey. A few thoughts.   My big issue is the first question's first answer is such a rabble rouser - it's written in such a manner as to make your average polled-person in Palestine want to answer to "reclaim all historic palestine from the river to the sea" (words like "reclaim" seem aimed at trying to make this a high figure - and the Washington Institute has certainly been accused of bias before).  That aside:  * 70% of Gazans believe Hamas should maintain a ceasfire with Israel (28% disagreed). * 57% of Gazans believed Hamas should renounce violence (38% disagreed) * 64% believed levels of delay and restrictions at checkpoints were a "significant problem"  Those are your moderates. They are the majority.    The current situation shows the blockade **doesn't work**. It's not prevented missiles getting into Gaza. All it has done is increase the number of people prepared to fire them.   The Israeli Iron Dome is a fantastic solution, and I hope they continue to strengthen and improve it. I have no issue with border checks, but the blockade has banned too many non-military items: http://www.economist.com/node/16264970  * cement * iron * wood  While these items can no doubt be put to nefarious purposes, they are necessary for a country to rebuild.     What a weird thing to say.  Dresden was a crime by the British which did little to advance the war effort. Even so, Goebbels further massaged the casualty figures to encourage the German war effort. You couldn't radicalise the Germans because all the men were already conscripted to fight the war.   You might care to look at the impact of the US-British-led invasion of Iraq, or the US in vietnam to see how ordinary people become radicalised very quickly by conflict.    Just as Israel's citizens tend to vote for more hawkish parties during conflict, so did the people of Gaza - they voted for the people they *perceived* would bring them security. It's not a case of people abandoning terrorism (people become indoctrinated), it's about stopping (or reducing the number of ) new people from joining.   There is a short term and long term problem here - and the solutions to them are clashing badly:   The short term problem is that Hamas has the capability and intention to strike out at Israel (though let us note that there have been thankfully few Israeli civilian casualties). This is the problem that Israel is trying to solve through a ground invasion of the Gaza.  Israel's long term problem is much the same, except that invading Gaza radicalises more moderate Palestinians, drives more support (and weaponry) from other Middle Eastern countries, and damages any hope of a proper peace settlement which is the **only** long term solution.   Now opening up the Gaza comes with huge risks, but it does help to allow Palestinians to live normal lives - provides them with jobs, allows them to make money, and increases the opportunity cost of war for the normal Palestinian - pushing them away from groups like Hamas.    Hamas does have capabilities to shoot rockets. It's a terrible thing. International pressure needs to continue to push them to disarm.  BUT The blockade disproportionately hurts Palestinian civilians, it prevents basic provisions reaching the people who need it. It prevents people working and making a peaceful living. Ultimately it helps radicalise ordinary people to join militants within Hamas' ranks.  I also assure you that MANY people give a fuck about MH17, the Malaysian airlines plane shot down over rebel held areas of Ukraine. I also give a fuck about the current Israeli-palestine situation as I do not see either sides tactics making life safer in the long run for either side.    I thought ISIS had realised their mistake and rebranded as IS (Islamic State)   There'll be a whole media drama over whether King Charles should abdicate to Prince William.

Do I go active or passive for around 250.   I do have an amp, but my friend reckoned that active speakers were better value for money. Thoughts?         A few things to address. The first is that we use the many methods you mention **alongside** animal research. You use the most appropriate method for the question you want to ask. All these methods have advantages and disadvantages - so cells cultures are great for understanding a basic drug interaction, but falls short if you want to understand how a drug will move around an entire living organism.   94% of drugs are not found safe and effective in animals, they are found safe **enough** to move to Phase I clinical trials. This happens having already passed tests in cell cultures and computer models. Around 88% of the drugs found safe **enough** in Phase I clinical trials, still fail in later human trials - so it is not a case of the failure of our models, just the difficulties of drug development.   I recommend reading this: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/01/23/nine-out-of-ten-statistics-are-taken-out-of-context/   There has been some pretty impressive non-animal techniques aimed at helping countries like China remove their need for cosmetic testing http://www.ibtimes.com/first-human-skin-sample-grown-lab-could-artificial-epidermis-end-animal-testing-1576882             1. Theft, by any normal definition, is depriving someone else of their property without their consent - it has nothing to do with the threat of violence (which would be closer to "mugging"). 2. Your taxation=theft argument relies on a newly created, non-standard definition of theft 3. I think many people don't object to paying their tax (I don't - I get great services for it). I don't pay more than I owe - I pay what I owe - for the services rendered. 4. People don't pay more than they owe in tax because they don't get any additional benefit from doing so. It would simply lead to free-riding by others.   Some of the terminology below is specific to the UK  Many large firms avoid paying tax by clever methods such as inter-firm lending and settling headquarters in tax havens. So my idea was: Firms with a turnover of 20 million or less are unaffected, continuing to pay corporation tax on profits Firms with a turnover of over 20 million pay whichever is greater out of X% of profits (based on corporation tax) or 1% of turnover (could be less than 1% if necessary).   This means there is no way of avoiding tax altogether. Providing your turnover was based on sales in the UK (or whichever country we are discussing) you would be liable to tax. You could not fake low profits through inter-firm lending, or such like, to avoid tax.  Thoughts?   Yes, this: http://news.discovery.com/tech/biotechnology/liquid-metal-transmits-nerve-signals-in-frog-legs-140429.htm   We're starting to get somewhere.   In 2011 there was a report of using electrical stimulation to allow someone paralysed below the waist to walk again: http://speakingofresearch.com/2011/05/20/a-paralysed-man-stands-again-thanks-to-animal-research/      Haha, I enjoyed that  "The people who firmly believe in haunted houses are called Ghostbusters or Paranormal Guys.          More about how the drug was developed from GM mice: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/04/11/treating-progeria-how-gm-mice-give-hope-to-some-very-special-children/         This is ridiculous. Sabin, a very famous researcher, was hugely in support of animal research and PETA are trying to make it sound like he wasn't. Read Sabin's own words: "In a recent letter to the Journal (Misrepresenting Research, Feb. 20), Dr. Stephen R. Kaufman, the chairman of the Medical Research Modernization Committee, correctly quoted my 1984 testimony before Congress but he drew wrong conclusions from it.  Dr. Kaufman was also wrong when the said the polio vaccine was based on a tissue culture preparation  not animal experimentation.  On the contrary, my own experience of more than 60 years in biomedical research amply demonstrated that without the use of animals and of human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans but also among animals." http://speakingofresearch.com/2011/02/01/the-monkeys-who-gave-summer-back-to-the-children/   I love ERV sometimes: "If you gave a Foodie with ADHD a LOT of cocaine, and said, Make a movie about food, they would make Food Inc"   The scientist believes animal research is important, and writes something which criticises some particular aspect or shortcoming of testing PETA quote out of context to suggest the researcher believes animal research to not be of any use. The reddit article picks up on those misrepresentations.  Not quite sure how this supports PETA's side of things.            Hidden House Rules - I take Fleet Street   My first ever journal article - not only discussing the impact of the animal rights movement on medical science, but also creating a sociological model to explain the motivations and structure of the animal rights movement.               I don't use contactless cards - but the endless warnings about card clash have replaced the old warnings about minding the gap   No, it's a new problem since you could use contactless visa cards instead of an oyster. So if you slam your wallet on the reader, the machine can take money from both your oyster and your contactless visa card               A good view on both sides. The only thing I take issue with is the 70 million - I'm not sure where that figure comes from but looks to be higher than the reality.   Interesting article, but flawed:  1. USDA covered animals account for under 1 million animals per year. If you add mice and rats you are unlikely to reach more than 20 million: http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/statistics/  2. The reality is that this statistic has been taken out of context. A good explanation is written by Prof Robin Lovell-Badge here, explaining it: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/01/23/nine-out-of-ten-statistics-are-taken-out-of-context/  3. Is correct - and something I personally disagree with, but do not think that being AWA exempt, exempts them from all regulations: http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/research-regulation/  4. This is true, and something I think needs to change BUT it contradicts Fact 1. 1 million animals ARE counted, so if 90% are not, then the total would be 10 million not 100 million (in truth around 95% are probably not counted).  5. I agree that cosmetic testing should be banned worldwide.   6. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee exists, in part, to ensure animal research does not go ahead where there are viable alternatives. In the EU this is written into the laws governing animal research.  7. Possibly true, but such environmental research is often done on fish larvae, where thousands may be killed at once, although they are not properly formed and are unlikely able to feel pain at this point.  8. Draize tests (eye irritation) are rarely performed, and are done WITH pain relief. At least in the US and EU.  9. If you don't test pregnant animals you end up with disasters like Thalidomide. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide  10. Cosmetic testing does need to end. Many countries are phasing out household products as well.  11. Yup - though they don't exist for most research    Be careful not to anthropomorphise animals - they are not human. An animal is not in a testing lab thinking of all the other places it can be. And outside a lab is no utopia.  Inside a lab they have warmth, food, shelter, veterinary care etc. However, they also will suffer (if only from being confined). Nonetheless, they do not have to worry about predation, starvation, thirst, freezing to death etc.       Really it's the 0.1% not top1% http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-31/where-does-real-problem-reside-001-vs-1  	100
 As for "liberating the concept of authority," why muddy the waters? Will you "liberate" the idea of the curve to talk about straight lines?  No, of course not.  But this is just sloppy rhetoric - the relationship between authority and individual or communal autonomy is not necessarily one of mutual exclusivity, as the relationship between straight and curved lines is (i.e. although any line that is curved must not be straight, some instances of authority may also be instances of autonomy).  Incidentally, there is obvious value in contrasting curves and lines when discussing one or the other.  You keep saying that you are familiar, but your basic problem with my position seems to be that you object to an "anarchy" that is as radical as the word sounds.  I don't believe that I have objected to any particular anarchist idea in this thread.  I have rejected some points of view about how one can and cannot rightly describe anarchist ideas, but I don't believe this results in a limitation on what can be described.  The anarchy of the anarchist tradition is arguably even more radical than the word sounds. We live in the midst of disorder, so nobody is likely to be scared of that, though they may not wish to increase it. But anarchy means approaching the way we live together in an entirely new way, which should scare us a little.  It seems to me now that you don't have any logical objection to my reframing.  Instead, you reject it as a useful endeavor on the grounds that anarchism *should* sound objectionable to sheltered middle class liberals (or whoever it is who might find a reframed anarchism more palatable) - not on the grounds that my reframing misrepresents any particular *idea*, but on the grounds that it doesn't feel objectionable enough.  So why shy away from the word that expresses our desires and invokes an appropriate level of discomfort?  Why frame my effort as cowardice?  My goal is to consider new ways of discussing anarchist ideas with those who would reject them if discussed in the dominant vocabulary, because I believe (and here, assume) that spreading true understanding of anarchism is a good thing.     Huh...thanks, I guess.  At least half the words in your post add nothing to your meaning.  You say:  any element anchored in will-to-power will quash elements that are not  Why is this so?  What specific elements will quash what other specific elements, and how is this a certainty?   That hardly seems like a reason to stick with the word 'anarchism'.  "Any car you buy will eventually break down - so why bother replacing your broken car with a new one that can drive?"   The subject of this thread is the language used to communicate anarchist ideas - in particular, the possible drawbacks of the word anarchist itself.  The topic is not "humanispherian please teach train_subject1632 about anarchism, they're using words wrong."  I am here to consider how anarchist ideas could be communicated with alternate language, so as to more effectively communicate these ideas to groups that have difficulty understanding the existent dominant vocabulary.  I am familiar with every topic you just invoked, and I am certainly not suggesting that voluntarism and anarchism are equivalent, nor that capitalism + voluntarism is anarchism.  It isn't just not anarchism - it's not conceivable, as the blanket adoption of capitalist ideals can only occur through coercion.  Why not liberate the concept of authority and use it to talk about anarchism?  I see no particular reason not to, when communicating with an audience that sees authority as necessary or desirable.   You did not understand what I said.  You are assuming that I am using the word authority in the same way you are, which is obviously not the case if you actually read and understand what I just wrote.  Your statement is equivalent to saying that there is oppressive power in allowing individuals to consent or withhold consent without coercion, and to decide what they do with themselves and other consenting individuals.   I disagree, but suspect this is only a disagreement born in semantics.  If authority is distributed to such an extent that any person's authority is simply over their own consent and behavior, that hardly seems different from abolishing authority so that individuals may govern their own behavior (and each others only through consent).   That is a far less bold and sweeping claim than you led with a few comments above.  It seems to me that there is no necessary connection between order and a hierarchy of centralized, violent authority.  Anarchy is not about inducing chaos - it is about decentralizing authority by removing hierarchy.  Authority rests with individuals, or groups of individuals (communities).  People are not naturally inclined to chaos; they are naturally inclined to order.  Because of this, various anarchist political theories are actually quite practical - in the absence of oppression, a set of sane, sensible, equitable social orders can emerge in a decentralized, human process.  I don't see anything about that that particularly implies a loss of order - only a replacement of the mechanisms by which order is maintained.     We may have our problems but it's no where near on the same scale.  I don't believe that it is, and I'm not alone in that belief.  Read some history.  I have a decent education in the recent history of the United States, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the many race riots that have followed up until the present day.  It is quite arrogant of you to assume that I am ignorant of history simply because I disagree with your beliefs about the prevalence of racial violence over the last ~50 years.  If you wish to assert that systemic racism has been substantially diminished over the last 50 years, perhaps you should cite some data to back that assertion.  History does not seem to support your view.    Not a single one of those other labels actually indicates what is radical about anarchy. And, of course, each comes with it's own baggage. We're not going to sell anarchy to people with closed minds by wrapping it in some seductive packaging. If they bought into something that they thought was "nice-sounding," they're likely to experience a pretty serious case of remorse when they realize just what anarchy really is.   I disagree.  There are plenty of labels that capture the meaning of anarchy as well as anarchy does without invoking the negative frame and connotation of that word.  The plain synonym "non-heirarchy" even does this reasonably well.  And why should a person feel remorse, having learned the true meaning of non-heirarchical political theory?  There is nothing about it that necessitates chaos, violence, or anything else that a modern social liberal should find surprising from an ideology so named.  Your rhetoric sounds appealing, from a certain point of view, but I don't see any particular reason to believe it.   Nope.   I've had a good experience using L-theanine to induce mild relaxation.  For nausea that doesn't originate in the GI tract, very low doses of cannabis work better than anything else I've come across - far better than any non-prescription anti-nausea drug.  If you don't already use cannabis, the dose should be incredibly low.  I can't recommend combining all the things you listed, especially the last two, with each other and your SSRI.  5HTP, in particular, is [not safe to combine with an SSRI](http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107 pid=33 gid=000283#Precautions) at all.   There also used to be a time where police dispensed street justice, beating the shit out of people that talked back or were standing on the wrong corner.  That time is now, and has been for decades.  It just doesn't happen often to the privileged middle class people that make up much of the population of Reddit; they have to actively research to learn about police brutality, instead of it being an ever-present threat in their daily lives.   Coconut oil actually raises blood levels of both forms of cholesterol; this article claims that it only raised levels of HDL, which is false.  It does increase HDL more than it raises LDL, and so has a positive effect on cholesterol balance.  But major health organizations generally say that more research is required before coconut oil can be recommended as a major fat source in the diet, because it may present a cardiovascular risk - it might be bad for you, it might be good for you, but we don't know enough to say.  [This article has a cite for the effect on HDL/LDL](http://www.webmd.com/diet/coconut-oil-and-health?page=2)   That sounds appealing in a way, but it obfuscates the fact that one could use different words to impart the same ideas without also evoking the same frame or connotation.  To give a simple example, we could use all the same definitions and political theories, but call anarchism non-hierarchical democracy (or some similarly nice sounding semi-novel term).  It would convey the same meaning, but would not evoke in privileged white liberals the idea of chaos and disorder, black blocks and burning cars, etc.  This could make it easier to convey the actual meaning of some set of anarchist ideas to people who would not otherwise be able to keep an open mind long enough to understand.    I quite thoroughly think that the more egoistic elements of Anarchism must fundamentally come to grief with the social elements by their general outlook.  Would you elaborate on this?  What particular elements are you referring to?   There isn't anything on that page that could be construed as a claim that this "isn't studied in the west because you can't patent mushrooms."  Also, the author appears to have been on faculty at a university in Israel at the time of publication.  Israel is not an Asian country. ;)  So what are you asking us to debunk - your unfounded assumptions about this research?  You didn't offer any statement actually found in or supported by the linked article. :P    I build my own cables from parts I buy at redco.com, and audio parts supply store.  If you have basic soldering skills and you're making at least a few cables at once, you can get the same or better cables than you would have for ~1/4 the price + 15 minutes of easy work.   Section 4A001.a.1 of the DSGL lists electronic computers and related equipment, electronic assemblies and specifically designed components that are specially designed to operate at an ambient temperature below 228 K (-45C) or above 358 K (85C). Software and technology for the 'development', 'production' and 'use' of these computers is controlled.  Sounds kinda like my graphics card :-/   There's nothing to debunk; this is peer-reviewed scientific literature, and its claims are likely to be true (and also quite specific and modest).   They suggested that I be a marine biologist or astronomer...didn't see a hint of military anywhere.   Well, you sure called that bluff... : /   That hardly seems like a charitable interpretation.  You darn libertarian Daoist metaphysicians and your irreverent remarks.   Haha - I can see you've considered the evidence for neurotoxicity already.  You seem to have the odds in your favor - I hope all goes well, and that there is no cumulative damage. :)   That's high enough that you should be concerned about single dose neurotoxicity.  If you're set on doing this, you should be certain to keep hydrated and keep yourself from overheating during the experience, and should not dose again with another psychedelic or amphetamine for the following week or so.  I must respectfully disagree with Quasarstoquark's somewhat carefree assessment of the risk.  There is good enough reason to be quite cautious about doses much higher than 100-150mg, and there is no good reason to believe that it is safe to combine MDMA with LSD, or to take it soon after 5-Meo-DiPT.  The stakes are very, very high - acceptable risk should be quite low.    I have no doubt it's LSD  Why?  Without testing it, you likely have no idea whether it is LSD or another psychedelic - potentially a novel, dangerous one - that can be laid on blotter.  You can't reliably tell by trust, appearance, size, print, taste, nor by effect unless you've compared a known sample of LSD to a known sample of not LSD.  And to obtain a known sample you have to test.  Testing kits are quite inexpensive if you plan to buy LSD a dozen times or so in the next few years.  Even if you only use it a few times, it's probably worth $10 or $20 to avoid taking a dangerous novel substance instead of LSD.   You can actually read the full text of the papers published in Nature that are linked in the article, by clicking the citations at the end.  It's a complicated story, spread across several studies...the short version: there's a source of trace nitrogen in the medium the yeast are grown in.  As for resonance - there's no contradiction, as biological systems are known to commonly produce molecules that exhibit resonance from molecules that don't.   I think you missed the point.  If making morphine were as easy as home-brewing, few people would be willing to spend very much money on it.   Easier than developing this technology, sure.  But not easier in the long run on a $ / dose basis.  It takes a lot of poppies, which have to be grown for months, in dirt, with fertilizer and water and sun and so on.  Yeast are far easier and cheaper to produce: air, water, sugar, and a few days to a week from inoculation to harvest.  If they make an comparable amount of morphine by dry weight, the yeast production will certainly be more efficient once developed.   No kidding!  All it would take is one tiny sample, liberated by one sympathetic (or entrepreneurial) graduate student, to populate every willing clandestine morphine brewery on the planet within a few years.  Beyond that, it's likely that within a few years the techniques of GMO yeast production would be within reach of a DIY bio lab anyway.   The difference between 2 and 4 grams is huge.  For many, 2 grams of shrooms will induce a mild intoxication with light visual distortions, not unlike a moderate dose of cannabis - while 4 grams will induce a full on psychedelic trip, complete with objects morphing into other objects, near death experiences, and all kinds of strange things you can't even imagine not having experienced them.  I recommend starting with 1.5 to 2 grams, considering your situation.  Don't worry - just start small, and you'll have plenty of space to venture into this gradually.   Angry people aren't very good at identifying workable solutions to complex problems, nor at convincing others to change their views.  It seems reasonable enough to me, to be in favor of progressive taxes and also the removal of tax exemptions for wealthy entities.  I don't see any particular reason to group these two issues.  But I don't think your interpretation of Rand Paul's proposed tax reforms is accurate.   Pshhhhh   I've read that after a few days it can be dangerous due to mold, but other sources claim you can just boil it all the way down to a resin. I would assume boiling everything away except the alkaloids would leave you with a bacteria / mold free product.  Well, you're assuming that boiling it down to a resin *would* boil away anything but alkaloids - which isn't true.  All kinds of stuff will be left over.  If the brew contains toxic secondary metabolites from bacterial or fungal growth that occurred over the last year, it's likely that some of these will remain.  There may even been viable endospores in the remaining substance, which could germinate in your stomach and grow out until they [explode through your chest](https://youtu.be/LsD6AL3HJtM?t=43s) and devour all your friends.  Since cacti are relatively cheap, and easy to obtain in the wild in many regions, you're probably better off seeking out new material.   A flat tax doesn't mean there are no deductions.  Part of Rand Paul's proposed flat tax is to remove almost all tax loopholes, which would raise the effective tax rate for many wealthy entities (individuals   corporations) by eliminating their ability to shelter income from taxation.  At the same time, it could well decrease the effective tax rate for many working class people, by offering them a higher default deduction (which would still exclude the poorest people from paying any income tax at all).  Your post betrays intense anger and frustration which, I think, has impaired your ability to accurately comprehend the ideas you claim to be rejecting.  What if you're wrong, and a flat tax could actually be a good way to achieve ends that you would like to see in society?   Interesting...  I don't know what synthesis engine it uses; I couldn't find a schematic and wasn't able to figure out how the synthesis worked, though I have identified which boards perform it.  Any ideas?  I could take photos if you're interested.   **Printed bases remove the problem of logistics**  ...  :/   If you're not here to debate the topic of the OP, leave.  The start of the debate does not need to be a question.    ...in generating a drug source that is self-replicating and easy to grow, conceal and distribute, the work could also transform the illicit opiate marketplace to decentralized, localized production. In so doing, it could dramatically increase people's access to opiates.  Oh no! :O   I understand the effect you're replicating; in my experience, it is present but never so obvious and overwhelming.  Even at very high doses, other visuals will come on much stronger and overwhelm the visual field before this became so marked.   Well, you do seem to have given this some thought - and I certainly don't intend to insult your intelligence.  But what I said about the small chance of you totally freaking out and endangering yourself isn't dependent on your approach or attitude towards psychedelics.  People with perfectly sane approaches and mature attitudes have terrible experiences sometimes.  Some people only have terrible experiences on psychedelics, and therefore cease use after a few tries.  You don't know - you could be such a person.  MDMA is a drug with an intense positive push - it does have some effects that are similar to some effects of psychedelics, but it is really quite a different beast.  It's difficult to have a bad time on MDMA unless you can't tolerate stimulants, or you take it a stressful environment, because MDMA is an inherently pleasurable drug.  Anyway, I don't mean to say you shouldn't do this, nor to be a complete bummer.  But I didn't see this perspective being presented at all and I feel that it should be considered.  Wish you all the best in this. :)   Well...you should understand that there is some risk involved.  You don't know how you will react, and you don't have any guarantee that the dose is accurate.  Most people have a reasonably good time on LSD, but occasionally a person will totally freak out and do all kinds of strange, potentially dangerous things.  That is why it is generally best to have someone accompany you when you first use psychedelic drugs - in particular if the dosage is unknown (as yours is, as you cannot measure the amount of LSD in your tab and lack strong evidence that it is accurate).  Consider the possibilities.  Is a very small risk of totally catastrophic results worth taking in this case?  What alternatives are available to you?   Yes, it can - sometimes modestly, as in the case you mentioned, and other times quite dramatically.  If you're curious to learn more about this, consider reading about the [variable bioavailability of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3189735/).  This somewhat popular supplement has terrible bioavailability by default, but has been studied enough that the causes are understood and can be effectively addressed.      More dangerous than what?  It's more dangerous than cold storage, but it's clearly intended to host a spending wallet - they aren't competing solutions.   :/  The brain itself is about 60% fat - not omega 3's in particular, just fat.  The highest estimate I have seen suggested that ~8% of the brain, by mass, is composed of omega-3 fatty acids.   That isn't true...and it's especially objectionable for a sub devoted to skepticism to tolerate baseless attacks by people who haven't even bothered to hear the argument being condemned.   Awful joke.   Why do you say that?   ~~Plutocracy is a form of oligarchy. :/~~  Derp nvm just understood what you meant.   Yes - there is no practical takeaway from the literature reviewed in this video, as common organic pesticide metabolites were not tested for.  What if those graphs had included such metabolites?  We might have seen inverted curves showing a shift between different urinary pesticide metabolites as subjects changed between organic and conventional diets, instead of a reduction.   I disagree with SugarRush - there is no cause for concern about theophylline.  It has a similar safety profile to caffeine; it is only a few atoms away from *being* caffeine, and occurs naturally in tea and coffee in trace amounts.  It is present to fill the role guaifenesin fills in Bronkaid (to help loosen mucus in the lungs).  However, you should break the tablet in half, or even quarters to start.  48mg of ephedrine is approximately two times the usual dose in the EC stack.  You don't want to overdo this - you can hurt yourself.  Using a half tablet gives you about 100mg of theophylline, as well.  ~300mg is a typical dose for a teenager with asthma.  A healthy adult can take this without too much concern - certainly less concern than a healthy adult taking yohimbe + caffeine!   :/  The video poses a clear and precise question, comparing organic foods to conventionally grown foods through a literature review.  If you can't bother to watch the video, don't comment.   Psilocybin mushrooms don't usually turn a person's eyes red.  Perhaps you rubbed your eyes and forgot about it, or you have seasonal allergies you aren't aware of.  Many people find that tripping through the transition to night-time can turn a trip dark.  You might be happier starting your trip in the late morning, so that you are done by nightfall.  However...psychedelic drugs have a dark side that you can't just avoid.  You will feel discomfort, fear, confusion, and other unpleasant things from time to time when you take psychedelics.  They aren't like marijuana, alcohol, MDMA, etc, which can offer a consistently pleasurable experience time after time if you get the setting and dose right.  Psychedelics will sometimes confront you with things you don't like, through no fault of your own.  Of course, sometimes you'll notice that something in the environment is making you feel bad, like an ugly noise or dark shadows or a person you feel uncomfortable about.  It's good to change those things immediately (move away from the noise, excuse yourself from the person's company, turn on a light) so you don't feel bad.  But other times, you'll feel bad for no apparent reason.  Unconscious fears often come to the surface on psychedelics; death-like experiences are common.  Scary stuff happens.  You can learn a lot and grow and change etc, if you're open to experiencing these unexplored aspects of human experience.  Or you can have some really shitty experiences trying to resist this stuff; it tends to feel a lot worse and stick around a lot longer if you push against it.  In my experience, everything that comes up on psychedelics is workable and good if you can just relax and let it happen.  Especially with psilocybin - it's a very laid back and easy molecule relative to something like LSD, but you do have to let go and allow it to work.  Or you could just lower the dose and trip in chilled out environments when you're already feeling good, basically using it like cannabis.  But that really limits what you can experience of these amazing substances.   I agree.  I also think that it's good to cultivate a habit of grounding one's awareness, and the sensations of the body are a very useful resource for accomplishing that.  Those sensations will be destroyed in time, like everything else you've ever known and everything there is about you.  There's no sense in opposing an experience of dissolution, or oblivion, or whatever.  But grounding in the body in daily life is a very powerful method for working with fear.   There's no apparent contradiction. :P   If he believes Noam Chomsky contradicted himself, then he should have a specific example of contradiction that we could all read and consider.  Apparently he doesn't. :/   Perhaps...or, it may be that you would have had this experience if you had stopped after the first 6 months - it could just be that your brain and body react to SSRI withdrawal this way.  The dependence can happen very quickly with most drugs.  In any case, it can't go on too terribly long.  It'll pass. :)   Here's the kicker though: he said that it might not be withdrawal, it might be that my body needs to stay on the drug.   Well...that doesn't make much sense to me.  Perhaps you misunderstood him?  Then again, a lot of psychiatrists don't make a whole lot of sense.  It's one of the easiest specializations you can do after med school, and tends to attract folks who weren't so great at medicine. :P  Suppose you had heart disease, and needed to take a drug to keep your blood pressure normal.  You feel better and so you and the doctor reduce the dose, but then your blood pressure rises and you go downhill.  The doctor says "well, I guess your body needs the drug" and restores the original dose.  In this case, it makes sense - your body actually needs that statin to maintain normal blood pressure.  Without it, you should expect symptoms and eventual death.  But you are not taking a statin for heart disease; you're on an SSRI, a drug whose sole purpose is to address psychological difficulty by altering the way the brain functions.  There is no reason for your *body* to needs an SSRI to function normally - except for physical dependence.  Bodily symptoms from lack of the drug perfectly match the definition of withdrawal.  Your SSRI is not treating an underlying GI condition, for example; it is either unrelated to your GI symptoms, or it is *causing* them as a withdrawal syndrome.  You know what I mean?  In the case of this drug, there is no difference between saying it is causing a withdrawal syndrome and saying the body needs it; the only reason your body could need it is because of physical dependence.   Physical dependence can occur without addiction.  Most definitions of addiction include an experience of craving, and many also include physical dependence.  The popular idea of physical vs psychological addiction uses physical dependence to differentiate the two.  For example, you could become physically dependent on a nasal decongestant spray if you use it daily for a week or two; you would have to keep using the spray to avoid severe rebound congestion, as the body adjusts its mucous production to the presence of the drug.  You would exhibit a withdrawal syndrome.  But you would not *crave* your decongestant, as you would nicotine if you were dependent on it.   Great article.  But you should review the meaning of "its" and "it's," and their appropriate usage.  Several captions use "it's," a contraction meaning "it is," in the place of the possessive form "its."  [How to use its and it's](http://www.its-not-its.info/)   The claimed relationship isn't quantified, and there is no citation of peer reviewed scientific evidence.  It's not even appropriate to try to debunk the supposed correlation; it hasn't been established.  But if there were a strong correlation, even that would not imply a direct relationship without further evidence (as others have mentioned).   Haha.  Anything that isn't a psychedelic should work, in that there should not be any cross-tolerance.  I guess it depends on your tolerance to cannabis.  Like if this were me (very occasional cannabis user), I'd just make myself a dank brownie.  But if you have a decent tolerance you'd have to dab all day to get that kind of effect, right?  Or you could do MDMA.  For a festival, I don't see that many options; you don't want to do DMT, nor ketamine or any of the other great psychedelic like drugs that don't exhibit cross-tolerance, because they're not compatible with crowded loud places.   There is truth to both comments.   What are some good ways to drop? I want to be able to trip BALLS all three days, but don't want to overdo it. My initial plan was to take 2 the first day, 3 the second day, and 4 the last day.  I doubt that would be enough of an increase.  But I also doubt that you'd want to trip the third day anyway, having tripped balls two days in a row.  Consider tripping the first and third days, and doing something else the second day.  That said, if you are set on tripping balls all three days...  A good rule of thumb is to double the dose to trip two days in a row.  For the third day, double the second day's dose (e.g. 2 tabs, 4 tabs, 8 tabs).  You might adjust this after the second day, if that was stronger or weaker than you wanted.  For example, you trip balls day one (2 hits), trip EXTRA balls day two (4 hits), so you only take 6 hits day 3.   Species is a concept that we apply to populations of individuals that can interbreed and share certain characteristics.  How can a concept suffer?  That makes no sense.  Individuals suffer, not ideas.  You seem to use the word species in several different ways, in fact referring to different things.  When you say the species can suffer, you seem to mean that a particular group of individual animals will suffer; when you say a species of chicken is lost, you mean a particular breed of chickens; when you say that loss is a "loss to the species," I imagine you mean to refer to the domesticated chicken as a species.  Your argument would be more clear if you expanded your vocabulary so as to avoid confusion caused by using one word to invoke several distinct concepts in rapid succession.  It may be an effective rhetorical device in casual debate to slip referents like that, but it is not an effective means of rational discourse.  If a certain subspecies failing to maintain its population led to suffering for remaining subspecies of chickens, of course that would be lamentable as it would have caused many animals to suffer - not the dwindling population, necessarily, but those future chickens whose quality of life was harmed by a loss of genetic diversity.  But if every domesticated chicken were rendered sterile tomorrow, I would not see any problem for the chickens themselves.  Those chickens could live out their lives, and leave no offspring behind to suffer in captivity.  Where's the harm in that?  Who suffers for it?  Chickens that were never born?  The idea of species?   The way I see it, there is no problem with a species dying out.  Every organism will die, whether the species lives or dies.  If a species ceases to exist because enough members die that no sustainable breeding population remains, that is not necessarily worse than the species surviving in captivity.  From a human perspective, perhaps something is lost.  But a species doesn't suffer; individuals suffer.  It may be better that there be no individuals than suffering individuals.   Huh.  I wonder about the safety of this.  :/   But why will the first person to trade useful goods for this currency do it?  Why would the first thousand?  Before people are trading it, it will be worth nothing.  If you have no plan for how it will get from nothing to so valuable it replaces fiat currency, then you have nothing, really.  That's the whole problem with introducing new currency.  You can't rhetoric that away.   Well, suppose that is all true - of course, I may well agree with you on all those points, yet still not be convinced that this currency would be valuable to people.  Why would anybody trade your currency for valuable goods (e.g. factors of production)?   Himalayan salt is a neurotoxin that closes your third eye :O   https://youtu.be/xefyXb5u658?t=3m40s   But for 5 coins to buy you a basic meal, someone has to be willing to exchange a basic meal for 5 coins.  Why would anybody do that?   You misunderstand.  An example of how it might function isn't what I was after - I was after some explanation of how such a currency could be expected to succeed.  If a currency has no value, it will not be used.  You have no explanation of how this currency would ever have value.   :/  Doesn't it seem a bit naive to think that a group of engineers who actually conceived this project and carried it to fruition didn't every stop to consider obvious alternatives before going forward?   Well, thank goodness we had you here to point that out.  Have you mentioned this to the people who *have actually built this*?  I'm sure they never thought of such an idea!   You could just emphasize all the qualities and interests you have that happen to be very common among stoners your age.   **Don't say another word about the theft to anybody but your lawyer.**   You're both missing the point of the article.  It isn't about people leaving the country - it's about people renouncing their citizenship.  You're conflating the choice to live abroad with the choice to renounce citizenship.   Yay :)  It seems to me that psychedelics in general exhibit a kind of plateau effect, yielding qualitatively distinct effects at different dose ranges (instead of a quantitative increase in effects already present).  Sounds like you found the right dose.   Sure, but you just said remove an X.  The result would actually be something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome).  Oh god I hope someone doesn't shop up a Turner syndrome Drow now. :/   Come on - this is not an honest attempt at rational discourse.  If you have nothing nice to say, at least say something coherent.   You certainly can get some like-minded people together and build a new town, and elect your own leaders.  :/  You would still be subject to all the existing laws of that state, though.  You would need to pay taxes, comply with business regulations, comply with laws about how city governments operate and conduct elections, and so on.   That isn't universally true - there are many cities in the United States that are laid out in a bike friendly way, either in full or in certain neighborhoods.  Many cities have protected bike lanes and dedicated bike paths along major commute lines and between residential and retail zones.   Even that isn't true.  There's actually a design very similar to this where I currently live (a city in the US), which affords the same degree of protection (bikes move with traffic to left turn or cross, but have protected right turns any time).   By setting permanent, ideal subsidy levels for the different primary markets, the value of those coins is loosely pegged to the value of the resources and labour needed to produce them.  Ok, this is interesting.  This theoretical currency's value is pegged to the value of goods.  How is that value expressed quantitatively?  In $?   That's an interesting piece of science fiction, but it doesn't address anything I said in that last post... :/   Sounds like the kind of endeavor that can only end in tears. :'O  Better to convert it to a salt and dissolve it in an aqueous solution and plug that.  Poor solubility in water tends to undermine absorption through mucous membranes.  You can easily learn how to do the conversion by searching for things like "DMT freebase to salt".  (this is the kind of chemistry crack cocaine addicts with no high school diploma can do in a mobile home's kitchen, successfully.  no big deal)   So..the truth comes out :O   I would only accept the coins if I had reason to believe they were worth the trouble.  There is *always* a penalty for trying - this is one of the most basic concepts in microeconomics, taught to high school students etc.  The cost of lost opportunity incurred by making a choice.  If you dropped a handful of pennies on a dirty floor, would you pick them up one by one, or just sweep them into the dustbin?  Is a minute of your time worth 4 cents?  To make a rational judgement about this, you need some conception of what *else* you could do with that minute.  I could obtain darkcoin or litecoin or dogecoin or monopoly money with very little effort - yet I have none.  I can obtain bitcoin, but only by spending a decent amount of money - and I have some.  Why?  The bitcoin seemed worth my time and money; the dogecoin did not.  The bitcoin was worth it primarily because other people figure it's worth it (i.e. it has exchange value) and it's very easy to transfer and hold.  I'm curious about your idea of obtaining coin only through transactions with verified entities.  Perhaps this could create some kind of value?  Can you explain how you see this functioning in a concrete example?   I disagree that the exceptions have anything to do with hate speech.  Perhaps this is just a semantic disagreement (i.e. we may disagree about what words to use instead of what is true), but it seems to me that the main point of the article is that hate speech is an ill-defined term from which no legal exemption from freedom of speech protection can be derived.  There is a connection between unprotected speech and hate speech sometimes, because sometimes hate speech *is* unprotected.  But the speech's unprotected status is always due to some other cause; the *exception* has nothing to do with hate speech.   You can do it! :D   The author goes on to discuss many specific cases of unprotected speech that were hate speech, but were specifically unprotected for reasons other than being hate speech.  He uses sets of cases to demonstrate specific general principles used to exempt speech from First Amendment protection in court - none of which has anything to do with hate speech in particular, though they may exempt speech that happens to be hate speech.  The article does not imply that there is never any connection between hate speech and unprotected speech - it in fact discusses at length the many ways that hate speech *can be unprotected speech*.  But it does show how hate speech is not unprotected *because it is hate speech*, because the First Amendment provides no such exemption.   The article discusses this exact point.   Makes sense to me.  Or if you plan to work out in the afternoon, you could delay until then; it's a great pre-workout stimulant.  But I wouldn't take it after the latest hour when you'd be down to drink a cup of coffee (whenever that is for you).   Why would anybody value this currency?  Bitcoin has potential because it has value - many people voluntarily exchange $ for bitcoin every day.  Arguably, this value is the result of a carefully planned and executed system of scarcity-regulating mechanisms (mining) and utility of the network as a cheap, convenient means of exchange.  This leads to perceived value because people have a reason to use the software as it is, and must obtain bitcoins to use it - yet bitcoins are scarce.  If your currency appeared tomorrow, who would care?  It seems like a lot of poor people might have some numbers in an account, and have an incentive to unload them - but where would anybody else get an incentive to trade valuable goods for these poor people's novel digital currency?   I thought the whole point is that they're building a physical space to layer VR over, for example  so that the wall *would* be there..    guaifenesin   If you're concerned, follow the recommended dosage on the package and don't combine with other drugs besides reasonable caffeine use.  That dose is safe for folks with asthma who are otherwise healthy and not aged.  The recommended dosage on the package is probably a good place to stop regardless.  Cutting is achieved by maintaining a caloric deficit, primarily through diet, while sustaining protein intake and a scaled back lifting routine.  The supplement helps you cut calories and work out by making you feel jacked and not hungry.  Its direct effect on thermogenesis is a bonus.  It's best used as a modest aid to cutting; you start to get diminishing returns pretty damn quick as you raise the dose.   Sounds like a job for MDMA.   Ah, well...that does suggest that what you're experiencing is not particularly related to cannabis use.  If it were me, I'd give it another month dead sober to see what happens.  Mild persistent visuals are common and usually resolve with a little time.   How long have you had HPPD?  Have you been a somewhat regular cannabis smoker for that entire time?  I had reasonably strong HPPD for several few months after some decidedly modest psychedelic use and moderate regular cannabis use.  It remained until about 2 months after I quit using cannabis.  I still experience it somewhat readily if I smoke cannabis, but only then.  Perhaps the HPPD would go away if you stopped using cannabis.   A series of psychedelic experiences catalyzed the end of my time as a heavy cigarette smoker, making it much easier for me to go through with a cold turkey quit.  However, I did find I was able to start the habit again years later and become re-addicted quite easily, once the situation was right for it.  So in my experience, psychedelics did a great deal to dissolve the existent addiction.  And I did stay away from that addiction for years without much difficulty at all.  But my experience shows that they did not, for me, remove the potential to build new addictions.   I have some experience with this problem personally.  I've have found the psychedelic experience to be very healing, but also extremely challenging and at times quite traumatic.  I strongly encourage you to explore psychedelics, but to do so...conservatively.  Carefully.  Slowly.  /u/_space_wolf_ has a very good point, which seems true to me as well - whatever thoughts, emotions, perceptions you bring to a psychedelic experience will tend to be amplified.  In my experience, this isn't so obvious and predetermined as they stated; there seems to be a great deal of room to steer the experience, at least if you have a reasonably stable awareness.  For me, having a regular mindfulness practice has been the most helpful thing for cultivating an ability to guide my experiences on psychedelics toward relaxation and ease, and away from or through strong negative emotions like fear and panic.  I don't recommend that you begin with LSD, as it tends to be a little *more* anxiety provoking than other psychedelics in many people, and also because doses vary so widely.  One little white square may barely produce an effect, while another may blast you off into 12 hours of kaleidoscopic where the fuck did my body go tripping.  Dimethyltryptamine, I similarly don't recommend at first, because few people possess the equipment and expertise to reliably deliver accurate doses.  If you use DMT a few times, you're likely to have at least one unbearably strong experience, which could easily turn you off from this wonderful substance for life.  Better to wait until you've got comfortable with...  Psilocybin mushrooms!  These are, without a doubt, an excellent beginning for the anxiety prone would-be psychonaut.  Buy a bunch of them (1/2 oz or so), and start by taking 1.5 grams boiled into a tea, in a comfortable setting with no responsibilities or possibilities for interruption that day.  In all likelihood 1.5 grams will do very, very little to you.  So next week, try 2 grams.  Keep upping the dose by .5 as you feel comfortable, but never dose more than once a week.  Most people have some kind of interesting experience by the time they hit 2.5 grams, and some actually trip fairly intensely at that dose.  By the time you reach 3.5 grams almost anybody would be full-on tripping.  You don't ever have to go that far to get a lot out of shrooms, especially if your intent is some kind of introspective growth process.  I hope this is helpful.  Psychedelics have an incredible potential to help transform anxiety, depression, trauma, and all kinds of mental and emotional afflictions.  But they can also burn you if you approach them in a naive or careless way.  By starting slow and choosing a predictable, easy to dose psychedelic, you can ease into the experience at a comfortable pace.  No need to dive in head-first. :)  edit:  Some people insist that new psychedelic users dose with a friend or sitter.  I personally think this is insensitive advice when given to introverted or socially anxious people (whether that describes you, I do not know).  There is no harm in tripping alone, so long as you dose responsibly and ensure that your environment is safe.   Hello!  I have a Kurzweil Ensemble Grand Mark II that I've decided to pillage the keyboard from to convert to a standalone MIDI controller.  I hate to see the rest of the instrument go to waste, and am offering all parts except the keyboard and the board that generates the MIDI signal for whatever it costs to ship +$10 per shipment (e.g. if you're in the US, you could have all the boards and transformers for $10 + a first class parcel and a priority flat rate box).  The instrument plays fine, but some patches won't activate.  I believe all the circuits are in good working order but can't guarantee anything.  If you can think of a better place to post this, please let me know. :)   It seems to work fairly well for the state... :/  	104
 Out of juice for a few weeks, won't have the money for more until the first. Can anyone help me out?   I would replace it if you don't mind driving an older car. I wish I would have done that with my Sebring instead of getting my mazda   I've only found a hammer of God at one store, but the Buddha zephyr is pretty popular. There's also the fat Buddha which is geared more for flavor builds and there's the mangala which is a short version of the Buddha. All the parts for those 3 RDA's are interchangeable too which is nice.   Well I'll hit it for a good 4 or 5 usually, the awesome thing about royal wire is it heats up super fast but it takes forever to get too hot. I've used a ton of different wires and royal is my favorite by far. If you build you should try it out!   Better than I expected honestly. I mean a higher resistance would be better but I'm completely satisfied. It's a bit warm but its not bad.    My favorite build is the hammer of God box mod with the Buddha zephyr. The Buddha has a MASSIVE chuff cap and handles heat realllyyyyy well, and the deck has deep juice wells. Also, tons of building space. I run 4 vtc5 batteries in the mod but vtc4s are pretty fantastic too. I get a bit less flavor but the clouds are just massive. I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I've got a .03 ohm build on it and it's never been even remotely a problem. All together it cost me about 300 dollars.  My build is a 6 wrap dual parallel 20g royal wire, so lots of surface area with a super low resistance wire. Flawless on every front. I've been in 4 cloud comps with it and never lost one. It outperforms my 26650 el diablo mod with the mephisto rda which costed me 350 dollars not counting batteries, wire, and cotton.   I think I'd be too tempted to fire it...   It just seems to be the common consensus from the people I've asked. Do you know the other things that will be required after engine replacement.?   I've heard the head gasket goes out faster after you fix it, so for the same money I can swap the engine and solve the problem for a lot longer... Right? Is it true that the head gasket wears out faster after repairing it?      /r/outside   Don't invoke the holy.... Spirit....   Gay + Gay if you will   Lol sorry if it was too vague. Just caught my attention and I got a kick out of it.   She looks like she's crying..?   That escalated quickly...   Like what are the implications of that though? What can that do? This Atty is made of spare parts from destroyed zephyrs my friends have given me so I'm not too worried about it   Guys calm down. The houses are just reeeaaaallllyyyy nice   Did that. Did not work. What happens if they touch? Lol   Pretty sure the insulator melted      Grandma is died   Time to unsubscribe from this sub lol.   "And that was when I quit my job"   Gonna be honest here, I run .04 on a 4 battery box mod in my buddha for competitions. Have been for about 3 months now. Never had a bit of trouble.      Know anywhere I can buy a drop bear helmet??  	27
 I just moved to Provo from Massachusetts, and am also not LDS. I live in BYU housing, and will go to LDS services with my roommates (for socializing). I've had no real problems. Everyone is nice, understands I'm not a member (if they know me, that is), and generally don't try to proselytize me as I have my own faith.  That said, I do like it here, as an outsider. There are plenty of events going on at BYU or UVU, and there's a good stream of local musicians doing shows downtown.   If you drink, there aren't that many bars around, so you'll have to get used to that.   It's good to see some bipartisan work on this. The issues that the PA office had are pretty shocking, like the changing of dates for visitations. I'm inclined to believe the issues are more a regional thing than a system-wide thing, but only further investigation will tell.      Lawyers and lobbyists can make that much, depending on the firm or group you work for.  And of course, medical professionals have that earning potential as well.   Right time, right place is always key.  I recently lost a job with AmeriCoprs in Wyoming where I helped a non-profit doing communications and outreach for their homeless veterans program. After I lost the job, I moved to Utah, and applied for a few other AmeriCrops positions (as I was actually placed on administrative leave, which allowed me two weeks to find a new AmeriCorps position before I was officially let go from the program). I found a veteran mentoring program with AmeriCorps contracted through the Red Cross, so I applied. This was three months ago, and only last week did I get a call back, and then only today (as an of an hour ago) did I finish up an interview for the position.  The fact that the position exists in the current city I just moved to is pure luck. And the fact that the position aligns up with a job I just recently had, is also pure luck.   It's the exact same as his. He was my inspiration for it :)  And thanks for the input.    So the baby boomers blame Millennials for believing the report, or blame them because it was published?   That does make sense though.    Can you explain how baby boomers made millennials racist and skeptical of vaccines?     The Paul's have been okay at grabbing the attention of the youth.   Thank you :) Those are my favorites as well.    Went out with a photographer. Got 27 pictures that are somewhat usable. A few of them aren't very flattering...but let me know which ones work:  [Link](http://imgur.com/p1l5gFr,VolDP1F,MARYbql,OXay3Hj,AwXzu57,o1gtk3L,PkiRDUN,Of7e3Br,EY4JghD,soaTv5T,wJ1drOl,2cqKQrK,Nqyn1LV,CqMLBXv,Etdo762,nskxSTF,TFETp2g,WOqAvJJ,01NLeam,W3uGwl0,OAIKiHK,6G0F8WQ,m8qNWm7,zm0lUhE,0EKb2X4,8NcyYVt,Ekwnq0P)   US intelligence and Mexican authorities will collaborate on raids, on occasion.    First dates are destined to be awkward. Maybe the second and third as well. After that the ball is your court.   Also, no, I dont have this problem.    My suggestion is to make smoke signals.    Maybe you have an unknown twin out there.   Alcoholic   Fahk you, Havahd's bettah  Signed,  An angry Masshole   **I spend a lot of time thinking about**  Secret societies   Switching jobs. If my interview goes well...  Currently in a call center. Not very fun. Please help.    I usually follow them home.    Provo, Utah. It's. So. Cheap.   Also, Google Fiber  lt;3  Also, Mormons! They are a pretty people.    Interview with the Red Cross coming up on Wednesday. It's the exact job I've always wanted (working with military families). It's part time, so it'll be struggle to find complimentary work alongside it, but boy am I exicted.    There's no such thing as too few. Start small, grow large. Build a presence in your neighborhood, and grow from there.   Could have met someone, moved, had something come up, etc. Life can get crazy. This is why you get the number early though, generally.   Love most of your pictures. They radiate confidence.    I switched from analogs to an e-cig and it's absolutely great. Highly recommend the change.  You won't smell, you'll maybe save money (depending on what mods you buy and so on), there's no fire hazard, and you don't litter!    I believe this applies to Japan as well, where the Emperor is just there for ceremonial reasons. He holds no real power, thanks to the US.      Agreed. I like this photo. Very colorful, bright. Has a certain time to it that's kind of nice.    It's not like they have much power (in the UK). They're just there for show.    True, but if they didn't attack Hillary for being with Bill then that'd clear the way for Bush to move forward a little better.    Personally, I find it interesting how all a lot of GOP voters seem to be already against Bush, despite Bush's track record as governor. The dynasty concern seems to be really bothing a lot of them.      The most facisinating thing about this is some states like North Carolina are offering compensation for such victims, and the big question is "How much is the ability to reproduce worth?" How on earth do you put a number on that? How much is enough to apologize for such a mistake?  NPR strory on the compensation program  http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/10/31/360355784/payments-start-for-n-c-eugenics-victims-but-many-wont-qualify   I think I may be getting a job with the Red Cross. Super exciting! It's only part time, but it should be worth it.   Probably few to none. The only ones that would most likely be present would be American defectors, of which there are already barely any already (I think there's only this guy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Dresnok#Other_defectors_to_North_Korea)   I needed something which allowed for more independent thought, so I went from Mormon to Quaker.    As a Friend, I appreciate the mention of the AFSC! They really are awesome.    I believe there have been much, much, worse. Scalia wasn't around when we threw the Japanese in camps.     Thanks for posting.   The rituals generally relate to God, brotherhood, and unity. Can't go into detail due to the fact we swear an oath not to dispel the secrets of the craft.   Charity for various causes. One of the main one is the Shriners, who are a part of Freemasonry. They do hospices for youth.  My own lodge ran a summer camp for girls.   Also, /r/freemasonry exists :)   Freemason here.   We are a fraternity of men who do charity work, preform rituals, and try to better ourselves as men. Not much else to it.    Seems like they have chances to me:  https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zYw5SbHYVKBM.kLaJN-znQs40  Any thoughts on the map?     I'm nearing the end, and it's been okay so far. There are some great scenes, and a few sluggish parts. The thing about the book is that it's a micro-view of a larger event by zooming in on a single town and a few characters while the whole country fights off a disease. Similar concept to *The Leftovers* if you're familiar with that.     The difference is what the defiance does, and what it stands for. It's one thing to trash the HQ of the IRS, FBI, the local police station or whatever, and it's another thing go looting Macy's and your local liquor store.   If these rioters were choosing meaningful targets, and not their local community, then we'd be having a different dialogue. Look at the LA riots and what that accomplished; it's the same thing here.       **The Executioner's Song, by Norman Mailer**  Having just moved to Utah, I'm excited to dive into this, especially concidering Utah's recent legal rulings on allowing death by firing squad for capital punishment.    Seconded. I had a polisci teacher who started off the class by mentioniung his political biases (he was a Marxist), and kept that known throughout class by mentioning it on occassion. All teachers should do this when it comes to politics/econ, etc.   The fact that I'm not preached to, am considered an equal, and need to not follow any doctrine but the ones I personally subscribe to.     I agree. I was trying to explain the argument since the other user said they didn't understand.    This is also a factor in your confusion (different understanding of word usage), but I think I made their argument clear. I was just trying to explain what they were saying, since you said you don't understand (not that I blame you, it can be a hard concept to grasp).   If anything isn't understandable, let me know. I don't really have a horse in this race, but I do think the other user's argument deserves to be made clearly to those who don't get it.    I think their point is that the distinction between the two words can look off. In nearly all else in the world, you wouldn't call someone moving into another land a settler, as you'd rather refer to them as an immigrant. Even in other places of illegal or perhaps "wrongful" movement of persons the word settler still isn't really used. For example, Mexicans crossing over the American border illegally aren't called settlers, but rather illegal immigrants, or aliens. Using the term settler in that case would feel a bit odd (or might not, depending on where you learned English).   I think it really depends on how you view the connotation of the word, hence your confusion as to what they mean, and their different definition.       If you have iOS, try BookBuddy. Holds a limited number of books for free, and once you get past a certain number (one hundred, I think), you have to get the paid version.    Massachusetts: We have funny accents sometimes    Is the offer legit? I'd be willing to take it.    One hour train ride to work with headphones, a drink of coffee, and a scenic route of Utah's beauty. This is my habit!   Seconded. One of the most well written books I have ever read.    Reminds me of my blind friend I recently met. We were crossing the parking lot to get to my car and had to walk over some rocks to get there. I walked across no issue, and my friend, upon feeling the rocks with his cane, giggled in excitement. He had a blast climbing over them (I didn't care enough to help, feeling confident in his abilities) saying most people wouldn't let him do such a thing due to fear of him hurting himself.    *Shop of the Lin Family* by Mao Dun. Taught me everything I needed to know about revolutions, capitalism, and China, all in less than sixty pages.    What's a minister?  (#)NoReligiousAuthority   (#)Quakers   Browsing the book store is where I get my fix. If something catches my I, I'll gloss over it and buy it. I might look up reviews quickly.    I see a similar sign over by the CenturyLink building. I'd take the job...if there was a contact listing.    Into the Wild. Really did a number on me as a teenager.    I'll get back to you in a month, ha! How long did it take you to finish?   Recently picked up the book for cheap, but boy is it long. Is it worth the journey?   **The Last Town On Earth, by Thomas Mullen**   Very interesting take on the 1918 epidemic we seem to forget ever happened. Heavy socialist/pacifist themes abound.    Gardening groups and language classes could be fun.    Take your favorite political book and condense it's ideas down to your speech (while also adding your own take).    Does that happen? I was thinking of In Cold Blood!   Correct!   Went to LDS services with my roommates. It was a little uncomfortable, but still somewhat enjoyable.    Two guys kill a whole family, rocking a quiet, small town.    Is it similar in style to Tina Fey's *Bossypants* (assuming you've read that as well)?   *Of Mice and Men* or *Cannery Row*, both by Steinbeck.    The Fall - Camus   I had no idea about this! Thank you for the suggestion!   Ah, must be a state by state thing. There are records of blank ballots for my home state Massachusetts.     Hello all,  I'm after any Library of America collection editions of any authors. Preferably, I'm after Philip K Dick or Ralph Waldo Emerson, but I'm open to any authors. I absolutely love how LOA organizes several stories/writings/books into one, and highly enjoy how they look on my bookshelf.  Willing to buy outright or trade from my limited collection.     Best Coast is absolutely necessary for a good summer. Their music is perfect for sunny days.   I joined for the same reasons. Have since switched denominations, but I sympathize heavily with that view.   It might not make it to the press, but the amount of votes any candidate gets is public record (in the US) including blank ballots.    Yes, and I've run for office before. Your vote sends a message when you vote outside of major parties.    Seconded. I'm between SLC and Provo and haven't had an issue.     A lot of customers use it for very basic things like email, and only email. You'd be surprised. We want to make sure that you're getting a higher speed for good reasons.    My best bet is they were trying to gauge whether you use things that require a lot of data usage (Netflix, downloading games, etc.). That is pretty funny though.   I'm paid bi-weekly, and donate a small amount to my meeting, when feasible.    In short, the owner of /r/LDS wasn't happy and didn't like the direction the sub was heading in, so he closed the sub down. Thus, here we are.    Sure, but I was just explaining why some people like him. He's a different type of thinker for a lot of people, which is his main appeal.    His books are pretty different than from what else you might read today.    Watched *Nightcrawler* last night for the second time,this time with a more analytical mindset. It's a really strong critique of hyper capitalism and dog-eat-dog competition. There are so many specific points made if you watch for analogies. Any one else have any thoughts about the film?  Also, anyone know where I can buy an anarcho-pacifist flag? I've been looking, but only found one on Amazon, and it was really pricey. I could make my own but I'm not very good with my hands!    As a prospective non-LDS BYU applicant, thanks for the write up. Extremely helpful in determining whether I apply or not :)   We have to understand that many former members have been hurt by the church, as when they leave their families and friends may leave them, and outcast them from their normal social circles. It's hard to win back hearts which have been so damaged by loved ones.   I found this place via either /r/mormon or /r/exmormon maybe two years ago, can't remember which   I love being called "Young Man" by them. Just warms my heart.   My company does the same thing. We choose the "closed" option when we step away for a second (as oppsed to "open", which lets us recieve calls).   Could it not be argued that selecting the Bible is not endorsing any particular established religion, since Christianity is so general? As in, they're favoring a broad category, rather than something like Catholicism or Methodism.   That's the only argument I can see being made in state court, if this law goes there.      Thank you for the write up. I agree conservatives are a little out of touch. They have many solid good points, but how they go about sharing them often goes insensitive.   Here's a video on combing social justice (in regards to poverty) with conservatism: http://youtube.com/watch?v=OPOnzzB3OZs   What do people think of "Shooting An Elephant"? It's probably one of my favorite essays I've ever read, as it describes the problems of colonialsm very well.   Just an FYI, tithing is not related to getting any sort of position inside the LDS church, since all members pay an equal amount (10% of income). Unless you're referring to something I'm not aware of.   So if I don't know squat, and have never coded before, but am willing to commit, would I be a good student?   I always miss the Lindsy Stirling sales :(  Thanks, though   I'm not sure how it would be drafted, or if it would be even feasible, but I'd like to see the allowance of citizens to avoid paying taxes towards war, if they object to said action.     As already said, the DMZ is heavily guarded. Very few who escape NK do so through the DMZ, due to risk of mines and being shot. The Chinese border, though still guarded, is relatively more easier to escape through, this why it is the border many choose to flee over (and Chinese guards can be bribed).    Though I've only just started my job, I know that if it was not for my amazing coworkers, I'd be having all the same problems as everyone else has written. Plus, the view of the mountains from my desk helps make me feel relaxed.    Not necessarily. Many more democratic countries have multi-party states, rather than only two parties: http://i.imgur.com/gCutY.png   Thank you for the pictures and AMA; I learned a lot from your experience.   You mention the medical students asked you about Beyonce. How up to date did they seem on outside culture, like music, TV, and movies? I'm surprised they even knew about her - as far as I understand, imports of outside media are forbidden.   Secondly, you mention you talked with the pastor of the church you visited, while noting the oddity of the churches attendees (all older women). Did the pastor seem knowledgeable on scripture? Did he seem real, as opposed to being an actor?    You never know. I'll have a heated conversation with someone, only to realize they were right a few days later. We often don't admit we're wrong in the heat of the moment.   "In an attempt to even the playing field, privacy activists have turned the tables on the surveillance industry keeping tabs on everyone else."      There's /r/geopolitics for news updates on American foreign policy (though not all links are related to the US).  They have a list of good sources over on their sidebar.   It sort of is. Some meetings will bring something to either provoke thought or discussion. You don't have to speak or think about the topic if you so choose, it's generally up to you. However, this all varies meeting by meeting and how they handle things.  After the prompt was shared, no one else spoke for the next two hours of meeting.   	110
    MayoClinic.com has a pretty good article on [testosterone and age](http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/83686)   Actually, coming up with an exact age is impossible because there are obvious variations between individuals as with all biological processes. But in the studies that I've seen, the test production of  healthy sedentary Caucasian males is very high at 18-19, peaks in early adulthood, and then may drop very slowly throughout life depending on a lot of factors.    Natty test levels are insanely high when you're 17, no need to inject hormones at that age IMO. If you start training and dieting seriously at 14-15, you can get huge naturally by the time you're legally an adult. Also, natural testosterone levels keep increasing until you're 25, then they peak, then they start dropping down very slowly. No need to inject hormones until you're 24-25 IMHO.    Iron isn't an issue, because this world has the Zipkrowd's iron farm. Of course for clay there isn't really a way around it, it's one of the few materials in MC that you still have to farm yourself by exploring.    Thanks, TSM, for turning us into the laughing stock of the LoL competitive scene. Even BJK, the Wild Card team, is holding their own better.          Not sure if compliment or insult.            This reminds me of Gilneas in WoW.       Amino acids on their own don't significantly affect mRNA expression of satiety-related genes, no. But the processing of various nutrients by the digestive system is very complicated, and foods that contain proteins can sometimes affect one's ability to resist hunger and cravings due to various factors in my opinion. But since a BCAA drink is just that, BCAAs, it should not affect satiety like, say, meat products would.    What the fuck did I just read?             Yes, proteins from meat, but mostly starches, starches, starches. :P  Vegetables that are rich in fibers work best for me when I'm cutting.    Interesting stuff, but I don't think proteins have as much satiety value as this textbook claims. Meat proteins, for example, have a greater satiety value than dairy proteins because they contain less isoleucine and leucine, which increase circulating levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 and 2 and of Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein enzymes, and more phenylalanine and histidine, which do basically the opposite. But beyond that, proteins in general do not have a significant impact on hypothalamic markers of satiety, at least in rodents, as you can see [here](http://www.jissn.com/content/12/1/14/figure/F6); as you can see, in this study, proteins, regardless of source, had a negligible impact on mRNA expression of the various satiety-related genes that they checked for.      Has the gut improved or does it just seem to be like that because he's flexing?    It depends what dairy products we're talking about here, but in the studies that I saw, dairy proteins are generally more conductive to anabolic signalling than meat/animal proteins.    Gluconeogenesis is basically reverse glycolysis. In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate and some ATP. In gluconeogenesis, non-carbohydrate substrates, like pyruvate, and certain fatty acids are converted back to glucose generally in response to hypoglycemia.    I would love to see it. In one more recent model that I saw, amino acids from the nitrogen pool are deaminated as glutamic acid to form ammonia, which is then catalized with the phosphate formed from the ATP produced in the TAC to make carbamoyl phosphate. Carbamoyl phosphate is then catalized again with arginine to form citrulline, citrulline and aspartic acid are in turn synthesized to form arginine again, and then the urea cycle begins. It's like a full circle effect, since citrulline and aspartic acid are also catalized to form fumaric acid, which is used in the TCA as well, and then regenerated to form oxaloacetic acid, and then transaminated to form aspartic acid again. Amino acids would have to be converted to pyruvate or another related compound before oxidative deamination even begins in order to ultimately be converted to triglycerides, which like I said literally never happens.    Also, dietary and meat/animal proteins are not equal. The amino acid profile of dairy proteins is more conductive to production of IGF-1 than that of meat/animal proteins, and dairy proteins are generally digested more quickly, due to being found in foods that also contain sugar, and therefore create a greater insulin response than meat/animal proteins.    This textbook is not entirely accurate. Recent research shows that the pathway for conversion of amino acids to triglycerides does exists, but that it almost never happens. You would have to eat something insane, like a 10 000 calorie surplus, in order for it to happen. It's true that amino acids can be deaminated to form pyruvate, oxaloacetate, acetyl CoA or acetoacetyl CoA, but in reality it almost never happens. Most of the excess proteins are actually used in the urea cycle and other functions.    Not currently, but I'm dieting and training hard to hopefully be able to complete in a year or so from now.    But what struck me is how it goes completely in contradiction with the message the documentary is trying to convey, which is that steroids and other related drugs aren't necessarily the 'evil' that society portrays them to be, and that they're going to become more widely accepted as our world becomes increasingly revolutionized by advances in biotechnology.       I meant acute risk of death obviously.    I didn't think we needed to state the obvious...    I know what 'imo' means, but you're on a bodybuilding discussion board. If you're not talking specifically about something in the context of bodybuilding, you have to specify it. I just assumed you were talking about aesthetics in bodybuilding, not about aesthetics in general.    When you try to imitate Zyzz, you come off as an idiot. The only one who could pull off the Zyzz persona while coming off as a nice, genuine dude was Zyzz himself. That's why the legacy he has left behind is, sadly, a generation of people with shitty personalities like Jeff...    Yes aesthetics are completely subjective. But in bodybuilding competitions specifically, all competitors aim for the lowest body fat and amount of water held that they can possibly can. I'd love to be proven wrong on that.    ITT: people who are downvoting have never watched/attended an actual bodybuilding contest.       Well, in bodybuilding the goal is to have as little body fat as possible so all the muscle and muscle separations can be as clearly visible as possible. There's nothing really subjective in this case... the less the better.    You mean below 8%    I didn't think we needed to state the obvious. Of course it can cause disturbances or death in an organism, which makes it a poison. But that's not the point...    Ignorance is poison.    Things like this make me angry.  Of course they're not gonna talk about the countless people who have used DNP to lose weight incredibly quickly and with absolutely no hormonal feedback afterwards.  Or about the fact that the mechanisms by which DNP causes the body to use its own reserves in order to produce ATP are so effective that they're being actively studied right now in order to create similar but safer drugs in the future.  All they can talk about is the few idiots who didn't know what they were doing and killed themselves. Or about that anorexic girl who took 8 pills and died. Of course the side effect of DNP overdose is a risk of acute death, that was established by scientists almost a century ago. Does that mean it's as dangerous as they're probably claiming? Hell no.  But of course they just love to blow it out of proportions. DNP should be illegal because the masses make it dangerous by being ignorant and impulsive when it comes to drug use, not because it's dangerous on its own. I've never heard of someone who knew what they were doing, who had carefully researched the physiological mechanisms, the potential side effects and the anecdotally reported dosage protocols, and who died from DNP use. And there's a reason: because when it's used intelligently, it works and isn't very dangerous.   This article, my friends, is a perfect example of why the society we live in is fucking shitty. And shame on the WADA for taking part in such bullshit.    You add a negative connotation to judging like you think it's a bad thing. It's not bad or good. It's just how it is. It's in humans' nature to judge. We all perceive other people in different ways whether we want it or not...    I don't know if you're right, but I can't provide a counter argument at the moment, so I guess you are.    I've talked about this before, but one study found that high doses of a lactate-caffeine mixture have a significant impact on muscle mass and strength in rodents. However, more research needs to be done, obviously.   Actually I do eat sugar, it's good post-workout, to take advantage of the post-exercise insulin sensitivity effect.    I know of a substance that's basically like alcohol but without the calories. Can't remember the name, but I'm pretty sure it exists. Look it up.    I'm not too sure what I think, to be frank. I don't even know what are the leading theories on the evolutionary origins of the whole reward system in the brain. That's something I need to do more research on. All I know is, there's something truly wrong in today's society with the relationship between eating behaviors and that reward system. In the past, people were mainly eating to maintain homeostatic balance, and today that's clearly not the case, and it obviously has to do with our lifestyle, but just how deep is the issue? The plethora of metabolic diseases (such as obesity) that we're stuck with is just what you see on the surface, and the issue runs much deeper than that. Of course I don't look down on people who count calories and only 'cheat' once in a while, because they're still better than most of society, sadly. But I do tend to look down on people, because I believe that they're being part of a partially flawed system without even being aware of it.    Well this is very subjective, but for me, small doses produce the same buzz as alcohol, except with slight visual hallucinations. I've also used THC, but I tend to avoid it because endocannabinoid-like substances make me hungry.    I prefer to use psilocybin, it's calorie-free, doesn't promote fat storage,  and doesn't make me feel like shit because of dehydration the next morning.    To use one of my favorite quotes, 'Living by your wants will never make you happy. What it means to be fully human is to strive to live by ideas and ideals and not to measure your life by what you've attained in terms of your desires, but those small moments of integrity.'      Of course I am aware that a lot of society doesn't want to hear what I have to say about eating behaviors, so I keep my apparently 'obsessive' beliefs a secret. I judge people, but I don't tell them or let it show. No one in my real life knows that I think like this. But I won't take pride in doing something that I regard as simply being the normal thing to do based on my ideology.    It's not even about bodybuilding. When you eat something that you 'crave', you are giving in to your body's reward system, also known as the hedonic neural pathway. It's literally the same neural circuitry as the one that is involved in addiction to drugs like heroin. Humans were never meant to reward themselves with highly palatable foods to the extent that people are doing so nowadays. Of course you can do it and still be a successful bodybuilder, many of the best bodybuilders in the world are living proof of that. But like I said, that belief of mine goes far beyond bodybuilding. My belief does allow me to have the strict dieting style that, perhaps, one day could allow me to be a successful bodybuilder, but don't be mistaken, it's merely a coincidence.    No, because I live by ideas and ideals, not short term wants and desires like you. Giving in to superficial needs like the one to eat such food is a behavior of the weak.    You know what they say...Redbull doesn't give you wings, lat pulldowns do!      I have a love   hate relationship with Dorian. He's one of the best in the history of bodybuilding, no doubting that, but he's also amongst the ones who started the whole gh/insulin craze.    Honestly tired of seeing this ignorant nonsense being posted again and again. Dumbass guy went full retard, had a medical issue because of it, that's it. Has nothing to do with bodybuilding.    2-300 calories above TDEE.    Honestly, maybe I'm obsessed, maybe I have issues... A lot of people have told me things of the kind.... But I'm not distressed by it anymore, because my 'obsession' has allowed me to achieve a more aesthetic body than I could have ever hoped to achieve otherwise, and I'm still FAR from where I want to be, but I know that this 'obsession' is also what will continue to drive me until I finally get there.    Either keep cutting slowly until you've lost another 3-5% or start bulking slowly to increase muscular mass while minimizing fat gains, IMO. Either way you will get a little bit of both regardless of what you do because you are still benefiting from the beginner's gains at your stage! Amazing work man, don't stop!         One day, reading articles like this one is going to give me cancer... Seriously... The ignorant tone in this article is making me cringe...   I find it extremely disturbing that being overweight has become somewhat of a norm. The mechanism by which humans are physiologically capable of storing nutrients in adipose tissue was never meant to be taken this far. My Metabolic Biochemistry teacher says that this is essentially the outcome of an evolutionary mismatch between ancestral adaptations to environment (the ability to store fat) and the lifestyle of people in today's society, i.e. eating foods to socialize and having an abundant supply of food available. And I agree, because I've believed that since I was a teenager. Society truly is fucked up, and I don't think it's going to get better.    It might not be normal to want to get 'swole', but in my opinion it's certainly not normal either to not have any clue how much of what is going through your mouth throughout the day.    Wow! I won't say good luck, don't think you're going to need such a thing!    This is why you don't 'experiment' before a show, especially when it comes to diuretic drugs, which can easily backfire if you don't know what you're doing.    I'd tell them that desiring to become more muscular is a personal choice that they have no business commenting on. And then I'd tell them that yes, I do use steroids, but that despite my drug use, I still have a much healthier lifestyle and much more daily motivation than they can ever hope to have.    Having both = Ronnie.    Even when I'm bulking, I have to eat extremely cleanly, or else I feel depressed and hopeless. If I ever eat anything that can be regarded as a 'cheat meal', anything that's excessively rich in sugar, bad fats and sodium, I'll have a slight outburst of satisfaction from the taste, followed by hours and possibly even days of guilt and resentment towards myself. I'm not saying it's normal or rational, but I'm literally incapable of eating anything that I don't regard as 'clean' food.       I think it's reasonable to say that most people who are serious enough about their training and diet for it to be possible for them to ever reach their genetic potential generally get on the gear long before they get even close to getting there.   White meat, and any carbohydrate foods with a low glycemic load, which means a lot of dietary fibers and little sugar. Just type 'low glycemic load foods' on Google.    I've been trying that too. 1 cup of liquid egg white and a pre-workout of caffeine citrate + DMAA. It has worked well.    I don't think there's anything wrong with it. But of course it only makes sense to look for what's the most effective, that's why I've been trying to figure out whether or not it's more effective than, say, post-workout cardio or mid-day post-meal cardio.    I've personally gone from 15 to 12% body fat doing fasted cardio, but I'm more tempted to believe that this is due to my diet. That's why I'm looking to hear about other people's experience.    A lot of research says that it's more effective than regular cardio, a lot of research also says that it isn't. Have you guys done fasted cardio regularly over a long period of time, and if yes, what kinds of results did you get? My understanding is that it's useful for highly trained athletes, due to higher substrate utilization and the effectiveness of fatty acid metabolism at a low body fat percentage, but for the average person, I'm not sure just how useful it is?     To be honest, I've found it difficult to socialize in a society where I'm the only person that I know to have a strict diet that is based on research. I can definitely say that, as I've grown up, I've felt increasingly alienated from the world surrounding me (I'm 20 now, I started my journey when I was 15). I cannot talk about food with my parents or friends, because food has become somewhat of a taboo subject and most people don't understand the biochemical principles behind nutritional science. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the one who's crazy, or if it's the world around me that is. I guess it ultimately doesn't matter, though, since the outcome is the same regardless.     The opposite for me, actually. But I guess we are all different, which is fine!   Buy a food scale. You can get one for less than $10 on Amazon. Check on a website that tracks the calories in foods, such as MyFitnessPal. Start off with eating mostly simple foods - cooked chicken, vegetables, fruits, brown rice, etc., and expand your food choices as you get more used to weighting and preparing food. Also, I usually prepare my meals for the entire week in a single day, usually Sunday. It really makes it easier if you have a busy week life.    Yep, that's what matters. If you keep track of your caloric intake, you can eat anything, and some nuts are certainly a very healthy choice - rich in good fats, rich in certain micro nutrients, with an excellent fiber/carbohydrate ratio, and with proteins of which the amino acid profile reduces the production of the IGF-1 hormone, which is possibly another good thing if you're trying to lose weight.    I would advise against eating nuts unless you are weighting food and counting calories. Nuts, while healthy, are highly caloric and it's very easy to overeat them in my experience.    This is true, but compared to how many calories they contain overall, the number of carbohydrates they contain is insignificant. For example, a ounce of almonds is 161 calories, only 12 of which come from net carbohydrates, and half of which come from dietary fibers. If your only source of carbohydrates in a day is from almonds, you are still in a ketogenic mode, because it doesn't take absolutely no carbohydrates for your body to start producing ATP mainly via ketosis, only very little, something around 10% of total caloric intake or less if I recall correctly from the studies I've read. But yes, some nuts are higher in carbohydrates, that's true, chia seeds for example.    **1. Don't eat to socialize.**  One of the main problems with our society is that most forms of socialization revolve around eating. And most of the time it's eating foods that are rich in sugar and fat, meaning people end the day with a positive energy balance (caloric surplus) because of that. People eat out at a restaurant to hang out with their friends, eat when they go to see a movie, eat at parties, eat 'comforting foods' at funerals, etc.. But humans were not made to live this way. For most of our species' history, we were hunter-gatherers who struggled to find food, and then people developed agriculture and there started being an abundant supply of food available. And as soon as that happened, things went out of control. In fact, there is evidence that many of the pharaohs from Ancient Egypt were obese due to having a diet rich in sugar. So perhaps the most important thing I learned is to not eat as a means of socializing with others. It's fine to socialize as you're eating, but don't center your nutritional choices around interactions with others, and find an eating pattern that works best for you individually.  **2. Learn to make the difference between actually being hungry, and feeling the need to eat because of exogenous factors, such as stress, negative emotions (boredom, sadness, etc.) or peer pressure.**  It is essentially believed that eating behaviors are regulated by two neural pathways in the brain: the homeostatic and the hedonic (reward) pathways. When you wake up in the morning and have breakfast, this is the homeostatic pathway; your body hasn't had any supply of energy in many hours and it knows that you need to eat in order to restore balance (homeostatis). On the other hand, when your inner voice tells you 'I really want to open up this bag of chips right now', this is the reward pathway, also colloquially known as 'food cravings'. People are taught from a young age, by their parents, by their entourage, arguably by society at large, to reward themselves with foods, so it only makes sense for them to fall back to eating rewarding foods when they are not feeling good. But it doesn't mean that you should do it! In fact, awareness is the first step to ceasing this slow-killer behavior. The next time you are about to open up this bag of chips, think to yourself 'Will my body start to malfunction if I don't eat this right now?' Most likely, the answer will be no, it won't, because you don't actually need to eat it, you are merely looking to reward yourself with the taste of those chips. And, with this in mind, you can put the bag of chips back on the shelf and find another way of making yourself feel better instead.  **3. Eat foods that make you feel full (low GL carbohydrate foods)**  When your stomach is empty, your pancreas secretes a hormone known as 'ghrelin', of which the purpose is to stimulate hunger so you will eat. Inversely, once you've eaten, another hormone is secreted from your body's stored fat, known as 'leptin', and of which the purpose is to suppress appetite. The relationship between ghrelin, leptin and other hormones is extremely complex, but simply put, the time you feel 'full' from the foods you eat is pretty much equal to the time they spend in your digestive system; as your stomach is getting emptier, your pancreas will start producing ghrelin again, and you will start feeling hungry again. What does this mean? That you should eat foods that take longer to digest, as they will also make you feel full longer. To slow down digestion, the macro nutrient you should pay the most attention to is carbohydrates. There are two types of carbohydrates: the simple ones, also known as sugars, and the more complex ones, or starches. Carbohydrates are found in almost everything: bread, rice, vegetables, fruits, etc; the only things that don't contain them are meat and pure fat-based products (mostly oils). However, sugars and starches are very different: sugars, due to being simple at the chemical level, will be digested extremely quickly, and, in the process, also cause your pancreas to create more insulin, which will 'drive' the nutrients into your system at a faster than normal rate so they can either be used to make energy or be stored as fat. Starches, on the other hand, are more complex, and will therefore take more time to digest and create a lesser insulin response. One way of knowing how much of an insulin response certain foods will create is to look at their glycemic load, which is based on a formula that takes into account both how quickly the food is digested and how much sugar it actually contains; the closer to 100 the glycemic load, and the higher the insulin response. If you are trying to lose weight, foods with a high glycemic load should be mostly avoided, except following an intense physical exercise, when it is believed that the body will become more sensitive to insulin and therefore use up more of the nutrients that it receives than it normally would.  **4. Do not give up on eating 'healthier', as it actually gets easier over time.**  One of the biggest communities of living beings in the world is in the human gut, and is known as the gut microbiota or gut flora. This community is made up of trillions of microorganisms that both influence and are influenced by your nutrient choices. In fact, gut composition is based on eating habits, and it is also believed that the microbes in the gut can influence the brain to desire the nutrient and nutrient combinations that they prefer, via a neural pathway known as the brain-gut axis. What does this mean? That eating healthier might literally get easier over time, because the unhealthy nutrient choices will eventually get replaced by healthier ones as you change your eating habits.  **5. Keep track of how many calories you are eating throughout the day.**  Ultimately, whether you lose, maintain or gain weight is based on the kind of energy balance you end the day with over a long period of time, days, weeks, months or even years. If you are always ending the day with a positive balance, you are gaining weight, plain and simple, no matter your food choices, no matter how much physical exercise you are doing. Society has been trying, in recent years, to teach us to eat 'healthier' and to be more physically active in order to become healthier, but the harsh truth is, these things only matter insofar as they allow you to maintain a healthy body fat percentage. In fact, in controlled lab experiments, losing weight far outweighs all other factors when it comes to improvements in overall health, including nutrient choices. So, in other words, if you are eating exclusively chips and donuts everyday but eating at caloric deficit and therefore losing weight, you are technically living a healthier life than someone who is eating 'healthy' but not losing weight. However, like I've said above, food choices definitely matter still, as, combined with social habits, they are generally a good indicator of whether people reach their approximate target caloric intake or not. But one way of keeping track of your progress and knowing whether you need to make adjustments in your life or not is by keeping track of your caloric intake. Firstly, it helps you make the difference between the actual need to eat and food cravings; if you're at caloric maintenance already and feel the need to open up that bag of chips, you can tell yourself 'No, I don't need this, I've already had all my calories for the day'. Secondly, it allows you to be more flexible: if you know that you are attending a social gathering in the evening and there'll be food that you'll most likely want to eat there, you can adjust your caloric intake consequently, by eating a little less than normally throughout the day so as to still end the day with a negative energy balance despite eating fast food at that party.   Yes, I'm not sure what you're asking? It increases leptin production, which causes the body to become less sensitive to both leptin and insulin.    Yes, because surplus fat is directly stored in the fat cells, which also increases leptin production.    Indeed, the only reason why I talk about carbohydrates is to give others a bit of background information on the subject. This study merely looks at the relationship between leptin and UGN.    Essentially, yes. It is believed that eating behavior are regulated by two neural pathways: the homeostatic and the hedonic (reward) pathway. When you wake up in the morning and have breakfast, this is the homeostatic pathway; your body knows that you need to eat in order to survive. On the other hand, when you think 'I really want to open up this bag of chips right now', this is the reward pathway. In a society where people are taught from a young age that it is a good thing to reward oneself with foods, it only makes sense for people to fall back to eating rewarding foods when they are not feeling good. But it does not mean that you should do it. Awareness is, in fact, the starting point of ceasing this health-destroying behavior.    Yes, but it is implied that the degree of insulin production necessary to cause resistance is one that is highly correlated with overeating. I didn't think I needed to specify that.    If I could give 4 tips to avoid eating at a caloric surplus, which is the most important, they would be:  1. Don't eat to socialize, this is when people are most likely to overeat/eat foods that are rich in bad fats and sugar  2. Eat foods that make you feel full (low GL carbohydrate foods, meat source proteins)  3. Learn to make the difference between actually needing to eat and feeling the need to eat because of an exogenous factor, such as stress, boredom or another negative emotion.   4. Keep track of how many calories you are ingesting throughout the day.     No, this is incorrect, and demonstrates why there is no ELI5. Eating at a caloric surplus is what causes the nutrients to be stored as fat, therefore increasing the production of leptin and resulting in the vicious cycle that I talk about. Insulin does increase adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides, because it transports the nutrients into the system at a faster rate, but this doesn't matter if you aren't eating at a caloric surplus, as then, those nutrients will still be used to produce energy.  However, fast-digesting carbohydrates might partly lead to obesity, as they make people feel less 'full' from the food they eat, since they are digested so quickly, and therefore make people more likely to eat at a caloric surplus. But for example, carbohydrate foods with a low glycemic load do not create very much of an insulin response. Low glycemic load carbohydrate foods are ones that have a high fiber/sugar ratio, amongst other things. For example: brown rice, whole grain bread, and peas, to name a few.     No, this is incorrect, and demonstrates why there is no ELI5. Eating at a caloric surplus is what causes the nutrients to be stored as fat, therefore increasing the production of leptin and resulting in the vicious cycle that I talk about. Insulin does increase adipose tissue uptake of triglycerides, because it transports the nutrients into the system at a faster rate, but this doesn't matter if you aren't eating at a caloric surplus, as then, those nutrients will still be used to produce energy.

Low glycemic load carbohydrate foods are ones that have a high fiber/sugar ratio, amongst other things. For example: brown rice, whole grain bread, and peas, to name a few.    Probably not ELI5, but as simply as I can put it, ingesting carbohydrates causes the pancreas to secrete insulin, a hormone that 'drives' nutrients into the system. Most of the nutrients are used by the body to produce ATP, the unit of intracellular energy and what effectively allows us to live, via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (the main metabolic pathway). The nutrients that cannot be used, however, are instead mostly stored as triglycerides in the body's adipocytes (fat cells). Leptin is an appetite-controlling hormone that is an adipokine, meaning that it is synthesized from the fat cells. Therefore, insulin increases the production of leptin over time, and as it does, the body becomes less sensitive not only to leptin itself, but also to insulin, resulting in a vicious cycle that makes people hungrier, fatter, and more likely to develop diabetes. In this study, they found a positive correlation between leptin and uroguanylin, a 16 amino acid peptide that appears to control some of the body's homeostatis mechanisms via the brain-gut pathway, through which biochemical signalling takes place between the gut microbiota, the gastrointestinal tract and the nervous system. In other words, leptin appears to control homeostatic balance partly via the action of uroguanylin, the latter being dependent on leptin production and, therefore, on carbohydrate metabolism as well. This is basic science, but they essentially acquired a better understanding of how leptin controls appetite at the biochemical level with this experiment.   Probably not ELI5, but as simply as I can put it, ingesting carbohydrates causes the pancreas to secrete insulin, a hormone that 'drives' nutrients into the system.

In other words, leptin appears to control homeostatic balance partly via the action of uroguanylin,  the latter being dependent on leptin production and, therefore, on carbohydrate metabolism as well. This is basic science, but they essentially acquired a better understanding of how leptin controls appetite at the biochemical level with this experiment.                Thanks!   To the Nether obviously. Otherwise there wouldn't be water.       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824650/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6414471  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25450864  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322757  http://jap.physiology.org/content/early/2015/01/08/japplphysiol.00054.2014  http://www.sciencedomain.org/abstract.php?iid=155 id=1 aid=703#.UuVae2Qo5GE   It's not directly anabolic but it is definitely related.    It's not very complicated. Maintain your pre-show caloric intake. Eat mostly meat/animal proteins and low GL carbohydrates to maintain musculature and fullness without increasing fluid retention. Obviously avoid foods that tend to cause fluid retention (sodium rich foods) and raise blood sugar high (sugar rich/high GL foods). Keep water intake fairly low, but not so low that you're uncomfortable, until 2-3 days before the competition.    Yes, because GHRPs imitate the effect of ghrelin. But with the latest generation of peptides, the gastric effects are supposed to be non-existent. But some people still report a feeling of gastric emptiness nonetheless.    GHRH/GHRP certainly works in synergy with AAS. DMAA is basically a stimulant, so it can be used as a pre-workout or for cutting/in combination with weight loss drugs (such as 2,4-DNP). The other two, I wouldn't be able to tell you.    Quote from a research article:  We examined whether a mixed lactate and caffeine compound (LC) could effectively elicit proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells or activate anabolic signals in skeletal muscles. We cultured C2C12 cells with either lactate or LC for 6 h. We found that lactate significantly increased myogenin and follistatin protein levels and phosphorylation of P70S6K while decreasing the levels of myostatin relative to the control. LC significantly increased protein levels of Pax7, MyoD, and Ki67 in addition to myogenin, relative to control. LC also significantly increased follistatin expression relative to control and stimulated phosphorylation of mTOR and P70S6K. In an in vivo study, male F344/DuCrlCrlj rats were assigned to control (Sed, n = 10), exercise (Ex, n = 12), and LC supplementation (LCEx, n = 13) groups. LC was orally administered daily. The LCEx and Ex groups were exercised on a treadmill, running for 30 min at low intensity every other day for 4 wk. The LCEx group experienced a significant increase in the mass of the gastrocnemius (GA) and tibialis anterior (TA) relative to both the Sed and Ex groups. Furthermore, the LCEx group showed a significant increase in the total DNA content of TA compared with the Sed group. The LCEx group experienced a significant increase in myogenin and follistatin expression of GA relative to the Ex group. These results suggest that administration of LC can effectively increase muscle mass concomitant with elevated numbers of myonuclei, even with low-intensity exercise training, via activated satellite cells and anabolic signals.    Long term use of large doses of hGH and insulin makes every single tissue in the body grow.    It can be injected either intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intravenously.    No one knows how safe it is.The long-term synergistic effects of GHRH/GHRP have never been studied in a controlled setting. The prescription drug version of GHRH is banned for recreational use in a few countries (but not the analogue that is generally used recreationally), but GHRP drugs have yet to go under the radar of major governing bodies.     Just to clarify, I haven't posted the sources for these drugs because the texts aren't average person-friendly at all. But if you are interested in the scientific literature, send me a PM and I can provide all the sources.    This is very true. Also, there is some evidence that certain types of cardiovascular exercise (such as running) affect muscular strength and hypertrophy, especially in the lower body. This is why I personally limit my cardio time to no more than 30 min daily.    **1. GHRH/GHRP**  Stands for **G**rowth **H**ormone **R**eleasing **H**ormone and Growth Hormone Releasing **P**eptide. These are **not** hGH, but when combined, they have very similar effects. During deep sleep, growth hormone is produced, and then, it is released at various times throughout the day in the form of a 'pulse'. GHRH and GHRH work synergistically and allow you to control and increase that pulse, resulting in increased anabolic effects (including increased rates of protein biosynthesis and lipolysis), better quality of sleep (possibly as a result of increased deep sleep time), and even faster tissue regeneration near site of injection when higher doses are administered. These two compounds are administered via injection, usually either intramuscularly or intravenously, and user-reported dosage tends to range from one to multiple doses of 1mcg/kg of body weight per day, usually at times of increased energy expenditure and fasting, to make good use of the GH pulse, such as pre-workout, post-workout, and pre-bed time. The synergistic effects of these compounds are not well studied in humans, and side effects from long-term use remain unknown. However, commonly reported side effects occur when dosage is not titrated up adequately, or with high (multiple doses) and long-term continuous use, and include: fluid retention, arthralgia, and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome; these side effects were also reported when high doses of synthetic growth hormone were administered in healthy adult subjects.   **2.  FS315**   FS315 is an isoform (a genetic compound that has been modified via post-translational modification) of Follistatin, an antagonist of the  TGF- family of cell regulatory proteins. Normally, Follistatin inhibits the production of all the  TGF- proteins, but this isoform has been modified to target only myostatin, a protein that limits muscle-building in humans. It is injected using an adeno-associated virus, a small virus that is inoffensive to humans. When injected in animals and human children, it resulted in a significant short-term increase in muscular mass and functional strength. Although this method is obviously not available on the market yet, the potential of abuse by athletes in the near future is considered to be high by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the method itself is referred to as 'gene doping'.   **3. Lactate-Caffeine**  This one is not available on the market yet either, and is related to Follistatin. When administered orally to rodents, a solution of lactate (the conjugate base of lactic acid) and caffeine increased muscular mass significantly and prevented paralysis-induced muscular atrophy, via an increase in Follistatin production, a decrease in Myostatin production, and via activation of the calcineurin-NFATc pathway, a complex process that increases the production of a subtype of white blood cells (known as T-cells) and of a protein known as Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc). The calcineurin-NFATc pathway is also activated by certain AAS, such as Testosterone and Nandrolone, and could partly explain their anabolic effects.    **4. 1,3-dimethylamylamine**  This compound has been around since the thirties, but common use only dates back to a couple years. It has the same positive effects as Ephedrine,  but via different mechanisms in the brain,  and without seemingly raising blood pressure (which is a huge plus). It is poorly studied, and much of the information on its effects in humans or in general is based on extrapolation from other similar compounds. Based on anecdotal evidence, it often induces a subtle feeling of euphoria, especially in the first times of use, and is often taken in combination with Synephrine Hydrochloride (another natural stimulant, also known as bitter orange) and caffeine; this mix is referred to by some people as 'Ephedrine-Caffeine without the side effects'. Its chemical structure is similar to that of another stimulant known as 1,3-Dimethylbutylamine.         You're making a lot of assumptions, one of them being that the other person understands the biochemical principles behind nutritional science, which most people who come on physical exercise-related subreddits don't. Most people don't even understand the difference between starches and sugar, or how different carbohydrates affect insulin production. Therefore, you cannot 'assume' anything.    I used MrCrayFish' design, easily found on Youtube.    Thank you!            Yes, but you missed the point. You cannot talk about macro nutrients alone because it's too vague, that was my argument. If you say 'I eat 200g of carbs', it could be 'I eat 200g of carbs, 150 of which are sugar, and the other 50 of which is starchy fiber rich carbs', or it could be 'I had 180g of low glycemic load carbs throughout the day, with 20g of sugar post-workout'. Both are completely different. When you're talking about nutrition, you cannot simply talk about macro nutrients on their own. You also have to also talk about the micro nutrients they contain, and their relationship to the other macro nutrients within the food product itself, or else you get a picture that is not very accurate.     Indeed, but they still do matter, and they also play a huge role in the control of satiety and hunger, two factors that often influence whether people reach their target caloric intake or not, especially when they're cutting. Also, they play a role in maintenance of general health and well being.    Saying only 'carbs, proteins and fats' does not mean much. How much of these carbs is starches? How much is sugar? What is the glycemic load of all of these carb foods? Where do the proteins come from? Dairy? Meat? What kinds of fat? Saturated? Unsaturated? Omega-3? Also, what is the micro nutritional content of all of these foods that you're eating? How much of your carb intake is fiber rich? Dietary fibers have a huge impact on glycemic load as well.  You need to be more specific if you want help. Like I said, just saying 'carbs, proteins and fats' is extremely vague, nutritionally speaking.    There are some insanely brutal squat workouts for legs out there. GVT squat. 20 rep breathing squats. Drop set leg press. Etc.    I find it fucking hilarious that some people think the top pro 'Crossfitters' got big and strong actually doing Crossfit training programs. Crossfit is the exact same shit as regular weight lifting, except there's more variation in ways of training muscle groups and series/rep format. And these athletes got their physique and athletic capacity lifting heavy weights with proper form, eating a lot and using AAS and GH/GHRH/GHRP.    Unless you have fairly low body fat (10% or below), I wouldn't worry about 'cutting too much', no such thing, especially if you're mostly eating proteins, which you should be if you're on a huge deficit.    In simpler terms, what I said above is: if you are cutting, make most of your proteins come from meat, and if you are bulking, make most come from dairy products. However, meat is also good if you are bulking, especially read meat, because it boosts testosterone production slightly; this is because red meat is rich in saturated fat, which means cholesterol, a precursor to testosterone. So, for cutting, meat, meat, meat, mostly white meat, except post-workout because you want sugar for the post-exercise insulin sensitivity effect. And if you're bulking, meat, some red, and dairy. Dairy is especially good if you're someone who struggles to eat in surplus (chocolate milk, for example, isn't very filling...).   Both meat and dairy products can be complete protein foods. For example, both fish and milk are. However, it is because of how much they contain of certain essential amino acids that they differ. Phenylalanine and histidine are known to increase IGF-1, whereas leucine and isoleucin are known to decrease its production; dairy products contain more of the former and less of the latter, and meat is the opposite. IGF-1 is a highly anabolic hormone. Also, like I said, dairy products are generally digested faster, due to being rich in simple carbohydrates (such as sugar), which creates a greater insulin response, and insulin is obviously very anabolic, in fact it's the most anabolic naturally occuring hormone in the body.   I don't have a whole lot of merit, I've been studying these things basically all my life, since I was a teenager. The more you learn about the human body and how it interacts with the physical world, and the more you come to realize how ignorant laypeople are, especially when it comes to food, and so the more you come to hate and despise them. Knowledge is quite the alienating concept...    Anyone who has an understanding of the basic biochemical principles behind nutritional science will tell you that this is complete bullshit. By nature, the most 'efficient' protein, if there's such a thing, cannot be a complete one because different amino acids have different up and downsides.  For example, the amino acids in dairy protein produce a greater increase in circulating IGF-1, and some dairy products are digested more quickly due to their low fiber/sugar ratio (for example, milk), so the insulin response is greater as well. Because of this, dairy protein is more anabolic, produces more ATP in the short run, but also increases the rate at which triglycerides are stored in the body's fat cells. In comparison, meat or animal protein is digested more slowly, has an amino acid profile that produces less IGF-1, and also possibly produces a greater feeling of satiety as well. And it goes on and on. I could write a 10 page scientific paper on the subject. There is no such thing as a 'good' complete protein.          Yes, if you want food that 'goes in' more easily, you should eat proteins from a dairy source and carbohydrates that are rich in sugar and low in fiber. For example, chocolate milk, which is rich in dairy proteins and has a fairy low sugar/fiber. Anything that contains dairy proteins and of which most of the carbohydrates come from sugar.    Dietary fiber is well known to control appetite; it is a major determiner of glycemic load and is the reason why many fruits positively affect hypothalamic regulators of satiety despite being made primarily of monosaccharide sugars. On the other hand, dietary proteins, regardless of amino acid composition, have little impact on regulators of satiety as far as I know. However, unlike meat or animal protein, dairy protein takes less time to go through the digestive system, and also increases the production of ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates hunger, by increasing the production of Insulin-like growth factor-1. In other words, if I'm cutting, I would eat proteins from a meat or animal source, and carbohydrate foods that have a high fiber/sugar ratio, and therefore, a low glycemic load as well, such as peas or broccoli, to maximize the psychological effects of satiety and limit those of hunger.             Yes but this is a flaw of how human societies function, because in the long run the benefits acquired from the advancement of science far outweigh all other variables involved. If a major scientific breakthrough involves the deaths of thousands of innocents, a thousand years later what do you think people will remember or care about? The life-changing knowledge acquired for that human catastrophe, and not the catastrophe itself.    Another study which indirectly demonstrates the efficacy of secretagogues for weight loss can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378754/). In that recent study, they found that, indeed, ghrelin can regulate glucose metabolism via the Ghrelin O-acyltransferase enzyme. This is exciting news for GHRH users and certainly adds to the whole GRF1-29/GHRP-2 craze of the last couple years. I just wish there was more research conducted in healthy non-elderly adult subjects.       FNDC5 is a newly discovered muscular tissue-secreted membrane protein that seems to have an effect on adiposity and insulin resistance. According to some novel research, inhibiting its production could potentially be used to treat obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases in the future.          Yes, but I'm of the personal opinion that we shouldn't let the advancement of science be hindered by whatever moral values society holds true at a given moment. Morality is a highly subjective and ever-changing concept, and the standards of morality of today will most likely not be those of society in a thousand years. On the other hand, the principles that guide the physical universe will never change, and I believe that morality will drastically change as we come to understand how things work in our world. Do not be mistaken.... Science dictates morality, not the other way around.    AAV Follistatin injection probably has side effects, as Follistatin affects the entire transforming growth factor beta family. But in this case they used an isoform (a compound similar but modified at the molecular level) of Follistatin that targets the MSTN pathway in order to avoid off-target site effects. More research will be needed to determine the impact of myostatin inhibition in humans, so I would be cautious to say it's adverse effect-free. Now as to whether it's 'doping' or not, that's an ethical question that science should not concern itself with. Laypeople would never understand anyway.    Noted. I will be more careful in the future.    I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake... I thought it had been published in November.    What is your question exactly?   In the era of genetic experimentation, we will be the generation that will get to abuse novel methods. But everything backfires one day... For example, societies of the far future with more extreme views might systemically modify embryos to make humans be born truly 'equal'.

Although our data confirmed TRENs ability to reduce endogenous sex hormone production and promote the development of benign prostate hyperplasia, the observed potential benefits of TREN treatment may still justify its application in the treatment of obesity. This study demonstrates TRENs ability to reduce adiposity and its associated dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance/pre-diabetes.'   Thanks!      According to the authors, use of trenbolone could be justified in the treatment of obesity.

The related study can be found here:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25322757 - A phase 1/2a follistatin gene therapy trial for becker muscular dystrophy.   For the first time ever, myostatin production was inhibited in children suffering from muscular diseases, using an isoform (FS344) of  TGF- superfamily antagonist Follistatin that targets specifically the myostatin pathway. It lead to a significant increase in muscular strength and mass. This research article discusses the implications of this novel method for the future of gene therapy.         I only share new studies that I find interesting and relevant.  However, this is a summary of the research on energy allocation during sleep, so it is already a synthesis in itself. The authors' suggestion that reducing caloric intake prior to bed time is a means of minimizing fat storage is based on findings from hundreds of independent studies. This isn't just a single study, in fact it's not a study at all; no experiment was conducted here, it's a summary of te scientific literature in related fields.          Goes to show how those who are at the top right now are primarily there because they have been doing this for a long, long time.    Study highlights:  - Trenbolone treatment significantly reduces adiposity.  - Trenbolone treatment improves circulating lipid profile and insulin sensitivity.  - No adverse cardiac or hepatic effects were observed with trenbolone treatment.  - Like other androgens, trenbolone treatment causes benign prostate hyperplasia.  - Trenbolone may prove to be an effective and safe weight loss agent in other models.

I was merely replying to your comment about milk being for babies.    There's no way to make it simpler than this without explaining what each of the terms means individually. Maybe someone else can chime in and do a better job than me at explaining this. This is obviously advanced science. By no means do I pretend to fully understand it myself; the people who do are those who have spent years studying and researching complex processes that relate to the fields of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.    I don't think you understand what you're talking about. The milk that babies drink from their mother's breasts is vastly different from the one that non-babies drink, and so are the reasons why babies should drink milk. The type of milk produced during late pregnancy is a unique one that is rich in antibodies to make up for the infant's developing immune system. In general, breast milk is also richer in dietary fats and antibodies than regular milk, and serves a number of functions for the baby's health.   	173
 First you have to understand how property is attained. Property is attained via the act of original appropriation. This means that one who puts previously unowned property/resources to good use by 'mixing his labor' with it becomes the owner of said modified property/resource.   This is what libertarians call the homestead-principle. The homestead principle logically follows from the principle of self ownership. As free, beautiful, independent human beings we own ourselves - that is to say noone else has any claim over our individual person. Also, by extension, we own the products of our labor, and no other may have a claim to it though we can choose to voluntarily contract our labor in exchange for something more desirable, like capital.   This is why libertarians reject taxation not only as an initiation of force but an aribirtary claim on the product of ones labor... which is ours. Taxation leads to one of two logical conclusions: 1. Either we own ourselves and by extension the product of our labor or 2. we are slaves who do not.   Government cannot own property and has no legitimate claim to anything as it 1. preforms no act of original appropriation, and 2. must rely on legalized plunder, or the violation of property in order to lay claim to said property or additional property of others.  As such, government produces no net gain to society as resources are arbitrarily confiscated from some and distributed to others via bureaucratic whim.  But to get back to homesteading and property accumulation consider this example: If I am in an area outside anothers homestead claim (or the claim that he has mixed his labor with) and decide to mix my labor with an resource, say a tree... the product of my labor that might produce a chair or table is thereby my property.    If I contractually appropriate a resource from INSIDE anothers homestead claim, as I preformed no act of original appropriation, I would be compensated for by labor in some way but the resource would remain theirs.  Its a matter of original appropriation. government does not do this. Government cannot own property. To hit on the native americans again, they preformed acts of original appropriation by being first to mix their labor with the resources of the various claims the tribes operated within. It is still technically their property according to propertarian theory.   As government preforms no act of original appropriation, being born into an arbitrary territorial monopoly claim means nothing...   However, if you are born on my homestead claim, a claim that I have mixed my labor with via the original appropriation of resources, and you refuse to go despite my wishes... you are violating my property... obviously most wouldn't throw a baby from their claim, but you get the theoretically idea...     This is where libertarians lose me. The for vast majority of human history, up to and until the 19th century, property has never been transferred this way. Land has always been stolen, usually through war and violence.  Land has always been stolen, usually through war and violence. Why do people have property in America, for example? Well, settlers came, stole land and killed natives, and then gave that land to other people. It's all stolen property.  And what does this have to do with the enforcement of property rights? Nothing.... what you are describing is the complete violation of property rights.... What does the forced expropriation of others property have to do with propertarianism or libertarianism? Absolutely nothing, that s the entire point. You seem to have a grave misunderstanding of how states from and what libertarians advocate... Yes whites violated the natives property.... again, what the hell does that have to do with asserting property rights? no, whites violated the property rights of the natives on behest of European monarchies... European settlers killing Indians to steal their property IS THE VIOLATION OF THE NATIVES PROPERTY....this is not what libertarians advocate.... Natives still have the right to the land IMO as they preformed the act of original appropriation via the homestead principle... its theirs... some was seeded voluntarily but for the majority, government took it via state actors... this has nothing to do with the free market or libertarianism.... this is what happens when their are no respect for property rights.... In a free society thieves are punished... not given positions in government which makes their plunder 'legal.' This is the entire premise of libertarianism... that ones property be protected from the initiation of force...   The only plausible libertarian response to that seems to be "that's in the past, lets do better from now on". But that's a bit hard to swallow.   Im not sure what kind of libertarians you have been talking to but again the exact scenario you describe resulted FROM THE BLATANT DISRESPECT OF PROPERTY RIGHTS... not because of them... In a private law society, when others seize property not their own, it is a tortuous act and demands compensation. Legal plunder via government seizure demands no such accountability because the theft is deemed 'legal.'   Thieves will always exist. An expropriating property protector is an contradiction in terms... You are right, but voluntary exchange is not theft. Initiators of force are not free traders... they are private criminals and government actors.... you seem to have trouble differentiating between state actors and free traders.... anyone initiating force against another person or property are not part of the free market and are violating the property of others... private criminals would be dealt with in a free society much the same way tort law now handles disputes. The situations you are describing are the direct result of states actors via the initiation of force... not the avocation of private property rights....  It's as though someone has been punching you and broke your face, and then just stopped says "time out, lets be friends", and when you try to taking him to court to pay your medical bills, he accuses you of using the government to enforce tyranny by taking his property.  No, law has existed for thousands of years without government and will exist thousands of years after its gone... you automatically equate court with government because you have been conditioned to accept government as sole arbitrator in all conflicts... even in conflicts involving themselves.... Again, in a private law society, there would be no government courts, and the ridiculous claim that compensating a victim is an initiation of force perpetrated by government wouldn't even exist...  Buts lets say someone did make that claim... NO, THEY initiated force against the person they beat up... they are liable... they are the aggressor and must compensate or face consequences.... You are conflating free trade with violent force... rape is not loving making... libertarians advocate love making(voluntary exchange) not rape(theft)... rapists(thieves) should be punished. They are initiators of force against peaceful people and their property... It is precisely because of property rights that compensation can even occur in the first place... If you steal something I do not own... I have no compensatory claim...  RESOURCES to help you understanding -  To understand how private law has worked in the past throughout history, check out this excellent lecture by Dr, David Friedman entitled: [LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT THE STATE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oWka2fi3y0)  Dr. Hans-Hermann Hoppe: [STATE OR PRIVATE LAW SOCIETY?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6V0XzJfm8U)  Dr. Bon Murphy [LAW WITHOUT THE STATE](http://mises.org/library/law-without-state) - contains common objections  Also, check out Chapter 12 in Dr. Murray Rothbards work For A New Liberty entitled: [THE PUBLIC SECTOR, III: POLICE, LAW,   THE COURTS](http://mises.org/sites/default/files/For%20a%20New%20Liberty%20The%20Libertarian%20Manifesto_3.pdf)   I have more for you on the other comment... Ill respond when I get time... am at work. cheers!:)   WOW is about all I can say to this:  And the state never agreed to your immigration to the state via birth. Your arrival in the state's territory was not consensual; you are the original aggressor on the state's property, and you continue to aggress on the state's property by demanding to stay while refusing to obey the state's laws.     property rights dont lead to tyranny... the expropriation of property does... in a free society, property can only be transferred via voluntary consent.... states form from the forced violation of property rights... not because of them....    lol... im from the south, forgive me :0    The CSA was a fundamentally unfree state.  not arguing that it was...  who said anything about the Confederacy being free?... the traditional narrative about the civil war just isnt true... For the north slavery, as a reason for war, was an after thought.... this has been thoroughly documented from the newspapers and documents of the time.... Forever tying states rights to slavery and racism has been a statist ploy since the beginning against the very inclination of decentralizing power or dissociating from the federal government....  If the war against southern succession was really about slavery, why wouldnt the government simply just buy and free the miniscule amount of slaves left at that time???? This is how most every other western nation got rid of slavery....    yes and there are building states rights and secession movements everywhere.... just look at what states are doing with marijuana.... and in Arizona. Proposition 122, the Arizona Rejection of Unconstitutional Federal Actions Amendment, passed.... this is open defiance of federal laws.... for all intensive purposes, this is nullification.... amazing...  	7

We glamorize marriages from the past by pretending that people voluntarily stayed together, instead of acknowledging that the majority of people didnt have alternatives. In fact, many marriages in the past were not only highly dysfunctional, but highly abusive. So feeling nostalgic for the perfect marriages of the past is like feeling nostalgic for the time when money grew on trees.   its kind of a conspiracy of society in a way. the media, the church, government.. all pushing us to stay in these marriages and get married etc...   yea it might not be an actual conspiracy per se   yea its all societal construct   the media created the myth of marriage and we each buy into it by playing our gender roles   fuck you flytape covered in flies!   not my book    https://i.imgur.com/NFQNLn3.jpg  https://imgur.com/gallery/NFQNLn3/new  e: imgur downvoated tlo?!?!          exactly, its another regressive tax on the poor that the rich dont even notice.. like all taxes/tickets/fines               you've been banned from /r/starcraft subreddit message via /r/starcraft/ sent 6 minutes ago you have been banned from posting to /r/starcraft. note from the moderators: https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3dh66z/you_have_been_banned_from_teamliquidnet_banned/ you can contact the moderators regarding your ban by replying to this message. warning: using other accounts to circumvent a subreddit ban is considered a violation of reddit's site rules and can result in being banned from reddit entirely. permalinkreportblock subredditreplyfull comments            http://www.glamour.com/weddings/2006/07/kristin-armstrong  she basically describes how she gave up her own desires in order to make her husband happy.

 Telegraph isn't paywall unless for people outside the UK it is   Good to see an actual professor state that even though so much was wrong he still enjoyed the film. If only the professors on reddit were able to do the same about other films...   He was ok at the World Cup but everyone else playing for England were shite. It's not like he performed near the level Ferdinand was playing at either. Ferdinand was at the heart of the defence of a Leeds team that got to the semis in the champions league, it was of course a lot of money but he was worth it   And when he cost that much he had performed at a World Cup and in the champions league   Yeh that one player...loads that   Danny Ings reminds me of a dwarf   Thought Nasri was off as well?   3 sick 7 me mate   Are you joking?   I like falcao but just look at the Spurs game, he missed about 3 that should have been goals just in that   Happily   Me too   Happily fuck off mate   Nerves maybe? Apprehension, just because he's the best doesn't mean he wouldn't feel them. Going out in front of 90 thousand and being expected to perform could do that to you   They are the equivalent of The Sun on radio, bullshit and banter merchants   Best thing you can do is try and catch Copa America games to see what he's like   Bebe scored a couple of worldies as well and would look good in a YouTube video.

Hello folks, I am pretty new to after effects so bear with me.   I followed [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx0bKB9aL08) tutorial on how to make smoke in after effects, using the particle playground effect. So I got my desired smoke effect, and all is well, except for one problem. At the start of my 5 second composition, there is no smoke, but as you play the composition, the smoke emerges from the position at which I put the producer (or whatever you call the point of origin for the particles). What I want is for the smoke to already be at its maximum height at the start of the composition. I can't figure out how to do that.   I hope you guys understand what I mean by that, and if not, I'll add screenshots from my composition. Can anyone help me out and let me know how to make it so that the smoke is already at maximum height at the start of my composition?  Thanks in advance.

Once she left, I fell back asleep and dreamed I ejaculated which lead to me cumming in real life. I know it wasn't on purpose, but when I woke up and realized what happened I felt as bad as if I had reset my badge for real. I feel weak and disgusting, and I know it doesn't count as fapping but it sure felt like it. Has anyone else experienced this after a streak of a few weeks? What mindset can help me feel less weak?

 I would definitely agree with Cabrillo. From there it's an amazing view both west into the ocean and east into the city and beyond. I would probably drive around Sunset Cliffs too.

Yes, when Android updates it's the same as with iOS only the notification is much more obvious.  2. Already answered.  3. I still root my phone but mostly because it's a hold out from my early days with Android when you had to root in order to get any features. But Android comes with a lot of features now and CM has even more than stock so I don't think you'll miss much.   Of course by not rooting you can't install any custom ROMs but in my experience the custom ROMs are more buggy than the stock. Again, in the early days this was a good trade off because Android didn't offer a lot but now there's no reason to tolerate a buggy ROM.   http://www.apa-wpa.com/  On the right side there's a link called "rules".

I got a lot stronger doing madcow after stronglifts.  Don't forget that there's two variables at play. Volume is one of them but intensity is another. With Madcow you're mixing your intensity around while maintaining your volume.   The truth is that you're going to make gains regardless of the program you choose simply because you're new at the game.   Madcow (and other intermediate program) is really for when you've stalled at linear progression.  Oh, I would suggest that you man up a bit. This stuff never gets easier.

 that's what I am assuming.    "...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.  As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.  "Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.  Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms.  "For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."  "The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.  The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans.      WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - U.S. telecom industry groups, alongside AT T Inc and smaller companies, on Friday called for regulators to immediately block parts of new stricter rules for Internet service providers, citing steep costs and threats to investment.  In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, USTelecom Association, CTIA-The Wireless Association and CenturyLink Inc sought to block the agency's move to reclassify broadband Internet as a more heavily regulated telecommunications service and a new broad general conduct standard.  The groups and companies, which are challenging the rules in court, did not ask to pause implementation of the brightline rules that ban companies from blocking or slowing down web traffic or striking deals with content companies for smoother downloads.  The filing cites several testimonials of executives at regional and local Internet providers that the rules, slated to go into effect in June, will create costly compliance burdens and limit resources for improvements to broadband networks or new products.               Mr Melon, I will undoubtedly be torturing you with questions at a later time, as I must be on my way for the moment. Thank you:)   now you have me farther intrigued.I seem to recall reading that some Japanese company had/is developing a new material-type solar cell that converts to usable energy without needing all those middle steps. Great, now I will spend half my day trying to find it, and gee I hope I am remembering it correctly.   they say you can have up to 9 units, I don't have the answer to your principle question at this moment though. Think what it will allow for those areas without electric grids though..so many possibilities.   It goes beyond insuring power in a blackout though.

This case, the horrible damage done to Freddie Gray, while in police custody which resulted in his far too early demise..this is a case that no one can possibly argue was justifiable.  My sympathy and love goes out to those family and friends of this young man; my anger   fury goes out to those that think destruction and violence will in any way help get the now so obvious   undeniable point across that unjustified violence against black youth exists   needs to be taken seriously into account by law enforcement agencies.  Peaceful protest, particularly in this instance, is IMHO the means to a more positive end result.     (A megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word "megalithic" describes structures made of such large stones, utilizing an interlocking system without the use of mortar or concrete, as well as representing periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions. For later periods the term monolith, with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.)     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnac_stones  " Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Merlin."      2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Meaning of the Monolith Revealed PART 2 (2014 update)    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpWMnlMIWAU      Cleopatra's Needle is the popular name for each of three Ancient Egyptian obelisks re-erected in London, Paris, and New York City during the nineteenth century. The obelisks in London and New York are a pair, and the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor, where its twin remains. Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks, their shared nickname is a misnomer, as they have no connection with Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime. The London and New York "needles" were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III. The Paris "needle" dates to the reign of 19th Dynasty Ramesses II and was the first to be moved and re-erected as well as the first to acquire the nickname, "L'aiguille de Cloptre" in French.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleopatra%27s_Needle      as an aside, Sunflowers have a very useful talent apart from looking beautiful   feeding birds/animals.

While the government is free to conduct its own foreign relations, it does so under the terms of the Compact.

US military 'monitoring' Iran ship seizure http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32503660    (Reuters) - Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television said an Iranian "force" seized a U.S. cargo ship after opening fire on it in the Gulf on Tuesday and directed it to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.  A Pentagon spokesman said Iranian forces had boarded a Marshall Island-flagged vessel, the MV Maersk Tigris, in the Gulf. He said the boarding occurred after Iranian patrol boats fired shots across the vessel's bow and ordered it deeper into Iranian waters.  The ship had no U.S. citizens aboard, the spokesman said, contradicting Al-Arabiya's report which said there were 34 U.S. sailors on board. He said it was traveling through the Strait of Hormuz when the incident occurred.  There was no immediate word from Iranian officials.  Iran has in the past sometimes threatened to block the strait to advance its opposition to sanctions imposed over its nuclear program.  The channel is a narrow strip of water separating Oman and Iran. It connects the biggest Gulf oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia, with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.  At its narrowest point, the strait is 33 km (21 miles) across and consists of 2-mile wide navigable channels for inbound and outbound shipping and a 2-mile-wide buffer zone.      just..ewww.

Earthquake Devastates Nepal, Killing More Than 1,900  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/asia/nepal-earthquake-katmandu.html?_r=0   Q:How long do you have to work without a bathroom break? Do you have a special bottle in your cab for toilet emergencies? Do you eat while working? Do you bring your own water or thermos of coffee/tea? Do you/can you use your cellphone while driving? Do train operators have to pass eye exams, as for an automobile drivers license? Are you allowed to listen to music while working? How long do you sit and drive the train before you get a break or chance to stretch your legs? In which city aside from New York would you like to operate a train and why? What is the usual relationship between train operator and train conductor  friends or competitors? What are the special or funny ways or phrases that train operators and conductors describe passengers? Do you have special emergency equipment since 9/11? Who has the better career: train operators or bus drivers and why?  Thank you to you and your colleagues for your service and helping make New York City great!   Posted by Darryl Mitteldorf, LCSW  Answer: We have what is known as recovery time at the end of the lines. In the terminals, we can use the bathroom or have our lunch break, which is built into our schedule. As long as the railroad is running on time, we have time to eat, but if the we are running behind, we may not have time to eat. Eating while operating the train is against the rules, as is the use of cellphones or audio devices such as iPods. The rules in the cab are just like the laws that prohibit you from doing certain things while driving a car.  All train operators and conductors have to pass full medical exams to operate a train.  Operating a train on the Amtrak system would be appealing to me.  We work as a team for six months at a time and have the chance to build relationships, which are usually good among operators and conductors.  There are no special or funny phrases that we say about our passengers, except take care and travel safely.  Since 9/11, we are now issued a mask, just like the ones you see police officers wearing in emergency situations.  Bus operators have the same responsibilities of moving passengers safely from one point to another, but they have the added responsibility of also performing as a conductor and a station agent on their buses. Both jobs can make good careers!  All transit workers appreciate you, too.

We are the Dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields.'  This poem has always touched me deeply. All those men, so many so very young.I'm sorry if the poppy part doesn't work for Anzac, but the sentiment..surely there is that in common?  Edit to add that going forward I shall wear a sprig of rosemary on Anzac day; thank you for the education:)   Thank you!   ok , please skip the whole 'end times prophecy' stuff, (unless you are otherwise inclined; personally I'm skipping all that part), but I think I like the listing they have of 'Mass Animal Deaths for 2015'.  http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/animal-deaths-birds-fish-end-times.html  They have links for 2011-2014 near the bottom, if you can manage to pass over the small religious paragraph if that isn't your cup of tea.

World Vision  The humanitarian aid group had staff on the ground in Nepal when the quake hit. As the organization tries to locate all of its workers, the ones who are safe are reporting that the immediate needs are food, water and shelter, spokeswoman Laura Blank told NBC News.  "It's freezing outside especially at night. I can't imagine how children and families are gonna sleep tonight," said child protection specialist Rosalyn Lorin, who witnessed the quake. "They need blankets and shelter. They're now afraid to go back (to) their houses."  Those who wish to donate to World Vision can visit their Nepal page or text NEPAL to 777444 to donate $10.  Red Cross  Emergency responders from the Red Cross have been mobilized to affected areas and are especially concerned about more remote towns that have been blocked off by landslides and lost communication.  "We are extremely concerned about the fate of communities in towns and villages in rural areas closer to the epicenter," said Jagan Chapagain, the IFRC's Director for Asia Pacific. The International Federation of Red Cross is using funds to try to get aid to those cut-off areas. The organization's blood bank in the capital of Kathmandu is also operating to provide blood supplies to medical facilities in the city.  For more information, visit the International Federation of Red Cross' website.  British Red Cross @BritishRedCross The #Nepal Red Cross have a solar-powered blood bank, built to help in event of an earthquake: http://blogs.redcross.org.uk/emergencies/2014/10/nepals-solar-powered-blood-bank-will-save-lives-deadly-earthquakes/  UNICEF  The United Nations Children's Fund already has staff in Nepal. For more information, visit UNICEF's website. People can also text "Nepal" to 864233 to donate $10.   International Medical Corps  The organization focuses on delivering medical supplies and sending teams to assist and train health care workers in crisis regions. Their team is heading to the epicenter of the quake, where they say hospitals are overflowing, and medicine and supplies are expected to be quickly depleted. To donate to their Nepal response, click here.  Save the Children  The non-governmental organization has launched disaster response on the ground in Nepal, and works specifically with children and families. Ten percent of donations also go toward preparing for the next emergency response, according to its website. To donate, visit their Nepal page.  CARE  The group has previous experience responding to landslides in Nepal, and humanitarian workers are currently in the country providing food, water, shelter and health care, according to its website. To donate, visit their NEPAL page.   GlobalGiving  The charity crowd funding site has set up a Nepal-specific page. Any donations made will support various relief and recovery efforts in Nepal. The money will first go toward immediate needs like food, fuel, clean water, hygiene products and shelter. Later, the money raised will transition to supporting vetted local organizations that are working on recovery efforts. To donate, click here. @GlobalGiving You can provide emergency supplies to victims in Nepal by donating to the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/nepal-earthquake-relief-fund/?rf=twtr   FINDING THE MISSING  Here are websites to check on loved ones in the quake region:  Google Person Finder  In the search function, enter information to locate someone who is missing or found, or enter the name of someone who is missing in order to search other entries.  Restoring Family Links  The website has a list of people who have registered as alive and a list of people who have been reported missing. Affected residents can register or report here.   Facebook Safety Check  Those in the area affected by the quake will get a notification from Facebook when they log on asking them if they're safe. People can check the page to see who has checked in and let their friends know they're OK.   http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/nepal-earthquake/nepal-earthquake-devastation-could-cost-billions-heres-how-you-can-n348301   I'm sure there are plenty more, please add links.

I may be saying this because I am a salty April 1st 60s, but the tables are starting to turn. There are now more reds than purples. This means being purple is more rare than being red. Eventually people will want to get as early as possible. Because of this, the timer will go down, and it will end. Just an idea. Also, if there are more reds than purples, why are there more *active* purples? The statistics are mind numbing for someone unfamiliar with this type of stuff.    I, /u/train_subject1909 , accept that I am, as a Purple, superior to all other colors because of my Button-granted right. In addition, I accept the Hierarchy of Purple and swear that my ultimate goal is to allow The Timer to reach Zero. Through all means, prove supremacy. Hail the Violet Hand.

Sure, but the foreshadowing for them planning an AI since Avengers 1 was attention to detail. Just thought it was cool. :(    ? They said that lol. I dont think this clarifies anything or that anything needed to be clarified in the first place.  Well it seemed cool how they had Ultron planned since the first Avengers...   This explains how the talked about how they had been working on Ultron before but were unsuccessful.      Haha! It's fine! At least you got it right! :p   Cell is called cell because, according to the wiki, "Cell is composed of cells from Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta, Frieza, King Cold, and according to the manga title page, a number of other lifeforms (in the FUNimation dub, it is also stated that he has cells from Krillin, Gohan, Nappa, and Tien Shinhan)." There are billions of billions of nuclei in the body, including Cell's. Also, according to this, "Cell Juniors (Jr.) are the seven offspring of Cell. They are asexually produced from Cell's tail, through cellular mitosis.[2] According to Cell himself, each Cell Junior has his power and abilities."

  "My People" - Eric Holder   What evidence was left out?   Strong-Armed Robbery is not a petty crime. Attacking a police officer in their car and attempting to take their gun is also not a petty crime. Seems you have built the wrong profile for Mr. Brown.   It takes more evidence to convict someone than it does to indict someone. So, if there was not enough evidence to indict, how do you think there will be enough evidence to convict?

I do see, from that link, that Fergusons violent crime averages are much higher than the US average. I would like to see 30 years of crime and demographic data on Ferguson. I have heard others mention that Ferguson was not a violent town until something changed. Jobs left and crime went on the climb.I wonder what changed to cause this shift.    What were the demographics and violent crime rate of Ferguson in, lets say, 1990? What is the demographics and violent crime rate of Ferguson today?

How many more straws do you have left to grasp over there? I implore you to ask any IT manager how many resumes they get from minorities compared to whites. You have no idea what you are talking about.    For example: Our company is looking for a new CIO. Not one minority has applied for it. Is it the CEOs fault that only white people have applied for the job? Lets say he got 200 resumes and out of 200 resumes only one was a minority. Should he hire that minority just because they are a minority?    What race is the majority in the US? If there are more white people in the US I would suspect you would see more white 'bosses'. But what do I know. Its nice to see you generalize all white people and call them all racists. You believe that all white 'bosses' base their decisions on race instead of work ethic, education, and a desire to succeed.   So what privilege are they losing? I see what you are saying.

 I should also add that not anyone can get their books in actual bookstores. Self-publishers do well, sometimes, with ebooks. But physical books still make up the vast majority of the market and bookstores don't and can't just put everything on shelves.       I like King--see username--but I think the whole "no one respects King!" line is pretty rubbish at this point:   * He won a National Book Award (THE lit snob org in America) "Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters"  * He has been published in the New Yorker, McSweeneys, and other snobby lit mags.   * He edited an issue of Best American Short Stories  * He has won lit awards like the O. Henry  I could go on and on, but basically, the lit world is not afraid of Stephen King anymore... if they ever were.     Anyone can publish anything for all the world to see, regardless of race/sex/religion.  Questions of race and sex aside, this doesn't really address the problem. Sales are highly correlated with marketing. Sure, anyone can self-publish, but when all the marketing is behind the John Grishams, Stephen Kings, and Jodi Picoults of the world those will be the authors who get read.            I've just never been a fan of many female authors, I don't know why, I just can't get into their books as much. I don't feel like I should force myself to read more female authors, or black authors, because honestly I only care about the books they write.  I guess to me it seems odd to say you "don't care" for the artistic output of 50% of the human population (or more, since you are including black authors with women.) That just seems really odd to me. The range of writing by women is huge, just as the range of male writing is huge.        If people do choose to read/publish/nominate books by white male authors over anyone else, and they do this subconsciously... then how exactly is anyone going to stop them doing that?  Well you probably help alleviate that by making everyone conscious of these issues so they can't just be subconscious about it. You know?   I always thought I read widely, but when I was in college and got into these conversations and I actually counted my reading list and... it was overwhelmingly white men. Now, since I'm conscious of it, my reading list is more diverse. No one forced me to do anything.     I don't think you should be concerned, however. White males, more specifically white people have always been dominant in the publishing industry.   Yeah it seems silly to be concerned when publishing is still dominated by Fraznen, Lethem, Gaiman, etc. The SF world, where the sad puppies got all mad, is still like 100% white men as far as sales go... and even awards. Scazli, VanderMeer, yada yada.   White male writers are not a dying breed.        There were a bunch of articles posted on /r/books and /r/writing about how someone analyzed the last 15 years of award winners in the major lit awards and not only were men much more likely to win, but the women writers who won did so for books that were written ABOUT men. Point being, sexism and racism are pretty pervasive and their effects reach really widely.   You might THINK that sex wouldn't be relevant other than memoirs, but in reality people judge women to be inferior writers off the bat, publishers are far less likely to publish fiction by non-white writers, judges will unconciously favor classic straight white male writers, and so on.                                        This is pretty much right, except some CNF can use a different form. Could be a list, or memoir, or a "nonfiction novel," etc.   But a CNF essay is a sub form of essays overall for sure.    Well "essays" encompass a lot of things, including creative nonfiction. But there is definitely a difference between say a lyric essay and a high school English class essay.   Basically, roughly, "creative nonfiction" is trying to be art of some sort while your average school essay is not. In the former, you want style, voice, formal experimentation, and anything else you'd associate with artistic writing. In the latter, you want to strip down the style, use a very rigid formula (intro paragraph, thesis sentence at the end, body paragraphs with topic sentences, conclusion summing up previous paragraphs, etc.)              (though I bet there are a couple of authors making that kind of money or more, just with individual sales rather than a long-term contract.)  Sure, probably Suzanne Collins and Stephen King (who has some SciFi stuff). Not many though.    Man, 3.4 million doesn't seem like much? The cut-off for the top 1% is under $300k a year. Scalzi is quite literally the 1% now, and his actual yearly income will be a lot more (as he gets royalties from already published books, film option money, and so on).    I assume he still gets royalties from sales and stuff?  From past books, yes. From these books, probably not unless they become mega best sellers. It would take a lot of sales to earn out 3.4 million advance, but it depends on how the contract is broken down.   In general, the way advances work is you get money upfront and your royalty earnings go against that until you pass it. So if you get $1,000 in an advance and you earn $1 dollar every book sale, then your first 1,000 books sold would go against the advance. You'd start making money after book sale 1,001.    It's a first-person memoir                                       Sure! Sorry, these responses get lost in these long threads, here is what I said before:   http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/37i2og/sexual_violence_in_george_rr_martins_novels_is/crmx99n  Essentially, the storyline just puts Sansa back int he same position she was for most of the series, which isn't that intersting. We've already seen Sansa tortured and locked up with no place to go. It's just repetitive. So it bothers me in the same way that Dany's redundant storyline bothers me. The rape itself doesn't offend me personally.        I'm saying that I can agree with you that the storytelling is lackluster so far in the season, but until we see where the payoffs lay in their respective plots, we can't pass a truly comprehensive judgment of the current scenes.  Fair enough!     I guess I don't get what separates this particular plot line from any other horrible occurrence in this series. Why does the writing on this get second-guessed when horrible stuff happening to all the other Starks gets an ok?  I explained my reasoning above! It has nothing to do with it being horrible--I'm one of those who fully thinks the books are MORE rape-filled and that the show is not a particularly bad example of sexual violence on TV. In fact, some rape victims I know like that the show actually presents rape as a horrible and ever-present thing, as it is in life for many women, instead of white-washing everything.         I don't think Roose knows about Ramsay raping and torturing Sansa,   She's locked in a tower and never let out (except to show her flayed women). I think he knows.   I mean look at Tywin's attempts to control who Tyrion does or doesn't have sex with,   Tyrion and Tywin are almost never together, not normally even in the same region. When Tywin DOES come to King's Landing he DOES break up Tyrion's relationship.    Regardless, this all comes across like backseat writing because people don't want bad things to happen to the characters they like.   You've got me pegged wrong. I'm a total character sadist. Just think this particular plot line is stagnant.     The problem is that what media you enjoy cannot possibly hope to participate in the most interesting mode of its own expression without forgoing some other or later "interesting" gratification.  I honestly am not sure what you are trying to argue here. I'm saying that some of the storylines this season have gone in boring, redundant, or nonsensical (ie Dorne) directions. That's a criticism of the narrative and the storytelling. I'm not complaining about individual scenes, but the narrative and storytelling failures.   Obviously you can disagree with me about the storytelling, but this isn't like... "SJW" complaining.       For the character to remain consistent with how he's been defined, yes. What else would you recommend, that his character suddenly change overnight to be someone completely different?  There are myriad ways this could have gone other than raping sansa. Off the top of my head:   * Roose could have forced Ramsay to not torture Sansa (he'd had several "stop just torturing Northern lords" speeches this season, so that would be consistent) and as a result, maybe Ramsay starts torturing Miranda or forcing Sansa to watch that.   * Ditto, but Ramsay takes his frustrations out on someone else.   * Or the wedding could have been delayed until after Stannis attacks.   * Or Brienne could have gone on a rescue mission.   All of the above would be consistent with Ramsay's character.    Or that the rapes all happen off page, out of sight out of mind?  Well I DO agree  that it is silly for people to be like "Raping Sansa is sexist! It was so much better when Martin wrote him raping and torturing a poor girl instead!"  But the storytelling and character arcs and stagnant right now   Agree, BUT I do think there are legitimate criticisms of that plotline. I thought Sansa's assault was, um, tastefully filmed compared to many other rapes on the show. Obviously the Jamie "we didn't mean for it to be a rape" rape is the worst example.   But at the same time, the character arc for Sansa was that she was developing into her own, learning how to manipulate via Littlefinger, and becoming confident. For her to just go back to being abused and locked up with no agency just returns her to the same state she was in for most of the series. It's kind of lazy storytelling.   Similarly, we've had plenty of scenes to show us that Ramsay is evil. Do we really need yet another rape and/or torture thing with Ramsay? Even as his father is telling him he needs to keep the North in line by making people think they are aligned with the Starks?   There were more interesting ways for the show to go. Even having Ramsay force Sansa to torture Miranda or something would have been more interesting.    Well it IS true that a lot of fanboys/girls pretend that the show is "adding" rape when... the opposite is true.   Like lots of people think that Dany wasn't raped by Drogo, but the actual book depicts her crying into her pillow every night as he takes her from behind and she writhes in pain afterwards. They think that because there is ONE scene where Drogo asks permission--nevermind it is a 13 year old girl literally sold to him without wanting to be--that he never rapes her, but that's some poor reading comprehension.       This should be pretty obvious to anyone who has read the books         Well, sure, but if a book sold a ton of copies and got lots of press, it is fair to critique it. Basically, it's a famous book. That's different than a debut from a writer that didn't sell well, which is maybe weirder to spend time attacking. That's all I was saying.       * Small Beer Press (Kelly Link runs this, weird but awesome stuff)  * ChiZine (horror/dark fantasy focused)   * Coffee House Press (literary press, but do fantasy horror stuff like Brian Evenson)  * Tin House Press (ditto, lit press but do genre-bending stuff)            I didn't like it much either, but throw a debut novel a bone. It's not supposed to be Tolstoy.  To be fair, this wasn't just a random debut book, but perhaps the most hyped science fiction debut in years.    Haven't read the book, but your review sums up the impression I got from the book, even the positive reviews made it seem like lame ninja/pirate/bro-nerd humor. But I guess I should read myself to find out.                                              Honestly it seems like more and more big name self-publishing people are moving back to trad publishing, or else doing both like Hugh Howey      yeah, I don't think readers here understand how advances work. Advances are just money up front paid out of your royalties. So if you get 15% royalties and 100k advance, you don't get anymore money until your book has earned 100k+ and then you earn the money over 100K    An author far more likely to self publish than most.  hasn't Scalzi been pretty open about not wanting to self publish? Just because someone has an internet prescence doesn't mean they want to self-publish   Yeah, "individual opinion" makes no sense here. Publishing houses put out dozens of books each month. This NYT author does not read them all. There is no way that her taste is some reflection of her honest opinion of all books out there... it can't be.   If the list is 100% white, that's the fault of a systemic racism, prejudice in publishing houses, and the author's own prejudices.    Fantastic book, definitely his best collection of stories (although not quite as good as his best novels IMHO)      countpoint: miserable books can be horribly entertaining. I mean, Thomas Bernhard is hilarious but his books are miserable and depressing. Cormac McCarthy is very entertaining and engrossing, even though his books are dark, horrible journeys into death and destruction.   Agree, though, that balance is good.                         The specific Jeff VanderMeer work you cited is SF :) But yes, he's done fantasy work too. Agree it's "weird fiction" but it's also about an alien entity creating a mini apocalypse while a crumbling but near futuristic bureaucracy of scientists tries to probe it. Pretty sf!   IMO the prevalence of the mega novel isn't really important when there are plenty of non-mega novels. And anyways mega-novels (aka series) can be great fun.  Sounds like we both agree the main thing is the author needs to read wider, as there are plenty of great short fantasy works.       To your first point, let me quote her:     **If the usual big-fantasy detail is taken out and you only sketch a plot, you get a fairytale.** If you write real high fantasy in 4,000 words, details and all, it tends to be a snippet, not a story. **If its something set in a basically real world but with a fantasy element, its not fantasy so much as speculative fiction**, or alternative history, or a ghost story. That means that there is an **incredibly narrow taxonomical window in which short fiction can be recognised as fantasy at all.**  So I really do think she's defining everything that's urban fantasy, fable-like, short, magical realism, etc. as "not fantasy." She says the "taxanomical window" is super narrow.    As for the likes of Jeff VanderMeer, he's a SF writer and I've said a few times in this thread the "mega novel" is nowhere near as prevalent in science fiction as fantasy.    This is actually a studio arts MFA, not a writing MFA. Not that you are wrong generally speaking though                        I can't believe I left Marquez off my last post, I read him at ever level of school      Also, as far as America goes, we are geographically very far away. It makes sense that, say, French students would study Italian, Spanish and German writers when they border those countries.   OTOH, America is shameful in how little Mexican literature we read.    No Spanish language work? Borges, Cortazar, Cervantes and some others are pretty widely taught at the various schools I went to. (Plus Neruda and others if you study any poetry).   But agree it's pretty English or European languages centric in America. I read virtually no Asian or African literature at any level of school.    I'm with you, I read Doestovesky and I think Checkov in public school, and Tolstoy and others in college.    Street of Crocodiles is great, but pretty weird. Like more poetic Kakfa stories.    Walter is a completely idiotic critic, that's true. Every SF/F writer thinks he is a buffoon. So, yeah, both of these people wrote bad articles.    High fantasy is defined as works taking place in imaginary worlds  Her problem is in arguing that only "high fantasy" is "fantasy" though. I think that's what people are reacting too. She defines urban fantasy as "speculative fiction" and other kinds of fantasy as "fairy tales." If she had just said "epic high fantasy requires long books" that wouldn't be quite as problematic.    I mean fantasy publishers have always enjoyed the trilogy, but it's not just a crass commercial desire, it is what high fantasy is good at.  I don't blame publishers, I blame writers. But keep in mind that modern fantasy epics are way longer than the classics.   The gold standard Lord of the Rings is a trilogy, but it is only 470,000 words in total. For comparison's sake, A Dance With Dragons ALONE is 420,000. ASOIAF will probably end up being six times as long as LOTR.   The Wheel of Time was 7 times as long as LOTR.   Modern fantasy series have bloated to pretty crazy proportions. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't think you can look at things like ASOIAF and Wheel of Time and say that's how high fantasy has to be. It didn't use to be that way.    More words means more chance for details, that's true by definition I think. But it's true of horror, historical fiction, realism, or anything else. It doesn't really prove the article's claim that fantasy doesn't work well in shorter form.     Disagree, because what I'm saying is that the "world building" is plenty complete in one book. Like, only reading Dune or The Left Hand does a fine job of building the world (pretty sure the Hanish books all take place on different planets with different aliens, so they literally build a new world each book... at least Left Hand does).   I mean, I don't think this is unique to SF though. The Hobbit does a fine job world building by itself. So do other single novel fantasy works.      The Left Hand of Darkness is purely self contained, and so is Consider Phelbas.   wikipedia: Le Guin herself has discounted the idea of a "Hainish Cycle", writing on her website that "The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones.  And the Culture books are all pretty self contained to. Dune is the first book of a series, true, but it's 100% self-contained. It has a complete narrative with traditional arcs and a classic ending.   Like, you can't just read book 1 of the Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, or A Song of Ice and Fire and get a full story. Those books follow the same characters through long periods of time, often with a specific quest or series of goals.   Le Guin's Hanish books don't follow the same characters or stories, they just technically take place in the same universe.   It's like the difference between an episode of a TV show and a movie that years later gets a sequel. Sure, the movie is technically part of a series but it's still a complete narrative in the way an episode of narrative TV show isn't.     I do think that sci fi gets to short cut a lot of world building because it is by-and-large our world, with some significant differences.  Honestly, I think this is not true on two levels.   1) Plenty of SF takes place on totally alien worlds (The Left Hand of Darkness, Dune, Consider Phelbas, etc.)  2) Plenty of fantasy is by-and-large our world in the past plus some significant differences. Like, is A Song of Ice and Fire any further away from Medieval Europe than Do Androids Dream... was from 1968 America?    the author certainly does have a point that the worldbuilding that makes up the backbone of a lot of fantasy requires a pretty significant page count.  My counter: science fiction uses just as much world building, but--although big series certainly exist--it is far more common for SF novels to be totally stand alone. Even in a lot of the series out there--Dune, the Culture novels, etc.--you can just read one book and have it be a complete narrative.   So why does fantasy require more pages than SF? I think it's just convention of the fandom. Tolkien started modern high fantasy and the other big pillars like Martin and Jordan followed his lead with huge epic series.    Kafka is huge and widely studied. Celine is respected and pretty well known, ditto Bernhard (but neither are taught that often). Bruno Schulz and especially Calvino are taught in college pretty frequently.   America is so big and has so many writers, that American literature dominates in America for sure. But plenty of classic European authors are read and taught. Everyone I just named previously I was taught in HS, college, or grad school at some point.             4,000 words is a standard short story. 15 pages maybe?       Oh yeah I'm not saying you shouldn't post it, just saying I disagree with the author completely.    Even though I posted this, it seems like total BS to me. Basically, she defines "fantasy" as being giant sprawling world building work--dismissing other stuff as "fairy tales" or "speculative fiction--so... yeah if you define fantasy as giant world building work, then it will have to be giant and involve loves of world building.             I don't get this at all. Giant world building epics that cover huge spans of time are only ONE type of fantasy. Plenty of fantasy works in short form. Hell, the genre spins out from fairy tales which are like 3 pages long            $$                  50k is "next to nothing"? Most websites would consider a 50k story to be very good traffic.           Kindles weren't as popular (were they even around? My memory is a little fuzzy on their introduction)  Kindles were introduced in 2007 I think, so were definitely around in 2010.                           but what book should I just NOT read yet if I don't want to spoil any major plot developments in the show?  This is a funny reversal of the normal problem. But here's the answer:   Books 4 5 are concurrent and cover same time span, so think of them as one for your purposes. The TV show right now is about halfway through the material of books 4/5 (while completely changing many of the storylines.)  So if you truly want no potential spoilers, wait till the end of this season to read 4/5.   But since the show is already much of the way through those books and changing so much, you could probably read both without spoiling anything terribly major. It actually seems like the TV show will end with several scenes from the unwritten book 6.             Well books 4   5 are the worst of the bunch, so I'd eather start with book 1 or don't read at all.    The one you like the most?   Jesus' Son is probably my personal answer      that article is pretty vague. Seems like she is just freelancing?             has anyone here read this yet?                   Depends on what we mean by plotless. I posted this article after it was mentioned in a thread (on r/fantasy) where someone was claiming that Station Eleven was plotless and prentious for not having a plot.   Station Eleven though does have a plot and borrows from pulp sources and was a best seller. So the fact that someone could read that and think, "where's the plot?" seems to be telling for how overly focused many readers on on traditional classic narrative arcs.    Raymond Chandler         Rock Springs is an amazing short story collection. That's all I've read though.   They are easy reads, I'd say in the vein of a slightly more poetic Raymond Carver.             Yeah, just came out from Vintage in the states      most of those are just really famous books that are taught in high schools....            urtext (plural urtexts)  A primitive, seminal, or prototypical example of an artistic genre or the basis of an ideological movement.  I think he means it here as seminal.   Not a fan of Franzen, but trying to lolcat writers with out of context quotes is pretty juvenile.    I'm not really saying depth is in the eye of the beholder, I'm saying that texts that invite many meanings and interpretations are richer than those that don't.   Like, a children's book with a very clear moral ("Listen to your parents!" "be yourself and people will like you!" or whatever) is a shallower kind of book even when the message is a good and important one ("Racism is bad!"). When adult books are written like that, with very clear morals or a very simple overall point, I think that makes them less interesting and, yeah, I guess less "deep."   I certainly agree with you that many works of supposed avant garde work fail by being simpply meaningLESS as opposed to inviting lots of different meaning. Some random art school kids banging on bongo drums naked while covered in paint might invite no real meaning or thought at all.     Work which cultivates an illusion of depth--whether that depth is inherent or interpretive is aside from the point.  By my metric, it isn't an illusion: depth of meaning comes from the text's ability to support and suggest multiple meanings, whether in Shakespeare, Philip K. Dick, or modern lit fic. Works with simple, clear "points" have less depths of meaning than those that suggest more complicated and contradictory points.  But I do think that you are conflating a lot of different things here that make your argument less sturdy. For example, I haven't really seen how anything you say is unique to literary fiction. All of your claims seem like they could just as easily apply to Gene Wolfe, Ursula K. Le Guin, Samuel Deleany, or any other number of celebrated science fiction and fantasy writers.       Lots of readers find formulaic YA books boring and don't get hooked on reading until they discover Kafka and Faulkner. Point being: different strokes for different folks.     I'm talking about it in terms of a feeling that you comprehend everything that occurred and the meaning underlying those events.  Well, I think you are mistaken in thinking that most adult fiction has "meaning" underlying events. Fiction is an artistic object, and the "meaning" is in the totality of the work and the experience reading it. The work that tends to get celebrated in any medium or genre is the work that is rich with meaning... in which many different interpretations can exist. Think of the one million different interpretations of every Shakespeare play that have been written or performed over the years.   Certainly Shakespeare's plays have very clear plots, but they don't have clear simplistic meanings, which makes them rich experiences.   Here's another example:   The Shining.   The Shining book and the Shining film (both of which are great) have the same plot, more or less. But many people find the Shining film to be more imbued with multiple meanings and interpretations, while the same events and the same character decisions and the same plot points (more or less) in the books feel less interesting because Stephen King has a more simplistic framework to convey those plot points and actions.   What makes the Shining film better, at least to some, has nothing to do with avoiding conventional plot elements.   Also, now that you've defined your terms more, i really don't see why you think what you are saying is unique to lit fiction. Le Guin, Delaney, Ballard, Wolfe,... most great SF/F authors have "unclear" points behind the action. That's not about literary vs. genre. I think it's true that most literary fiction has less dramatic action and less clear character arcs, but that doesn't mean that literary or genre have more or less clear "meaning" behind the actions and events that occur.    yet the entire book insists there is a point.  Speaking as an author who knows many authors, I don't think many fiction writers think there is "a point" to their work anymore than there is a simple, singular "point" to an orchestra piece or a painting.    They are very different books, but my point is that books can have a strong plot and still have much of the book not deal with the plot. (and yes, I read Station Eleven). Someone else mentioned Moby-Dick in here and that's a perfect example. It has a very strong, very clear, very simple plot. But at least half the book doesn't deal with the plot, but instead with side characters, side adventures, or just literal scientific descriptions of whales and ships.   What percentage of Harry Potter or LOTR are directly about the main plot? Even those books are filled with world building, descriptions of food, side conversations, etc.   You seem to be conflating summary and meaning. I can summarize Station Eleven just as easily as LOTR or any plot heavy book (a theater troupe travels around a post apocalyptic America), but why is that where meaning comes from? I don't think anyone would say the depth or meaning of LOTR has to do with hobbits throwing a ring in a mountain really.  I'd understand you if you were talking about a confusing postmodern book where events and action are unclear, but Station Eleven and most lit fic has very clear plot, action, and events   I really hate when people pretend that things they don't like aren't liked by anyone. Tons of people like Faulkner and Joyce! Their books are still read many years after their death. Why pretend all their readers don't exist?    Here's another thing about lit fiction that might be the cause: MFAs/teaching.   In MFA classes, you focus on sentences, voice, and character. I went to an MFA and there was almost no talk of plot. I guess this is still a chicken   egg question, but I think part of the reason is that workshops take place for an hour or so, so you have to read short stories instead of novels, and it's much easier to talk about the voice and style of a short story than the plot... at least in a way that would translate to a plot of a novel. You know?    I hear what you are saying, but there is a counterpoint: using a familiar plot is EASIER. It's already there ready for you to use, and people are way more likely to appreciate it.   Sure, maybe some snobby high brow people will scoff at something formulaic, but you only have to look at the list of recent blockbusters to see how lucrative--and even acclaimed--you can get just recycling the same things over and over. Basically any movie can make millions by using a standard plot and buying the rights to a famous name (even if there is like no relation to the original property and the movie like in GI Joe or Battleship)  In general, people love what is familiar. Hell, that's what genre fiction is based on: using the same tropes and themes with only minor variation so that readers know what to expect. (There are forward-thinking exceptions of course)  So I don't think you are wrong, but the opposite is true too.    I think, in part, literary fiction tends to be plot less because it allows them to maintain that vague air of depth and meaning that could come under fire if it were forced to conform to a concrete conflict/journey.  I'm not sure I totally follow you here. Does depth only come from plot or lack of plot? Often "depth" has to do with the themes and presentation of ideas much more than plot, even in genre fiction. Like, Do Androids Dream... might have a standard noir plot, but the digressions and exploration of AI and such were new and "deep"      No. Next question.    "Plot" is no more essential to a novel than anything else. Lots of great books have classic, standard plots. Lots don't.   I like a good conventional plot, but they are normally pretty unrealistic and rest on coincidences, unrealistic character triumphs, and other artificial devices. Because of that, lit fiction probably tends more toward plotless books since it tends to want to be more "realistic." (The non-realistic literary fiction works: postmodern, magical realism, whatever, tend to have more plot than the domestic realism stuff.)       yeah it's an interesting topic, that we obviously talked about on here a lot with the Ishiguro / Le Guin flap.   I do think that it's very possible to absorb genre tropes in today's world without ever reading genre. You know? Like I knew the tropes of noir from Calvin + Hobbes comics and kids cartoons when they did parodies of them. It would be very easy to write a novel that incorporated tropes without ever having read a book in that genre (but just watched films and TV shows and what not).    I haven't read it yet so don't know, but I have a copy on my table and it has blurbs from Terry Gilliam, Alan Moore, and Jeff VanderMeer. Seems pretty awesome.         	200

But I think we wouldn't need to be too focused on flexibility; we just need a principle-based rather than a rule-based system which would accommodate dynamic outcomes. You seem extremely well versed with the fundamentals of what would be necessary to create such a system. Drawing a contrast to the present economic system, how would you go about creating a social balancing system from scratch which would have a chance of being practically efficient over 200 years?                        *pew pew*  "Hey John," *pew* "how's the kids? heard Eddie got detention again."  *pew* "oh you know. same ol' same ol'." *pew pew* "these suppressors are great huh?" *bang*      Creating a horrible sequel to a good movie.   No you need Ricin.         Orderly liquidation, followed by terse negotiations with creditors.   And then the fire nation attacked    Because it didn't join the army.

Should have used a tortilla    I know! A fire hydrant!   And then the fire nation attacked.   And then the fire nation attacked.   I see where you're going with this. You're saying that the current economic system is still far from fully mature. Hence any attempt to emulate it with a reputation system would be beset by the same imperfections. Hmmm, good points.  Here's where I'm coming from. I'm an investor/analyst working for a billion dollar fund. Basically, I've noticed that broadly speaking, optimal capital allocation is a balance between allocating resources for maximum financial gain and achieving the best social outcome for all stakeholders. I'm not sure what the equivalent is in economics, but that's what it is in investing. However, while it is intuitive to strive for the maximum financial gain on the resource end, typically striving for the maximum social gain is counterproductive to finance. So my conclusion is that there is a lack of accountability for the social side of things in the present economic system (i.e. currency) which fails to take into account the social balance of things, which is why a positive social action is reflected as a negative in a financial context - where optimal capital allocation is represented by something in the middle. If we could create some kind of system of accountability which comprehensively describes both sides of the equation, we might be able to increase productivity by leaps and bounds, as it might reflect in full what financial accountability (i.e. economics) only represents half of. Think of it as what general relativity was to gravity - the former being a more complete representation of reality than the latter to describe reality. You could even win a Nobel prize for it, as this would have immediate and discernible impact on every large company on the planet.   What are your thoughts?   People Eating Tasty Popsicles?    I think the fact that you need to define 'ethical' shows that your opinion is not a widely accepted standard.      that sounds like internal justification for what you want to do. On an absolute ethical basis, it does make you a shitty guy. If you have to convince your conscience, 99% of the time it's unethical.    you make very good points. We can already see how karma, even without financial incentives, have bred karmawhores who upend the system with reposts. I get what you're saying that the difficult part is tracking down the perverse incentives. Hmm. But perhaps the reputation market will right itself to a significant extent, as the financial market has to at least offer a utilitarian system. Do you have any personal "secret" insights about economics which you wouldn't mind sharing? (for instance, one which might not stand up to peer review)   I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think you have where I am coming from. I'm suggesting a complete change in perspective. You mentioned this:   How would social value not be arbitrary? You're talking about picking a way that things "should" be and providing an incentive to bring reality more in line with that ideal situation, no? Well, the problem is that people don't agree on that ideal. They're never going to precisely agree.  Well, putting aside the 'how', my suggestion is *to* find a way to make social value not arbitrary. Yes I know it sounds impossible; I'm just putting forth an axiom. *If* we were able to do that, then we could make social goodwill accountable and hence tradable as a form of currency, right? And there would be innumerable good resulting from having such a system. So how do we do that - make social value accountable?   Again, I realize how impossible it sounds, but my point is to find a way to make social value as accountable as financial value. I was wondering whether someone of your stature might have any ideas, or would be interested in such a discussion.   Yes but you could just as easily say the opposite. Boils down to whether your glass is half empty or half full.   Well they prevented a nuclear war, gave us personal computers, created the Internet, pioneered the longest era in history without war... while we had Tumblr? Priorities...   In 1965, we weren't worried about going alone to the park.   You'd just be invaded by a coalition of governments and be forced to produce potatoes under torture.   A more feasible plan would be to build a mercenary army with potatoes as trade. Potatoes are the cheapest form of calories, so controlling the supply would guarantee you a stream of loyal soldiers in poverty territories. Trade potatoes for favors and arms with the most corrupt people on this planet. You could then trade those as currency. Protect yourself by surrounding yourself with your zombie horde (until they decide to drop a nuke on top of you)   Please elaborate on what your friend told you.   What about the supply chain? Global headquarters? Am army of part time workers and their associated legal obligations? The building and overhead? Material costs are usually not a restaurant's biggest cost.      Yes, but if we were able to institute a system which provides proper accountability to social value, then it wouldn't be arbitrary. The problem now is that such accountability doesn't yet exist, hence we turn to financial measures to record them, which obviously doesn't provide adequate incentive. If we could work out an economic system which rewarded social value as much as currency  rewards trade value, I'm sure we coild start working something out.   Yes. All you need is to reach critical mass and the resulting fission reaction is self sustaining.    235 is used because it has a special property which most heavy elements don't have, while still trends remaining a heavy element.    It would only kick one child.   I was thinking more along the lines of creating accountability for social value. Some way or currency we could use to recognize goodwill so that we could store it and reward it a realistic manner. Like you said, recognizing social standing as a currency would incentivize socially positive acts by individuals in society. It would make charitable acts feasibly economical on a large scale where financially it may not.   One day you should pour both out into cups and switch the contents. *diabolical laugh*   When the alternative is liquid death, I'd take name calling any day.   Antarctica?   Interesting.

Talking ad nauseum about another guy is probably an attempt at gently letting you know that she is not interested in you romantically.

That would be awesome but no de-contamination chamber. In the most general sense, "closed" just means that it is only accessible to library staff and the public can't browse the shelves. Closed or not most libraries try to have climate control, as extreme temperatures, humidity, etc. are awful for conservation. This becomes more important for rare books/manuscript libraries.    Also the light is a big issue. If it were up to librarians, there wouldn't be any windows in libraries at all. Take for example [Herman B Wells Library](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/u8bS2__uK8-jaeX1AM4xxg) at Indiana University at Bloomington. It was designed without windows because it was intended as a closed stacks library - meaning patrons would have to ask library staff to retrieve a book for you. This quickly didn't happen because most students wanted to be able to browse the stacks. So, they opened it up, but still no windows. Almost every rare book/manuscript library will be closed stacks though, and I find many European/British research libraries tend to follow this model as well.    Yes.

My mom, brother, and I were in the United States for one summer and had taken a trip to Cedar Point in Sandusky, OH - not our home town. It was a hot day and we took a break to sip some beverages on some "jungle cruise" type attraction. The host of the ride was engaging the passengers and asked where everyone was from. It came round to us and we said our city in Japan. The guy in front of us then turns around, and says, "Oh, are you with BlankCompany?" Which was correct, and odd as most people assumed military. My mother affirmatively; he then asked our last name. She then, somewhat hesitatingly replied. He then asks, "Where's Librarnox'sDad'sFirstname." After we got over the shocked silence, we find out that this was the guy who had been doing our taxes for the last 5 years. My mom knew his name from paperwork, but had never actually met him IRL. To add another layer, he wasn't from Sandusky either, I think he was from Pittsburgh or something.  Oh, and just the other week, my soccer coach from Japan showed up randomly to an event at my place of business - in the mid-western United States...

There's plenty of apartments there!   5:00 to 9:00 - The event itself is free and its $10 for 10 tastings (for either chili or beer!), $20 for a wristband for 30!  Breweries 50 West, Blank Slate, Great Lakes, and Rivertown will all be there.    The tail was full of demons.   It was boring until my brain was on autopilot and I slammed on the brake as though it were the clutch...  Luckily just jerked my friend around a bit. I love my stick.   Level 5 and 9 are low enough that it wouldn't take terribly long to get back up there quickly if you just want to start a new character. You could play a new Siren - you're fully up on the skill trees and what works well. If you want something more long range, Zer0 is good, but I find that he works best when paired with another character. Axton's turret is bonkers, and can be used to good effect - much more in the thick of things. And I do have to put a good word in for Salvador - he is fun as hell to play. But I always love berserkers :)   The Gorge is great - the Hocking Hills are amazing too. Basically anywhere in Vinton county - the least populous county in the state!   I feel 100% confident that Mozart would tweet the shit out of everything. And be a selfie king. This is the same man who wrote [Leck mich im Arsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leck_mich_im_Arsch), or "Lick me in the Ass."   This. thisthisthis. It was a low point in my life when I had to essentially put a used tampon in my purse for later disposal since dude-bro didn't have a trashcan in his bathroom. This was just at a random party. Do this even if you don't have a female significant other.  	31
       Any luck?          Lawyer.    When do they lose the second head?    Fascinating.  The only ones I've ever been to have been easily accessible, this has been the most challenging one. I'm going to London next weekend; do you have the GC.    Yup, White Edge. Beautiful area.    This one is actually on White Edge. You do have a great view of Stanage from it though.   	10
 reddit fired someone, people are pissed, a few subreddits have gone private as a result.   Yep. This pretty much transcends gender and has a lot more to do with Lee being such a famous author and such a notorious one.    At this point, reddit would be smarter to risk the HR fallout and talk about what happened then let people continue to cook conspiracy theories about it.    I've worked hard to be pretty fucking lenient about what qualifies as "world politics", but this is fucking ludicrously not politics. It's not even *remotely about* politics.   Might as well start taking posts on Jim at the local McDonalds and how he's totally shafting people by only giving them 2 squirts of ice cream instead of the mandatory 3, or something.   Wait, harper lee's a chick? I always thought she was a guy for some reason.    it's beautiful is what it is. I haven't seen hardly any shit-posts hit the front page all fucking day. It's been all either interesting content, or content i could acknowledge is interesting to someone.   It's like how a park is always empty right after a big storm and you can go hang out and ride the slide without any asshole kids looking at you funny for doing it.   That's alot of "might" and "maybe" and it presupposes that the intelligence we create is both able to be modified in such a way, that we'd have the know-how to do it, and that it isn't able to bypass it by some means. That's a tremendous, enormous risk.   I'd honestly rather have an AI that had zero safety precautions in it than one with half-assed ones, because the one with zero we at least *accept and know* is dangerous. It's just like how bicycle helmets increase injury: if you think you're safe, you take unnecessary risks.   It also, of course, presupposes that we're not stupid enough to have it accidentally destroy us with our own, perfectly reasonable requests. Which i have no faith in, personally.    Yep. And if you're some mentally ill kid who wants to be famous - this is the easiest and fastest way. Grab a gun, go blast some people, instant fame, attention, and even internet fan girls.    Displays a marked lack of imagination:   1. People have survived jumping from bridges before. While it's typically fatal, it is by no means universally so.  2. When Ariel Castro killed himself, i threw a little party to celebrate. Not every death is a tragedy.   Also, why no phone number on the sign? "Make the call! Hope you know the number, though..." - that's just poor implementation!    I think that - among all the literary genres - horror is the most flexible and most pliable in terms of format. That said, i think most creepy pastas are basically in the same vein as lovecraft's "At the Mountains of Madness" - a "true account" from the perspective of someone who's discovered something abnormal and either wants to document it or warn others off.  The other big format would probably be the "letters" format - where people communicate back and forth about some strange happening.   both are pretty venerable formats, although updated to the modern age in the form of web pages and text messages instead of scientific journal entries and letters mailed back and forth.   I find how much reference material i need is directly related to how interesting the project is.   it's always surprising to me when someone's attacked in a parking lot - It's a big open area that tends to have people arriving unexpectedly, and all that.    Indeed so. A mass shooting is the single most efficient way to have the whole country talking about your agenda.    That is my fear exactly: that they have an agenda they want to push, rather than any interest in doing honest science.          Sure, and when it convinces someone to let it out, everyone can be very surprised.    I'd just rather not be here when it transitions to the next step, if it's all the same.    It's like having a sealed metal can of an unknown substance sitting on your desk. The person who gives it to you tells you it can be anything from an elixir that'll let you live forever to sarin gas to bubonic plague to distilled water to a cure for cancer - or really anything at all.   Would you open it, if you felt the threats were authentic?   It's like that, only it's with the entirety of life on earth. Creating a new *type and form* of intelligence is unprecedented and totally unpredictable. To even experiment with it is dangerous, because we have no idea if we could *contain the experiment*.    Pointless to even try to gauge the risks or come up with mitigation strategies. You can't defend against what you cannot understand nor quantify.   It's inevitable that we'll have a GAI at some point, and when we do, whatever happens after is anyone's guess.    That's how i feel about it. The guy probably got scared that whatever he had before is worse than what he has now (which ain't much).   I wonder if you could truly call this theft, or extortion? Or some combination of the two?    The palestinians live in a paradise compared to the american south post civil war. The south was in ruins - and there was *no help coming*, and *no one gave a damn*. It is not an apt comparison to say they were anything like the palestinians.    that was possibly the darkest music video i have ever seen.   put another way: in 2012 there were 14,827 murders in the US. This would represent .8% of them.    Yeah, different people value stuff differently. Like i have no problem paying even for a game that's totally free (dwarf fortress) because i enjoy it so much.   nonsense, it's full of bad scary news because bad scary news gets clicks.         I just post the news and let the site decide, but it's pretty depressing how the site decides sometimes.   Well, Canada *is* america's hat, so i can see how it'd be appropriate.    Ramen + mixed vegetables + egg. you can make a pretty passable dish out of those 3 ingredients mixed together (or separately).   Alternatively, Spaghetti, cheap pasta sauce, mozerella cheese + bread. Make a bowl of dipping sauce out of olive oil, serve with the bread. It'll class up an otherwise simple dinner.   Edward Lee is 100% pure amazing.    Indeed so. When i gotta piss and am out and about, my first thought is not getting filth on me from the typically filthy bathroom, and my second thought is relieving myself and getting the fuck outta there. I could care less who's in the stall next to me.   That's true. There's a lot of doom-and-gloom and malthusian thought in environmentalism; we should be focusing on mitigation and adaptation, not how bad things are going!    Urinals are fucking disgusting anyway; i hate even seeing them, let alone *using* one of them.   that's how i feel about it. Hopefully this puts an end to the matter (but somehow i doubt it)   Seeing weird clusters of murders like that always makes me a little suspicious.    I wouldn't spend 25$ on it because it's not worth 25$. It's like saying "why won't you spend 25$ on this hershey bar?" - because a hershey bar ain't worth 25$. Nor is Hearthstone.      That's pretty much how i feel about it - the shotgun's actually my corpse-recovery weapon of choice, because it is so indiscriminate with regards to hit location.    It's not to bad, really. I mean it's got a horrible signal-to-noise ratio, but it's not really fury-inducing for me.   considering how horrifically corrupt and inept the brazilian government is, i have little faith that anything'll be done past enriching a few embezzlers.      Surveillance perhaps, to establish her routines. An unfamiliar party wouldn't just show up and stand in the road in the woods with a loaded gun and hope some random stranger happened to walk or jog past before too many passing motorists noticed them, would they?  it'd be more likely they were driving along and happened to see someone out alone, if it was a stranger. Target of opportunity and all that.   Honestly, i don't even know what to do with someone like that.    What's creepy is when it happens once - and then never again.      Not only evil, but disgusting as well.   Definitely possible; Gacy dominated the news for a long time. His dying before being caught helped keep him out of the spotlight (though the trials of his accomplices were big news at the time, i gather).     That's actually kind of amazing, really.   Oh no, that's .5 seconds of the catholic churches income!    They prefer to be called "former dolphin" or "retired dolphin" i believe.   I kind of doubt it for a few reasons.  First, most biker hits are loud, messy, and obvious. Biker gangs survive on fear, so they tend to not be very subtle in how they kill people. They'd mow her down in a public place or fire bomb her house or something, not just shoot her in the head on a quiet road.   Second, how would they know where to find her to do the hit?   Third, if they were tied up with a gang enough to get killed over it, you'd think there'd be some mention of that somewhere. It's not something they could keep quiet.    From what i gather, a few things contribute to his lack of notoriety:  1. He happened before serial killers were a big media phenomenon  2. People in the area have largely just tried to forget him   It's pretty legitimately difficult to find someone actually *worse* than Corll. He's almost in a class of his own.      To me what leapt out about this article was this aside:  Wilson's death was the fourth murder this year in the town of 23,000 people, Armstrong said.  that seems pretty high considering it's only july.   My skin looks normal in real life, but in photos it always has a kind of reddish tint to it. I don't like it.      Definitely a bit of that.   Indeed so. Much of the past will be forever a mystery to us because of just that.   I'd honestly prefer we study him until we learn whatever we can to help predict and prevent people like him from acting, and then just execute him. He's got no business being alive, let alone sitting in prison eating food and watching tv and living a decent quality of life.   There's a few things.  Firstly, it sets up a divide between gun owners: sporting users and self-defense users. divisiveness is not something to be fostered.  Secondly, it opens the door to excluding or limiting weapons based on their (perceived) sporting use. Anything that places a limit on the type and form of firearm that can be made or sold is inherently wrong.   You think brevik can be rehabilitated? For that matter, you think he deserves a *shot* at rehabilitation?   Probably either someone who knew her, or a thrill killer.   If it wasn't accepted and believed by *someone*, it'd not be published.   I have no clue what they used on the video, but if that's the real world version of CSI's "enhance", we got some distance to go before life imitates art!   I'm not particularly surprised no one got involved - it happened very fast. And, I'm not sure that getting out of your car to get involved in an altercation like that is the right choice; what if it was a setup to steal a car by luring someone out of it and just hopping in and driving off?   Got anything meaningful to contribute?      I'd just find other crazy mis-identifications it has and point them out, too.    I think whenever someone commits a really hideous mass crime like that, they should be given to the US to deal with. We got ways, and all that.   i think the challenge would be finding a serial killer who was not, in fact, pathetic.   Truly so. And a true romantic, if the letter he wrote to his (deceased) wife and left in his desk is any indication.    If i could clone one human a thousand times, it'd be Richard Feynman. Maybe he wasn't the smartest man on earth, but he was damn clever and a very good communicator.   Jet fuel is a fuel and not particularly corrosive. I am not surprised it can't melt steel.  Now fire, on the other hand - that'll turn steel into putty.       Livestreamers  are a constant rolling shitshow.   As a side note, as someone who's done some software development, having "superfans" of the product is probably the single most double-edged sword in existence. They can do great advocacy and get more people to adopt your product, but they can also be total fucking nightmares to work with because they can be very demanding and entitled.    Livestreamers  are a constant rolling shitshow.   As a side note, as someone who's done some software development, having "superfans" of the product is probably the single most double-edged sword in existence. They can do great advocacy and get more people to adopt your product, but they can also be total fucking nightmares to work with because they can be very demanding and entitled.    In theory we can learn alot about the past, but much of it is conjecture and there's no way to really prove one way or the other that what we think happened is what really happened.  For example - going by fossil evidence by it's nature omits evidence that wasn't fossilized. This is a serious omission, because some types of tissue and some types of environments just do not fossilize well.    Stewies more forgivable to me because family guy is such an exaggerated, over-the-top type of show. Plus since the episodes are barely connected, it's alright that he's had zero character development.  Bender on the other hand...      I will never forgive the NRA for pushing guns for "sporting use". The sporting use concept has done more harm to gun owners than almost any other gun advocacy i can think of.   The NRA can go fuck itself: it'll never get my money and it'll never represent me.   Right? I mean I would show up with the assumption i wasn't going to get hired, just because of how many applications they toss and how good their selection pool is. Why not hire the very best, if the very best are knocking down your door to work there?   Bender is like Stewie, if Stewie was even less likable and had fewer redeeming or sympathetic traits.   There's generally two kinds of assholes on TV shows: Lovable losers who are messed up but good hearted, and unlovable losers who are just annoying. Bender is (about 90% of the time that I've seen him) the latter.       Must have been a horror show on that train.      Honestly i'd probably like new episodes, but the old episodes i've seen so many times i can't stand them now.   I used to like futurama, until cartoon network played it into the fucking dirt during adult swim.   Was big news a few months ago, if i remember right. Damn strange, and a real shame.   Evidently, quite a bit.   I'm surprised one's worth that much dead, honestly. I wouldn't think they'd be good eating.         we survived *200 thousand years* without oil or coal or what have you. I'm sure we'd pull at least that long again without them, in some form or another.   Hell, it may be that "modern life" or "technological life" is just a total anomaly that'll collapse and be forgotten across the time scale of humanity.   It'd be great. We could give them billions of dollars, and then their (corrupt) government could just lie about emissions, and everyone would feel great about themselves.   At this point, there's almost nothing that i can think of that would convince me to have cable TV. It's just nothing something i can ever see myself needing or wanting again, because the value is just not there.      oh man, i don't keep track at all.   [This is a fairly recent study on it](http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2012.pdf) - PDF Warning.  I think the most important thing to take out of that is this line, though:  "Currently, no comprehensive national database or tracking system exists to systematically document the toll in death and injury of murder-suicide in the United States."  as to gender breakdown, though:  Of the 378 homicides, 288 victims were female, 89 victims were male, and the gender of one victim was not identified.   and that sounds *about* right, to me.   Pretty much how i feel. I don't condone murder, but if the man was killed, i have to think it's a case of him getting what was coming to him.   His family should be humiliated to even mention that they knew the guy, let alone that their his family.   Pretty much. After the fucking chinese wrecked american manufacturing, this place turned into a fair approximation of hell with more greenery. Once you get into the smaller communities, it's drugs, teenage pregnancy and neglected buildings as far as the eye can see.      Policing is a limited resource. There are not - despite what people think - infinite investigators, funds, and forensic capability to throw at every single case. Especially decades cold closed cases of suicide.  There are *plenty* of *actual* [unsolved murders](http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/catch-a-killer/) in seattle - they should be getting the priority, not another dead junkie-rockstar.   I gotta google news alert for murder suicide, and the amount of stories that hit it is fucking *astounding*. And it's almost always something totally tragic like this, too.   It's almost like hygienic standards that say "don't crawl in mud" exist for some reason. Who'd have thought?    As always with these sorts of could-have-been weapons, i wonder not how successful they would have been, but rather what complaints the troops would have had about them.       [Or maybe this guy should be working on some of the *actual* unsolved murders Seattle has.](http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/catch-a-killer/) Of course, solving the murders of people who aren't rich and famous doesn't get you spots on documentaries.   nice try, i'm from appalachia, that looks like most of the communities in the area.   It's gotta be an interesting place, but i so rarely hear about it in the news.    Yeah we should totally deregulate the healthcare industry! That worked out great in the era before regulation, when they sold radium water as a cure-all.   God forbid we be more like nordic countries, which have some of the happiest, most satisfied citizens on earth. Clearly it must be hell to not worry about bankruptcy everytime you get injured, right?   sure, if you're rich as fuck and don't mind spending it on doctors, we have *great* healthcare.  of course, if you're not rich as fuck (or don't feel like dropping thousands of dollars a day when you stay in the hospital) then we're not so awesome.   can't be worse than what we've got now.   If it's not reproducible, it's not science, it's something else.   practically the definition of [Thesus's Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) at this point:  Now, all that can be seen of it is a skeletal frame   the Calypso was in the Singapore harbor when a barge accidentally rammed into it, sinking the boat to the seafloor. It took days to bring it to the surface   I mean the boat's been severely damaged, sank, stripped of it's entire outer hull. All that's left is the inner frame and a few parts. I'm not sure that you could call it "The Calypso" and be honest if it was restored - it'd practically be a new ship!   I'd argue it's more *inaccurate* than sensationalized, but i could see how someone would see it that way.   That's a very good question, really.    It's gotta be so incredibly demoralizing to the people who live there and to the utility crews. I mean i can't even *imagine* living in conditions like that.       that's pretty bone-chilling. What level of suffering couldn't be justified by saying "maybe society will profit from it some day"?   i took the title straight from the article - i did not sensationalize it.   This is nothing less than amazing, man! This would have saved me SO MUCH frustration building multiblocks, keep up the great work    I left the title as it was hoping it'd stir some of this sort of discussion. My first thought on reading her account was that she must be living in pure mental anguish.   And most heart-breaking:   Death feels to me not as a choice. If I had a choice, I would choose a bearable life, but I have done everything and that was unsuccessful, she said.  It sounds exactly like every other chronically ill person who seeks an escape from their torment.    The story of the "Volunteer Legions" is a pretty interesting one, and this is a pretty interesting artifact of it.         you can just go [Full On](http://www.ruffwear.com/Products/dog_packs) if you want your dog to be useful in the field. At least you can make the little punk carry his own gear!  My favorite dog-cessory is actually [Cut Armor](http://www.hardcorehogdogs.com/Cut_Gear.html) - it's used by hog hunters to protect dogs from the hogs, and looks pretty insane.   This is why they should wait for the 4th of july to launch - at least they could claim it was a fireworks show, then.   It's baffling. Assholes like that live in a world 100% of their own devising, and have no meaningful contribution to make to the discussion other than highlighting how ignorant some people can be to the truth.   I always preferred hobbes anyway.     Indeed. Plus, negative framing: they didn't have to *prove* anything, they just had to shit on Kerry and people put the onus onto him to prove that he was innocent, rather than on his accusers to prove his guilt.  In that kind of environment, the winner is whoever has the best PR team, not the best man.    A fitting name. I'm pretty sure most people i've told about him don't really believe me, or think it was a 2-3 time event, not something that happened on an on-going basis for many, many years to many, many people.      that's such a whitewashing of history it's staggering.   Jokes on them, they say "international banker" and i envision some swiss dude, not a jewish dude.   side  bonus, foraging will raise your survival skill nicely.   I've always found the worship of Xipe Totec particularly interesting because it's so over-the-top brutal.   Yeah, this is Mr. Smith goes to Washington level of naivety.  That's how i feel about the entire hype-train surrounding sanders, honestly.    To me the situation with John Kerry showed how absolutely powerful framing can be.   I believe it. It would seem that there'd have to be a very careful balance between getting power to the piston vs. venting the pressure. I'd also bet that malfunctions would be frequent      I don't know shit about israel - my guess is that the isralie government would simply refuse them immigration or deport them if they caused any problems.  Other than that, doomsday cults have in the past left. Notably the Jim Jones cult left america. It just all comes down to where they go and how much trouble they cause when they get there.     getting between a fracker and their money is like getting between a rabid bear and it's food. You just can't win.   That's exactly how i look at it.   For a real challenge, try finding *anything* with ask jeeves!    yeah, if Okinawa was any indication, an invasion of the home islands would have been a screaming nightmare for everyone. We'd burned most of tokyo down and were firebombing japanese cities left and right, but it still would have been an awful struggle (i recall hearing estimates of a half-million dead american soldiers!)   I think by that time *everyone* was done with the war and ready for it to end.    I'm guessing it's fine - bad players will be self-selected out, anyway.   I'm a big Lana Del Rey fan.   Some people can beat Doom in 15 minutes. Doesn't mean doom is an easy game, just means with experience you can do it faster.  	150
 Oh. This looks really, really bad. The silly slow motion scene with the bullet, the totally tiresome sound effects in these kind of new trailers, the music, and of course the superficial action scenes they probably had to cut in to compensate the total lack of anything of value I guess this movie has.   No, I don't have any reason to limit myself that way. Even if I'm not a big fan of a specific actor, I would never refuse to watch a movie because that specific actor is in it, I think it's better to be more open-minded and not refuse to watch movies because of certain actors. There's of course some movies I would rather watch than some others, but I don't have any need to have a definitive list of actors that I absolute refuse to watch.   Kes (1969) by Ken Loach. The cast for the film had authentic Yorkshire accents, which isn't maybe the easiest to understand.      A little bit of trivia:                *"In a 2013 interview, director Ken Loach said that, upon its release, United Artists organised a screening of the film for some American executive and they said that they could understand Hungarian better than the dialect in the film."*   While I like Tonari no Totoro (1988) more, have you seen Gake no ue no Ponyo (2008)? It's also directed by Miyazaki and could be up your alley too.   A good one! One of the better war movies, especially when it comes to portraying the real horrors of war. It's very dark, dirty, haunting and has a great atmosphere.   I can think of Le manoir du diable (1896) by Georges Mlis. There's supernatural things happening, but not really any death.   Ten of the best/my favourite ones:      * Eraserhead (1977)      * Hxan (1922)                       * Les diaboliques (1955)             * Les yeux sans visage (1960)                 * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                      * Onibaba (1964)               * Possession (1981)           * Repulsion (1965)               * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                  * Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)               There's certainly not many good ones, but I would go with Antichrist (2009) by Lars von Trier.   I have the 2-disc set from Artificial Eye that also comes with Krhozat (1988), but I don't remember where the screen came from exactly, I think I've had it on a computer for a while.       I would just take it as your favourite director that has at least one movie in the collection. Andrei Tarkovsky for me.   One example is L'eclisse (1962). The end is known for being a bit puzzling for many people, but if you haven't seen everything before the end, it will probably be even more puzzling, especially because the main characters the movie is about aren't present at all near the end. You really must have seen the whole movie to be able to put the end of it in some context at all.   Liverpool (2008).   I don't just like a long film because it's long, time is irrelevant for me. Why I like Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)? Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of the uncompromising outlook Akerman had with the whole movie. It has pretty much everything I love. Static shots, no soundtrack, toned down performances, long takes, depth, important things to say, a very unsentimental story and just a lot of everydayness. The compositions are clever and smart. The color palette is also very stripped down, which works great with the whole form. It almost the epitome of "show, not tell", since it's not that much dialogue either. I really like minimalism, and Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) does it perfectly, but still has great depth in both its character portrayal of Jeanne and the images overall. It's probably one of the biggest and most interesting portraits of a woman in the history of cinema. The portrait of Jeanne is both down to earth and realistic. We really get to know her and suffer with her. It's an important movie both as art and social commentary, mostly because of Akerman's depiction of the role women have in society, what we expect from them and the alienation to society and life. It's a feminist masterpiece if you ask me.         I like when directors manage to catch the hugeness in the little things in life, which I think is something important in cinema. Akerman even had a theory that you have to look at things long enough to really see them, which is a thrilling point. Just like Tarkovsky, the movie has a sort of disruptive feeling of time. When something has that and keeps me thrilled at the same time, I simply have to embrace and love it.        I've watched all those, I also mentioned that No Country for Old Men (2007) looks quite okay. I'm more of a fan of cinematographers like Motokichi Hasegawa, Sven Nykvist (mostly his work with Bergman), Vadim Yusov, Gbor Medvigy, Gianni Di Venanzo etc. When it comes to the newer ones, I prefer Liao Pen-jung, some of Christopher Doyle's work, and Fred Kelemen for example. When it comes to movies like Skyfall (2012) or A Beautiful Mind (2001), I feel that they have that typical Hollywood look that a lot of newer movies have. The specific color gradings, the use of lightning, sometimes too much brightness  for my taste and sometimes not that kind of contrast that has a lot of depth which I like. I'm just not too much into the way those movies look. Sometimes it can do much with the directors certain cinematographers work with, so maybe it has a lot do to with that. If Deakins worked with Lav Diaz or Tsai Ming-liang, then the result would possibly be more something for me, I don't know. As I said, he's not bad at his profession, I simply don't want to put him that high up on my own list.   Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good book to start with.      First of all, I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not going to say anything about it's quality, but it still makes me a bit worried and hesitant about it, especially if you know what kind of movies tend to get high ratings. You shouldn't take the IMDb Top 250 that seriously. There's a lot of shadow accounts there, trolls, corrupted votes, people that only use 1 or 10 when they vote etc. And also, any Tom, Dick and Harry can make an account on the site and start voting. I'm not saying that every single user is doing this, but there's absolutely no reason to take the list and the ratings seriously. A big part of the people on IMDb belong to the general public, and I have always felt that the general public isn't the definitive consensus to trust when it comes to cinema, especially not when it comes to a website with that kind of rating system. It's anyways always much more interesting to know what people think about movies if it's those that I know have watched a lot of them, have a lot of knowledge, have studying movies on a more critical and serious level and have a big bubble of references, than just some total strangers I don't know anything about. The IMDb Top 250 is a list by the general Internet public (and possibly some corruption), it's nothing you should look at with a too serious eye. Of course, it's much about taste too. But I think one should have in mind what you are dealing with. For example, people tend to upvote some of the big and newer Hollywood movies like crazy.   Of course, just what I said. I can't say I like how movies like The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Skyfall (2012) and A Beautiful Mind (2001) look for example, but Deakins did a better job with No Country for Old Men (2007) to name one. He's good at what he does, I'm just not a huge fan of the majority of his work and how it looks, but that's just my taste. So yeah, there's of course a ton of movies that look much, much worse too.   I'm a bit tired of the whole thing with sequels, prequels and remakes in Hollywood today. So I'm not that anticipated for it. Incendies (2010) by Denis Villeneuve wasn't a bad movie, but I can't say I liked Enemy (2013) or the mediocre Prisoners (2013) that much. On the other hand, he is a much better choice as a director than a lot of the other ones working in Hollywood today. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Roger Deakins either, but there's a lot of worse cinematographers out there too. I'm absolutely going to see the movie though. Blade Runner (1982) is a classic, but not one of my favourites, it will still be interesting to see what will be done with this one nonetheless.   I believe the person meant that the movie will be based on the novel by Philip K. Dick.    and there was one I watched on Amazon prime about a woman who became a photographer in the late 1800 early 1900s but the title is eluding meat the moment.         You probably mean Maria Larssons eviga gonblick (2008) by Jan Troell.   I don't believe it was chosen at random. As I said, the symbol has been imprinted in the culture of Japan for a long time now. You can see it in a lot of places today. Especially in Japan, from lanterns to Buddhist temples. Even the Ku Klux Klan used it. I didn't say it was a direct reference to the clan, but it's worth to read about it and know that it's been used for a long time in different parts of the world. I haven't seen the movie, but since I know it's about the history of Japan and war, it makes more sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series.   Here's my top ten films that are non-English:                1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)      3. L'eclisse (1962)      4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)       5. Tanin no kao (1966)       6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       7. Suna no onna (1964)       8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)         9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       10. Stntang (1994)      But yeah, a lot of the foreign films were and still are way ahead of Hollywood in so many ways, especially in this day and age. Most of my favourite movies are not English language ones, it just happened to be that way for now. There's so much good foreign stuff. And of course, a lot of bad. But what's good is quite superior if we compare it to Hollywood. It's the same with directors for me, some of my favourites for the moment are Andrei Tarkovsky, Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, Michael Haneke, Kenji Mizoguchi, and Yasujir Ozu. Right now I'm quite into Japanese cinema, particularly from the 1950s to 1970s. It's almost like a constant project going through foreign/world cinema and discovering and watching films from all over the world, it's interesting and fascinating. And when it comes to overshadowing, it really shows how much foreign cinema is overshadowed if we compare it to Hollywood in a subreddit like this. Not a surprise though, just a thoughtful remark.   I don't believe it's a reference to the games, it's a very old symbol that has been around in Japanese culture for a long time. And because this is a movie that's about Japanese history, it makes pretty much sense that it wouldn't just be a reference to the game series.

It's hard to take the majority of people on those boards seriously. There seems to be a lot of trolls too.   Thanks! I totally missed that this is coming before you mentioned it. Pre-ordered it today! I can't wait now!   And he's holding some Ozu.   1. Paris, Texas (1984)       2. Naked (1993)      3. A Woman Under the Influence (1974)       4. Down by Law (1986)     5. Do the Right Thing (1989)           * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)       * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      * Zerkalo (1975)        ICheckMovies has some great and interesting lists. Otherwise it's through books and various film sites etc.   Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975).   Potential for anything good? Not really. Not if it's going to be in the exact same vein as the previous movies. I feel that it would just be another mainstream franchise that outstayed its welcome. The series was a financial success so far, so I won't be surprised if it actually comes back. I'm just very, very doubtful to the whole thing, but that's me. Especially kids these days would probably like it though. I'm certain that the Shrek series has its fanbase, that's one thing that's sure. If you ask me, I would gladly be without it.   That specific quote seems a bit vague. It doesn't say that much for me. Sure, films that scar, make you feel something, stick with you or anything similar are usually those you remember the most and probably stick with you the longest than those movies that are mindless entertainment that you forget about the next day, but it can differ from person to person. People always look for different things in movies, it's always going to be that way. I think Michael Haneke had a great quote going on:        *"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience."*     I have to say I agree with Haneke a lot.   I don't usually look for something specific and written in rock that a horror movie must have for me to like it. It always depends on what a horror movie does and how it does it, that's the main thing. It can be depth, interesting ideas, playfulness, a great atmosphere or anything that just makes me appretiate it a little extra. Horror movies are mostly best when they're not typical in their genre, but rather challenging, innovative, playful or just about anything that makes them stand out in a good way. I guess it's like with any genre, so it's hard to say. I like for example Possession (1981), Repulsion (1965), Spalovac mrtvol (1969), and Onibaba (1964).          Now, Funny Games (1997) is maybe more of a thriller than a pure horror film, (and the boundaries can be discussed to death) but that's a great example of what I would like to see more of. Movies that are thinking one step ahead and actually have something interesting to say.   Which one are you referring to? Do you mean Lt den rtte komma in (2008) by Tomas Alfredson which has that as the English title? If you do, that's a Swedish movie and not a German one.   Som great and essential ones in my opinion:        * Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972)     * Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1968)       * Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)      * Der freie Wille (2006)       * Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)       * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)        * Faust: Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926)        * Faustrecht der Freiheit (1975)       * Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)      * M (1931)       * Metropolis (1927)       * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)     * Stroszek (1977)        * Tagebuch einer Verlorenen (1929)         Keep an eye out when it comes to directors like Fritz Lang, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, F.W. Murnau, and Wim Wenders, they have done some of the best stuff when it comes to German cinema. Especially Fassbinder, what a man! He has done many, many great movies.   De ofrivilliga (2008) is like Sweden and typical Swedish people in a nutshell. It's almost scary.   He's done some good stuff. With no doubt one of the best and coolest directors from Hong Kong for the moment. Maybe even overall. Chung Hing sam lam (1994), Fa yeung nin wa (2000) and Chun gwong cha sit (1997) are my favourites by him.Especially Fa yeung nin wa (2000) must be one of the best films post-2000. I really like the lightning in several of his movies and the use of colors. He's also good at contructing interesting characters that aren't simple and flat, but rather nuanced and at the same time giving the audience both small and fundamental questions about them. There's usually a lot of emotions in the films as well. I'm a bit curious and worried about his latest feature film, Yi dai zong shi (2013), the one about Ip Man, I have to see that one soon. It looks a bit different than some of his other movies. I'm not really a big fan of martial-arts films, so that could also be one reason for my hesitancy.      When it comes to tracking down Kar-wai's films on DVD, it's quite easy. Criterion Collection released Fa yeung nin wa (2000) on Blu-ray too. And his other ones shouldn't be too hard to find if you look on Amazon and similar sites. I'm happy to help if you have trouble finding something!           And if we are speaking of similar films, the ones I can think of for now are these three:         * Bin-jip (2004)        Kim Ki-duk's movies are mostly either a hit or a miss for me, but this one is probably his best. There's very little dialogue, but I find the relations of the characters to be something similar in the vein of the movies by Kar-wai.              * Ai qing wan sui (1994)      More dialogue than the Kim Ki-duk film, but Tsai Ming-liang is much better when it comes to having sparse dialogue. One must check out Tsai Ming-liang if one likes Wong Kar-wai! Ming-liang isn't as straightforward, but I always feel the need to recommend his films. And there's also that similar feeling when it comes to interactions with the characters.           * Stranger Than Paradise (1984)        Jim Jarmusch has that special coolness that we can see in Kar-wai as well. Very likeable stuff!       I don't know if you have seen these three, but it will probably show!   It feels like the majority of the movies in that list are big movies people already know of and that already are quite popular on Reddit, for example The Godfather (1972), The Green Mile (1999), Reservoir Dogs (1992), No Country for Old Men (2007), American History X (1999), The Shawshank Redemption (1994) etc. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I would love to list some crime dramas that are some of my favourites outside of that list too:        * Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)      * Blue Velvet (1986)       * Du rififi chez les hommes (1955)      * Le doulos (1962)       * Le samoura (1967)     * Le trou (1960)     * Pickpocket (1959)     * Pierrot le fou (1965)      * The Limits of Control (2009)       * Touchez pas au grisbi (1954)        None of these are that obscure either, but they're not as well known as some of the big Hollywood classics in the list from the link, so maybe someone discovers something new from my recommendations as well.   Sayat Nova (1969) by Sergei Parajanov is a great one. It's a stylized, surreal and beautiful biography of the Armenian poet Sayat Nova. Parajanov was more interested in revealing the poet's life in a visual and poetic way rather than literally. One interesting fact is that Sofiko Chiaureli played six different characters in the movie. There's no real dialogue or any camera movement either.   I agree, this should be a standard everywhere. It would especially benefit those who have impaired hearing too.   A cracker. According to the Silent Era website, the survival status seems to be unknown, same with the current rights holder. Even the following is stated on the site: "It is unclear whether this film was actually produced."      Your best shot will probably be to come in contact with the production company, Regia Kunstfilms Co. and/or DFI (Danish Film Institute) and see what they say.   Nobi (1959) by Kon Ichikawa is great. War, starvation, absurdity and chaos.   I wouldn't say that always suck, it really depends on how they are made etc. But there's of course a lot of bad examples. On the other hand, Andrei Tarkovsky made some of the most amazing dream sequences ever. Zerkalo (1975), Stalker (1979), Nostalghia (1983) and Offret (1986) have all great and beautiful dream sequences.   Ingmar Bergman really said it:       *"Tarkovsky for me is the greatest (director), the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream."*   Get some from Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema), they have a lot of great movies. L'eclisse (1962), Pickpocket (1959) and Seppuku (1962) are some that I really recommend.    Not your favorite movies, but the ones you think influenced the filmmaking industry, or are perfectly told stories.  That's making it a little irrelevant, complicated and strange. It's not always that or this way. Someones favourite movies could be perfectly told stories, the perfectly told stories one prefers could be movies the person thinks influenced filmmaking in big ways etc. Reasons can hang together and differ. For example, my favourite movies are the same as the ones I think are the best of all time. So here they are:        1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)        2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)     3. L'eclisse (1962)      4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      5. Tanin no kao (1966)      6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)        7. Suna no onna (1964)         8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       10. Stntang (1994)          Krhozat (1988) is great and there's a lot of rain in it.    He would often ask his actors to perform the same scene 60 times in a row, until all pretensions of acting and "constructedness" would disappear and what would be left were the words, plain and simple.      This isn't completely true. It's mostly a rumour people spread around, that he made them repeat something like that so much. In Ingela Romare's book about Bresson, there is a long interview with him where he said that it's false and just rumour about his way of working. He simply made his models utter a sentence and asked them to not think about what they were saying. He could also ask them to think about something else than the content in what they were saying.        I think you are missing a lot. First of all, to understand Robert Bresson you have to forget all about how a film "should be". I suggest reading Notes sur le cinmatographe (also published in English as Notes on the Cinematographer), there you will find his own kind of "rules", formulas and guidelines when it comes to cinema. He used it a lot in his own films. Robert Bresson despised the way in which the majority of films were made. He was of the opinion that the majority of cinema was filmed theatre, that's why he created a new sort of film language, his own cinematography. I would also suggest to not even think of comparing Lynch with him, that's just pointless from the beginning. Both of them have made some great films, but they don't have much in common at all. To make it easier, Bresson's style doesn't have much in common with much at all.             Bresson wanted to separate cinema from the theater, he stripped the cinema to only the bare essentials. He was quite interested in other artforms, such as literature and painting, so much in his style is influenced from those fields rather than film. Look at the acting for example. The people in Bresson's movies were called models by him, he didn't want to call them actors at all. The point with his kind of "acting" was to make the models say their lines in a kind of automatic way, which didn't have focus on them making a performance, but rather acheiving automatism. In my opinion, this also had an effect that made it subtle, powerful and raw. And therefore it also left room to fill the characters with your own emotions, aside from those you already got from the beginning.       The people in his movies were taken from life, Bresson required that they didn't have any connection to film or theater. Have in mind that I mostly speak of his later films now, his earlier movies were not made the same way. Anyways, he used people which were not taught to be natural. Classic acting had a learned naturalness, something which was absurd to him. The people in his films were supposed to be (models), not pretend to be (actors). Bresson even tried to not use the same model twice. Everything from the theatrical expressions was meant to be taken away, that was the point in which Bresson wanted to bring out the authenticity, a realism in the way of just being human. Facial expressions, movements, gestures and voices, everything was supposed to be as neutral as possible. This is something that was the total opposite of typical acting, because Bresson felt that typical acting was closer to the theater than to cinema. A person who has been indoctrinated in the theater when it comes to expression, that person can't show genuine emotions on screen, that would just be emotions that have been learned, which equals fake emotions. Bresson was interested in the purely "physical" in people. He didn't tell which feelings he wanted his models to show, he just gave them physical instructions such as how the model should move, what the model should look at etc.        He was also a perfectionist and a minimalist. That means every image, sound, move etc. is supposed to be there and has its own meaning of being there. This is why many of his movies are a bit shorter than your average flick. This guy stripped cinema to the bare essentials, but still managed to make huge art. The thing with Bresson is the special relationship between images and sounds together with important questions about human beings, it's so special that you won't really find it anywhere else, not like in his movies. It's just pure film magic in my opinion. Some people can watch films all their life and still not understand Bresson, which isn't shocking at all, because you really need to study his style to truly understand him, I'm almost certain that you barely scratched the surface of this man and his movies, especially if you think his visual style is "dull", that it's "lacking" and when you say you don't see the point. Study, read his book, watch his films, and examine critically. This can take years, but understanding Bresson isn't something you do after two or three of his movies. It takes time. We are not talking about taste now, have that in mind. We are just talking about understanding. I also have a great book about him by Ingela Romare, but it's in Swedish, so it's a bit hard to recommend if it isn't your first language. There may be something else you could find in English though (besides his own book). Anyways, If you have the interest to understanding Bresson properly, you have to commit and do it properly. Good luck if you want it. And don't rush.         I think it will suck too. Just like the first one. It was just silly and trying too hard. Talk about cheap jokes. No finesse or charm whatsoever.   Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz.   You maybe feel that way because the movies by John Carpenter and George Romero were a big influence on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic. Wide-angle lenses were also used to help give the film its look. The soundtrack obviously echoes Carpenter too.   Here are all of them:         * Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)         * Chinatown (1974)       * Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)       * The Godfather: Part II (1974)         * Taxi Driver (1976)       * Being There (1979)        * All That Jazz (1979)       * Alien (1979)      * Rear Window (1954)      * Zelig (1983)       * Cabaret (1972)       * Paper Moon (1973)       * Jaw (1975)      * Lawrence of Arabia (1962)       * All the President's Men (1976)        * 8 (1963)        * Citizen Kane (1941)        * Days of Heaven (1978)        * Animal House (1978)       * Mad Max 2 (1981)      * The Year of Living Dangerously (1962)      * American Graffiti (1973)       * The Terminator (1984)       * Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)        * The Exorcist (1973)        * The Graduate (1967)        One of the best westerns ever made. Amazing soundtrack and memorable characters. A true classic that's very rewatchable. I got sad when I heard that Eli Wallach died. It's almost been a year now.   It was quite silly, yeah. But I didn't really expect it to be great, especially as Nolan never impressed me before. I find him quite mediocre. I have been talking about it in some threads before, so I'm probably going to repeat myself, but I disliked Interstellar (2014) mostly because Nolan seems to be unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. But that's probably because the film is so flat and empty that there isn't anything left to leave to the viewer. To make it as unsubtle and clear as possible seems to be Nolan's last hope of deceiving himself and the audience that there is something in the movie and that it's smart.       Matthew McConaughey's character is paraphrasing and saying that the world only consists of crafsmen, but lacks of visionaries. That's quite funny, because Nolans doesn't really have any visions at all.        The soundtrack by Zimmer is also all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had ancient gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of silly crying.       About the IMDb Top 250, that's something one shouldn't pay attention to at all. Everyone can make an account and start voting on that site. A lot of the votes are corrupt, people create fake accounts, some users only use 1 and 10 when rating etc. It's hard to take it seriously, the whole top list is better off being ignored. Another thing, you don't have to be missing something just because you didn't like a movie, it can rather be the movie that's missing something. Everything doesn't have to be so single sided.         Hulu Plus seems to be something for you. They pretty much have nearly everything Criterion released and some more. Fandor and Mubi could be something worth looking into also. Another thing to consider is visiting libraries, they actually have more stuff than you think. It's of course not the same everywhere, but it's worth a shot. Don't forget about YouTube either, you can find a lot of classic films there. Many are in the public domain, so those are free and totally legal.   George Clooney's first film wasn't From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). He started acting in the late seventies, made his first role ever in 1978 (in a mini-series) and his first movie role in And They Are Off (1982).   Threse three are great and a lot more mature than the typical fantasy stuff:         * Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987)       * Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)    * Ugetsu monogatari (1953)          Wu Wu Mian (2015) by Tsai Ming-liang, great short. You can watch it here:          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MJ68jedKc   Ten of my favourite ones:      * Eraserhead (1977)      * Hxan (1922)                       * Les diaboliques (1955)             * Les yeux sans visage (1960)                 * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)                      * Onibaba (1964)               * Possession (1981)           * Repulsion (1965)               * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)                  * Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)               It's going to be a lot of movies for you if everyone is going to give you three films from each year starting from 2000 until now. And of the ones I have seen and rated from that span, I haven't given a single one more than a 4/5 rating, and those that got it are less than forty movies all together. So I'm going to give you fifteen of the best films I have seen from 2000 until now that I really recommend:         * A torini l (2011)           * Book chon bang hyang (2011)     * Cach (2005)      * Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)              * Fa yeung nin wa (2000)      * Mies vailla menneisyytt (2002)      * Mulholland Dr. (2001)        * My Winnipeg (2007)      * Ni neibian jidian (2001)        * No Quarto da Vanda (2000)        * Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       * The Act of Killing (2012)       * The Limits of Control (2009)       * Werckmeister harmnik (2000)           * White Material (2009)         I'm not really surprised.    This Transient Life (1970)        I have to rewatch that one soon. So damn good!      Yaju no seishun (1963). Seijun Suzuki did some good action in the 60s.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   I haven't seen Transformers (2007) yet.   No female character's dream, big motivation, ambition or idea, is really truly their own. They're not really independent. It's quite interesting to consider that the role of Murph was originally written for a male too. But that later changed. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that the independence of the women in the film only go so far as to make it work mostly for the big male figure in their existance. The women are dependant on their so called hopes to make their special big male figure proud, and in the end also to complete his lifelong dream, not really their own.      Much of the movie moves along according to men and that they are the dynamic ones, which leaves women in reactive positions. Every woman seems to be forced to hold onto the hand of the big male figure that abandoned them. None of the women would have their ambitious striving without a so called strong, adventurous, independent and lovable male lead. To make it short, this is just some of the problems the movie has, so I hope I have given you some answers to your curiosity.   I agree that it's overrated. I dislike it mostly because Nolan is unable to tell with pictures. Everything is already explained with dialogue and/or voice-over, there is nothing left to the imagination. There is nothing that is subtle. The soundtrack by Zimmer is just all over the place and so pompous and nobby that it feels more like a parody. On top of that, the screenplay had tiresome gender roles, doubtful New Age philosophy about love and a lot of crying.   The movie you are looking for is Kurutta ippji (1926) by Teinosuke Kinugasa. Good stuff. I recently got it on DVD, but the transfer wasn't really that good. It really deserves a nice restoration, a Blu-ray release would be amazing. It's just sad that the existing print of it is missing a big part of the film too. By the way, when it was screened in Japan in the 1920s, it would have included live narration by a storyteller or so called benshi as well as musical accompaniment.   This is what you should be looking after:         * A torini l (2011)        * Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      * Krhozat (1988)      * Nattvardsgsterna (1963)      * L'amour  mort (1984)        * Le feu follet (1963)       * No Quarto da Vanda (2000)      * Offret (1986)        * Petla (1958)       * Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986)        * Stntang (1994)        * Viskningar och rop (1972)      * Werckmeister harmnik (2000)        Woody Allen.   One of the most beautiful movies I've watched this year is Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). Amazing cinematography. It doesn't make it worse that it's a very complex and interesting look at sex, history and politics. It's what I would call aesthetic perfection! Some user here on Reddit posted an album with screenshots from it, here is a (NSFW) link: http://imgur.com/a/MAxel            I'm guessing it could be Rak ti Khon Kaen (2015) by Apichatpong Weerasethakul. But if Lav Diaz, Michael Haneke and Abbas Kiarostami all come out with a new film this year, it could be one of theirs.   Easy one. Max von Sydow. One of his most memorable roles for me is as Karl Oskar in Utvandrarna (1971) and Nybyggarna (1972) by Jan Troell.   "Top-tier" directors is maybe subjective, I would for example not put Guy Ritchie anywhere near the top of anything. And well known doesn't always mean that someone is good, so we have that part too.  But to answer your question, I think Jeanne Moreau would probably be the hardest one to beat in the first place. Just look at this list of the directors she has worked with:   * Michelangelo Antonioni     * Luis Buuel    * Louis Malle       * Jacques Becker    * Marguerite Duras     * Tsai Ming-liang    * Jean Renoir        * Rainer Werner Fassbinder    * Manoel de Oliveira       * Franois Truffaut     * Marcel Ophls       * Joseph Losey       * Orson Welles    * Elia Kazan       * Theo Angelopoulos     * Wim Wenders       Bronenosets Potemkin (1925) by Sergei M. Eisenstein. The ultimate one. One of the most influential films in the history of cinema, the montage techniques in it are as relevant and important today as it was in the 1920s. Early propaganda movies from the Soviet Union is what you should look into if you want to see montage editing at its best.   Il sorpasso (1962). Great road movie about an impulsive and extroverted excitement seeker who meets an introverted and straitlaced law student. A hell of a ride.   Have you seen Smultronstllet (1957) by Ingmar Bergman? If not, that is the ultimate one.   I think it was because of the cover art and/or the extras.   Der Himmel ber Berlin (1987) is probably the best one. A great portrait of the contemporary West Berlin from the eighties.       Some other ones that are very good:         * Der letzte Mann (1924)          * Despair (1978)           * Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979)        * Die dritte Generation (1979)       * M (1931)       * Possession (1981)        Worth mentioning too:         * Germania anno zero (1948)        * Menschen am Sonntag (1930)      * Variet (1925)          I would also recommend to check out Fassbinder's massive and epic Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) if you have the time. It's more of a mini-series, but was made to be a single film, so the limitations can be discussed on that part, but it's a very interesting depiction of Berlin in the late-1920s. All hail Fassbinder!   It was already announced two months ago, it was just postponed a bit.      Mulholland Dr. (2001) is a must watch.   None of them. I watch what I want to watch. I have never used those sites to be sure if I should watch anything or not.      Some of my absolute favourite war films:              * Apocalypse Now (1979)        * Csillagosok, katonk (1967)        * Idi i smotri (1985)       * Ivanovo detstvo (1962)        * L'arme des ombres (1969)         * La battaglia di Algeri (1966)        * Lacombe Lucien (1974)        * Nobi (1959)       * Paths of Glory (1957)       * Popil i diament (1958)        * Voskhozhdenie (1977)           Solyaris (1972), the best movie ever when it comes to space and science fiction.   I think I would choose Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969). It would probably be amazing.   Favourite actress: Setsuko Hara     Favourite actor: Chish Ry          Favourite director: Andrei Tarkovsky        Favourite movie: Der siebente Kontinent (1989)          I rather feel that bland visuals, no emotions, doing many things and the loud and clear message also applies to movies that aren't independent. I can see these kind of things in both independent movies and the big mainstream blockbusters from Hollywood for example. So the so called mistakes are quite common in pretty much films of all kinds, I don't think they should only be paired together with movies that are independent. The indie label just states that a movie is produced outside of the major film studio system, completely or partly, it doesn't actually say anything else, something that many people believe. Also, if someone feels that a movie is incomprehensible, it doesn't have to be the director's mistake, it could rather be the viewer's fault, something worth to remember. It doesn't always have to be that one sided.   1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)       2. Book chon bang hyang (2011)      3. A torini l (2011)          I don't know where you got something Japanese from. Maybe you answered the wrong person? Funny Games (1997) is an Austrian movie in German. The remake is in English.   Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) by Lav Diaz is the best movie I've seen from the last two years. Really great. I can really recommend it.   Yeah, you could say that.   It's not really that different. Actors and the language aren't the same, but that's mostly it. They're both directed by Haneke. The remake was just aimed for the American audience.      Funny Games (1997) is some good stuff.   Yaj no seishun (1963) or Buta to gunkan (1961).   Some of the better ones working today:     * Abbas Kiarostami           * Aki Kaurismki        * Aleksandr Sokurov          * Apichatpong Weerasethakul       * David Lynch       * Hirokazu Koreeda      * Hong Sang-soo        * Jafar Panahi       * Jean-Luc Godard        * Jim Jarmusch        * Lav Diaz       * Michael Haneke    * Pedro Costa           * Peter Greenaway     * Tsai Ming-liang           I can't see the real challenge in it. It isn't as hard as you may think. Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972), Tky monogatari (1953), La libertad (2001), Le rvlateur (1968), Bu san (2003), and Akibiyori (1960) are some examples I can think of after some seconds. And they don't have any certain plot holes really. Also, there's a lot of more experimental/avant-garde movies that could fit, same with many shorts. My examples were movies with a more standard narrative though. It all depends on where you want to draw the line and how picky you want to be.   My favourite is La jete (1962) by Chris Marker.   * Andrey Rublyov (1966)     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     * Stntang (1994)       It sounds like When a Stranger Calls Back (1993) by Fred Walton, could it be it?   Naked Lunch (1991) and Where the Buffalo Roam (1980).      I don't think it's odd at all. I think it's rather great that people dress however they want when they're directing a movie and not going after some special dress code. There's no reason for it. It can get rather hectic, hot, excruciating and stressful on a movie set, therefore people probably show up in what feels best and comfortable for them in that kind of situation. Taste is also subjective.   La jete (1962) by Chris Marker and Je t'aime je t'aime (1968) by Alain Resnais.   Here are five of the best ones I have seen:       * Csillagosok, katonk (1967)     * J'accuse! (1919)      * Paths of Glory (1957)    * La grande illusion (1937)     * The Big Parade (1925)           Still hoping for Woody Allen.   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. A true masterpiece.   Some great examples I really like:  * Les rendez-vous d'Anna (1978)          Anna, a female director is on tour for her newest film. She goes from France to Germany and back to Paris. While in Germany, she travels around there a bit and we get to see the people she meets.           * Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)      Kawamura is a professor touring Europe. He meets Naoko, a married woman living in Paris, scarred by the Nagasaki atomic bombings. A romance blooms and they travel around Europe trying to find themselves.          * Stroszek (1977)         Street singer and former mental patient Bruno teams up with a prostitute and an older man to travel from Germany to the United States in search for a better life.          * Topio stin omichli (1988)        A road movie about two children (Voula and Alexandre) searching for their father who dissapeared, but is supposed to live in Germany.       You have to check out Posetitel muzeya (1989) and Pisma myortvogo cheloveka (1986) by Konstantin Lopushanskiy. Both have a very similar post-apocalyptic vibe. Lopushanskiy also worked as a production assistant on Stalker (1979).   Dreyer! Thumbs up. Such a great movie.  	121
                                                    thank you for clarification duely notted for future about arxiv.   	18
 Thanks for erasing the last .1% of doubt I had that this whole story was BS.     	2
 I know that, it was just a joke.      No no I'm sure you do! I just haven't met many and those who are don't really seem to like to talk about it.    I suppose that is true, women do seem to respect men and women the same.   I'll be your friend! :)   	4
 video is not working    I don't think they kissed in the tunnel.   All he had to do was use a little flaps.  Correct procedure makes a big difference.   What were they doing?   Where did the guy go so quickly?  he only had a few seconds and then explosion and tones of debris.  Edit: Just realized they cut it right after he left you can see the lighting shift just a little.   wow that is an amazing theory.  but wasn't she using that moon tea and wouldn't they have noticed while she was in prison and when she was walking naked through kings landing?   What makes you think she is pregnant?   I think that came after or only a tiny bit before the red wedding though.   Which passage are you talking about?  I would love to see that.   Yea and it can be cost effective for the airport, I don't know why more of them are not doing it.   I just noticed in that video he says "slightly below nominal" right after he reads off the altitude.   Can't forget with the suborbital Mercury flights they were pulling around 10g's I think.   Yo encontre esta mapa de las rutas de autobuses en Puebla.      Thats how I feel Nobody really knows what to expect.      Can someone explain what we are seeing? Are the early cutoff those plumes of smoke?   There was a slightly early cutoff?   Does anyone else think that it landed really close to shore?    It looks like they could have used a crane to recover it and if there had been crew inside they could have walked/swam to shore.         Astronomers can do a suprising amount with Earth based observations. For instance they have made accurate estimations of the [mass of Pluto and Charon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto#Mass_and_size) by obserbing the orbital periods.  Using [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) they can also learn things like the composition of the atmosphere.  All of these things are great, but all of them can be improved on greatly through a mission like that of New Horizons.  First of all you can measure things that are not possible to measure with ground based operations, like wether Pluto has a magnetic field.  You ask what is so important about a magnetic field?  Well the properties of a magnetic field can give you a great deal of information about the interior structure of a planet.  One of the biggest things a close up mission like this can do is give you clear pictures of what the body actually looks like.  This gives you a lot of science on its own.  Up until now this [picture taken by Hubble](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Pluto_animiert_200px.gif) is the best one we have had of Pluto.  The flyby wil give us incredibly clear images of the planet that should give us all kinds of information.  Since this is the first Kuiper Belt object we will fly by we don't really know what to expect.  That is part of what makes this mission so amazing, for the first time in decades we are getting ready to fly by an object we know very little about.  It is comparable to the first time we flew by Mars with [Mariner 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_4), the first time we flew by Jupiter [Pioneer 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10), or the first time we flew by Uranus and Neptune with [Voyager 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2).   TLDR:  There is no substitute for close observations of a planet and with the different instruments on board we should be able to extrapolate a lot not only about Pluto and its past, but about many other Kuiper belt objects.   /r/Puebla esta abierta horita.   Venga a /r/Puebla horita esta abierta.   Come check out /r/New_Horizons we are posting updates all the time.   /r/Puebla es la nueva lugar de este Subreddit / /r/Puebla is the new location for this subreddit.   Hola todos y Bienvenido a /r/Puebla!!! Esta es el primer anuncia del subreddit y Qu mejor da para abrir esta subreddit de Cinco De Mayo!   Yea I understand that.  If it does pass I sure hope that it gets struck down.   I strongly believe that when punishment starts to become disproportionate to the crime people loose confidence in the system.  It is hard to believe that someone might get jail time for this and that they would have to register as sex offenders.  These rulings are proof that our judicial system is broken.   Happy Cinco De Mayo Everyone.  If anyone has any questions, comments, theories about Pluto, please post them.  This will be our first comment thread.   yea i found the tarantino one after i made this post.   I don't get how this is constitutional?   Wow I did not know that, thanks.   Yea I get that and i have been throwing caution to the wind more lately.   Where did this rule come from?   I thought she was married?   I have about 70 hours and I got my PPL about 2 years ago.  Its a bunch of fun.    My best advice to you as a new pilot is never get complacent.  Be exact and precise and most of all be cautious.  When you start to feel like you have got it all down and start to push the envelope is when it will come and bite you in the butt.  Their are old pilots and their are bold pilots but their are no old bold pilots.   Can you link them?   That was pretty good for your first landing.  I had a "death grip" on the controls according to my instructor during my first lesson.  I probably could not land it like that until I had 10-15 hours under my belt.  You should post this over at /r/flying.  We love to see new pilots over there.   Yea I just pulled 5 off the top of my head.    but if you have feelings for a girl, show/tell her. You'll find out quick whether she feels the same.  I have been realizing this more and more.  I have been going with the theory that i have nothing to loose and it has been working out for the most part.   But sometimes either a guy just does not realize a girl is interested, or they value the friendship more than the 5% chance they might become their girlfriend. The least a girl can do is give bit more hints.   I think any of the basic three emergency services (police, ambulance, firefighters) really should never ever be denied to someone no matter the fees or insurance or whatever. They're emergency services, surely you can fight about money after the emergency has been dealt with.  Those things are great, but they are not free.  Who would pay for them?  I understand why you think this is messed up, but no one would pay if they could just pay when their house is burning.  The problem you have here is a classic [Tragedy of the Commons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).  If you were to play the good guy and put out the fire for free, than word would spread and everyone would stop paying their fee.  You may say well maybe they could pay a big fine afterwords for putting out the fire without paying the Fee.  That would not solve the problem for two reasons.  One the Fire Department needs a regular source of income to stay operational.  You might go years without a fire in a rural area like that and without a source of income the fire department would close for lack of funds.  But the very next year you could have 10 fires and nobody to fight them.  The second is I bet many of these people living in these rural areas would not be able to or unwilling to pay the fine which would be huge on the order of a few thousand dollars.  They would say "All they did is spray some water! Why does that cost 10,000 dollars?"  I think the obvious solution here is to change the $75 fee into a tax.  That way everyone pays for something that is beneficial to everyone.  This is precisely why we have taxes, to fund basic things that everyone needs but would not pay for on an individual basis if they were not forced to.  Everything you do everyday is paid for by your taxes roads, schools, bridges, police, and yes Fire departments.  I think this is a perfect glimpse of the kind of things that happen in a country with "small government" and little to no taxes.  Imagine if we lived in a country like that where we let peoples houses burn down because they didn't pay a silly fine.  Imagine if we lived in a country where we let people die because they could not afford health insurance...  ohh wait we do.  Edit: I would honestly like to know how you think we should pay for these public services?   Exactly what is cheaper building a new rocket or cleaning up and fixing an old one.  This is why Elon puts so much emphasis on rapidly reusable.  If you have to refurbish the whole thing before the next launch it gets to be just as or more expensive as new rockets and you have to start to question why you don't just make a new one.  Fingers crossed for good results from landed booster when they go to test it.  Rapid reusability could change everything.   This is exactly the problem with public companies.  A lot of times it does not matter how much money you make in the next year, it matters how much you will make 5-10 years from now.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZIzreiseMk  Actually the scene was a little bit plausible lol.   Yea I am just surprised that this is not included.  It would be like if we gave people felonies just for being arrested, and then they were felons until they got the proven not guilty in court.   Yea in the US it is the other extreme.  Business is king.   How do you learn to fly one of those? Do they have trainer versions?      I read [this story recently](http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/crime/colorado-woman-sentenced-lying-police-about-kidnap-and-rape-never-happened) about how a man was falsely accused and because of it lost his job and was not able to find a new one because of the accusations.  This is not the first time I have heard of this happening to people, where they face retribution at work for crimes that they have not been convicted of.  My question is how is it legal to fire someone for a crime they have not been convicted of?  What has happened to innocent until proven guilty?  It is not like this is in the shadows, many companies even have policy of not hiring anybody that has charges pending against them.  It sounds like now even getting accused of a crime is enough for a business to fire you.  They don't even wait to see the results of a trial.         I know where I work the driver who you tip keeps the tips.  There is no tip pool or anything like that.  So if you decide you want to give a driver a 10 dollar tip he gets to keep it and you have really made his day.   I was under the impression that Mellisandre was just a temporary POV which we have seen GRRM do a few times in the recent books.  And when I mean central character I mean central to the overall plot of the series.  He has killed off main characters like Catlyn, Robb, Joffrey, Robert, and Ned.  But those characters while central and important, were not the same as Characters like Daenerys and in my opinion Jon Snow.  In my opinion the books are about certain characters more so than others.  I think Daenerys is obviously the main character of the whole series and on the second level I think Jon Snow, Tyrion, Arya, and Bran, are all central characters to the overall plot of the books.  I am not saying that these characters could not die, but I am saying that in my opinion these five characters are much less likely to get killed off than other main and POV characters who are more incidental to the plot of the books.   Yea I understand that OSM is not trying to be the next Google, But i feel like if we are going to get people to start using OSM it not only needs to have the data, but it needs to be convenient to find that data and use it.  I think OSM has been doing a great job at improving the quality of the maps, but I feel like the different applications to make that data useful to the average person, are still lacking.   Wow That is a little suspicious lol.  That might explain the scared/rushedness lol.   Not really during launch and assent,  there were barely any options for abort,  add that to the risk of foam and ice hitting your heat shield like what happened with Columbia.  A great of example of the lack of abort options was shown with Challenger.  If that had happened to Apollo than the abort system would have kicked in and the crew may have survived.  Challenger did not have any abort options during that part of the flight.   How does having the door come open cause that?   I still think he is not dead.  I don't think GRRM would kill off Snow he is one of the central characters, and the only POV at the wall right now.  I thought Tyrion was dead when he got pulled into the river.  GRRM Likes to leave you on cliff hangers.   I also remember them mentioning that Stannis tied some deserters to a trebuchet and was prepared to launch them out of Storm's End while it was being sieged.   I feel like the number one reason that i don't use OSM for my everyday map searches and stuff is because the search function in OSM is so bad.  Unless you type the name exactly as it is the search comes back wrong.  Usually i will do my searches in google just because it is so inconvenient to try and figure out why OSM is not giving me the correct results.  Does anyone else have this problem?  How can we fix it?   I agree I have a hard time believing that the Governor of Texas is this stupid.  I feel like there has to be some other motivation.  Maybe he feels like this will help him in election season.  He can say he stuck it to Obama and protected Texas.   That is a whole other matter.  I am so done with money in politics.   What will be the stupidest possible outcome, it if they ban the lantern thing because of this.  I am so sick of things getting banned or heavily regulated because of some silly accident.  Life isn't safe or perfect it seems like everyone else in the world knows that why can't we figure it out in the US?   I really wonder how far it will go.  I think eventually if it does not stop the Republican party will either split, or become irrelevant.  In the case of the latter the Democratic party will move more and more right until it eventually splits basically returning things to the norm.  That is my theory anyway.      That makes me smile, I don't know why.      http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/cruz-tries-blame-obama-2008-crash?CID=forwardprogressives   How did you do?   Progress and ATV are both capable of docking where the ATV is shown in the diagram.  All the ports are the same on the Russian side.  In fact when progress comes its more or less default location is the rear docking port where the ATV is in the diagram.     Ohh i get what you are saying, dragon is attached to the bottom front not the front.  I forgot about that.  I guess you could move the docking adapter and attach dragon to the end, but that would be a bunch of extra work.   Thats what gets me whenever people say that it is facing the wrong way to do a boost, The station is not stationary, they can and they have flipped it around, it would not be unheard of to turn the station backwards in order to preform the boost.    Dude you need to spell check.   I honestly feel like taking a company public in this day and age is like giving it poison.  It might not kill it in a year or even 10 years, but it seems like companies always begin to go downhill after they go public.  It becomes all about increasing profits and not about the product anymore and it just seems like these days all investors care about is sucking money out of your company, and when it dries up they move on to the next one.    Although I would love to invest in them, I am super glad that Elon has made the decision to not take SpaceX public.  Investors would turn it into another ULA and completely kill off development in anything that did not show the potential to be profitable within 5-10 years.  It would completely kill what makes SpaceX SpaceX.  I think Elon has even hinted in interviews that he knows that this wold happen if he were to go public.  He just uses more polite language.   I would say the Dragon V2 reveal and now the Tesla Power wall have both been big hits.  I think they have been doing a pretty good job.  You also have to weigh in the fact that Elon is becoming a bit of a star so people will naturally want to hear what he says.  Just having him him do the presenting creates hype around whatever it is he is presenting.  Even if he stammers here or there, the enthusiasm shows through, and it feels genuine.  Personally I thought the Dragon V2 reveal was great, and while the Tesla today wasn't as smooth, it was just as exciting.   I thought progress could refuel Zvezda?  Is that wrong?   I recently read an article where they were talking about how they actually have been having a little too much water lately, and have been having to store it for longer and longer amounts of time.   So why don't they try to utilize it more?  Unless I am wrong NASA pays the same amount weather the Trunk is empty or full, and adding some unpressurized boxes with food would not cost practically anything to develop.   I completely agree I think the central problem to our system right now is the money, and probably gerrymandering.  I think if you get rid of the money suddenly a lot of issues will no longer be issues, like climate change.   So in light of the recent events with Progress M-27M there has been a lot of talk around the subreddit about there being more pressure on SpaceX because of the lack of very many alternative cargo vessels.  There have been many questions about why SpaceX can not re-boost the station or carry more supplies and so on. My question is, why does SpaceX not try and utilize it's trunk more on Dragon?    I feel like there are a lot of possibilities for how the trunk could be used, like a propulsion module for giving the station re-boosts which could be either fired up while still attached to dragon, or removed and attached to a better spot on the station.  Maybe just some fuel tanks that can be used to refuel the Zvezda module, or stored externally on the station until they are needed.    I also think a pressurized container to go inside the trunk would maybe work.  The Canada Arm could take it out and attach it to a different docking port allowing for the transfer of more materials.  You could even go with a simple unpressurised container that you would take out using the Canada arm and store externally on the station, retrieve on a space walk, and bring in the through the airlock.  This could be stuff like freeze dried food, where it does not really matter if it travels unpressurized.  So why are some of these ideas not viable?  It has been shown that the Falcon 9 can carry more weight and still land the first stage, and with the v1.2 they will have even more available mass.  On more than one occasion the trunk has gone completely empty, which just seems like a waste.  What are the reasons behind not trying to utilize trunk more?   Yea or some sort of propulsion module that could be taken out and attached to the proper place to boost the station.   Honestly it would not be a surprise.  After all pad abort was supposed to happen in December.    Yea that too, it's just embarrassing.  I honestly think that some of this stems from Obama being black.  I think part of the reason many people don't respect him and don't trust him is because he is black and continuously or subconsciously this makes them view him differently.  its just crazy when you here things like people thinking Obama is the biggest threat to the USA and getting ready to create shariah law, or dissolve the government or something crazy.    Yea I think I can agree with you there.  Ironically though that hasn't stopped the right from calling him a monarch and a dictator.   While this may be true, I have to argue that some of the stuff is legitimate stonewalling, like immigration, and comprehensive climate change reform.   Yea before i thought she was just a charlatan, but after that chapter i realized she was completely committed to her beliefs, and some of her magic actually works.  That was a big deal to me because up to that point i thought she was faking everything.  Now I realize she just fakes some of the more flashy stuff but at least from her point of view the bigger and more difficult stuff is completely real, which is kind of terrifying.   your comment implies tyrion   That's weird it is working for me.   Yea I was going to say when was that last updated, he is way more done with book 6 than that.   Yea I thought the one chapter from the POV of the Melisandre was great.  It really added a lot of depth to her character that I did not realize was there.     I don't even remember that lol.  I guess this is where it is good i watched the 1st season of the show before i started reading the books.    I have not watched any other seasons of the show.   Spoiler!!! [Tyrion is not dead](#s)   I am going to pop the hype bubble a little bit, and ask...  What would change if Bernie Sanders was president?  The Republicans have shown that they can stonewall pretty much anything Obama wants, and Obama is much more center than Bernie.  There were some big campaign promises given by Obama, that congress pretty much shut down, like ending Guantanamo.    I really want to know, how would Bernie be able to govern more effectively than Obama?  I think he is great, but how is he going to be able to get anything done with congress the way it is?   Yea, that is how I feel I don;t get why we are hiring this company which will get a huge percentage of the profits.  I think that if they do build it they should put the tolls towards improving public transit.   How would United Airlines make that kind of mistake?  Is it a tactical decision?

This is also why safety nets and welfare are a good thing.  When a worker knows that he won't starve or loose his stuff he is more likely to quit and try and find a better job.  By giving people the option of welfare they are less likely to put up with the crap from a bad employer.   What most people that want to get rid of the minimum wage seem to forget about, is that many people that work for minimum wage are already receiving public assistance.  This basically means businesses are shifting their labor costs onto the government.  So by getting rid of the minimum wage businesses would most certainly pay workers less which is effectively just shifting more of their labor cost onto the government.    Walmart does this in mass, and the irony is many of those workers turn around and spend their government assistance, like food stamps, at you guessed it, Walmart.  Walmart has pretty much made a business out of being the place to spend your government assistance like food stamps.   I need a banana   Those electronics might still be good, if it all works I would estimate you have about $50-$100 worth of electronics there.   I can't tell whos subreddit it is so i don't know if they have been active or not, but they have not responded to my messages.  I would like to make the subreddit public and make it about the Mexican state of Puebla      I have tried reading it, but i was super bord with it, does it get more interesting as you read?   lol   My problem is I feel like the writing degraded and I felt like the plot was rushed.  When comparing the first and last book, the plot of the last book is so much less developed than the first.  The PTSD thing was interesting though.   http://www.troll.me/images/waiting-skeleton/waiting-skeleton.jpg  Still waiting for Winds of Winter   I have started to realize that he kills off all his characters to continue the plot.  Many authors jump through all these hoops to keep everyone alive.  For George R.R. Martin if a characters death is necessary than he does it.  When you go back and look at everyone who has died, you begin to see that many of the deaths had lasting effects for the story line.  One of the largest such deaths was the death of Ned Stark.  Ned's death basically began all the events for the next 4 books.  Kahl Drogo's death set in motion Daenery's story line.  The examples go on and on.     Thats How I always feel when I make posts.

We post updates and everything else related to New Horizons.    I am totally pumped for the flyby in June   Well obviously not, they are specifically built so the front does not fall off.   Something i have wondered is why don't they use something like Methane, natural gas, or propane to pressurize the tanks?  I understand that helium and N2 are inert and everything, but without an oxidizer, what is the difference?   Why can't they get rid of Helium on Falcon?   In your picture Cygnus seems more on par as far as size compared to dragon.  I don't think they are the same size in your picture as they are in the post.      If there was a mod like this it would be awesome with remote tech 2   Also you do not just pull the pants up and call it a day, that would be uncomfortable. You have to tuck the boxers down your pant legs like you tuck in a shirt. That way the boxers lay flat with the pants and are not a big wad at the top.   Also you do not just pull the pants up and call it a day, that would be uncomfortable.  You have to tuck the boxers down your pant legs like you tuck in a shirt.  That way the boxers lay flat with the pants.    Best music ever.   I think they said in the AMA that they are not planning on adding any more planets for the time being.  But honestly i would love it if they added a saturn like gas planet 2   Or it would be really cool if you could build space telescopes to make them un blurry.   What do you mean?   Yea my first rescue mission was with a space capsule that did not have a docking port.  It was also my first time randevuing.  The funny thing is I did not think to eva everyone lol.  I built this cool claw contraption using landing legs to keep the craft I was pushing in the line of thrust, and de-orbited it :D.  Then I turned around and thrusted to put my rescue craft back into orbit so it would not get deleted in the atmosphere.  One of my most satisfying moments in KSP.    That is SpaceX's niche. There are some customers that need that full 100% and that is where many other rocket company's make their money.   Silly question, but why can't they just design an engine that is very similar to the RD-180?  They have tons of them couldn't they just reverse engineer them and make some changes.   F9 is my wild guess.  Secondly how do you account for it crossing squares during reentry?   Yea but you also have to remember that the political situation has changed a lot since then.  The country as a whole is definitely moving left and as many have mentioned the electoral college favors the Democrats.  I think it will be interesting to see how Republicans react if they do loose in 2016.   They economy has gotten a lot better in the last 2-4 years, but you would not know it watching Fox News or listening to the GOP leaders.   Yea i hate when they charge you a fee so they can give you money you can only spend on campus it is a total rip off.  At least at my college you can use that money at some of the local businesses.  	138

    No singing tree?   Howard Stern stayed on air that day long after his usual sign off.  His two following shows on 9/12 and 9/13 really were just as important.  A large part of the Stern Show is that regular employees become "characters" on the show, almost like a reality show.  The 9/12 and 9/13 shows told the various experiences the staff had in the wake of the terrorist attacks, from Robin having to hitch a ride with Scott the Engineer to try to get home, Bababooey trying to get home and explain to his young kids what exactly happened, Stuttering John leaving to go pick up his kids from their school because other children were being evacuated to his kid's school, Doug Goodstein using his press creds. to go down to lower Manhattan to make sandwiches for the rescue workers, etc.      Frank Drebin: Oh, and one more thing...

    Detasseling corn in Nebraska. I started doing this every summer when I was in sixth grade. This job consists of getting up at 4 in the morning to catch the school bus that leaves at 5, riding for an hour to some random corn field, getting off the bus, putting on safety glasses and gloves, walking through the dew soaked corn field freezing cold to pick the tassels off the tops of the corn stalks.  Then in the afternoon it gets killer hot (since this takes place in July), and it wouldn't be so bad but you have to wear long sleeves and long pants to protect yourself from the corn.  Then you go home, wash off your crusty mud shoes, through your clothes in the wash, take a shower, go to sleep, wake up for supper, pack your lunch, go back to sleep...and repeat for about 2 weeks (no days off).   Did you guys have a falling out with the members of My Chemical Romance, does the song "Pretty Handsome Awkward" have anything to do with Gerard Way....or is all that drama just rumors?   nope...he lives with his parents and has tried killing himself three times since the divorce (12 years ago).   Cheating on my father and divorcing him all within a short time period.  Not because it hurt me directly but because it about killed my dad.  	5
 It's hard to say, definitely old-ass shit!   this is taste - but certainly applies to smell as well!  I have a second image in the taste category here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/16099754179/               https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/sets/72157649839698477/  Three are here, more to come tomorrow and Friday            tomorrow               Thank you, I just subscribed and will start to contribute!   This is fun, great way to utilize my photographs!!  Glad I came across this!   Wow thank you! Its only got a few simple tweaks in Lightroom   this is only sight, taste will come               Nope.  I crawled out of that hole long ago   hahahaha   oh..and Thank you!!   Hey!  Yes I am, I shoot with a Nikon D3200 and I am currently in an exclusive wide angle phase with my Sigma 10-20.  I post in lightroom, very minor tweaks to clarity, sharpness, highlights etc.  Tripod Mount ISO 100 F.13 Shutter .5     hahah what is this natural light stuff I dont know about??                  Thank you my man!!   Hey!  Thanks for posting                                                   lol   Indeed!   Thanks!!   Hey. Not on me, no. I have some unedited shots at home.  Do you have a Facebook or flickr where you post your stuff?   Thanks, I haven't done any edits yet but I will have more eventually   yes, in london somewhere, not sure where though   thanks   thank you   thanks   london   thank you   Thank you, Nikon d3200 and sigma 10-20               lol Witty McGhee!   nah   because I posted another pic of it last week, called it a piano and reddit people tore me a new asshole!!! lol  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/15959978438/   yes, here https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/15959978438/   lol   i love you guys!!                                                   Yes. The garage was buried in a corner and the cars in a box. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to put it all together!    It was very flimsy and in rough shape!   Cool cool,  good to see you here! I figured this sub was fitting to post on!   No clue of the story but i found the pic and the find very fitting for a Christmas post   Very cool   Hahahaha nice   Was a very cool find   Hell ya   Before...it was buried in a corner and the cars were in a box   Woot   Thanks!   And the mystery is solved!!! Thanks   Thanks so much!   Good question! I've always thought retro meant old shit!   Oh..and it's "because" not "cos"   Good Morning Miserable Scrooge and Merry Christmas  The tin garage was buried beneath layers of boxes and other junk and the toy cars were in a separate box, I (and many others who have seen this photo) enjoyed seeing it put together and it brought back a lot of memories for many.  After I set this up I tore it back down and put everything back where it was.  So now what are you going to say?                     Good grief.       YOU GUYS ARE KILLING ME :p   The living room of this house  https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/16079265945/  I haven't got the other pics here with me but I will be posting more in the coming weeks   Love it   Very Cool   Solid!   whoomp there it is!!!  Thanks man, appreciated   That's exactly right!   I don't batch process and mass upload - one pic a day   yes and I really hoped that the house had power, I wanted to play some of the records   It's a theme we have going in some sets, an ongoing post apocalyptic thing.  I don't expect everyone to understand :P   I'm used to comments like yours, no worries.  I come across all kinds of weird shit..I can assure you this place has been abandoned some time - the basement was entirely flooded and most every room was empty   hahaha thank you!!!   Thank You!   It's christmas time  and there was lots of holiday themed stuff and a great looking kitchen table, so we set it all up as it might have looked!   Ontario Canada   It was pretty empty except for a few rooms, but the few rooms had some cool shit!  	128

Note that the study found a life expectancy advantage to being overweight but none for being obese:   Overweight patients, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 25, had lower mortality than normal weight patients, that is, those with BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. However, obese patients, with a BMI greater than 30, had mortality risk similar to that of normal weight patients.

 I have a Sony A6000 and I've also had a few Canons and Nikons. I LOVE my Sony. The af and shutterspeed are amazing perks to their line. The only gripe I have is the digital viewfinder. But being that it IS mirrorless, what else would I expect? Don't get me wrong, they do a great job with it, however it can be a bit frustrating.   The lag isn't bad at all, but definitely noticeable when shooting a moving object.   Can anybody here refer me to the best bargain for Canvas Prints?  I want to start putting some of my work on display, and although I don't expect large 3 panel split canvases to be cheap, I am still looking for the best bang for my buck.  Cheapest place I have found so far is Costco, plus they conveniently let me upload my photos and I can preview each concept.  Any/all information is appreciated!      I saw the same sign at an abortion clinic   It looks like it could get me really high  	5
 Yeah,I thought he cut her baby out because she said she had a stomach ache and her son made a "cute" little thing. But I can never be so sure for there was not enough information.   That was pretty good, that actual scared me compared to the other ones I've read.   Your amazing! I love this story 10/10 ha ah ha love it.   I laughed too, it was pretty funny.   This is amazing!   For some reason when you mentioned the cameras, the first thing I thought of was five nights at freddy's   Always in the name of science...    I was thinking that too, because of the cold touch and inhuman strength.   This is confusing.   Maybe instead of trying to see if the Shampe was real, they could have wanted to capture it.   Of course that's normal, just lock it up somewhere before you go to bed.   Maybe you should settle down, but you probably won't listen to me anyway.   You deserve some happiness, this is the best ending ever!!!!!   hmm this is really a problem, you should go to a church or something.   How about you try to talk it out with the creepy guy on the phone, he could be death or something.  	15
 *Ahem* Ezekiel 25:20-The cherubim shall spread out their **wings** above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their, **wings**, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.   Thanks! I tried looking for it but couldn't remember who made it :(  Definitely wasn't trying to get credit for this hilarious picture, just wanted to spread some smiles!    Or I can wait 10 minutes for a half a dozen people to comment the link over and over again.    Plot twist it's a dude    Don't even think about the chafing       Damn. There goes my dream of being the next subway icon    It's heroes like you who make reading fun. Thank you, sir, for your noble sacrifice.    It's okay. I am white.    He'd be so distracted with how that joke makes no sense you could nail him right between the eyes.    Hehe. Shot.      He laughs so hard he drops the gun and you shoot him with it. Impressive turn of events.    Nope. That's only to impress a chick.    I'm no longer alone!  *cries tears of joy*   I'd rather be gilded than gelded   Shit you not my little brother said that exact thing to me earlier today    Or not really care about math class    Fuckin white girls I swear    *cough trickle-down economics cough cough*   Wait, no.

 And American men are sent to other sports like American football, basketball, and baseball.    Really depends on height also. I can gain 1 pound of muscle a week.    Done with being the tall lanky guy. Boost confidence, be stronger, be able to through my weight around when needed at work    Record bench of 250 after starting at 185 a few months ago.  Record weight of 180. I never weighed more than 170 and was 155 back in March.  Friends I hadn't seen in months noticed my bulk, talking to girls at the bar has never been easier    Unpopular thought here. When you're really skinny your BF is also low. Gain muscle and BF. Who cares if you have fat as long as it's not a gut? Cut when you get to a good size. I've gained half fat half muscle but I still look better and most importantly I'm stronger    Gotcha. I'm all in favor of donations funding it. Seems like the most effective "charity donation" someone could make    Apologies for shitty format but I'm on mobile  http://krcc.org/post/colorados-iud-program-finds-another-year-funding-still-seeking-state-support   It has already received new private funding    It's been funded again by private funds.    Pac attendence is suffering. I'm not sure how it compares to other years. Colorado is still above 90% capacity despite that embarrassment of a season    This is a comment I'd expect from you in /r/cfb    Nothing close to Jump Around in Madison. They stopped playing it and consulted with engineers to make sure the stadium could handle the shaking before bringing it back    This should become more popular, at least in America    "I noticed you haven't left for the airport, your flight is in two hours. Good luck"   Smart ring with clock and weather. Smart house with mirrors and counters that function as touch screens.    Elderly dementia patient. Said she was going to cut my guts out. She didn't have any teeth, loomed like the exorcist    Coach Folsom and Ralphie    It differs between states, Colorado doesn't have a duty to act when off duty   Our men play American football    Stupid Pao    Thanks for saying "free". Most people don't understand that.  Clinic visits play a role in preventive health but education and out of clinic programs are huge too. Things to get people moving and eating better    Like working on making society less violent.    I haven't heard anything from him about preventive medicine. Obesity related illnesses are the biggest cause of death. 3/4 of Americans will be overweight/obese by 2020. That's 5 years away. Yeah the healthcare system needs some work but it's way better to fix health at the source    Hunting is how you get bear arms  Edit- fuck you Pao!    The last 20 min are a lot more like the soccer I'm used to    [Gooooooaaaaaallllllll] (http://i.imgur.com/tT9Mo.gif)   [Americans right now] (http://imgur.com/X9DLci9)   More like 70 years    Fucking FIFA is rigged. Turning off my xbox    You wouldnt 3D print a car    Right because weed is hard to get    How else to you hang bear arms on your wall?   Yeah let's have it so only criminals have guns, that's a great idea.    No gun? Shit better grab my knife.  Why do you think most murders are in poor and urban areas? It's culture.  [A 2001 study looked specifically at 34 adolescent mass murderers, all male. 70 percent were described as a loner. 61.5 percent had problems with substance abuse. 48 percent had preoccupations with weapons; 43.5 percent had been victims of bullying. Only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history of any kindwhich means three out of four did not.] (http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/actually-know-connections-mental-illness-mass-shootings-gun-violence-83103). Do a little research instead of believing everything the mainstream press tells you.    Jeb said he took offense    Because it's not about sanders or bashing trump    ......exactly    It's not mental problems, it's culture. The minority of violent acts stem from mental illness   And we know how well that went    Ban guns and we won't have shootings!  Completely wrong. Fix our violent society.    His vision is a utopia.    "Folks who do not like guns is fine. But we have millions of people who are gun owners in this country -- 99.9% of those people obey the law," Sanders said   http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/05/21/machine-guns-legal-practical-guide-full-auto/   [CU upset OU] (http://youtu.be/WcDgVvPKzvI)   I believe you can get them with permit/certification. It also differs by state https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_United_States_by_state   Who would have expected the poor who couldn't afford insurance would be sicker? I bet obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease make up a huge chunk of the "unexpected"    I'd like to see the numbers. How much they got in fees, how much they paid to healthcare, how much was administrative costs.    It says he wants to ban semi-automatic weapons but the article doesn't say anything about fully automatic. Shouldn't it be the other way around? I appreciate that he recognizes one 0.1% of gun owners use it for crime but his stances seem inconsistent          Except most institutions are constantly barely getting by. Good luck taxing organizations with no money.    The purpose of a business is to maximize profit, and many businesses are very good at it. If forced to give people paid maternity leave, they will find some where to compensate the lost money. Possibly expansion funds (yes they exist)  or termination of other employees    California, bring all your Texas friends    Can't even have sparklers here...   The Cal game should've killed me   Fucking sefo. He's a good QB but his fuck ups cost us at least 3 games    And didn't the US win the Olympics the following year?   Not exactly him, just quite a few home town recruits leaving    Colorado over UCLA last season, double OT against a ranked team    Hey coach Mac, how about focusing a little bit more on our own state    Got hired my first try, can confirm. Although it's extremely difficult to afford living here on EMT pay       I'd drop philosophy and take it later    2 hour shipping on your weed and beer needs!    Never heard of it   I loved summerfest because they didn't do stadium seating. I stood on the bench of a table and friends stood on the table, almost face level but I could still see everything    I miss summerfest. Everyone standing on the bleachers but I can still see over them    It's a trailer sort of thing    Pollock is the best teacher though, he even won an award    North boulder, they're illegal but I'm not sure how enforced    [guns huh?](http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/9o0ttj/tip-wag---gay-rights-pioneers---gun-dorms)   Your Wisconsin is a bit drunk, looks like your trying to be accurate    Good thing it starts back up in a few years    I've broken into the fortress    That's why the front page is entirely "Sanders has big crowd!"

I'm interested in this plan, I'm sure I'll see it on the front page when it comes out    I've only met ground crew for fight for life at my ER but the north Colorado med evac crew is great too. Helicopter ems is bigger in Colorado than most states because of how quickly you can be somewhere that it takes hours to get to a hospital    defense, TSA, education. TSA fails miserably. We don't need this big of a military. We already spend the most on education. The issue with education isn't money, it's lack of a home life to motivate learning and a flawed teacher seniority system    So the tax makes money based on the amount of trade and he wants that trade to decrease which would give him less money than predicted? That makes no sense    And this is the same government you want in charge of health care    Colorado EMS has lost many people too soon this year. I'm hoping my company does something to reach out    /r/Murica   Do you not know what day it is?   That estimate is with current conditions. Add a tax and the amount of trade will decrease.

Free healthcare, free tuition etc. I haven't seen anyone do the math on if his tax proposals would generate enough funds, possibly because he's been to vague on his plan.    Why not Rand Paul?   Yes that was updated  Edit- the newa originally stated only injuries and the article updated to show the one fatality. Why downvote?   CU's season kick off for 2014 also has listed at 23rd   On the CU football  wiki, maybe that hadn't been updated since last season       Baylor    23rd in all time wins   In light of reddit recent events, posts the angriest fans of college football   I'll start with [the classic] (https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2895936/osunoo.0.gif)   If I'm doing discontinued teams then I'll do Marquette. The MU and UW combo would make heads roll    Spring football/basketball?   Yeah I saw that, it's for frats    Lurker making a post, forgive me if I missed answers to this. I played some lacrosse in high school, now finishing school in Boulder after deciding against the CU club team because of time restraints. I've been itching to get back into play and have come across some boulder leagues. I was wondering if anyone here plays in them and has recommendations. I'm not sure what gear I have left from high school but I know I'll need a new stick and helmet.    I've been on that sub a few times, they love Colorado. I played years ago but didn't have the time for our club team. There's a boulder league I'm looking at but I wish they would do intramural    Yeah our men's club could easily make the jump. I'm not saying they would be an immediate power house, but they could compete. They won nationals in 2014, lost in the final last season. Women's moved to d1 via title ix and do decently but were a shitty club team beforehand. We have everything in place for it to happen, they just need to navigate title ix restrictions. A rivalry would easily form between CU and DU.   The Denver outlaws pro team won a title recently, DU won ncaa, Colorado and CSU have recent club titles, ncaa regional was in Denver, world games were here last year. It's getting big in Colorado    Game 3 this year, Sept 19, 5pm at mile high    Colorado won nationals in 2014. They had two plays on ESPN top 10 but I can't find the video now    [Here's ticket info] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml? DB_OEM_ID=600 ATCLID=209140439). It looks like Oregon is family weekend so that's another way tickets will be harder to get. You should look into mini packs. It's $77 for 3 games but you could get better seats if you pay a bit more money. I highly recommend going to the Rocky Mountain Showdown. It isn't a huge crowd but there is plenty of hate to go around, especially with recent years.   We did, and Cross Country    What time zone?  East Coast people can enjoy a 1am match up of Colorado at Hawaii on what's technically a Friday morning    What is the most popular spring sport at your school?  Colorado has no popular spring sport but hopefully lacrosse if it gets added like Girls  lacrosse did    University of Denver doesn't even have a team. Their lacrosse though, I would go nuts if CU made a d1 team half that good    Are you in the Boulder area? Those tickets will be "harder" to come by. I say harder because season ticket holders and students won't be giving up their tickets, USC has a huge alumni base in Colorado, and Oregon has random fans everywhere.  Best advice, don't get tickets in the visitors area, those are the worst seats in the stadium. I would just go to the Folsom box office web page and buy tickets before season starts. Sure you could get some scalped tickets a few days before the game but the could be more expensive.    I haven't seen any Nebraska or CSU attire on tours. I'll see the occasional CSU shirt and people will look at them funny but that's it.  For some reason people think it'd 100% OK to never wear CU gear but always wear USC/UCLA. Even when the team comes to town they'll wear that to games. I don't give a shit that you're from LA and your dad is the dean of X California schools, you're at CU now    That's just not a person you want at the school if they were serious. Not because of being a rival fan but total disrespect of an academic institution that's taking time to consider you    As if I needed another reason to hate Ohio State fans    It would be too easy    USC    Or don't identify with a party and vote who you agree with on what issues you prioritize.

       Can I email you my resume? I've wanted to be a journalist as long as I can remember.    Bottom right photo         Genius.   Star wars, assassins creed, Batman, dragonball, mass effect.

 Into your lap? Where were you sitting when she shot him? I'm so sorry dude. That's so fucked up.    That fucking amazing! You are fucking amazing and I'm super stoked for you. You did something so few have the courage or capacity to undertake, and then you decided to follow your dreams. Outstanding! As someone who's gone through a transformation and about to follow her dreams, this helped affirm that I'm on the right path! I wish you good luck!    That's funny...I'll be in Bangkok in less than a month, and from there I'm moving to Chiang Mai. I live in the most popular city in the US right now...Charleston, SC. But not for long!   It probably has a lot to do with the fact that I work in a town full of pretentious yuppies. It's considered a 'rich town', full of million dollar homes, and people who are way above middle class. In the town I grew up in, people are much nicer, I get along with every single stranger and acquaintance. It's just whenever I get into the next town and I have to deal with all of the self-entitled yuppies....there are a lot of them, and they can be quite demanding and nasty. I treat everyone nicely though, life's too short to be grumpy! Kill 'em with kindness! :D   That's awesome! You're amazing!   I have a ton of hobbies and I usually just go knit or make some jewelry when I get bored instead of eat. My biggest struggle was people wanting to constantly shove carbs in my face and I had to snap a few times before it stopped. I love my mom, and her baking is sooo good, it seriously was torture going to her house for a while there. Haha! Cutting down my calories was probably the toughest part, but once I got used to 1200 calories it was easy. That took about two weeks. Thanks a bunch and good luck to you! :D   I did all of my own research. I started to look at the nutrition contents on every thing. I learned about how the body changes when you switch to low carb. I learned about good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. I learned that BMI is not bullshit when it's measured properly. And I learned that it takes some work to lose weight, but it really is just calories incalories out = weight loss. I suggest if your struggling to lose weight, start a food diary and get an activity tracker. I wear a Fitbit and I love it! :D   I switched birth control. Went form a low estrogen one to a high estrogen one and my body had to adjust.    I switched birth control. Went form a low estrogen one to a high estrogen one and my body had to adjust.    I've been called a skinny bitch by at least 5 women. Some times it's comes off as,"Haha! You're such a skinny bitch." But I had one woman who walked away from me and told her friend on the phone that I was a skinny bitch because I didn't interrupt her while she was checking out. All of my friends are really supportive and I've made quite a few new friends too. Coworkers were the worst, they were the petty women who told me I was just going to gain all the weight back and then some. And now that I'm more confident, I talk to more people. I always remember the nasty ones more though. I'm the awkward girl who waves at every passing car and says good morning to everybody. I said good morning and smiled to this lady leaning against her car as a ran past yesterday, and she just glared at me. I'm telling you what I've experienced, maybe it's different for you, and that's pretty cool. Maybe I should come move to your town! Haha!   Oh it's rarely direct. It's usually really passive aggressive or condescending. Or I'll say hello or good morning and I'll just get ignored. Probably has a lot to do with the fact that I normally dress and look like a teenager too. But, maybe it's just my imagination too.    I have make up on in that picture, and I was going through a hormonal imbalance that was fucking up my estrogen levels, so I look more feminine. I just woke up in the final one but my legs and abdomen are much more defined, and I'm more healthy now than then.   Yes to the first question, and it took about four months until I actually started to get excited about going for a run.   Thanks, The pictures are dated.   Just look at my legs in the 10th photo. They are getting bigger. my waist is just getting more toned because the fat is finally gone.   Would you take a moment and look at the difference in the size of my legs from photo 9 to photo 10? My legs are much larger and more defined in photo 10, and the only thing that is getting smaller now is my belly. I'm actually beginning to work on gaining more muscle and I've never felt better in my life. I have much more energy, and I even eat more too.    I actually want to start gaining, and I've been adding more protein to my diet. I don't think I have the capacity to become anorexic either. I like food waaaay too much. I love when I finish dinner and I have around an extra 100 calories left, it's chocolate and soy milk time! Or ice cream. I love me some ice cream.   Apparently me. Haha! wow.   I get that a lot.   I went to see a dermatologist and was prescribed tretinoin cream and I also did a bunch of red light therapy for them. I can't feel them either.  	20
 So, I guess the bigger question is, when will it be over. It seems as though much of modern human history is about the rights of humans-Martin Luthers thesis seem to be in the same vain in a weird niche way, so how does it end? Does it just move on to something/someone else?  Anyway, this is a great article, full of lots of little history goodies.           	4

 If it's saying your graphics driver crashed, then it'll be your video drivers. Try updating them or installing a different version.   I have a 980 too, I haven't updated to the latest version yet (that hit yesterday). And you're a good example of why I don't update everything the second it's out.   With the computer being years old, I'd **strongly reccommend changing the MB** out for a newer one, even if it isn't very good.  From personal experiance, older boards tend to catch fire MUCH EASIER. Mine set fire due to a very small (and I mean very small) amount of dust which overheated a capacitor, blew it up and caused an internal fire. If i'd of left it running while I was out, my house would be gone.  Not only this, but it may not be up to date with the hardware it's running, check and see if the MB manufacturer are still putting updates out for it and get the latest one ASAP.  Other than that, epic upgrade! ;)   The GCHQ is also working with the NSA, and are doing the exact same things in the UK, yet no one here is batting an eye lid? Why?

 Pretty good horror film that managed to glide away from typical horror film clichs, however I felt the third act went downhill a bit.   Only in earlier operating system versions.   Even though xxPielsTastyxX is correct, the flight time of the entire mission would of only been about a minute long. I attempted launching a large platform craft, however it ran out of fuel as I was hovering over the ocean. Parachutes were then engaged and somehow a big piece of platform and an escape pod survived.  	3

 You are right. Youtube titles can never be trusted.    It was in an actual court of law.  But that doesn't prove Ray's innocence, just that they found him not guilty. He is innocent because he didn't do it. If you take a look at the evidence, it will probably not change your mind, but it may keep you from saying things are are dumb and unfounded.   If you understood civil court you wouldn't say it was anything like Judge Judy.   And to this day the King family doesn't believe Ray did it.    Actually they dont have accountability. If they fail at their job, they can falsify reports, their fellow officers will cover for them, get paid leave of absence while the non-investigation takes place, etc.  Then there are the police unions. The problem is they are not accountable to anyone.     It's crazy, but I can't wait to see who we get.  In Reggie We Trust.     Exactly. People are so afraid of being alone, that anyone will do.   It reminds me of what some comedian once said: that marriage for him will probably be like in gym class when the instructor tells everyone to pair up. Everyone shuffles around real quick and finds a partner. He's just standing there looking around. Then before he knows it everyone is paired up, except for some girl on the other side of the gym who, by default, must be his partner.    To me, denial = delusion. And for every problem you deny, you create about four more that you may or may not be aware of.    I used to know an old guy who once told me, "It's better to be lonely than to wish you were."   Just got too damn cold. And lonely.     Police can't police themselves.       If she can't notice a text on her phone from someone she already verbally committed to (and respond), then she should be dropped even quicker.  Right, she's just too busy and distracted with life to undertake the most basic of functions, which don't get much simpler.  She could do it in 3 seconds while on the toilet.    Neither James Earl Ray nor James Earl Jones killed MLK.  ["The jury found that King had been the victim of assassination by a conspiracy involving the Memphis police as well as federal agencies."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.#Coretta_Scott_King_v._Loyd_Jowers)  And also [here](http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial).   Yeah, he has a bunch of good stuff on youtube.   Im with you. Because Carr would get a synergy with Cooper. We have untapped potential with Carr that Cooper could help realize. If we didnt have Carr, Id be more inclined to go with Williams. Too bad we only get one.   Wow. He is telling pickers 1-3 something. More than an implication.    Duncan is 39.  I'd take 2 or 3 or 8 impressive blocks, and the many non-shots they cause (which stats don't account for) by a young player, than 1 random block by a 39-year-old any day.  But whatever it takes for Spurs fans to get excited.   Exactly.      They say "disrupting" like it's a bad thing.   Well maybe it was just an accident then.   Yes, and I've heard some say that Williams is overhyped.  No one has said that about Cooper.  If anything, they say he's underappreciated.  Sure, that is hearsay, but means something.      DeAndre Jordan does this about 8 times a game.  Tim Duncan does it once in a series, and people act like it's the second coming of Christ.     This is exactly what I've been saying.  Draft Cooper.     NBA needs to hold them fucking accountable. It is not "just part of the game".     He whines. Then we see the replay of him and two others taking Blake's head off.    I like DJ, but he has to get it together.   Yeah, I don't think any of them are Swedish.    Yeah fuck him and the NBA for not fining him already. And Parker too. *All they do is flop!*   But we need to close out games!  Make a freaking free throw too!  That's 2 games we've handed them now.   EDIT: And fuck you too refs. You do this for a living? What a horribly called game.    When is the NBA going to fine Ginobili for flopping? This is beyond ridiculous.    I should mention: If you read Kierkegaard, I would start with 'Concluding Unscientific Postscript' then 'Fear and Trembling', or the reverse.    Goodell would then investigate it for 3-30 months, and personally destroy all evidence of a delay.    It is the internet. Thre is room enough for everything.    Yeah. They're thinking about it. For now.    Fuck Goodell.   To me, it isn't about the weed.  It should be legal.  It's a plant, etc.  But it's about being stupid.  Don't do nonsense like that *especially* before the draft.  No, we shouldn't take him.  And Reg is not the type of guy to see value there.   Yeah. And OP's first instinct was to feel sorry for him being a closeted gay? Right.    This is excellent.  The Bleacher Report may have a commitment to excellence.    I'm going back and forth, and forth, on Williams/Cooper/White.  I tend to end on White or Cooper because we could then better realize Carr's potential.  But then they got Crabtree, so are they thinking this isn't as much of a need.  Then I remember Reg is a former LB, so maybe he prioritizes defense somehow.    I want Williams *and* either Cooper or White.  Too bad we only get one.  I guess I'd be most happy if Reg saw it my way and got a receiver.  But if he didn't I'd be OK too maybe.   It's a cop-out because you can't handle it.  The government you advocate is the same government that built the big banks, along with Fannie and Freddie, the Fed, etc., which led to the bubbles, and the bail outs, which led to *no one* going to jail.  They are the same government that already taxes corporations more than most other countries, taxes the rich far more than the poor, *and* writes the loop-holes for them to hide most of that money in.  The powerful (be they the rich, the banks, or the government) like money for themselves, not for you or me.   Exactly.  And it explains why anarchists/libertarians have trouble organizing (if we are to see that as "trouble").  Natural freedom entails what appears to be disagreement, but is only difference.  The words keep us apart, because we get fixated on them instead of human-heartedness.  To continue the example of politics:  Democrats and Republicans group themselves in opposition to each other based around artificial concepts, platform planks - pro-this, anti-that - which have nothing to do with real reality.  So they are in perpetual war for their own supposed benefit.  Gay marriage, for instance: Why is any kind of marriage anything more than an agreement between two people, or between two or howevermany whatever?  The powers that be have seized on this artificial issue to the detriment of us all.   You're most welcome.  You saw Watts in person, or recordings, or how?  "Tao: The Watercourse Way" changed the way I see the world.  I think you'll enjoy those books!     Close.  I'm saying (among other things) that it shouldn't be demanded or expected that anyone trust a scientist or an expert.  That's not good science.   Respectfully:  What you lack in substance you make up for with footnotes, and verbiage.  I can give you 8 ways in which black and white resemble each other.  And I can give you 8,000 ways in which SK was anti-Hegelian, and use primarily SK's own statements, not those of academics who enjoy the trees more than the forest.  You are aware of this.  Certainly you aren't suggesting that SK and Hegel are similar.   don't worry i'm just an anonymous guy on the internet.    but you ought to put your money where your mouth is and pay even *more* than you are required to in taxes.  but you don't.  so you aren't as much of a true believer as you'd like us to think.   Hogwash.  Praise be to Almighty Science....er, peer review.  Ignorance of experts on full display here.  Why such zeal and dogma?  Where is your skepticism?  Why make a judgement call?  Why not hold global warming as a provisional possibility?  We haven't even gotten to whether it is caused by man or not.  If it is naturally occurring, apart of man, or not.  Or the question of if it is happening, in this giant universe, why the necessity for alarm as if we humans can do anything good to save ourselves.  All our saving of ourselves has only resulted in more wars, theft, etc.  I think it was a scientist who said if bugs go, life on the planet will have about 50 years, but if humans go, life on the planet will thrive.  So the enlightened are supposed to save us from ourselves?  So the tyrants who spout what they want to to justify taking our money for their own benefit are going to save us???  Get real.    So at least you admit that consensus can be wrong.  You don't hear that from the rest though.  And even you say that if you have a "convergence of data", it is very unlikely to be wrong.  Oh the chances are slim.  I see.  Again you drift into non-science really fast.  If you guys are all talking about likelihood, then say so.  If this is a Pascal's wager thing, say so.  But none of you do.  You say it is happening, and anyone can see it, even though no one can see the data or interpret it properly, etc.  This is how you don't do your cause any service.  But you are the enlightened one, adored by academics and the tyrants.  Make a fucking prediction.  What's the temperature going to be in 10 years?  Al Gore should be able to put $1,000,000 on it.  I'm sure someone would take his bet.  But you can't even tell me the temperature next week.  But that's probably because I'm not a scientist.    All the great scientists had skepticism and doubt and uncertainty, and were certain of their own ignorance, perceptions, etc.  They even doubted the fucking data.  NONE of the climate change zealots EVER express this.  They are religious extremists.  EDIT:  Nothing personal.  I don't want to be this harsh.  Forgive me.    Here are the [reading lists](http://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/graduate/master-s-liberal-arts/reading-lists/).  Henry Hazlitt - [Economics in One Lesson](https://mises.org/library/economics-one-lesson)  Irwin Schiff - [How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't](http://freedom-school.com/money/how-an-economy-grows.pdf)  [Fredric Bastiat collection](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/The%20Bastiat%20Collection_4.pdf) Including "The Law", which you should read too.  Murrary Rothbard - [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money) Maybe read this first.  Incredible book.  Ludwig von Mises - [Human Action](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Human%20Action_3.pdf)  The first books are short.  This one is long.  I don't know any good nutrition books.  Just wish I had learned it.   Regarding philosophy:  I would start with the existentialists, and among them Soren Kierkegaard.  Because he was such an incredible philosopher, but also because his philosophy, and that of the rest of the existentialists, is so human.  It is not abstract, is not about concepts exclusively.  It will engage you and bring you in.  A lot of philosophy is difficult when initially confronted by a novice - but not always.  Also read the philosophy on the St. John's list.  Those are the basics.  Perhaps Plato and Aristotle most basic.  [Lao Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/014044131X) (Tao Te Ching) and [Chuang Tzu](http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Chuang-Penguin-Classics/dp/014045537X) are the 2 basic Taoist texts.  Dating from 600-400 BC.  They are poetic and beyond words, literally and figuratively.  It would also provide a basis for other philosophy reading, though Taoism is not per se a philosophy or a religion.  Plus, it is eastern so it has a different angle.  Many parallels between Taoism and existentialism.  But read these alongside Alan Watts' ["Tao: The Watercourse Way"](http://www.amazon.com/Tao-The-Watercourse-Alan-Watts/dp/0394733118).  It might blow your mind.  Excellent stuff.  And not esoteric at all.      You need some training in basic epistemology.  It isn't a "hard science", but give it a try.    The point with Galileo, which you probably get anyway, is that the *established consensus was wrong!*.  In your world, the "consensus" can't be wrong, and ignorance doesn't exist.  Let alone the questions of what a consensus is, who establishes it, etc.  You try to dismiss my example and say that they weren't scientists, that Galileo was the "first scientist".  What unscientific, purely rhetorical, nonsense!  "Considered by many" ?????  You and your ilk can keep parroting this considered-by-many delusion as fact in some way, but not only is it meaningless, it is misleading and *unscientific*.    You argue against yourself when you say that no one but Galileo was a scientist in his time, so all the naysayers get a pass.  But nowadays you heap scorn on all the non-scientists if they don't take on faith what is supposedly established as consensus, though not 100% of course.  Because how are they supposed to process all that data and evidence, if it is so difficult for real scientists to do it?  Oh, by faith.  I see.  Now it's a religion.  Consensus becomes herd mentality.  Science is determined in the comments on reddit.  If I agree with you I understand how science works.  If I don't, I don't.  I'm afraid you don't understand how science works.    If global warming is happening, you aren't making any good fucking argument for it.  You're making a pathetic, unintentionally unscientific argument not to listen to a goddamn word you say.    One simple question for you:  Can the consensus be wrong?   EDIT:  By the way, what's the consensus now?  Is it 90% or 95%?  Unlike with temperatures, the exact number is hard to determine.  Maybe we should just find out what the consensus on the consensus is.   i think they know all leaders (of this sort especially) are of strong choleric temperament, and thus extroverted.  so they skew our results to show we aren't too far from that.   Innovation will flourish when the government monster dies.     Mao. It said I was more extrovert than introvert. Dead wrong. Heck, all these leaders are more extrovert than introvert, by a long shot.    I know, I know. The state is all right.    Wow. All that is is SK showing some respect for a guy and maybe for the magnitude of his ideas.  Not agreeing with what his ideas actually were. And certainly not espousing them. The last "despite" quote really shows it. At least you included it.    Is Galileo in the 95% or the 5%?  Surely none in your 95% are there because people like you would ridicule them if they weren't. Surely none of them are there because they wouldn't get tenure otherwise.  Oh, but we are all for individual radical geniuses, unless they diverge from the "consensus", right?  One shouldn't have to take science on faith, or by Pascal's wager.    Sure most people would say SK is anti-Hegel.  And we would know what they mean. In some circles, where people fear being seen as too simple, perhaps they would elaborate. Usually not here on reddit though.   Like with a lot of philosophy there are layers and there are indirect influences.  And there are contrarian books out there for everything.   But to say SK was not anti-Hegel is the point that is untrue on its face, and only might be partially true with serious explanation, none that could be derived from what SK himself said, however.    Yeah, it matters. Particularly the part about admitting uncertainty. Something we didnt hear from Obama on Earth Day or from most pop scientists today.   You, in your zeal and righteous indignation, try to come down on me for a quote made by someone else. Something deep inside you must have been triggered. It is this kind of reflexive animal religiousity that is a threat to rationality and real science. And, like any religion, entails massive hypocrisy and denial.    Check out the reading list for St. John's College. It is online.   For economics:  'Economics in one lesson' by Henry Hazlitt 'The seen and the unseen' by Fredric Bastiat 'Human action' by Ludwig von Mises 'How an economy grows and why it doesn't' by Irwin Schiff  Read philosophy  Read nutrition  Read the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu Read the Book of Chuang Tzu     I hope we get this guy unless Reg decides to trade.    Green's been pretty effective on D though.  Kawhi might be my favorite non-Clipper player in the league.  Just plays, and it speaks for itself.  He's pure.  A team player, but steps up when he needs to.  Good with the ball, good away from the ball, excellent at defense....   Not bad for a guy who can't jump, or switch directions very fast.  He played well.  He's solid and it worked.   Way to play son!!!!      ....followed by a flop and a flail....   1.  I would have to assume that this author makes a point based on substance. 2.  I would have to assume that the book description is wrong when is says the book is about SK's problem with Danish Hegelians, not Hegel himself.   3.  I'm sure I could find 10 books that say the opposite of what this does.  EDIT:  And this guy doesn't seem to be saying "yes and no".  He seems to be saying no.   Im surprised by how little discussion there is about how much we need a receiver, or not. If we do, it is a no-brainer we take Cooper (or White).  Seems to me it is that simple.    No. This one is a different version/translation.    Exactly. Oooooh they're so classsssy.       All Parker and Ginobili do is flop or flail into the lane trying to draw a foul.    Oh, because the food is shitty in Denver.    Keep moving /r/environment.  Nothing to see here.  It doesn't exist if you don't see it.  Now move along.   In Denver or at Casa Bonita?   Could you elaborate on Thomas Cleary, how he has appropriated it?   Read "the seen and the unseen" by Fredric Bastiat. The issue isnt whether innovation happens. The issue is that potential innovation doesnt happen (the unseen) because of insane and impossible barriers to entry imposed by the tyrants.    "Science is belief in the ignorance of experts." ~Richard Feynman   How do you know the sky is blue?  If you take a cursory look at the news, check any measure you like.   Especially because we need a good receiver. And because we have Carr, and need to realize his potential.   It doesnt mean much if we get a much better defense and dont improve our offense from last year. We need weapons.   And Im not as convinced as others about Leonard either.    Because it is grounded.  Because it has to do with people and with life. Not just abstract esoteric concepts that only have significance in school, if anywhere.    Yeah I got into Taoism several months ago and noticed the same things you did. I recommend 'The Book of Chuang Tzu', the Penguin version. A good complement/supplement to the TTC. Lots of rich stuff there. I find Taoism to be very refreshing and rejuvenating.   Did you ever read Kierkegaard?    I think Woody Allen addresses existentialism in most of his movies. A lot of the humor comes from the absurdity of life. Also, 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest' is very Taoist-existentialist.   Deconstructing Harry Cuckoo's Nest   thanks!   Yes, you got it.  Not so sure about everyone else here though.   "Lack of medical care" is police-speak for "We broke his neck.  What are you gonna do about it?"   **Keys to the Game**  The Spurs defense is messing with our flow.  They are picking CP3 up at just across half court.  CP3 has to work to get around it just to the 3 point line to get the offense going, get a pass off, dribble anywhere.  And they give him different looks with Green and Leonard switching it up. It takes precious time off the shot clock if nothing else.  Hence, we haven't been rotating, cutting, moving, creating opportunities like usual.  When CP3 moves and passes, we are much better.  This should be obvious.  Blake can't be defended by any single Spur.  He needs to just dribble down to the post and shoot a bunny every time, or turn around and make a move.  He will either make a shot, get fouled, or pass to someone else open if he gets doubled.  But last night he didn't do this.  Heck, Splitter is playing him like a little bug.    Barnes needs to cover Leonard like a blanket.  Don't help anyone else out.  Stay less than one arm's length from Leonard *at all times*.  Don't let him *receive* a pass.  Don't let him touch the ball.  It can be done.  Reddick and/or Barnes and/or Crawford need to be on.  When these guys all have an off night, or even 2 of them have an off night, we struggle big time.    In the off-season we need to acquire a serious bench.  Hedo, Big Baby, and Spencer Hawes can barely even run.  They seriously look like they are in some geriatric condition, hobbling around everywhere.  And Baby shoots the most blockable shot in the world.  Hedo - at least he does no harm.  Remember when we had Eric Bledsoe, Caron Butler, Lamar Odom....?   Two words:  Jamarcus Russell.   Pretty much anything has had its counter throughout history, whether legitimate or not, especially in academia and religion.  I haven't come across any criticisms, and I find this itself to be a bit surprising and unique.   I agree, but has anyone attempted this misguided effort?   Oh....Ouch.  That's the same defense Kobe gives when anyone brings up the fact that his personality has broken up good teams, and is generally bad for team chemistry, and thus prevents (more) success:  "Look at my rings!!!  I gots rings.  They cover a multitude of sins, don't they?"  What about all the rings he and Shaq don't have but should have?   Are you saying there is proof the Patriots deflated those balls?   What is it with LSU?  If I were a GM in any sport, I'd make a rule never to draft anyone from there.  Even the stars, like Shaq, are underachievers.  At least since Pete Maravich.   Are there any criticisms of Taoism?  If so, what are they?   So Spurs fans are OK with "flashy" play after all?  Up until now that sort of thing has been frowned upon.   Was it really over Blake Griffin? Looks to me like Griffin was about 5' away and never even challenged him.    Sexual relations is different than rape. Woods got treatment for sexual addiction. Clinton is a horn dog. Sure women lie. I sure tend to belive them here. i could be wrong but I dont think so. Ive read their accounts and the ones Ive read arent made up. What money are they getting? What point is there in casting doubt where there is no reason to. We all have a measure of realistic doubt with this stuff automatically. That gets influenced by the evidence or lack if it.    Cuckoo's Nest Shawshank Redemption Sling Blade Platoon  The new Netflix series Bloodline is incredible.    Self-inflicted hair cut.    Focus on the tasks at hand. Lead through competence (that is the way INTJs tend to lead). When you dont know, admit it. Dont act. Treat people with respect. Let people follow their abilities and instincts.  Dont play favorites. Dont posture. Dont condescend. Have fun.   Man, I like Carr. Hope he and Crabtree - and Cooper - can do it this year.    I cant think of any other instance of 40 or so women coming out of the woodwork like this.    Yeah, and OJ isn't guilty either. Im all for 'innocent until proven guilty'. Ive spent time in jail due to lying cops. But there is a difference between my opinion and a legal conviction, which he probably won't get due to the statute of limitations.    i know. barnes should smother him at all times. everywhere.  i mean no more than two feet away.    We gotta finish close games off.   We cant let their D stop and hold our offense. They we're picking us up just across half court and it would take another 8 seconds to start the offense. CP3 needs to get the ball to the three-point line quick and start moving around.   If we run and push the ball it will work in our favor.   We gotta make free throws down the stretch.    Rape a few and they throw you in jail.  Rape a lot and they defend you.   Marxism was largely dependent on Hegel.  Kierkegaard was anti-Hegel.    Thanks!  (I just returned to this thread and saw this.)   What is the total count now?      Yes and no. Depends on the corporation and one's direct supervisors. When things go bad, they go really bad.    /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut  /r/Taoism   How should we treat others?  What about empathy?  How should we console a sad child?  Why do children get sad at an age before they have even differentiated between good and bad, fortune and misfortune, etc.?  And I would say that disharmony with the Tao isn't a good thing.      TL;DR   Yeah, we idealize someone. Then when we meet them we realize they are a real human being, and it's a big turn off.    How would we know?  Since there wasn't any coverage.  Oh, are we believing the stats the police give us?   That hurt.  But we'll still win the series.   Spurs making a conscious effort to guard us at the 3 point line and beyond. CP3 getting around it for now though. He's going to need some help from Barnes and Reddick. Gonna need some 3's this game.       The Chuang Tzu is the best for these questions.  It addresses people as really human (human heartedness) and the questions of whether or how to improve things in the world.  It tells what the sage would do or not do.  Most of it comes down to wisdom and seeking harmony, not coercion, not impatience.  EDIT:  In other words, the answers like "What is there to improve?" don't *really* get it.  There is substance to Chuang Tzu's writings.  His book was longer than a reddit comment.   I don't know why, but it just wasn't that substantive, seems to use a lot of words and isn't very direct or simple.  Alan Watts is the best for explaining Taoism to anyone.   yes. very good.    If it rhymes, you'll do time.    ive never heard it put that way before. but now that you mention it, i get exactly that way too. all my "pessimism" has to do with people. everything else is a welcome challenge.    Yeah, this kicks the other one's ass.  And I think the Japanese will especially like it!   Assuming your stats are true, why don't those officers lose their jobs for misconduct?  Why are they protected?  Why do they get paid time off when their conduct is being "investigated" by their friends?  And given the amount of systematic cover-up that exists, if we are relying on stats reported by the police, then certainly they aren't true.    You must not have looked very closely at /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut  Only a few new cases of brutality?  You're a liar. [And try this.](http://killedbypolice.net/)  Please *don't* become a cop.  Judging by your post history, you like Grand Theft Auto.  Being a cop isn't a game, where you get to live out your fantasies of street justice and run around chasing "bad guys" with your buddies and all your expensive cool gear.     I think so too.   You are quite naive.    What a load of shit.  Pure shit.  You guys are very well paid. All kinds if benefits, time off, insane pensions, paid leave when you kill someone, police union pays your attorney, fellow officers wont testify against you.  You are all a bunch of goddamn frat boys.  Sacrifice?  Fuck you.    If there are good cops out there, why dont they speak out against their murdurous colleagues? All - yes, all - police unions are corrupt. We have an epidemic of police abuse and cover up. Check out r/bad_cop_no_donut and see for yourself.  People getting KILLED everyday for doing nothing. Then the DA's dont prosecute. And we have the prisons full and overflowing with non-violent offenders. The US justice system is fucked up.       Yeah it is excellent.    The Timmy is what cracked me up even more. But I dont know why.    ive noticed many people have a laugh reflex when watching supersick stuff.  twisted.       Wow. Fucking Horrible.  Depressing.  Keep the uni's you have.  They are far better than this shit.   There were definitely bad calls, but they were on both sides and not gazillions of them I thought. Compared to what could have been.    I dont call flops and dives and hacks classy.    Yeah we need a bench. What if the refs call a bad game and we get in foul trouble?     Yeah did you see all the times they passed up close shots just because DJ was there? Too bad there isnt a stat for that.    I know what you mean, but to me they are just quiet, not classy, except for Pop. The reason is that Ginobili and Parker flop way too much. Ginobili is always looking to draw a foul rather than just playing.    Magic Johnson   Linear TV stopped about 20 years ago.    i know. my comment didnt come across as i meant it.    Yes, thats my point.    I read Rand. Didnt make it through any of the books because the writing was horrible. But I read her. Academic popularity is for sissies.          Ginobili going into flop mode a little earlier than expected.       there is something in ch. 2 of Chuang Tzu. about not wasting one's energy with others who dont get it because they wont get it. it is referring to leaders and authorities, but still applies. there are probably other references too.   i try to tell myself to let the substance of what i am saying speak for itself and not be wedded or identified with what i am saying. if i say it, that i will be ok with however it is received, knowing that its reception isnt up to me at all, but only to say it. people are really up against reality and not against me. i try to present it as impersonally as possible. not to say that this is always how i do it though.    ....plus Photoshop.    yeah i like variety. i like a lot of things and can usually do whatever i put my mind to. but i get bored sometimes. or dont find satisfaction in actually following through and making it real. sometimes just the idea is enough. That said, I do different things all the time and see a lot of them through. I enjoy the challenge.    Ive been there. One thing I had to realize is that existence doesnt mean stasis. Things grow and change and learn.   I would highly recommend checking out Taoism. Discovering it has done wonders for me. The two primary texts are The Tao Te Ching and The Book of Chuang Tzu. But also get The Watercourse Way by Alam Watts as a primer. Taoism shares much with existentialism, but not everything. It is not a religion or philosophy. Essentially, it is the way of nature. Becoming aware of it has helped me realize my place in the world, and helped rid me of existential angst, etc. Anyway, I cant do it justice here, but very strongly recommend it.    I can vouch for character concerns in Oakland. Drove through there 3 weeks ago. Parked for 2.5 hours. Got truck broken into and $11k worth of stuff stolen.    He puts his shorts on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us. But that was 16 years ago.    not really. not the worst thing ever though. the deer appears to have puffy cheeks even. NBA teams should be able to get the best graphic artists, or artists of any kind, in the world. NBA owners and execs have no aesthetic taste is the real problem.    yeah. goes to show you cant just copy-paste.         Yeah, Oregon doesn't see a difference between spending public money (without consent) and a company spending its own money. Because they know better, and it is for your own good.        and everyone was lauding the new redesign for the bucks.  that was a joke too.  why is it that european soccer teams can do it, but americans can't?   where do they get these horrible graphic designers? ridiculous.    thanks, to say the least.   im leaning toward cooper or white because they would make carr better able to reach his potential. by getting a WR we tap into that synergy they would have with carr. it is a synergy that would otherwise remain underutilized, if carr doesnt have a WR weapon. though we did just get crabtree, i think the point still stands. looking forward to see what reggie does. we have a lot of good options.    The estate tax is one of the worst of many bad taxes.  I don't care how rich you are.  It's basically: you're dead, so what do you care, and what can you do about it?  	164
 hey how is billy crazy?   I think it's a pretty good game. Not groundbreaking, but certainly entertaining.   haha she knew she couldn't hit the high note so she didn't even try. still a good cover though   lol   "despite all my rage I am still just a-"  "pika?"

God she's hot.   Camilla Luddington was great in Californication. I'm glad she's the new Tomb Raider. Just the cover art alone caused me to stock up on cocoa butter.  Oh, and I'm completely aware that now that you guys know she was in Californication, you are all looking up "Camilla Luddington nude."   It appears that you are a Cardio Bunny who is attempting to find her Way by dabbling in strength training. This is great, my Daughter, that you are trying to make this Change. Please, my Daughter, do more strength training, so as to Attract my Sons, and frolic in the Garden.   maybe that's what she meant it as...   good. I bought boxer briefs.

I honestly never get tired of it. Pretty much all I listen to is Adore on repeat.      haha it came with my console...   "because I can't stop listening to Smashing Pumpkins... I need help..."   yeah, but I discovered the SP fairly recently   yep of course. sexism. sexism. sexism. everything is sexist now.    What, am I supposed to be repulsed by pretty girls, lol      He had beautiful hair.   I fucking love Adore. I'll definitely get that 7-disc set.   his cheekbones are nowhere near as high as mine   I'm into pretty girls   I have really high cheekbones, so does this make me ber cute?   yeah that's a really good song      I also like Boston Terriers but that's it   ok pugs are not ugly, in fact I think any dog that is not a pug or a bulldog (I like both French and English) is ugly   pugs are very cute dogs, so it's more likely about a cute person    He obviously likes plays on words, and some lyrics I mishear, but completely fit the song. I think it would be pretty cool if he sings his music so it can be heard different ways.   It obviously has nothing to do with pug dogs, so why is it called "Pug"?   bye bye $150   nice. thanks   But then we need 50 coins... and 50 more. 50... 50.   Harvey Dent, can we trust him?   Eva Mendes in The Place Beyond the Pines  EDIT: Wait, are you asking about an ACTOR who is commonly known as bad, or a PERFORMANCE that is commonly known as bad? I don't think anyone thinks Eva Mendes did a bad job in this movie...   lmfao   fook   I want to listen to the album Adore by Smashing Pumpkins while I am  playing Arkham Knight.    Adore by Smashing Pumpkins is a good album. It has a lot of sad music.   Does he get a lot of screen time?   Well I would also need a therapist if I had to wear those tattoos.   Is it worth watching just for his performance?   go fuck yourself    Whenever I'm out in public I make a complete idiot of myself by playing a character I created (like Sacha Baron Cohen but I'm not making a movie).   I watch The Place Beyond the Pines.   Fuck that. I had to do that to treat catatonia, and it really fucks up your memory. Please don't encourage that shit by being a patient.   I really liked his performance in The Place Beyond the Pines.   It sounds like it won't disappoint me, so I'll buy it.   If you had to choose, which film do you prefer?    Why didn't you like it? Not that I don't respect your opinion, but this kind of feels like someone saying they don't like the novel The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.    I just got done re-watching The Place Beyond the Pines (my favorite film). Will Blue Valentine (same director and writer) disappoint me?   She obviously was suicidal, but that doesn't necessarily mean she attempted/succeeded. I think it's a good idea to message her family to see what's going on.   I beat the game on death march, and what you need to do is put on quen, use fast attacks, and dodge.   no he just loves the books   [she also used to be the bassist for the Smashing Pumpkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IDz8DLMWOM)   oh nice that you mentioned smashing pumpkins, billy corgan has such a sexy voice no homo   wait, it's done?   fuck, it looks like I need to bulk up lol   if that's a mens small I'll happily buy it from you   on death march, right?    I would listen to that song.      This publication would have been more relevant if you answered the question.   Not trying to be a smartass, but there is no title track as the album is not called "Ava Adore." Billy said the title is actually a play on words, as "Adore" sounds like "A door," as he knew it was a huge departure from the original sound, so it is "a door" opening for the band.    Some people like me love it, others think it's complete shit. Yeah, it's a departure from the previous albums, but it's still a great album.   I don't understand the logic of getting rid of the albums you really liked just because the artist put out an album you didn't like.   "Today" by the Smashing Pumpkins is a good pick me up.      C'mon, Adore is great.   mine is Adore   I listen to the album "Adore" by the Smashing Pumpkins.   Well I'm going for it. I'll sing along to it while making eye contact. It's fucking cruel and unusual to not blow me if I do that.   yeah so can you answer   Seriously, dude? You can at least answer my question.   definitely a nish nish   Billy Corgan is famous for his usage of Sexy Voice (no homo). Who else has been gifted with Sexy Voice?  In all seriousness, I'm just looking for singers who have a voice similar to Billy Corgan's. Thanks.   lolwhut   indeed   I can't really say I love stew, lol   what is with you and stew, dude?   I got that, but this question is fucking weird.   To answer the question, I don't "dip," but if I did, buffalo meat would probably be a good replacement for bread.   the tip of my dick  but seriously, what the fuck kind of a question is this?   lolwhut  	132

 Who just so happen to be Chinchilling  	1
 First, you are cherry picking. Oils outperformed the SPX in 2001-2011, but often lagged before and have definitely lagged since.   Second, that was then. The global scientific community (all 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, etc.) delivered the verdict on leaving most fossil fuels unburned only last year. The Saudi dumping of oil followed that announcement, not coincidentally. Meanwhile, coal stocks have been in decline for five years, and European utils are selling off their coal-fired generation businesses. This is no longer the *new* reality, but just the reality.         Did you check the MSCI link? Fossil-free indexes have been outperforming the S P for the past five years. That's the reality that exists.   All true, but most of the rest of the world is [driving up](http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2014/01/14/beef_prices_chart.jpg) beef and pork prices as fast as they can.   Anyone who thinks these universities would endanger their endowments' performance by excluding fossil fuels, [see this](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf).   Based on data like [this comparison](https://www.msci.com/resources/factsheets/index_fact_sheet/msci-acwi-ex-fossil-fuels-index-gbp-gross.pdf) and [this](https://www.aperiogroup.com/resource/138/node/download), combined with the fact that the entire world scientific community now tells us that we must quit fossil fuels entirely within little more than a generation to avoid running insane climate risks, isn't it time to get out of oil, coal and gas stocks?  I've made this a cornerstone of my stock portfolio. Anyone else doing this?   [Relevant.](http://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/1d59dbf3adff85344bde64dfe334603f)   So, a small fraction of what we just spent to bail out the corporate banks and pull the world back from the brink of depression and war. Got it.         True. However, the takeaway for me is the article's comment from Michael Mann: "the U.S. still needs to create a larger gap between greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth". In other words, relying on market forces to solve this problem over time is woefully insufficient.      True. A better headline would be, "Finally, a conservative with morals the oil industry can't buy".         The "crash" has already begun, but it's more of a slow crumple, like a supertanker hitting the rocks at low speed.  [This analysis](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/10/fossil-fuel-free-funds-out-performed-conventional-ones-analysis-shows) shows the new market reality: stock indexes that include fossil fuels underperform those that don't.   None of the fossil fuel majors are doing squat to diversify into renewable energy. The few that even tried, such as Shell and BP, have backed away. CEOs and directors don't last long, so each has a strong incentive to maximize short-term shareholder return, and screw the future.      One item to watch: standing on the pedals too much--as in hill after hill--can lead to leg cramps on longer rides, particularly in hot weather. Try to stay in the saddle, keep a cadence, and hydrate.               Theres a volcano in Alaska, Pavlov, that only erupts during the autumn and winter. The 10cm or 15cm rise in sea level during the winter months, when low pressure comes over, is enough to bend the crust and squeeze magma out. Thats an example of how tiny a change you need, he said.  Fascinating. Thanks for posting this.   We need people who know the science but can speak to their tribe.   Bingo.   Except when economists provide cover for pillage and political prostitution. There's *always* campaign cash in those.   A fanatic's first reaction to failure is always to insist that the policies tried weren't *pure* enough, so they need to be doubled.                         To be fair, Repubs have two approaches--tax cuts and deregulation--but only one ultimate goal: destruction of government.   "Washington State photon torpedoed the idea faster than a Borg could mutate."  Hah!   Ian, have you looked into the impact of raising cattle and cattle feed in California? [This Bloomberg article](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-13/cows-suck-up-more-of-california-s-water-than-almonds) suggests that it is the top single drain on California water supplies, yet it seems to get little attention.    "First, the government should eliminate energy subsidies of all kinds  for fossil fuels as well as renewable energy."  A very false precondition. "The government" cannot level the playing field by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, because the vast majority of them come from scores of *other* governments in developing countries; $550 billion annually. We would also have to eliminate much larger *indirect* subsidies such as public money for fossil fueled infrastructure such as highways, airports and utilities, not to mention the vast military costs of protecting oil fields and transport routes.  Fee-and-dividend carbon carbon taxes are beautiful things in themselves. However, until all the world's nations stop subsidizing fossil fuels, renewables will still need subsidies to compete.   Consider the alternative: coal, pollution from which is already killing or sickening millions worldwide, making fish inedible, and cooking the climate. Which is the greater risk?   Hey, if it walks like a demon, and it talks like a demon...      Shoot the messenger? Lomborg has been hired by a fossil fueled front man to spread doubt about the global scientific community's dire warnings that we must quit fossil fuels very, very soon. That is the story here.  Jotzo is hardly the only economist (or climate scientist) critical of Lomborg's profitable grandstanding: *every national scientific academy on Earth* officially disagrees with Lomborg.  However, the fossil fuel industry just can't get enough of him.    You have spent some time building those walls. I won't waste mine trying to break them down.   You want credible economists? The IPCC is full of them, and, as a body, they completely disagree with Lomborg, who is no economist at all.   Lomborg is more accurately what used to be called a mountebank. Someone who makes a career out of calling attention to himself.    Put another way, polluters have learned that buying media and experts to craft messages for it it is a worthwhile cost of doing business.   PR toadies have responded by creating front groups like the Heartland Institute, which specializes in market research and messaging to divert attention from any harmful business, from tobacco to coal. For a painfully accurate, darkly funny inside look, see the movie, "Thank You For Smoking".   Out of sight, out of mind.         "These prices" are now low precisely because Saudi producers know they won't have many buyers in the future. It takes decades to deplete a large field. They're dumping product while they still can, and before carbon pricing begins to eat margins.   Haven't we all. However, I think one of the better things one can do for humanity is to raise a wonderful person or two. And I don't buy the doomsayer's argument that kids will merely inherit a hellhole of a planet. Not at all. Sure, climate is a challenge we must confront, but I'm reasonably sure we will do so, and it will be neither the last nor the largest challenge humans will face. (Just wait until synthetic biology and artificial intelligence get rolling!)   This should be titled "Large *American* cities ringed by car-dependent suburbs are less green". Most European cities are far greener.   Then at least pay for your trash: dumping tons of extra carbon into the atmosphere cannot remain subsidized by the rest of us.   Bury it in secure storage.  We simply don't have time to solve the climate problem without using *every* tool at our disposal.    I don't want to live in a city they are fucking dangerous.  Some cities are dangerous, many aren't. For examples, look at the top and bottom of [this list](http://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings.jsp). It's largely a matter of wealth and how invested a city's inhabitants are in its continued wellbeing. Not too different from small towns and rural areas worldwide: some are placidly safe while others are dangerous, also due largely to wealth and emotional investment.   We lack time. The world scientific community tells us that we have exactly 27 years, at present trend, to quit fossil fuels altogether if we want to prevent running crazy risks to the climate, peace, prosperity, and the lives of millions. This is now an emergency, full stop. We must develop *every* clean energy source we have, and that includes nuclear.   But don't take it from some random natterer online. [Listen to the experts.](http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/to-those-influencing-environmental-policy-but-opposed-to-nuclear-power/?_r=0)   Suburbs exist because massive government infrastructure spending and subsidies, along with free carbon pollution, *enabled* them to exist.     It's called quality of life.  Its called free riding.    What do oil reserves matter when at least half will need to stay in the ground to prevent climate catastrophe?   The car itself, even if electric, requires a [huge carbon footprint](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car).  Worse, the kind of living that a car enables--big, inefficient, detached homes with thirsty lawns and power machinery, where every errand requires a long drive to still other inefficient buildings, whose occupants *also* depend on driving--is the most carbon intensive by far; several multiples more so than city living. Needless to say, it is also highly water intensive, materials intensive, etc..   If you need a car at all, you are placing a massive strain on resources. It's nearly impossible to live a suburban or rural life without doing so.   Then pay for the true cost of [400% more carbon pollution](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/greenest_place_in_the_us_its_not_where_you_think/2203/).       The best way to *prevent* an outcome like that may be to do just the opposite: forget the cabin and [stay in the city](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/04/22/earth-day-climate-change-column/26073883/).   Something else that does wonders for mental health is to join others who feel as you do, and raise your voices together in order to be heard.   Citizen's Climate Lobby and 350.org are great for that, but nearly any environmental group will do.     Bleak? This is the most exciting, optimistic, important time to be alive that has ever existed, and I'm serious.   As a species, we are overcoming warfare and injustice faster than ever before. Population growth will soon peak. Our grandchildren will live richer material, spiritual and intellectual lives than we do.   We simply have this little climate problem to solve, which we can easily and affordably do, if we can just cooperate. Gaining that cooperation is the signature task of our time. So get to it! Just remember that you have two enemies in this fight who are determined to wear you down: one is named social inertia and the other is called the fossil fuel industry. Don't let either of those defeat you.         Ugh. If this blog lunatic had even *read* the Tyler Cowan article in question, rather than merely attacking its headline, he might have noticed its point: "Our more peaceful and  yes  more slacker-oriented world is in fact better than our economic measures acknowledge. Living in a largely peaceful world with 2 percent G.D.P. growth has some big advantages that you dont get with 4 percent growth and many more war deaths."      [No need for anything like that.](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/01/29/3616382/solving-climate-change-cheap/)   Sulfates + water = sulfuric acid  Ocean acidification and acid rain are already massive problems that sulfate seeding would make much worse.   True, and the most cost-effective geoengineering scheme, sulfate spraying, will actually make ocean acidification and acid rain much worse. It's like a heroin junkie trying to compensate by smoking crack rather than by breaking their addiction.    Lowering taxes on the owners of capital means shifting those burdens onto poorer taxpayers. Meanwhile, on current US trend, the benefits of any extra growth will go entirely to the rich.  Count me out.   1) Solar output peaks when much of demand does, during the afternoon air conditioning hours, so intermittency is less problematic than it may seem.  2) Battery storage costs are dropping quickly as well. For example, [this forecast](https://dqbasmyouzti2.cloudfront.net/assets/content/cache/made/content/images/articles/Storage_Cost_Drops_580_440.png) from three years ago actually *underestimates* the rate of improvement.   3) While some think that solar or wind will be enough by themselves, most credible voices on the matter believe that we'll still need base-load generation from nuclear, biomass and the like.   Installation and other soft costs have rich opportunities to fall in the US. Those costs are [more than double](http://greenzone.co/2014/05/04/solar-pv-system-germany-roughly-50-cheaper-us/) what they are in Germany, and German companies are steadily lowering their costs as well.         Overcoming limited supplies of commodities is what human ingenuity does best. Don't bet on scarcity.    exponential modelling of any product is a fool's errand  So Moore's Law doesn't exist? Sometimes exponential product improvements *do* happen. In the case of solar PV, [Swanson's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swanson's_law) holds sway. It may not move at quite the speed of Gordon Moore's famous dictum, but the mechanics are similar.                   Nationalists who hate versus internationalists who love. Nothing new about that. ([Godwin's Law hereby invoked.](http://library.flawlesslogic.com/finance.htm))   There seems to be either a Play It Again store or something like it in every metro of a half-million or more. Bonus if hockey is big in your area: it takes tons of gear, it's all-year, and kids start playing early, so parents are always looking for ways to economize.               Google "Earth Day" and your location, and something will probably turn up. Also, just show up at a rally, or write a letter to the editor of your local paper. Those tend to capture the attention of political leaders.   ...*Now I'm crowding thirty and still wearin' jeans.*          In my humble view, there's only one possible name for it: Amanda.   Hoax! It was cold in Boston! I have a snowball! Benghazi!               Four degrees warming isn't *likely* to cost more than half of Earth's people their lives, although it might. It would certainly crash the global economy, reduce the food supply and lead to much more warfare. If global nuclear war breaks out, it's goodbye civilization, and that means goodbye as well to the global infrastructure needed to feed billions.    They always are. Tribal hatred and all that.   Jeb Bush wants to represent a political party that gets fully 90% of the oil and gas industry's campaign money. Let's recall that his oily brother also acknowledged climate change while campaigning, then actively sabotaged and defunded climate science once in office.    And twenty years ago today, conservative fanatics killed 168, including an entire child care center, in the Oklahoma City bombing. Merely the worst of many deadly conservative attacks on America before and since.   By contrast, the most notoriously violent socialist radical group of the 1960s, the Weather Underground, killed exactly one person. The Unabomber killed three. So much for left-wing terrorism.   If there was destructively irrational exuberance during Greenspan's tenure, it came primarily from raging libertarian egotists like him.   I'd like to take a measured, sensible, economist's view of his opinions, but I can't. Not after seeing the massive pain and ruination that resulted from them.      Washingtonians and Oregonians have been battling Californian attempts to steal our water for generations. This is merely the first time they've brought Star Fleet to the fight.   But just try to insure those.   Better idea: rather than spending billions to move water from Washington to California, primarily to raise [cattle and their alfalfa feed](http://www.businessinsider.com/real-villain-in-the-california-drought-isnt-almonds--its-red-meat-2015-4), why not just raise the cattle and the feed in Washington where the water is now?   There are plenty of better places to grow water-intensive crops like alfalfa, almonds, pistachios, beef and rice than in the middle of a desert.   California has been trying to hijack the Northwest's water for generations, blithely ignoring the fact that Oregon and Washington fight over that water all the time, and they, too, are suffering from drought right now.    the ice has been melting for thousands of years because the earth has gradually been warming.  The Earth has actually been slightly, gradually [*cooling* for the past 8,000 years](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), after reaching the interglacial peak. The past century's sudden rise looks like a wall on the right side of the temp chart.         Back when?      When did I say "painless"? You say that climate action, "involves simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation" and that "abandonment of fossil fuel use would bring about complete economic collapse". I simply quoted the global economic and scientific consensus that says your statements are completely untrue. Solutions are very *affordable*, but no one says they're free.     There's the real objection: if the solution isn't painless, deny the problem. Rationalize it away. Foist it onto others. Shirk responsibility.   Upvote for all the above, although I suspect that dumping their oil before it is outlawed is a larger factor than most admit. After all, it takes many decades to really drain giant fields, future extraction technology will undoubtedly extend the life of those fields, and a global ban on burning oil is now inevitable, maybe even imminent.   The only factor you haven't mentioned, and perhaps this qualifies as fresh thinking, is the degree to which the Saudi oil heartland is also the heart of the Kingdom's Shia population, and Sunni/Shia warfare is breaking out all over, so maybe the Saudis are also concerned about possible future national breakup and the loss of that territory.   Everyone's view of where "the other side" begins is relative to their own position on the political spectrum. Where do *you* stand?      The article's point is that continued global warming will lead to an economic crash which will then reduce the pace of further warming, although by that time both climate and economic conditions will be dire.   I do dismiss the left's solutions as they're often economically unsound  Which "left" is that? There's some range to consider.   Except that fossil fuels receive [$550 billion in annual subsidies](http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/energysubsidies/), and have been heavily subsidized for generations. That $550 billion is about six times what renewables get, despite the fact that fossil fuels are the largest, richest industry on Earth, with well developed infrastructure that needs no assistance, and fossil fuels represent a global *problem* while renewables are a desperately needed *solution*.  That's the so-called "free market" you're defending.   You do realize that the IPCC is also comprised of economists, right?  I'll be moving along now.   Not only New Jersey. Coddling cops while attacking teachers has been Republican doctrine nationwide for at least a decade.   Not hard to see why. More teachers are female, more cops are male. Teachers lean left, cops right. The GOP's geriatric base voters are worried about their own safety but indifferent about educating a generation they won't live to see.   Except that every national scientific academy, all 97 of them, agree that we must quit fossil fuels within 20-30 years at present trend, or climate damage will pose existential risks to civilization itself. How is the free market alone going to overcome the entrenched power of the world's largest industry *within that time window*?   Did I say that? No. So why did you?    I also agree with these scientists.  You agree with Idso, Ball, Lindzen, Singer, et al? Those are merely paid oil company shills singing for their supper, my friend. Others on the list, like McKitrick and Spencer, are conservative political ideologues.     I'm skeptical of many populist solutions that involve simply taxing ourselves into economical and technological stagnation.  [No need for that.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/13/averting-climate-change-catastrophe-is-affordable-says-ipcc-report-un)   [Experts!](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/13/averting-climate-change-catastrophe-is-affordable-says-ipcc-report-un)         "We cut renewable subsidies but not fossil fuel subsidies, and renewables lost ground to fossil fuels. Crikey!"   I certainly don't know what "Christians are for", do you? There's wide variation on that score. But I can easily see what *Christ* was for: sharing.  How is a voter who agrees to a tax for benefits to others not performing an act of charity?   It's much easier to calculate the cost of decarbonization, where variables are known, than to forecast future climate sensitivity where variables are less known.   I'm merely saying that Nordhaus's forecast represents the low end of a credible range, the high end of which is much, much higher.  Personally, [Weitzman](http://www.macalester.edu/~wests/econ231/Rev%20Environ%20Econ%20Policy-2011-Weitzman-275-92.pdf)   Wagner are more my breed of climate economists.   Rhetoric? No, scientific fact. It's called the [DICE model](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/DICE_Manual_103113r2.pdf).   You expected global climate risks to be cheery?       The climate changes during the pliocene are not well explained by carbon, it doesn't even account for a significant portion of the differential.  There is [little doubt](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n1/full/ngeo724.html) that elevated carbon levels during the pliocene accounted for a significant portion of the higher temperatures and higher sea levels then. And that was merely one of [many such ancient episodes](http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/zachos08nat_141144.pdf) that provide insights into what a high-carbon atmosphere does to life on Earth. And, in each of these episodes, the impacts to precipitation have been highly uneven, boosting extremes--drier here, wetter there--just as we now see developing.  We agree on the need for action, and on the need for credibility, but let's settle down with the knee-jerk attacks.    See, there you go predicting doom if humans don't act soon to decarbonize. How can you be so certain of the stakes?  I'm not predicting anything. I'm simply paying attention to the united opinion of *all* of the world's major research bodies, which say we *must* decarbonize due to the extreme risks involved.  Here's an analogy: we now find ourselves playing Russian roulette, while forcing our children and grandchildren to play as well, all simultaneously, but we don't know with real certainty 1) how many bullets are in the guns, 2) at what part of our bodies the guns are aimed. We do know that, over the course of the next few decades, the number of bullets increases, as does the likelihood of the guns being aimed at our heads. Every decade is a pull of the triggers.  That makes the modest cost of decarbonization (0-2% GDP, net) an essential investment.   And Nicholas Stern says 6C could cost [20% of global GDP](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/Executive_Summary.pdf)--and that's before we consider the costs of ensuing global warfare, where all bets are off. Look at the global cost of the Syrian drought right now. Needless to say, there is quite a range of possible costs, but any of them would be far greater than the modest cost of prevention.      No, not very comforting.   1) Very few "predict doom", because most believe that humanity will act soon to decarbonize. The stakes are simply too high not to.  2) The plea to decarbonize isn't coming from "a scientist" or "just *some* scientists"; this is the united judgement of the entire world scientific community, including endorsements from every one of the world's 97 national scientific academies, the UN IPCC, the World Bank, NASA and just about every other research authority one can name.  3) The fact that we don't know with certainty what to expect is exactly why these organizations and individual experts are all so concerned. Their position is that the likelihood of absolute catastrophe is too high to ignore, and growing higher as we dither, so the only reasonable action is to "buy insurance" by investing in decarbonization now.   That's easy, because it has happened several times before and we have abundant evidence of the effects.   For example, the [last time we had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it led to sea levels more than 100 feet higher than today, global temperature 5F degrees higher than today, with large deserts in the North American Great Plains (complete with camels, no less).   Let's just say that would now be highly inconvenient--except for the camels, which would be somewhat cool. Yet that was merely a moderate warming event, due to atmospheric carbon levels no higher than today's. [Much worse](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229.full) have occurred.   Matthew 19:21 - "Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven."  Luke 12:32-34 - "Sell your possessions, and give to the needy."  1 John 3:17 - "But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?"  Luke 3:10-11 - Whoever has two tunics is to share with him who has none, and whoever has food is to do likewise.  Acts 2:44-46 - "And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need."  Acts 4:32-35 - "Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need."   Luke 16:19-31 - There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."  Etc., etc..   All true, but nuclear meltdown is probably among the lesser worries, in my personal view, simply because the *last* thing any government will starve of water is a nuclear reactor; they can be powered down to reduce water consumption; and, even in the event of a meltdown, the damage is usually far more localized than that of war, drought, etc..   The [last time the Earth had 400 ppm CO2](http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2013/05/10/the-last-time-atmospheric-co2-was-at-400-parts-per-million-humans-didnt-exist/), as we now do, it caused the global average temperatures to rise to 3 to 4 degrees C warmer than today (5.4 to 7.2 degrees F), and polar temperatures to rise as much as 10 degrees C warmer than today (18 degrees F). The Arctic was ice free. Sea level fluctuated between 16 to 130 feet higher than today. Coral reefs suffered mass die-offs. Much of the North American Great Plains turned to desert and dry steppe, complete with camels.   That's where *today's* 400 ppm is taking us, and never mind what the 550 ppm projected within fifty years would eventually do.    True, but it's a small quibble. Temuzjin's fears seem all too plausible. The idea that extreme warming will be delayed or prevented by global economic collapse due to moderate *near-term* warming is horrific. Because, as history shows, economic collapse leads quickly to the worst kind of warfare--which, these days, is as dangerous to civilization as anything a hotter climate can throw at us.         Meanwhile, low-cost oil producers like Saudi Arabia have responded by dumping their oil on the world market at half price, to unload their reserves before burning oil is outlawed and to delay the cost effectiveness of renewables.  That's the problem with fossil fuels: selfish-bastard nations with abundant fuel reserves can always undercut renewables if they choose, going by the logic that its better to sell those reserves now at low price than to see them stranded by the coming global bans.  The only solution is to ban these fuels sooner rather than later. The free market will *not* help.      The hardcore, unfailingly voting GOP base was born long before the 50s.   Millennials don't vote; fossils do. From a coldly calculating perspective, aren't Republicans shrewd to cater to cranky old reactionaries who *never* miss a chance to cast a ballot in every election from the Presidency down to the local school board, and to court lethal industries that most fear regulation?  There's only one solution, kiddos: vote, and organize your friends to vote.    Agreed. This shows a race to scale up and consolidate in order to achieve bargaining leverage over labor, capital, vendors, retailers, you name it.   Hell *yes*!   "The government"? These subsidies are coming from scores of governments, mostly in developing countries. Very hard to control, hence the developed nations' subsidies for renewables to compete.    I don't understand why it would be viewed as a subsidy to the employer.  Because it rewards the worst-paying employers, lowering the floor for the lowest possible wages, speeding the race to the bottom.    Looks as if a Nestle boycott is gathering momentum over this, and not just among Californians.   Nothing improves company reputation more than making yourself look like the greedy corporate bully in a lifeboat movie, guzzling all of the boat's water when the other passengers aren't looking.        I would like to see renewables take over without the help of government subsidies.  Wouldn't we all. However, fossil fuels are subsidized *six times* more than fossil fuels, despite being the richest industry of all time.    "Hey, maybe we can dump our oil on the market cheaply and sell the shit before it's outlawed, while delaying renewable energy so that we have more time to pump more carbon into the atmosphere!"   According to the IEA, we have only two years before a 2C rise is locked in. Time to make climate *the* central issue, whether elderly "perfect voters" are ready for it or not.    Been saying this for months: dumping oil on the the market is both a great way to drive out high-cost energy competitors (shale, renewables) and to sell more oil before carbon pricing and regulation kick in. For low-cost oil producers like SA, it's a win-win.  Unfortunately, for the rest of us it's a lose-lose, raising a higher price barrier to renewables and conservation.      Why the question mark in the headline? As the lead sentence says, "The world's glaciers are disappearing".   Sure, but it's all relative. Free healthcare, free university education, more than a month of vacation, $20/hr wages for McDonald's employees, and a government that taxes 44% of GDP are pretty left wing wherever you go.   Yes, we are in an interglacial period. No, there is [no danger of plunging into another ice age](https://www.skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age-intermediate.htm), at least within the next several centuries, so definitely no need to "prevent" that.   Except that in economically comparable places where handguns are readily available, homicide rates are generally much higher, and most are committed with firearms.  In the US, for example, [69%](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_7_murder_types_of_weapons_used_percent_distribution_by_region_2013.xls) of murders are by shooting, and 75% of those are with handguns.         "Some left-wing parties have also urged the right-wing government to work out a wider mandate for the fund   Oh, yes, the "right-wing government" of Norway...  That phrase just made my coffee come out my American nose.   Thanks for the great answer!      Isn't the model predicated on political differences among counties, states and Congressional Districts? So isn't the result really a map of overall political attitudes rather than anything specific to climate alone? It certainly looks that way.   "As Bartlett noted, Federal Reserve policy (slashing interest rates) and the stimulus from increased government spending were also important factors."  Three Pinocchios for Mr. Paul. Again.   It's being blamed for conditions in the Northeast as well. The polar jet pushed extremely northward off the West Coast then pulls Arctic air southward to the East Coast.    Detroit is merely one of [many American cities](https://www.google.com/search?q=american+city+homicide+rates+per+100,000 client=safari rls=en tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=bAYnVfqOJMvWoASstIHoDg ved=0CEUQsAQ biw=1063 bih=500#imgrc=iHMcC_C_EJh1XM%253A%3B6gsbx7XDPzh6NM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fd28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net%252Fimages%252Finfografik%252Fnormal%252FChartOfTheDay_1693_Detroit_is_Americas_Most_Dangerous_City_n.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.statista.com%252Fchart%252F1693%252Fdetroit-is-americas-most-dangerous-city%252F%3B960%3B684) more violent than Glasgow. Hell, many American small towns are more violent than Glasgow.   Actually, more guns are smuggled from the US to Mexico than the other way round. Most illegal guns in the US were legally purchased at some point, then stolen or resold to felons, etc..   In my area, pickup trucks are magnets for window-smashing prowlers who know that pickup drivers are more likely to keep handguns in the vehicle. Those weapons are then easily sold to fences.         The House is the article's focus. As a counterpoint, I simply said that it fails to mention the greater bias against city dwellers in the Senate and the Electoral College.    "By a straw purchaser, which is in itself illegal. So legally purchased? Technically. Legally obtained? No.  Cite?    However, most U.S. shootings do not happen during the commission of crimes, and the guns are most often legally purchased.      "If we use all of the fossil fuels in the ground, the planet will warm in a way that is difficult to imagine. Unless the economics of energy markets change, we are poised to use them.  Unless the economics change...  Which is why no market-based approach will work. We are either willing to sacrifice a bit to maintain a habitable, prosperous planet, or we are not.    Good points all, except that killing "sprees" are pretty rare in the US. Most US shootings are in the heat of sudden disputes and confrontations, where, as you say, pulling a trigger is simply much easier than raging after someone with a knife, and with far greater certainty that you won't be killed or mangled in the bargain. But the typical death toll is one or two victims per incident.   What do you know about water supply challenges in Beijing, where, due to water stress, some are questioning the city's bid to host the Olympics?   True, but it's the second map showing opinions by state that's the most disturbing. All those barely populated, fossil-fuel dependent states like Wyoming get the same number of Senators as populous, progressive states like California. The Electoral College gives a similar (but smaller) advantage to empty states in Presidential elections. In short, the US Constitution ensures that each voter from remote coal and oil country gets three votes against every one for a city dweller.    That and aging populations. The correlation with leaded gasoline is [striking indeed](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/01/03/how-lead-caused-americas-violent-crime-epidemic/).   [The reason](http://www.humanosphere.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GunViolence.png) is no mystery.   To be fair, the UK had tight controls and a very low handgun ownership rate before the ban, so the ban didn't change much.   The greatest responsibility most of us will ever shoulder.  Of course we know our kids will eventually follow us to the grave, but the possibility that *their* distant progeny will eventually become the much improved beings that *we* would like to be is worth all the trouble, as long as we don't overdo it, don't you think?         "it's doubtful that solar and other renewable alternatives can make up for the vast energy contribution of fossil fuels anytime soon.   [Not so.

 Same here. I'm on a TV show and we've done 7 straight months of 70-80 hour weeks. I'm ready to get out, but the skills I've learned don't exactly translate to other industries, so I'll kinda be starting from scratch. It sucks, because I love the actual job, but the hours are inhumane.    Well, the way we were gonna frame it is that, while we don't need a guy in the condor in those days, the rigging is more complex to get the movers onto the bottom of the condor basket and we could use the extra hands. It is a concern, though.    I'm the board op for a tv show that uses a lot of Lekos fitted with 800w HMI globes. A lot of times we send out guys up in 135' man lifts with 4 or 5 of them for our night scenes. The weathers particularly brutal today and I hate that we have to send guys up in the air in the freezing rain just to operate them for 8 hours at a time.   Surely there's a moving light with equivalent output that we could send up instead that I could operate from my board.  I come from the film world and don't know a lot about moving fixtures so any suggestions would be welcome. I'd need to be able to shutter in the beam, change the focus and intensity, and ideally I could zoom and iris in and out.  It's also needs to be close to the intensity of an 800w HMI.  Anybody have any ideas?  Or at least an idea of where to look? You'd be making the lives of some poor shivering kids much more comfortable!   I love it. Tested it against the Triumph Tiger 800, which has much more torque. I liked the ergonomics of the gs better, plus it comes with a lot of nice little features. I haven't taken it too far off road cause I wanted it to be nice and shiny for at least a few weeks, but it's been great on the few rough dirt roads I've taken it on. Feeling good about its capabilities, and I can't wait to test it out on some rough stuff  Went on my first bigger trip with it recently out to New Mexico and West Texas, rode about 300 miles a day for 5 days, including riding through that huge thunderstorm last weekend for 7 hours. It rides great, really comfortable. The ABS saved my butt a couple of times, and the heated handlebars are awesome.

 Man, 5 years captive...I can only imagine how bad the conditions were.   They should seriously consider investing in technology like that in California. Every single county is now under drought conditions...      100% second this. Doing dumbbell bench and felt a sharp pain in my deltoid. Figured I'd man my way through it...  I was lucky enough to avoid surgery but my maxes have never been the same since. As much as it hurts to have to take a break in lifting in the short-term, it's way better than the risk of doing long term damage.   I dunno, I think I just don't like kids in games.

[Video-Game Character Wondering Why Heartless God Always Chooses 'Continue'](http://www.theonion.com/articles/videogame-character-wondering-why-heartless-god-al,274/)   That's really awesome to see. Great work.   Haha me and my friends would rent this as kids just because of the nudity. But watching it now that I'm older, it's a damn good film.   Congrats and welcome!!!   He makes a lot of good points.   In December 2012 I was on a Saudia Airlines flight and watched an Arabic movie (subtitled in English) about a guy who had sunglasses and goatee. He was a concert promoter or something and got with a girl singer, but then later got bored and got with a new girl he hired. Then he ends up in the hospital with amnesia and the girls get together to trick him and pay him back.  For some reason I thought the movie was Egyptian, but I could be wrong. I also thought the main actor was a comedian named BoBo or BoPo or something like that...  Any ideas?   OP delivers! Many thanks!   Haha that's awesome! Source?   100% agree.    Haha, good point.

You should also do "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel. People of his generation were being blamed by older generations for their lose morals and other social problems, and the song was a response to say "look at all this shit that's gone on through history...it didn't start with us".

       I either want to major in Music (been building repertoire for the past 15 years) or major in an IT-related major like Spatial Systems or CS...      Good luck!   When companies usually state a BS as a requirement, would a degree like MEng, MPhil or PhD be overkill?

Hey all, I really love the sounds of the violin and have tons of friends who are amazing violinists and i'm kinda inspired to be like them and learn the violin but... i'm 19... I feel as if i'm too old.  Now, while I don't have any unrealistic goals of ever reaching their level considering how they're already breezing through pieces like the Bach Chaccone, Mendelssohn Concertos, Caprices, etc. I don't know if it's the right move... will I forever sound like crap and be bounded to Suzuki-like-pieces? :(  I have some musical experience, i've been playing the piano for 15 years and have done my FRSM in music theory so I hope that can help a bit. I'm open to all advice!   She got tired after her laughing fit and went straight to sleep, leaving me alone, cold, lonely and very horny :(   Hey all, i'm going to go get a classical guitar to learn soon and was wondering if ya'll had any advice!   I'm 18 and i've been playing the classical piano for 15 years and what I found with the piano is that at the beginning fundamental exercises like Czerny,Hanon,etc. are essential in building technique. Is there a similar thing for the guitar?   I'm open to any advice, thanks!   So we were having a really hot make out/foreplay session and I (who was super horny), trying to be fucking suave, decided to just look her in her eyes to ramp up the hotness.  Our eyes lock on to each other and it was incredibly hot and beautiful and I decided to talk dirty. In the heat of the moment I said: "My tits are waiting for you".   Let's just say the night ended there.      Impressive research, however through using Flaigocol mathematical derivations whereby the Hilbert spaces denote the Barnarch-Tarski paradox in equilibrium with the Fredhold theorem whereby the Erdos-nagy is 0, were can derive the Farrel-Markushevich in light of the Malgrage-Ehrenpresis if we denote the ZJ and Z* as the consant found in the Talor-Proudman. Thus:  Rasputin - Rasp[berry] = Utin[erry]   Your mathematical rigour, though elegant, is flawed.  QED.    One year! Damn :(, so no hard boners during sex for a year?

 That might be the greatest statement made today.  Thank you sir.      I see what you did there, hahaha.... "Place"..  haha   Pretty cool.

In my case, the lack of power was for the better.  I was a first time rider off in my own.  Gave me a chance to learn to ride without the ability to do something stupid first.

The final scene of Na Triobloidi: Jax screaming on his knees on the docks was a rough watch.

There is something heart wrenching in the moments through the series when  see Happy crying or upset.  I think it's because both, so often he is the comic relief and also he is such a hardened, cold person.  Seeing the contrast is even more devestating.

I dunno   I only see some In white  and someone in blue....?   A lady on the streets and a Sikh in the bed   I have my first "first date" in a long, long time coming up.  I live in Plano and am accustomed to going out in east Dallas.   My date lives in McKinney near Frisco and I'm looking for a unique idea of where to take her near her area.  She's not much of a drinker and a vegetarian, providing a very slight challenge to my normal night out to the pub.  Does anyone have good ideas?   Aww.....  I miss the 90's   Awesome bike, what's your up, out, and rake?      I know, it's a lot of nothing until the last three seconds,  then BAM   All I could hear in my head was, "3...2...1...

I just started working out and have an organized weekly schedule and routine for when I go in, but would to keep better track of weight, reps and sets. Using my phone would be nice.  Having a book and pen is one more thing to keep track of in the gym.  What does everyone here use?   I see the laptop pic, but where's the guy?

I cry, boobs appear AND I get fed!  I shit and someone else cleans it up.  Plus all of the big people place %100 of their focus on me.   It's not a tumor   It has been for me too.  But, if I were living in Chicago again where there's a Catholic Church in every neighborhood I would stress about it.  It's a little different here.   The number of Catholics in North Texas is reletively high per capita, but mostly due to a very aging population and immigrants coming from socially Catholic cultures.   I don't know if this particular problem rears it's myopic head all over, but I've noticed this problem over the last few years here in the Great state of Texas.  I'm a proud Catholic and have grown up here.  We have our fair share of Catholics here in the Dallas area, but I am still in the protestant bible belt none the less.  Due to my commitment to my career and odd schedule, I've had to resort to online dating.  I don't limit myself to only dating Catholic Women, but practicing Christian or Jewish is a must.  One problem I consistently run into is the narrow mindedness against the Catholic Church.  The best and most recent example I can give occurred last night.  I had been taking to this wonderful woman for a few days now and she apparently missed me identifying myself as Catholic on my profile.   Her response when I told her what church I attend was one of shock.    She asked if I was only supposed to be dating someone who was Catholic.  I responded no, and that I wished to be married in the Catholic Church and raise my own children Catholic,  but she wouldn't have to convert.  Her response was that,  "She wouldn't want that for her children because catholicism is too extreme"    I wasn't going to fight it.  I wasnt going to get into a conversation on apologetics.  I'm not sure how to handle this.   Die anyone else feel the adult dating challenges.  It has interfered with a previous long term relationship.  How do y'all handle dating outside of your faith?   TL;DR I'm catholic,  facing challenges of not having a large dating pool of Catholic Women.  I date protestants and it doesn't work due to narrow mindedness on their part.  What do I do?   And what ever sploosh is for men.  Which I guess is just sploosh....  But with semen.

I never would have thought to make a sandwich with out of it.  Awesome   Thank you   Thanks.  I've been focusing there too.  I've cut the fast food first and foremost.  I also drank my emotions away all through the month of December.  After making an ass out of myself at a NYE party I decided to stop drinking, at least until I've showed myself I don't need it.  I recently took up a job at whole foods.  That has helped me keep focus on what goes into my body.    Things got a little shitty for me this last year, but, at the risk of sounding cliche, today was my first new day.  Mid October I left home and moved across the country to be with my fiance'.  After moving to Arizona, giving up my promising job at one of the best new breweries in my area, and leaving all of my friends and family behind, I found my soon to be blushing bride not to be who  I thought she was.  Everything was wrong and I realized it 6 weeks into a new place.  I had found my fiance, the SheDevil as I now call her, sleeping with someone else.  As it turns out, she had been with him for the last five and a half years, and had been sleeping with him the duration of our two and a half year relationship.  I moved  home beaten down and alone.  I had given up my position at the brewery and my position had been filled.  But today I did something I hadn't done, but kept promising myself I'd do every day.  I got my ass up off the couch, did 15 push ups, 18 sit ups, and 18 squats.  I also ran 1.8 miles.  I know one day doesn't make a habit, neither does one week.  But realizing I can't commit to others who choose not to commit to me, I am now committing to myself instead.  Push ups, sit ups, squats and running every day.    If I can do it depressed and 70 lbs. overweight, anyone can.  Keep pushing    Can't agree more.  Take it in to a local shop.  Ask other riders about good shops, maybe check out yelp.  I'd also recommend picking up a model and year correct service and parts manuals.   I vote you just watch the site and make an opinion for yourself.  If you don't like it, quit watching, I you do, watch it.  Do yourself a favor and stay off the sub.  People will fuck with you here, like subtly referencing Tig's fate.   I'm so I out of the reddit loop, didn't know this was a thing   I'm getting itchy to download some new music and I don't want to forget what to download while waiting for them to get back up and running.   So I recently made the choice to shave my head.  I'm going bald and pull off the bald and bearded look well.    I do however break out when I shave.  Most of it is on the site and behind the ears so visible to those around me.  When I don't shave I may have one or two if any pimples under my hair.  Any recommendations for a solution?      Meh, you can't expect much much more from someone who chose to be identified as "poopooslut"   Bless his heart indeed   I *sobbing gasp* just wanted a *sobbing gasp* division *deep breath* chaaaaaampionshiiiiiiiiiiiiip   I'm not disappointed in the Cowboys, quite the opposite.  I think they're growth this season was fantastic, including Jason Garrett's.

There's another app based program that is with looking into.  Is called 6 Weeks.  Its a conditioning program for push ups, sit ups, squats, dips, and pull ups.

 SUVs would be like mothers; always correcting people, but there when you need them.   Going to work as usual, but it'll be on my mind.     I've appreciated them many times.   God didn't need anything to create Him.  He has always been and will always be, whether we like that thought or not.  The concept of always being is hard for me to understand, but so is particle physics.   My friend attended the culinary arts program at the community college.  She remained almost debt-free through Pell grants and such.  The chef teaching the class hired her at a fine-dining restaurant he managed.  She learned so much about banquet cooking and how a kitchen actually operates.  She completed that program and is now in the baking program, since that's what she likes to do.  She did very well in school and is currently spending a month in France working with those chefs and bakers in different restaurants.  She's very good and has a great future ahead of her.  Opportunities seem to present themselves, even at the community college level.   It's a long list.   I was in my driveway about to head to work when I heard a news bulletin on the radio.  I ran back inside, turned on the tv to see it happening right before my eyes.  I just kept repeating "WTF", over and over for a while as the realization of what was actually happening sank in.   I'd get rid of all those nasty executive orders that I really don't like.  I'd pardon whistleblowers who did what they did for the good of the country, and I'd seek charges against all those responsible for the banking scandals.  After that, I'd seek charges against some people for war crimes committed outside the US.   I see them as actors playing a part.  They have to look and act decent when they're in front of a camera and say all the right things people want to hear.  They don't have to believe it, just say it.  It's a high paying job for those who can do as they're directed to do.   They can track you through GPS, have your home and cell phone numbers, records of all calls in and out, financial account info, pics of you, your family and friends, know if you have registered guns and what political persuasion you ascribe to and what car you drive.  Yes, I'd say they could blackmail anyone they wanted.    /r/videos   "There's been a terrible car accident."   Baseball.   Probably like it was too good to be true and they were coming for me at any time.  I'd be skeptical and wary at first, I'm sure.   Car problems.  I'm not a mechanic and don't know much about them, so when the smallest thing goes wrong I automatically imagine it will cost me thousands of dollars.     You should add tobacco and cotton farming in there too.  I worked a tobacco field once and never again.  Hardest thing I've ever done.  I do not recommend.   Weekends are very busy and usually aren't staffed by the regular personnel.  Some wait until Monday for perceived better care.     That isn't what this subreddit is for.  Did you even read the sidebar?   The effects on their economies was probably true.  Slaves helped build the economic foundations of the new nation. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 solidified the central importance of slavery to the South's economy.  That was an important factor to the rich, white landowners during the abolitionist movement. It provoked a great debate over slavery that tore the nation apart in the bloody American Civil War.    I grew up in Virginia and we had two years of Virginia history.  I think we got a realistic view on slavery and how it was practiced throughout the American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries.   It isn't offensive or honorable to me.  It's like others such as Patriots, Steelers, Chiefs, Raiders, 49ers or the Browns.   Too many people get offended and want to sue for the silliest things.

I have a male coworker named Shannon.   I'd feel far less stable being dependent on someone than I feel being responsible for myself.  Why do you need anyone else to feel stable?  Are you afflicted in some way, or are you able to take care of yourself and  just lack the confidence?   I'll pass on the bugs.   They become fish food.   No, it doesn't matter.  Any woman could easily have sex multiple times every day.   It was more fun and less serious than today.   Nothing, actually.   60 is a senior citizen now?  It just keeps getting younger.

Keep it clean and cover it until then.   I'd go to the E.R. and get a tetanus shot and have them clean it out and cover it.   Caffeine.  I need my coffee fix every day.   It's so sad that our nation has come to this.  I would never have  imagined that US citizens would be so afraid of their own elected government.  But, here we are.   Why do you believe they'd all be so passive?   Russia and China have already committed warships to the region and committed to fighting any attacks on Syria. Iran is mobilizing its troops. Britain and France have committed warships to the region to support ours. Israelis have been given gas masks in fear of an Iranian retaliation.   Unlikely, you say, but I say most probable.   Of course it will.  Nations have already made preparations for it and forces have been moved into place.   Being a douche to the person trying to keep you from dying prematurely sounds like a great plan.   It's hormonal.   Unfortunately, you can be fired or laid off at any time.  They do not have to hold your job. The position needed to be filled and they filled it.  You were expendable from the moment you left work.   That depends on which side of the fence you sit on and which side you find most credible.  Both sides defend their points of view vehemently and show "evidence" to support themselves.  Videos tell a lot, as well as the news reports of that morning in the US and in other countries reporting on it.   I didn't ridicule anyone, so your comment is unwarranted.  Judging from the appearance of presidents before and after holding office, it's definitely a hard 4 year stint.   Askreddit is the third largest subreddit in terms on number of subscribers.  I'm sure the admins/mods feel they're needed here.   I've come to regret voting for every president I've ever voted for.   If you want good care and information you're willing to wait for it.  Most people like that kind of thing and spend time with their physician to get as much information as possible.  Sometimes it takes more than 15 minutes.

Well then, since you have such a good plan, I suggest you visit the local prison and ask some guy who's been convicted of drug trafficking to tell you the name of his supplier.  Surely he'll share that info with you.   If you don't know where to get them you probably shouldn't have them.   They are the offspring of fallen angels and human women.  Gen 6:4   There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.   I wouldn't give them up for anything.   Apparently, we aren't a very creative bunch.   Coming and going and driving your car anytime, anywhere you want.   Football.

Both parties would demand a candidate from their own party, consequently, they'd never agree on anything and nothing would ever get done.

The possibility of a heart attack or debilitating stroke that makes the quality of life terrible, or worse, end up left to die in a nursing home.

They've already confirmed suspicions; it's a base for testing top-secret aircraft and weaponry.

They're tolerated because there is no other choice in the matter.   I'd call that state brain damaged.   Well, I believe a killer meteor actually does factor into the scenario.   Grandmothers.

Everyone else is just, "eww, asparagus."    I'm only familiar with its' religious application.   "Today, it is commonly used in reference to any prophetic revelation or so-called End Time scenario, or to the end of the world in general.    The Biblical prophets' revelations show God's justice as taking place in the future or as imminent now. The genre of revelation aims to show God's way of dealing with humankind and His ultimate purposes, and its writers often reveal the meaning of present events in connection with the ending of the present age."   There shouldn't be any more taxes period.  We're overtaxed already.  If they want to make improvements they should start offering vocational classes and teach people how to do those specialized jobs.   If he actually follows through on the threat of engagement while everyone's telling him not to, probably so.

 I'm crying on the inside :((   I've been running 5* No. 9, 5* Yeo, and 4* Alex for everything, should I start focusing on Alex instead or keep trying for Susanoo?   I recently started playing Crusader Quest about less than a week ago and I already have a 5* No. 9 and a 4* Alex, I heard about the Alex/Susanoo/No. 9 combo and I'm almost there.... problem is that every time I promote a warrior, I get Joan. Four promotes in and all I've gotten is Joan. I pulled Joan from a Premium too. Do the RNG gods hate me or.... is this some secret bug or something :( or is this really normal??   This is by far my favorite piece written on this flag issue. Thanks for sharing. I can't believe some students are sending death threats to these 6. I feel like every thing is being blown out of proportion.   I started playing three days ago and I was able to pull Sneak off that contract and then used the gems and pulled No. 9 :)   I read that as India and was thoroughly confused....

 Blof en opgezwolle en dan het album eigen wereld. Blof vind ik eigenlijk altijd goed.   Zeker goed interview, ben het wel zeker eens met de stelling dat staats secretarissen na hun politieke carrire een paar jaar niet in die sector mogen gaan werken.   The last couple of movies are really bad from this serie, the first one was really fun in my opinion.   You must have a great personality!   this might safe them!   Hello and Thanks! Have installed this a couple of months ago. Only some apps, just don't fit in nicely and don't work flawless.  It does work only not 100% and 75% of the consumers wouldn't understand how this works or its to hard for them to install.  Either way thanks for the tip!   Oke, je hebt Cees H. in een kamertje en die Johan V. , beiden praten niet en je loopt stuk op je bewijs, Johan V. heeft een crimineel vermogen van 200 miljoen EURO en Cees H. voor 6 miljoen gulden. Ze praten niet en er is niet voldoende bewijs dus beiden zullen vrij uit gaan.   Dan komt dus de keuze, wil je iets of niets.  Een van de twee moet je aan het praten zien te krijgen om berhaupt iemand te kunnen straffen.  4 mogelijkheden: Beide praten allebei de bak in, Cees H. praten en johan V de bak in, Johan V. praten en Cees H de bak in, of beide praten niet geen van beide de bak in.  Beide praten is natuurlijk ideaal alleen beide mannen houden de kaken stijf op elkaar.   Dan blijven de volgende opties over vanuit Teeven zijn ogen.: 1. Cees H. 4,7 miljoen gulden betalen op voorwaarden dat die gaat praten en Johan V. Aanklagen en een boete opleggen van 200 miljoen euro + 5/6 jaar cel. Weet even niet hoeveel de euro tegen de gulden nu zou staan maar laten we voor het gemak even op 4,7 miljoen euro maken. 200 miljoen - 4,7 miljoen = 195,3 miljoen in de "plus" om het zo maar even te noemen.  optie 2: Johan V. laten praten en Cees H. de bak in en geld boeten, 6 miljoen gulden van Cees H. en Johan V. vrijuit (200 miljoen). Nu loop je dus 200 miljoen euro mis en 5/6 jaar cel.  Of beide niet praten en je eindigt ook op niks.  Welke keuze maak je?   Have a Q10 for 2 years now, but the only thing i'm missing is apps, native apps especially. Side loading isn't it for me. A good app store would change a lot for them. Maybe they should make it more attractive to developers.   Persoonlijk vind ik de cel echt veelte ver gaan.  Tweede kamer voorgelogen is natuurlijk een kwalijke zaak, aan de andere kant gebeurd dit dagelijks door de gehele tweede kamer. EDIT:Dit neemt niet weg dat het niet fout is. Hij heeft hier trouwens ontslag voor ingediend wat al een behoorlijke straf is.  Het toespelen van geld is een beetje te kort door de bocht. Er is geld betaalt voor informatie om de grotere vis te pakken. Ik weet niet of je bekend bent met dit systeem maar wil het best aan u uitleggen.  Nu zegt die Cees H. wel van mij mag die alles vertellen, dat is makkelijk praten als Teeven een zwijgplicht heeft.   Met ze deal was niks mis, alleen het achterhouden van het juiste bedrag is fout. Die fout heet die ingezien en hier zo ook zijn ontslag voor ingediend.  Moet die voor dit achterhouden gestraft worden voor de rest van ze carrire?    Vind het toch wel een beetje lullig voor Teeven hoe die man zo de grond in word geboord.   I stole a candy bar, arrest me! Please?!   Find it strange that a university is listed.   Don't think this is the reason of the crash, the co-pilot is still a fully trained pilot.   Protein shakes. Bad for your liver and kidneys and a lot of people don't need it.   hey OP, CPU is not a abbreviation for computer! Nice system though Enjoy your day.   This!  Totally understand you!    This looks very good! Especially for third world countries where they don't have the money for proper trainings facilities.    Visiting France and I was a bit shocked how terrible they speak English, have to admit the last couple of years it has become much better. But 10 years ago it was terrible. They where/are also very arrogant about there culture, I was really shocked because I always thought they were very romantic and friendly to everybody not just to each other.  Edit French changed to english.    Why don't you consider universities in other cities? Leiden, Nijmegen, Maastricht, Eindhoven, Groningen. I wouldn't even consider UvA the university is way to big for me and not even the best university, also Amsterdam is a bit overhyped at the moment and housing is also pretty hard to find for a decent price.  Don't know for sure but most of the universities have employment agencies for students or international students.   O and about the dutch, it would be appreciated to learn dutch, almost everybody here speaks english but it would be a little bit rude not to learn the language of the country where you are staying for such a long time.    Good luck.    you?   Yes I am!   Well it's rather disturbing, are you on tinder for nice dates or to gain instagram followers in the same time? The priority of these people is a bit off.      Hoi! Ja sorry was bedoeld voor het strafrecht! Mee eens wat betreft de scheidingen en arbeidsconflicten las ook dat mediators hier onder vallen misschien is het wat om hier vaker gebruik van te maken? Aangezien advocaten vaak duurder zijn.  Bezuinigen wil natuurlijk niemand, persoonlijk vind ik dat het moet maar hier zijn de mening heel breed over.  Interessant wat betreft die versleuteling! Volgens mij is een encryptie kraken veel moeilijker dan een kluis.   Aangezien het een grondwet is zal dit denk ik niet op de korte termijn veranderen haha.    Dat verschil tussen lichamelijk en psychisch is psychisch eigenlijk een nog groter probleem aangezien psychische problemen vaak heel complex zijn. Neemt niet weg dat lichamelijk minder erg is.  Toen ik 16 was kan Ik me herrineren dat een gram weed 6 euro was net zoals hasj dit is nu, volgens jellinek: 10 euro voor weed en 13 voor hasj. Dit is een stijging van om en nabij 100%, goedkoper is het volgens mij niet gewordend? Dit komt ook door de belastingen en inflatie.  De risico's zijn nog steeds hetzelfde lijkt me?   Ja maar farmaseutische bedrijven en apotheken gaan de wiet, cocaince, xtc, paddo's enzo niet verkopen. Dit word dus een nieuwe handel vanaf de grond af. Waarschijnlijk zoiets als coffeeshops want dit gebeurd ook gecontroleerd. Wat voor lui dit zijn weet ik niet maar een crimineel kan toch wel zo een zaak openen.   Dat een psychose alleen getriggert kan worden als je er aanleg voor hebt is niet waar. Bij wiet kan het schizofrenie verergeren. Bron: http://www.jellinek.nl/vraag-antwoord/kunnen-drugs-psychoses-veroorzaken/     Or a girl who stands between 5 dudes. What is the statement you wanna make here?  edit: spelling   Psychische verslaving is ook verslaving en dat je dan alles kan verbieden slaat natuurlijk als een lul op een drumstel, Van cocane, heroine en xtc is bekend dat die gezondheidsrisico's met zich meedraagt cocaine en heroine al helemaal.   Maar volgens mij is dit een eigenlijk een discussie waar we niet over uit zullen komen.  Ik zal altijd het niet goed vinden dat mensen drugs gebruiken en wil ze al helemaal niet helpen om dit makkelijker te maken.  En volgens mij kan ik uit jouw antwoorden opmaken dat je voor legale  gecontroleerde drugs handel bent?  We zullen het zien als het legaal word wat de cijfers zijn!    Maybe flying on Rotterdam/TheHague airport would be cheaper but the public transportation from that airport to Amsterdam is not ideal, lets say pretty bad.   About the hotels I have no clue. The wiki of this subreddit is very informative so I would recommend to take a look over there.  Welcome to Holland!   Because she is mentally older then the boys of her own age.  Bullshit.   De redenen waarom drugs legaal zouden moeten zijn:  Het is minder schadelijk dan word beweerd ter vergelijking van alcohol en tabak: Valt wat voor te zeggen, maar elke dag cocaine of elke dag xtc is natuurlijk een heel ander verhaal en je weet niet hoe dit ontwikkeld aangezien het zeer verslavend is. Hier moet je rekening mee houden dat het gebruik wel iets omhoog zal gaan.    Criminaliteit tegen gaan. Nederland word een groot export land aangezien dit dan een legale plek is om het naar toe te vervoeren binnen Europa en te kopen.  Lagere prijs: Dit is nog steeds afhankelijk van de overige landen waar de productie vandaan komt en je ziet nu aan weed dat het ook steeds duurder word.  Oke we gaan het zelf produceren en jij wil dit op de legale manier gaan doen, bij alle drugs criminelen vervalt hun huidige functie en hun enorme hoeveel heden geld. Dit is zeker gunstig maar ben toch echt bang dat jij de dupe bent als producent of verhandelaar aangezien die drugshandelaren geen lieverdjes zijn en heel hun business is nu weg. Ik zou onderduiken.  Ik bedoel zeker niet dat mijn weg de enige manier is maar legalisatie kan zoveel meer problemen veroorzaken. Psychiatrisch hulp zal zeker ook groeien, ben een keer daar geweest en echt heel veel mensen zaten daar met psychoses door drugs. Natuurlijk niet iedereen maar wel veel. Maar dit is een beetje een kip en het ei verhaal waar je zelf in geloofd. Veroorzaakt de drugs de psychose of hadden die mensen al een psychose en probeerde ze drugs als uitweg.    Al zouden we wereldwijd de drugshandel zo aanpakken dan heeft het zin, als alleen Nederland het doet krijgen we echt nog grotere problemen. In plaats van dat we de criminaliteit aanpakken.    Nee sorry bedoelde niet dat ze samen zweren op hun stand punten maar samen werken door bepaalde documenten te lekken is natuurlijk heel goed mogelijk. Zo krijgen ze bijden weer een kans.  Wanneer het kabinet valt hebben ze nieuwe verkiezingen en kunnen zijn mogelijk wel in de nieuwe oppositie partij komen.  	33

If you need it to, I could allow http as well as https.  I tried using http/reddit today   was redirected to https.  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2937448/reddit-defaults-to-https-as-internet-titans-rush-to-embrace-encryption.html  You've never had gold? Shame on reddit, you're of value to the community, if only for the "admin box" script :) And being helpful is always a plus.   I'm still puzzled as to why I seem to be the only one experiencing these errors? There surely has to be 100's of mods using GM scripts? Is it something GM themselves need to address?   To get 1.16 installed I followed the link above, then clicked on the 'Raw' button.   Well THAT'S helpful github, who wudda thunk it?  Hoorah!  http://i.imgur.com/shcReC0.png  You sir, are a clever man. Now, how is this related to none of my other GM scripts working (I have to assume it IS related)? And please PLEASE tell me there's a global fix, my lack of scripts is crippling my mod-work :( I'm surely not the only one this is happening to ?      OK I overwrote  the current .js content with the 1.16 code linked above,   a refresh of "admin box" gives me:  Executing first time fetch writeRMA: {"version":"1.11","moderated":{},"fetched":false,"reqcount":1,"nextModFetch":"","debug":true}  I don't see a way of downloading an actual .js file to import into GM from that link? (told you I was dim)    In the screenshot you provided, bottom right of the admin box, you'll see a 'refresh' link and a 'debug' link. Hit refresh first see if that fixes things. If not, hit debug and look to see if there is any data displayed  The subs I mod are public record :) Refresh does nothing, debug gives me:  writeRMA: {"version":"1.11","moderated":{},"fetched":false,"reqcount":1,"nextModFetch":"","debug":true}  Not yet been able to install 1.15 it's just a wall of text to me, I'll fix it in the AM, but my main worry is why nearly ALL of my GM scripts have stopped working    As it to refresh and see how that goes. You could click 'debug' too to see what data it is storing.   I don't know how to do any of that (I'm not very bright) :(   What version is Admin Box?   1.11 I'm wondering if this is something to do with reddit's switch to https? It's the only recent major change I can think of? But what's puzzling is reddit reveal 1.0 (shows user karma on hover) works fine, so it's not ALL GM scripts, just most of them? The "mod event reports generator", for example, seems to work fine?

 Here's plain. Add whatever flavoring\nuts you want. http://ozlemsturkishtable.com/2012/06/home-made-turkish-delight-lokum-and-they-go-so-well-with-turkish-coffee/   Two ways I like:  * Cut in half, where the pit was drizzle some nice olive oil and handsomely season with S\P.  * When I have a little more time, I love to caramelize some shallots with cumin, paprika, lime juice. Throw in some almonds at the end. Put it in a bowl, and make some toast in the same pan. Then I take an avocado, mush it up, add salt, pepper, olive oil and a little bit of balsamic or rice-wine vinegar. Spread that on the toast, and add the shallot\almond on top.    Inclusion or exclusion: Perhaps a normally loud atmosphere grows suspiciously quiet. Or maybe some element of the atmosphere starts in a rhythmic fashion, like water dripping or a rusty fan.Or maybe it's nature and the animals that inhabit the enviornment start making alarm sounds.    Think of not only where you are, but what's beyond the walls of the scene.   * What time is it?  * What season? * Is it tense?  * for your restaurant is it fancy, is there also a bar? where is the kitchen? * How does the environment react to what's goin' on?  If it's a tense winter night, chances are there aren't going to be crickets in the background or children going to school for instance.    Mysteries is vastly different than Job - I encourage you to see it. It's 50 different playwrights' individual interpretation of a given Bible parable.

I've made them before but need advice on making A LOT in the most efficient way possible. This is for around 20-30 people so figure I'm making around 100-150 total sambusahs.   I plan on making my 5 fillings on day #1.  Day 2 will be all about stuffing and folding them. Then baking some and frying some so that they'll be fresh when people start arriving in the evening. I have 2 questions:  * What is the most **efficient way to prep** so that I can do as much ahead of time but keep them fresh. Can I stuff some day-1 and refrigerate, or will they got soggy? Maybe freeze the ones I'm frying?  * **Folding** them can be a time consuming process. Any tips to speed it up?  *  I was also considering other forms some could take, like an **open cup**. Any tips on how to make puff pastry mini cups? Could I make these day 1 and then fill them right before? Should they be refrigerated or room temp?   nope... it actually seems like a marketing stunt for ABC to promote it's new show    on new years day there's the "polar bear swim" there which is probably pretty fun to check out   Yeah they're great! If you like them make sure you check out the [Golden Festival](www.goldenfest.org).    Native Brooklynite here. Use [HopStop](http://www.hopstop.com) to figure out trains once you know your destination.   I would suggest either walking across the Brooklyn bridge to DUMBO or you could take the F to York or the A\C to High St. Walk around [Dumbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUMBO) and then go up the hill (or squibb bridge) to [Brooklyn Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights) to see some really nice tree lined brownstoney streets and the [Promenade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Heights_Promenade).   Some alternatives: Walk the length of **5th Ave in Park Slope.** You could either take any train to Barclay's Center or 2/3 to Bergen.  Cool things to check out there:  * [BierKraft](http://www.bierkraft.com/)  * [Skyice](http://www.yelp.com/biz/skyice-sweet-and-savory-brooklyn) good Thai food that's a bit better than standard fare. Casual. Really interesting icecream flavors  * [Gorilla Coffee](http://gorillacoffee.com/) Strong Stuff!  * [Barbs](http://www.barbesbrooklyn.com) Amazing music every night of the year.   * etc...    Or take the B\Q all the way out to **Brighton Beach.** Get lunch at [Cafe Kashkar](http://kashkarcafe.com/) or one of the [Russian places](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Brighton+Beach+Russian+Restaurants find_loc=Brooklyn%2C+NY)  and then walk down the boardwalk to Coney Island which is erie but kinda cool in the winter. Good if you're adventurous and like Russian stuff.   Don't goto Williamsburg. It's just an extension of Manhattan and full of people trying too hard to act like what they think of as "real New Yorkers"      I spent some time this summer interpreting from my non-native second language (Turkish) into English for some friends I was traveling with. When I was in the thick of it, doing it daily, I started dreaming in both simultaneously. It was as if I was interpreting the dialog in my dreams as it occurred.    Yeah you're right. I had the impression that she wanted to explore authentic East New York to see "what the city is really about..."   * **The Staten Island Ferry** You don't need tickets, don't worry about it.   * **Ground Zero** No idea, but I'm sure you can just show up.   * **City pass....** I'm a native New Yorker and never heard of this. The MET is free and you can give them whatever you want at entry so a "discount" seems silly.    * **Subway** Get a weekly pass. That makes sense since you'll be jetting around all week. Every station has a machine where you can get one.   * **Tickets** Goto TKTS. Like u/SilverMarch said the one in Downtown Brooklyn is the easiest. From there you can easily walk and see the Brooklyn Heights promenade\DUMBO\Brooklyn Bridge   * **Central Park** Like anywhere in New York, **the best thing you can do is just walk around, get lost and find your own little surprises**. The horses are pricy but easy to find.   * **Bus Tour** No clue. Be a real New Yorker and walk!   * **The Projects** Don't be an idiot.    Folks have already suggested Kalustiyans and Sahadi's as I was. I'd also add Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights to the list for anything indian. Go there to be inspired: there will be plenty of stuff you don't even recognize.    Also check the places across the street from Sahadi's or Damascus next door for middle eastern goods.    It is become even less sparsely populated to due to migration after the late 80's onwards. People in the East came to the Istanbul \ the cities seeking work and refuge from armed conflict between the state and the PKK.

I downloaded the data from the OECD family database.  In Excel, I plotted the child poverty rates for households with no workers, one worker and two workers in the house.

I plotted in Excel the real GDP and life expectancy increased GDP equivalent of growth for Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong for the period 1965 to 1995.                                                   The data was downloaded from the OECD 2014 factbook.

If a particular economist was any good at forecasting, he would keep quite and trade on own account.      The data was downloaded from the OECD database.  In Excel, I plotted child poverty rates by family type.

The Quantity and Quality of Life and the Evolution of World Inequality, NBER Working Paper No. 9765 (June 2003).  In Excel, I then plotted the improvements in GDP per capita and GDP per capita adjusted for increased life expectancy for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the USA, and England   Wales.

(I'm copy/pasting the entire Wash Times article because their website is a pain in the ass--but the article is definitely worth a read)  -----------------  The Washington Times - Saturday, March 22, 2008  The State Department investigation of improper computer access to passport records of three presidential candidates is focusing on one remaining employee  a contract worker with a company headed by an adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. Barack Obama  The probe by States inspector general will include polygraph tests for supervisors in the passport section to find out whether the three contract employees who accessed the records had a political motive or were part of a political operation to obtain personal data on Mr. Obama, Sen. John McCain or Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Two of the three contract employees had been fired before The Washington Times first reported Thursday on security breaches involving Mr. Obamas passport records. The furor expanded yesterday to incidents involving the passport records of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton.  **The third employee, who has not been fired, worked for The Analysis Corporation (TAC), which is headed by John O. Brennan**, a former CIA agent who is an adviser to Mr. Obamas presidential campaign on intelligence and foreign policy.  The TAC employee is the only individual to have accessed both Mr. Obamas and Mr. McCains passport information without proper authorization, a State Department spokesman said. That employee, who was not named, triggered an electronic alarm system, officials familiar with the probe said.  The accessed records have the data provided in passport applications and used by the department to issue or renew travel documents.  State Department officials said Thursday and yesterday that the intrusions appeared to be the result of imprudent curiosity on the part of contract employees who were hired last summer to help process passport applications.  In Portland, Ore., Mr. Obama said the series of attempts to tap into peoples personal records were a problem not just for me but for how our government functions.  I expect a full and thorough investigation. It should be done in conjunction with those congressional committees that have oversight so its not simply an internal matter, Mr. Obama told reporters.  Mr. McCain, who is traveling in France, called for an apology and a full investigation of the breach. The United States of America values everyones privacy and corrective action should be taken, he said.  Mrs. Clinton had not publicly commented by yesterday evening.  Mr. McCormack said the investigation also will determine whether the records of other high-profile political candidates were accessed improperly and whether there are systemic problems.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised that the department will carry out a full investigation and expressed anger about the breaches, as well as the failure to notify senior officials.  It should have been known to senior management. It was not, to my knowledge. And we also want to take every step that we can to make sure that this kind of thing doesnt happen again, she said, adding apologies to all three candidates, starting with Mr. Obama.  I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked into my passport file, Miss Rice said of her telephone apology yesterday to the Illinois senator. She also called Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain.  **Officials do not know whether information was improperly copied, altered or removed from the database during the intrusions**.  We are looking at [whether] there is anything more to why these people did this other than inappropriate curiosity, said Patrick F. Kennedy, undersecretary of state for management, who is in charge of the passport offices.  State Department officials met for about 90 minutes with the Senate staffs of each candidate, along with the staff of Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Delaware Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has jurisdiction over the Foreign Service.  Rep. Henry A. Waxman, California Democrat, sent a letter to Miss Rice demanding to know the names of the contract employees.  Besides the TAC employee, the State Department said the other two employees worked for Stanley Inc., a 3,500-person technology firm based in Arlington that this week won a $570 million contract to continue providing passport services to the State Department, work the company has done since 1992.  **TAC, a McLean-based information firm that has helped the State Department automate the Terrorist Watchlist over the last several years**, issued a statement last night that it had been notified earlier in the day that one of its contractors had acted improperly. The firm said it had honored a State Department request not to fire its consultant to help the investigation.  **This individuals actions were taken without the knowledge or direction of anyone at TAC and are wholly inconsistent with our professional and ethical standards**, the company wrote.  Calls to the Obama campaign about Mr. Brennan were not returned.  Mr. McCormack said yesterday there was a fourth person who breached the passport records, although he described it as a case of inadvertance. He said a passport office trainee last year was learning how to work with passport electronic records and searched for Mrs. Clintons file as a test, but was immediately admonished, and it didnt happen again.  Working-level supervisors confronted the three employees after a computer alarm system was triggered by the effort to access Mr. Obamas records.  What didnt happen is that that information didnt rise up to senior management levels, so that we could be made aware of it. That should have happened, Mr. McCormack said.  If senior officials were alerted to the intrusions, additional safeguards would have been used to protect the data, Mr. McCormack said.  Officials said the computer alarm that was set off includes a notification mechanism that should have alerted States inspector general. However, it is not clear whether the IG reviewed the improper computer activities, the officials said.  Acting Inspector General William E. Todd and the chief IG branch investigator, James B. Burch, a former U.S. Secret Service agent, are leading the passport probe, which began Thursday. **Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey** said his department was no reason yet to investigate.  Miss Rice and Mr. Kennedy did not learn of the breaches of Mr. Obamas personal data until The Times e-mailed questions about the security breaches on Thursday.  As soon as we realized that there were these unauthorized accesses for Senator Obamas passport files, we collected the information, we briefed the secretary, we briefed Senator Obamas staff, all before we ever replied to the reporter, Mr. McCormack said.  Then we replied to the reporter, and then we all talked to the rest of you as the questions came in, he said.  ----------------  also see:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan       At one point in his career, he was a daily intelligence briefer for President Bill Clinton.[6] In 1996 he was CIA station chief in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia when the Khobar Towers bombing killed 19 U.S. servicemen.[6] In 1999 he was appointed chief of staff to George Tenet, then-Director of the CIA.[3][6] Brennan became deputy executive director of the CIA in March 2001.[3] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan      John Brennan LIED about the 2003 terror threat intelligence which led to an ORANGE ALERT...LIED about "not a single collateral death from U.S. drone strikes"...LIED about the CIA spying on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence...  ...and that's all on his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O._Brennan).  looking further...John Brennan was involved in the 2008 Passport Scandal in which passport records for Obama, McCain and Hillary Clinton were illegally accessed...was this John Brennan intimidating the candidates and letting them know who REALLY RULES DC???  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/mar/22/passports-probe-focuses-on-worker/?page=1     Should Congress pass a law that no agreement is valid past 4 years?

Fetzer seems to go too far quite often--but this slideshow seems spot-on in many areas...Fetzer points out the vans were erased from the background in the Zapruder film.  Once you add in the fact that Col.

The U.S. will become involved in another war (or two or three)...at some point oil fields in Saudi Arabia (or Iraq) will be set ablaze--then the prices will skyrocket as the u.s. moves in to control the situation...  will the world be split into a US-UK vs Russia-China Battle Royale???  If this happens I hope we can actually produce some computers/phones here in the US...with California under a drought--we are also importing a huge amount of our agricultural products, too...South America (where much of our food comes from) seems to be tiring of being on the butt end of the our bankers economic warfare and CIA overthrows...  it is so fuct what our government has done since the end of WWII--the whole world would have been happy to have our help--but we took advantage of them...instead of letting democracy sell itself we allowed the corporations to rule and we have become tyrants who sell democracy by bombing countries around the globe.    just a guess?  it would make sense if Snowden is a CIA limited hangout...  any other info?   This is CRAZY--the cop tazered the guy...he's on the ground--yet 6 cops take tuns beating/kicking him for 2 minutes...  even crazier is the fact that these video just keep coming one after the other--before you turn around another one pops up...   It would be interesting to compare 2012 to 2014...maybe using one random sample from each week to see if there is a difference in the variety of sources being linked--and seeing if there is a difference.  not sure how to access/research on the Wayback Machine (I've seen it linked to before, mostly for 9/11 stuff)...      I remember after the changes took place--I pointed out that the bbc/guardian literally made up more than half of the r/worldnews Front Page  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2arx5o/congratulations_rworldnewsyou_are_becoming/   I think there was also a spycase in the 50's or 60's involving an NSA officer named Snowden (I forget the first name).  He got busted selling secrets to the Soviets and enjoyed buying a Cadillac and a boat with the money....   I agree--I think the electric outage at the White House was a complete false flag designed to SPOOK. Think about the complete rehab the White House got after 9/11--you'd have to be an idiot to think they wouldn't upgrade the electric as they were fortifying it during the construction.  I remember seeing a photo of the WH with the front completely covered with a tarp. I think I remember something about the WH receiving the same type of material which the Pentagon had added (which was hit by a plane or missile on 9/11). I would assume some additional offensive weapon capability was added to the roof of the WH.  In any case, I just can't believe the WH would be connected to the same grid as the general public after 9/11 (obviously commercial and residential buildings are far removed from the WH at this point).   I think AJ is a provocateur--in it for the $$$$$$$$$$$.  I think AJ is right about a lot of issues--and is harassed by the gov't on a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis.  I think AJ has seen the writing on the wall--and has made changes in the way infowars covers issues. For example, infowars did not post any articles questioning the Tsarnaev conviction during the trial--because he knows the gov't will come down on his ass even harder.  It also seems like Infowars has also added more mainstream links to their mix over the last year (ex: cbs "news"). AJ also knows that google is fucking everyone and making independent articles vanish when people search for "9/11 WTC 7".  I don't think AJ is "controlled opposition" but I do think he is willingly changing the way infowars operates because he sees what the gov't and google are doing. In the end--it's not much of a difference (effectively the gov't has muted infowars).  I would also note that AJ was most likely harassed "Extra Special" on his trip to NYC (which is when he did the Piers Morgan segment I think).  The authorities KNOW they can fuck with him--and it will affect his performance.  It does not excuse AJ making an ass of himself--but it does show a Reason as to Why he may have been wound extra tight the day he went bonkers on cnn. I think AJ even posted a video of him being bullied by NYPD on his way back to his room...  **EDIT**: Interesting that NOW THAT THE TRIAL IS OVER...infowars NOW at this very moment has as their lead story: http://www.infowars.com/the-truth-behind-the-boston-marathon-bombing-trial/   Their real job is to scare the shit out of stupid americans--so they can make more [MONEY](http://redd.it/2fnykt)...  -------------------   **THREAT INFLATION**  Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.  Why?  The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.  Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.  This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.  Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.   The above 6 paragraphs are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011).

The CIA has been out of fucking control since day 1.  In 1947, these fuckers were [operating on U.S. soil to recruit members of the National Student Association](http://www.c-span.org/video/?324828-1/book-discussion-patriotic-betrayal)--a group funded by the CIA. Must have been hard duping 20 year-olds into signing secrecy agreements (before they knew who they were working for)!!!  When the CIA was created by a handful of [OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article30605.htm), the only other people who knew the CIA existed were a few sycophantic senators and President Truman.  It would be 50 years before Americans would find out the CIA received much of their early funding through a secret codicil in the Marshall Plan. That's right: while everyone thought the Marshall Plan funds were going to rebuild cities in Europe/Asia after WWII--the CIA was secretly skimming 5% to buy mansions and fund political parties in Italy, France, Japan (etc).   FACT IS:  We only know a small percentage of what the CIA did 50 years ago...and we don't have a fucking clue what these fuckers are doing today.   [WTFU america](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM). Even President Truman thought the CIA was out of control--he wrote an [editorial in the *Washington Post*](http://www.maebrussell.com/Prouty/Harry%20Truman's%20CIA%20article.html) exactly one month after JFK was whacked:   + For some time I have been disturbed by the way CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the Government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.        the fucking criminals at the Pentagon and the CIA don't necessarily have to go to war to profit--all they need to do is scare the fuck out of stupid Americans--strike fear into them so they can spend whatever amount of money they want on their bullshit programs--  http://redd.it/21andu  FYI: the U.S. had about 300 nuclear weapons in 1950...by 1960 the U.S. had 18,000 nuclear weapons. (Eisenhower sure did a great job controlling the MIC)  It also helps if you don't submit to an audit: http://redd.it/29fcu5  http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget   Fucking "Horseface John"...at this point one has to wonder if he was CIA controlled opposition from the start.   kc would be a cool spot...tons of talent came outta there...robert altman did a ONE star movie called "Kansas City" with a FOUR star soundtrack...be easier to recreate than most urban centers--and there are plenty, plenty of storylines which naturally occur there ...of course KC's biggest star recorded IN CHICAGO, though.   Relevant:   http://redd.it/2fnykt  You also may want to visit r/TSBD where you will find free pdf links to books/interviews with  authors such as Antony C. Sutton, William Blum and Stephen Kinzer.  The Westadt book looks like it hit the nail on the head--hadn't heard of it...   It is definitely a positive sign that there are now so many different professions which have scientific questions--the architects   engineers being the most prominent. Adding pilots' research adds another layer to the cake.  But it does seem that there are some fields which have most likely been silenced by confidentiality agreements: politicians, first responders, military...I would bet the victims' families are silenced as well (once they have signed Feinberg's compensation fund).   Cheers to Mr. Blum.  As the U.S. dollar is being eclipsed by the Chinese yuan--it might be a good idea for the U.S. to quit dictating to the entire planet.   Someday the U.S. might actually need some goddamn friends and just about every other nation on earth has plenty of reasons to turn their back on us due to the underhanded actions of the CIA and the lies the State Department cranks out on a daily basis.   The U.S. has attempted overthrow after overthrow after overthrow--sad that so many Americans don't realize what the CIA has done in our name.  At least in Russia most of the readers know they are being lied to--in the U.S.A. the readers mostly still believe the crap fox-cbs-abc-nbc-nyt is feeding us from the bowels of the CIA-Pentagon-State Dept Propaganda Machine.  How fucked up is it that I get more truth from RT news than I do from these corporate news sychophants???   As it's late nite on a Saturday--I was pretty much joking...  I have watched the Pilots for Truth video and definitely think You Are Right--this is another Big Gigantic piece of information which should be brought up more often.   The Hey Day of Jazz was in the 20's and 30's...WWII broke up many of the bands and helped kill Jazz...BeBop emerged on the backend. Early R   B started in the late 40's and Rock n' Roll came about in the mid 50's...the [Chitlin' Circuit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Chitlin-Circuit-Road-Rock/dp/0393342948) does a great job of describing what life was like for the African-American musicians. The shows traveled around the country--often a wide variety of acts were included. There were no huge modern amps back then, so the shows were quite a bit different. But imagine seeing Ruth Brown with Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis (plus many others)--all on the same bill.   Chicago RULED in the 20's--Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton were there at the height of Jazz in 1926.  The "Chicago School" of jazz musicians would head to the South Side to catch Armstrong--among them were: Benny Goodman, Bix Biederbecke, Artie Shaw and Gene Krupa. The white musicians morphed Jazz into Swing in the 30's--everything popped one night in LA during a Benny Goodman show and the Swing craze started.   You should be able to find Ken Burns' *JAZZ* documentary on youtube--the first 3 or 4 episodes do a great job of describing the history of Jazz into Swing into Be Bop...one of the biggest surprises you will find is the racism which was so prevalent...even in the 50's and 60's some of the New Orleans musicians remember playing a gig where they would put a curtain in front of the band *while they were playing*.    OUCH--my brain hurts...it has to do with UA175 flying faster into the WTC than is physically possible, right?   I certainly wouldn't say that...I would say many of them should be prosecuted--but that will never happen.   I would disagree--at this point anyone who can read KNOWS the CIA and the NSA are involved in many acts which are morally despicable and constitutionally illegal. Some of these NSA-CIA actions are directed towards Americans on U.S. soil.   The most recent example being the CIA's creation and funding of the National Student Association--created in 1947 (cough, cough) to act as a honeypot which duped U.S. college students into informing on international students.    The ground the Pentagon stands on was also referred to as "Hell's Bottom."  When Roosevelt saw the plans he told them to cut the size in half--they didn't listen.    FYI: the is NO relationship between We the People and the CIA.  The CIA was created behind closed doors with no open discussion--a handful of OSS-Wall Streeters and Pentagon Mafia secretly had the Agency created and funded.    We the People have no fucking goddamn idea what they have done--or what they are doing at this moment. We do know they have LIED and LIED and LIED to us...maybe that's why they won't let We the People see any files--any further exposure would only reveal more LIES.     Thanks...I wrote/posted it last week--it got a few upvotes and drifted into oblivion...  Take it and run with it if you like--be interesting to see what you come up with!!!   Yup--I noticed that...possibly "Mohammed Atta" is a popular name (as in there are many people named Mohammed Atta)?     (Partial?) Answer:  [The CIA Is Wall Street, and Drug Money Is King](http://www.american-buddha.com/911.ciawallstreetruppert.htm)   The US Government is more interested in WAR than in creating PEACE. The USG hides our own history from We the People. The USG allows War Crimes by our own leaders to go unpunished.  -----------------  The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.  The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.  The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?    The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.   The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?  The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.  The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar.   The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...  FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).  I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?  -------------     "HELP!!!  I only make six figures a year to support ILLEGAL OPERATIONS against every nation on the planet--including my own country!!!"        Det. Asshole Cherry most likely has done this many other times--this is just the first time it was caught on camera.  Who knows what Det. Asshole Cherry would have done if there weren't 2 witnesses in the back of the car.  Who knows how many other people have been dragged in by Det. Asshole Cherry under false, made-up charges.   ...and our current president quoted MLK on his way to getting elected, dedicated a statue to MLK once he was elected and, most recently, made a trip to Selma (in part) to celebrate the life of MLK--but forgets to call for the release of the FBI records.  Hollow, disingenuous words followed by disingenuous actions...  NEVER FORGET:  MLK would be abhorred by the 1,000+ drone strikes Obama has allowed and the continuation of the excessive military spending the U.S.A. is pumping into WAR, INC.  NEVER FORGET:  the speech that got MLK killed was his ["Beyond Vietnam"](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_beyond_vietnam/) speech which he made exactly one year before he was assassinated by elements of our own government.  NEVER FORGET: that the reason we do NOT have a full video of MLK's speech is because the media left after they got some news footage and STOPPED recording--they LEFT the event in the middle of the speech.  Luckily, we do have the audio recording and MLK's full, written speech.          The author does a great job in the book of describing the fanatical taste federal authorities had for prosecuting Al Capone. Eig, thru a stroke of luck, actually got the government to release an unreleased FBI file which showed that Capone was not responsible for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre--it was actually crooked Chicago cops who were killing mobsters to pay them back for a robbery which had taken place a week prior (a cop had been killed in the robbery). Of course, FBI Director/Blackmailer J. Edgar Hoover never saw cops killing gangsters on St. Valentine's Day as a crime.  But, Prohibition had directly led to an upsurge in violent crime among the gangsters protecting their booze and territories. President Hoover appointed a special prosecutor to take Capone down. The prosecutor eventually found evidence from a previous bust of a gin joint--it was an accounting ledger which the government used in their tax evasion case to estimate what Capone's income was. But the accounting ledger also showed the money the cops were being paid off as well. Obviously, the cops were never prosecuted. Same accounting ledger--but all the crooked cops walked as they watched Capone go down.   Interesting that Eig notes how the prison doctors used "experimental" drugs on Capone while he was being treated in prison for syphilis. Who knows--Capone may not even have had syphilis--they may have just fucked him up while they were using him as a guinea pig.    very well written article with some great quotes by former LEOs.  i see the cops literally preying upon the African-American population everyday where I live...they literally drive down a main street from a white part of town, pull into the walmart--so they can check all the license plates...then they wait for them to drive out, pull them over and, cha-ching--more money for the corporate prison complex.   some municipalities actually have parking enforcement drive around and ticket out of state vehicles once they are parked in an area over 30 days for not transferring plates (it might even be shorter than 30 days).  for those who haven't heard: the License Plate Readers the cops use while they are cruising mall parking lots (or pulling you over) will automatically pull up the registered river's info and make different audio sounds for offenses (a cash register opening for a late ticket payment, etc)....dana priest (Wash Post) reported on this in her 2006 book *Top Secret America* (which was mostly focused on the growth of the government/corporate intelligence agencies post 9/11).  ---------     **i guess that's why 837 fucking pinko anarchists upvoted it**   it would be taken down within 1/25th of a second and I'd be banned for life from r/news   Fully agree the "free beacon" is either a group of CIA sycophants or a CIA funded operation...  I just wonder if there even was a suicide--possibly the CIA made this up to slow down the release of the report...  ...or, more likely, there really was a suicide, in which case there should have been some release of info after the family was notified. The media certainly wasn't interested--that's for sure.     (full article from freebeacon.com)  ------------------  CIA Official Dies in Apparent Suicide  Death did not take place at CIA headquarters  BY: [Bill Gertz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gertz)     April 4, 2014 11:46 pm  A senior CIA official has died in an apparent suicide this week from injuries sustained after jumping off a building in northern Virginia, according to sources close to the CIA.  CIA spokesman Christopher White confirmed the death and said the incident did not take place at CIA headquarters in McLean, Va.  We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done, White told the Washington Free Beacon. He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.  A source close to the agency said the man who died was a middle manager and the incident occurred after the man jumped from the fifth floor of a building in Fairfax County.  Many agency employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered a part of the profession, for the three general types of employees: Intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, and members of the clandestine services, the agencys elite spying branch.  The CIA is known to operate or rent space in a number of semi-secret locations in the country, including at least one high-rise building in Tysons Corner.  The agency also operates a number of top-secret facilities used by its clandestine service officers, including agency safe houses.  No other details of the death could be learned.  The agency is currently engaged in a high profile dispute with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  Sen. Diane Feinstein (D., Calif.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has said the CIA has blocked efforts by the committee to investigate harsh interrogation of terrorists.  Committee staff members working at a CIA facility in Northern Virginia to investigate agency interrogation practices also have charged that the CIA covertly searched the agencys computers that were being used in the investigation.  The agency subsequently reported that several Senate staff members had improperly and possibly illegally removed classified material from the CIA. The FBI was asked to investigate the mishandling of classified information in the case.  The agency is under pressure from Congress to declassify a 6,000-page report on agency interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, used to glean information from al Qaeda terrorists captured after the 2001 attacks on Washington and New York.  The agency also this week came under scrutiny from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence over the agencys role in obscuring the facts surrounding the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.  Former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell told the committee that agency analysts concluded that a protest took place in advance of the attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.  Morrell testified that subsequent information revealed this judgment to be incorrect.  The CIA was operating a facility in Benghazi with a large number of agency personnel whose activities had not been made public.  Speculation about the CIA annex in Benghazi has focused on the agencys role in supplying weapons to Libyan militias that in turn were shipping the arms to Islamist rebels in Syria.  ------------------   The article in the *Washington Free Beacon* was the only source of info (all other articles merely repeated the vague details from the Free Beacon).  Even stranger still was the TIMING of the release of the freebeacon.com article: **11:46 PM on a Friday night**. It was just ONE DAY AFTER the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) had voted to release the $40 million Torture Report Edit which looked into CIA actions in the post-9/11 era. There had been hearings on Benghazi that week as well...Seymour Hersh had released his article The Red Line and the Rat Line in the London Review of Books (which has been thoroughly whitewashed in the complicit U.S. media)...  In 2011 Barack Obama led an allied military intervention in Libya without consulting the US Congress. Last August, after the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, he was ready to launch an allied air strike, this time to punish the Syrian government for allegedly crossing the **red line** he had set in 2012 on the use of chemical weapons.  ... The **rat line**, authorised in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida.  http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line  So NO ONE at any news organization has been able to follow-up on this in the past YEAR???    -------------------    also see:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gertz  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/24sxfz/30_days_ago_a_cia_official_committed_suicide_in/  http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2370vt/still_no_follow_up_to_april_4th_article_a_senior/      Jim Marrs' [*RULE BY SECRECY*] (http://sandiego.indymedia.org/media/2006/10/119974.pdf)  also see Antony C. Sutton's *AMERICA'S SECRET ESTABLISHMENT: THE ORDER OF SKULL   BONES* at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2h6486/the_best_enemy_money_can_buy_by_antony_c_sutton/)   ---------------  Frustrating listening to this interview--wish Jon Gold had scored a few more points early on--especially with the reasoning behind Iraq. The Iraq War wasn't just about oil--what a lot of people miss is that it was about the PetroDollar. In fall 2000, [Saddam had switched from the PetroDollar to the Euro](http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system-part-3/) in Iraq's oil-for-food program. The expansion of the Military Industrial Complex greatly enriched thousands of private defense/intelligence corporations. Glad that Jon Gold did mention Dick Cheney and Halliburton and was able to remain quite calm. It's very well documented that the neocons were frothing at the mouth for [regime change in Iraq throughout the 90's](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003).   I also wish Jon Gold had pointed out how the 9/11 Commission seemed to be set up to fail. Financially, the commission was initially set up with $3 million--which may sound like a lot, but the largest investigation of the largest crime on American mainland soil had to pay 84 people (a large percentage of attorneys). In contrast, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence funded the EDIT the CIA Torture Report with $40 million (right off the bat in 2008). I found Shenon's *The Commission* did a pretty good job of revealing how aspects of the commission were controlled--mostly by Zelikow, but the commission offices were actually in a CIA managed building (and in the wake of what we know of the [CIA spying recently on the SSCI](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/03/12/calls-brennans-ouster-emerge-along-details-cia-search-senate-computers/)...). It is useful to study the Pattern these commissions/investigations take--reading Gaeton Fonzi's *The Last Investigation* is helpful in this regard (even though it is about the House Sub-Committee on Assassinations).    Overall, I'm glad I listened and definitely have a lot of respect for Jon Gold who did a great job of separating the 9/11 provocateurs (Alex Jones, Webster Tarpley) from those who are seeking Justice and Accountability.   I think Jonathon Kay is a sycophant--especially since Jon Gold pointed out that Kay has some slight connection to James Woolsey (a former CIA director). The entire main stream media is corrupted filth--I expect no actual truth from them. They will [LIE us into another useless war soon enough](https://vimeo.com/33033186). Fox, cbs, nbc, abc the nyt--they are all CIA-Pentagon Sycophants (bootlickers, ass-kissers, fawning parasites) who are happy to head home to their McMansions which are paid for In Full with the blood of at least 1.5 million people from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan...and a few thousand dead U.S. soldiers, too.   -----------------   Haven't heard of this before...I would think you should change your password for reddit immediately and contact the mods/sys administrators so they can look into it further.   Actually...after WWII, the Marshall Plan was hijacked by the CIA--there was a secret codicil which sent at least 5% of the roughly $15 Billion (about $700 million) to the CIA...these funds were used by the agency to fund political parties in Europe and Japan (as well as to buy large houses for the station chiefs)...the agency also began funding the National Student Association in 1947 (which held conferences around the globe to spy/recruit/tattle on the international students)...  The CIA's take wasn't revealed until about 50 years later (it's always  a great way to control history if you can keep the truth from coming out for at least 50 to 100 years).  CBS, of course, has many CIA ties and would certainly be more than willing to pump out some propaganda. (see Carl Bernstein's "CIA and the Media" article)   I just can't believe how often I see VOA (Voice of America) linked to.   [*Murrow: His Life and Times*](http://www.amazon.com/Murrow-Times-Communications-Media-Studies/dp/0823218821/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1427847913 sr=1-2-fkmr0 keywords=sperber+edward+r+mussow) by A.M. Sperber...  It was certainly foreboding the way he left CBS, then he took a position for Voice of America and babbled U.S. propaganda in Vietnam. The most trustworthy voice in journalism driven from broadcast tv because he had a dedication to the truth.   Up until the last few years, I had a deep respect for cbs news and Walter Cronkite--but after researching 20th century u.s. history (especially the JFK assassination, the CIA and 9/11) my respect is shattered. i studied journalism in college--which is what sparked my interest in the Murrow bio.   I just wonder: does the head of NSA have an NSA-proof phone, too???      (not trying to break rules...nextgov.com used ALL CAPS in the headline)   DoD vs. NSA vs. CIA vs. DIA vs. FBI vs. POTUS vs. SS vs. DHS vs. DEA vs. Congress vs. We the People   the article says they sell these phones to private companies and privacy-minded citizens as well...         DoD vs. NSA vs. CIA vs. DIA vs. FBI vs. POTUS vs. DHS vs. DEA vs. Congress vs. We the Serfs         I read in a Murrow bio that in the middle of WWII Winston Churchill offered Murrow the #1 position at the bbc...he obviously turned it down. After the disgraceful treatment he received from cbs "news" in the 50's I bet he regretted it.   would they volunteer if they weren't PAID???   JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.  JSOC.      r/news should be renamed r/NaziNews   my point is that I constantly hear people brag about how we have a "voluntary military"...but that seems to obfuscate the fact that they are all paid with substantial benefits (health, education, special financing for mortgages)...obviously, i'm not saying they shouldn't be paid...but there is a substantial portion of troops who are there so they can get money for college and even a small portion who are enlisted so they can receive u.s. citizenship.  the Pentagon employs 3.2 million (some of these are civilians)...i would bet that even the lowest pay grade is somewhere around $30,000 per year...i'm sure there's a significant number who make six figures...               i've never come across the site before--which doesn't mean anything--but many of us "conspiracists" think the government puts out disinfo to make the truthers look wacky.   i didn't have time to watch the whole interview--that's just my gut reaction. did the architect provide any documents or a photo of him with one of the bin Ladens? the bin Ladens are a huge family and do have a construction company in Saudi Arabia--so there is a chance they may have crossed paths.   i would also hope the architect would have contacted the authorities at the time if this had actually happened...  glad you like some of my posts--i definitely try to bring some interesting points up...   disinfo.   very insightful--thanks for posting...i have felt the USG seems hell-bent on war for quite some time because the u.s. seems to be swinging wildly around the globe...i just posted a short essay which expresses my concern for the direction we are on...  i hope we're WRONG!!!  can't believe this didn't even make the front page.   The USG allows the bankers to walk away from prosecution. If a citizen transfers money illegally or commits mortgage fraud--we'd be locked up, but the banks are allowed to make out of court settlements with no prosecution on the record. But We the People must follow the ever-increasing library of laws and regulations now imposed on us.  The USG allows the DoD to write their own checks with no audit necessary--while the citizens and small businesses of the country follow the law and submit their taxes or face serious penalties.  The USG allows the intelligence agencies to trample our rights and the U.S. Constitution--no serious investigation of the NSA has taken place. We do not know the true actions of the CIA-FBI-DoD because of the extreme secrecy. How can we possibly know if the agencies are acting in our interest--and within the law--if we do not even know what they have done?    The USG allows our law enforcement to jail millions. They would rather pay for our citizens to be jailed than pay for our children to receive the best education or provide training for those who need it.   The USG attacks other countries around the globe--JSOC has boots on the ground in about 100 countries right now. Will we end up in another "war"? Will it be in Iraq? Syria? Yemen? Ukraine? Iran? Korea? China? Russia? Will it be because they attacked our soil or because we are protecting the business interests of the .01%?  The USG also wages economic warfare against other countries which leads to instability and is not a peaceful long-term solution. We do not need to overthrow other governments--they have a right to be their own sovereign nation and to live peacefully. Other nations have a right to make their own laws and choose their own leaders.  The USG would rather invade other countries and build military bases and infrastructure over there than upgrade our own infrastructure. Most of our soldiers should be employed building roads, high-speed rail lines, and green energy infrastructure--but instead they are sent to fight for oil and the PetroDollar.   The USG allows corporations to write our laws: agriculture, banks, energy, healthcare, media/cable conglomerates, transportation, tax laws...  FINALLY: The USG allowed our country to be attacked on 9/11 with no open investigation. In fact, our leaders openly resisted the investigations of both the Joint Intelligence Committee and the 9/11 Commission. Evidence was destroyed, the investigations were obstructed and the evidence hidden from We the People (and the world).  I do love the people here--but the USG is FAILING. Our leaders should be concentrating on helping us--the tax payers--instead of bombing other countries around the globe and leading us into another War. Who is running things--the Pentagon? the CIA? the defense companies? the bankers?       ------  NICE...been wanting to read this as Kinzer is one of my favorite authors. Kinzer is also one of the better public speakers as well--he really manages to make the subject interesting.   -----------------  *OVERTHROW* LECTURE (2006, 1hr 21min)  http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499417/stephen-kinzer-talks-book-overthrow-americas-century-regime-change-hawaii-iraq  ---------------  *Q   A* w/ Stephen Kinzer, discussing *The Brothers: John Foster, Allen Dulles and their Secret World War* (2013, 59min)  http://www.c-span.org/video/?315393-1/qa-stephen-kinzer  ----------------    In terms of money, I find it even more revealing that the 9/11 Commission was initially funded with just $3 million--while the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence budgeted $40 million for the Torture Report to be spliced, diced and redacted. The attorneys who did the "editing" were CIA-approved.   I definitely recommend people read up on other commissions--*The Last Investigation* by Gaeton Fonzi does a great job of showing how the HSCA was controlled by the purse strings and manipulated by the CIA (false leads, excessive control of files, etc). The patterns used to undercut the commissions become more apparent when you read Philip Shenon's *The Commission* directly after. (I do recognize there are weak aspects of Shenon's work which David Ray Griffin (?) has pointed out.)   LBJ definitely knew he was dying--possibly he felt betrayed by the country or the press or the CIA or the Pentagon for his failure in Vietnam.  Being President wasn't the dream job he had always hoped for. Odd that he would say "The American people had enough of Presidents dying in office."    Until I watched a C-Span panel discussion earlier today, I never realized that LBJ admitted this not once--but twice.  [L. Fletcher Prouty mentioned this *Atlantic* article](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4532917/l-fletcher-prouty-describes-jfk-assassination-conspiracy). LBJ does seem to be drunk or heavily medicated in the [CBS interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfFMUWg39WU), but a second admission to a reporter at his ranch is significant--especially since LBJ was very guarded after he left DC.   I finally watched *Rich Man's Trick* for the first time a few weeks ago--which confirmed one of my biggest suspicions (that the JFK limo almost came to a stop). The Secret Service agent who ran up to the JFK limo was always a red flag for me.  The *Atlantic* article also mentions that reporters would question LBJ about where he was on the night of the 23rd--any ideas about the significance of this? It also reminds me of how Dick Cheney was absent in the weeks following 9/11 (except for arranged press interviews).

Later it became clear that the NSA was funded by the CIA.  The NSA worked both in the U.S. and internationally.        	188
       Well, I don't think US should *support* them. I just don't think US should be trying so hard to stop them. Seems likely ISIS will lose anyway. Worst case scenario, ISIS wins and wipes out the Syrian government, the Iranian government and a few terrorist groups. As for the civilians, they're utterly screwed under both the status quo and ISIS, so we're not doing them any favors either.   right, so those are bad things. But, like, everyone they're at war with is equally bad, and a bunch are actually kind of worse.    I think the USA should join Team ISIS.  Think about it. ISIS is trying to overthrow the Syrian government (that would be Bashar al-Assad's government, the one that used chemical weapons on its civilians). Meanwhile, ISIS is also at war with: Iran (the ones with the rogue nukes), Hezbollah (the ones with the rogue rocket strikes) and basically every failed state and terrorist organization in the region. Why are we trying to stop them?   It's ridiculous.      Here's an abstract from [the full study:](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150609/ncomms8352/full/ncomms8352.html) Exceptionally preserved organic remains are known throughout the vertebrate fossil record, and recently, evidence has emerged that such soft tissue might contain original components. We examined samples from eight Cretaceous dinosaur bones using nano-analytical techniques; the bones are not exceptionally preserved and show no external indication of soft tissue. In one sample, we observe structures consistent with endogenous collagen fibre remains displaying ~67nm banding, indicating the possible preservation of the original quaternary structure. Using ToF-SIMS, we identify amino-acid fragments typical of collagen fibrils. Furthermore, we observe structures consistent with putative erythrocyte remains that exhibit mass spectra similar to emu whole blood. Using advanced material characterization approaches, we find that these putative biological structures can be well preserved over geological timescales, and their preservation is more common than previously thought. The preservation of protein over geological timescales offers the opportunity to investigate relationships, physiology and behaviour of long extinct animals.   Death To Paywalls!! Here's a bootleg copy of the complete study: http://docdro.id/12xxp               huh. that's a good point. we should really say "newly discovered species".

 The fact that he *kept her from a phone* is the most telling. If it was truly "rape play" there would be no need to keep her from a phone. In fact if he took her phone from her it's pretty obvious he knew he was passing the line from rape fantasy into actual rape.   he kept her from leaving so there's that   This probably wasn't the first time he's done this, he has probably preyed upon women in the past in a similar fashion and will continue to do so until stopped. At least imo   most rape victims tend to have a guilt complex. media tends to have a "she was asking for it" by dressing that way, drinking, being alone with men, etc mentality and at some point it's self-internalized. I would strongly recomend counseling for op's friend because most rape victims will suffer from guilt for years, which can lead to depression, acting out, drug abuse, promiscuity, etc.   As someone who has had rape fantasies, and someone who has actually been raped, I would just like to add that the fantasy of rape is completely different from actual rape.  This could have easily have happened to me and I feel for your friend.  Obviously she trusted this guy to NOT go overboard and he took advantage of her.  Even in a bdsm type scenario, there would be safewords and someone experienced would be able to tell true distress signals from "oh no please don't (stop)".  There would probably even be check ins from time to time to make sure your friend was ok and that continuing was alright. As someone who was raped, it is sometimes triggered during sex (even vanilla sex) for the strangest of reasons. Yes I like being fucked in the ass and choked but if I start crying or not being all there, I'm not in a great state of mind and a loving partner would realize that and comfort me/stop. This is obviously not a loving partner but a predator who needs to realize what he did was wrong.   Um, no if I go meet someone I met online it does not mean they can keep me a prisoner, for three days or for the rest of my life.   I am assuming that someone can testify to the fact that she was in fact, missing for three days   Yes they were having consentual sex. However, she did NOT consent to being slapped in the face by a cock. I still believe that is something you discuss beforehand. As a person with kinks, I am a big supporter of knowing your partner's limits beforehand.  Would I get upset over being slapped in the face with a cock? NO if I had *previously agreed to doing so*.   I wish, then I could sit around on my ass all day.   I agree, If that's his fetish  and he HAS to have that kind of stuff to get off, and she doesn't agree to participate in it, it's probably better that they both find someone else. Otherwise years down the road he's probably going to resent her   It's unreasonable for him to expect you to do that stuff when it is a turn-off to you.   awww, what a cutie   roflmao grossss   but him being *physically abusive* to her is ok?  Everyone has limits. It's smart to find those out ahead of time.   next time ask first   this is the greatest thing ever   aw man does it have pictures?   fuck yeah.   DAMN, already expired   My maternal grandmother died of breast cancer. It was 20 years ago. Thankfully, today it's NOT a death sentence like it was back then. Anyway just wanted to add, your SO rocks. Keep fighting the good fight!   "I wanted to buy the 28 inflatable dinosaur to put in my backyard, reasoning that it would keep the squirrels and birds off of my pool screen,"   You so should have bought it   I tend to be upfront about it. If you're into it cool, if not well it's probably not going to work out. lol   as a matter of fact I do. I clean up people's shit everyday.    I used to be when I was little but as I grew up I decided it was the way I am and I couldn't change and having guilt over it was just making me more depressed.   Maybe I'm old school, but whatever happened to old school peaceful protests?   And who has to clean up all  that glass? The goddamned workers the protest is supposed to be for/helping.     Yea we have trash cans but apparently that's too much work   very sorry but if she's suffering, it's for the best. also she's had a really long life, I hope my cat lives that long    As someone who CANNOT have babies this would piss me off to no end   ROFL   Well there was the time the scumbags left baby diapers all over storage stinking up the whole place. I also had to pick up POOP off the floor. ugh   the cherry blossom hair stuff, does it smell awesome??   damn I shoulda got this   ALSO it gets to the point where I just want them to rip my ovaries out, baby or no baby, because I can no longer tolerate the constant pain   I have pcos and tons of lower back/ovary pain. I had a laparoscopy and they lazered out some of the cysts. I was pain free for about a month before the pain came back. Currently popping pain pills like candy and laying in bed because walking hurts :(   why would you expect a CLOTHING store to have a swiffer? wtf?   I didn't think they even sold windows 7 anymore?   She was more traumatized than I was. I felt so awful :(   used to be?   I have the same type of fetishes. (Female) It's nothing to be ashamed of, you just need to find someone who has the same kinks as you and set ground rules (safewords, safe, sane and consentual)   That's not something to be ashamed of, it means you have a heart.   We had Sphynxes so we tried to keep them warm in winter. Of course they would just burrow under blankets in a heat pile anyway   We used to make cat sweaters out of old sweatshirt sleeves. Oddly enough they liked them better than the expensive ass cute ones from the pet store   We had sphynx cats and we'd give them sweaters in the winter but they still hated them   If they are hairless cats, it is to keep them warm. Otherwise because humans are silly   but he's ok I think   urinary blockage   We finally got one of the upside down two liter bottle $11 water feeders. But they really love the fountain :(   normally the cat fountains get gross and slimy and we just throw them out. but at $40 each they are too damn expensive. Why can't they just make them easier to clean?   oh god, I'm worried now. What about the food was causing it? I had a cat with constipation and was worried it was the cheap cat food we were buying   without the needle obviously, lol      oh no, glad he's ok. I had a cat with the opposite problem, she was constipated and couldn't poo. Vet told us to feed her vaseline and it worked like a charm. Trust me you haven't lived until you've tried giving your cat a makeshift enema with a syringe.   both   hope he's better!   jade green nail polish? ooo pretty   I didn't want to be the first asshole to say it lol TY   Man you are lucky. My tits are always the first thing to go when I lose weight.   For some reason I was imagining it at the reception.   haha he's gorgeous, and obviously very spoiled   We had a child abuser down the street when I was growing up. The wife and kids would run down the road screaming without shoes on. My mother took them in our house and called the police multiple times. They refused to do anything about it. It was in rural WV and it was really horrible :(   buy a major brand then dumbass lady.   Almost 30, still get pimples. Also customers have no business talking about employees and their physical appearance.   Well in my experience sleeping with the fan on dries my sinuses up really bad. I think it makes the air really dry? Like to the point where I need a damn humidifier.   meat and guns!!!   there's also a 25 lb gummy bear. I want one, now that I know it exists   thank god I'm not the only one rationalizing buying it to my SO   noooo the sour patch kids are the best. watermelons are good too   ice cream or chocolate   I drove an hour each way every day to work. It sucks but it's not impossible.    A new manager came in, and first called me a "spic"  Now THAT you can take to HR!!!   should have transferred :(   I get this all the time. People tell me to smile and cheer up. Um you try working this job and smiling all the time. Plus when I put on a fake smile I look psycho like I'm about to chop someone to pieces.   hadn't heard about that one, thanks!   I'm so sorry :(   Have you tried anti-depressants?   Yea it is too rough for faces.   some dude managed to sneak in after we closed today at work. our coworkers left after 5 while we stayed to do the deposit. the assholes unlocked the door and suprise suprise some guy comes strolling in, oblivious to the fact that it's 20 minutes after 5 when we close and the lights are all off.   lol that's adorable   haha I tried to cancel like a day after I signed up but they said they wouldn't send the free box. SO cancel AFTER the free box ships lol I have to wait until may 8 and THEN cancel   every time I call julep I get put on hold for like 2 hours   Wellll I have a job but on my day off I like to catch up on internet stuff/reddit, make soap, clean house, and wash laundry.   I am a former self-mutilator. You don't know HOW many times people just assumed I was sexually molested. I wasn't. I wasn't "repressing" it, it flat out did not happen.    dr drew is a moron   NO. NOOOO   bah I would have maced the shit out of the guy   I get them on my inner thigh/pubic/ass region. Not fun   lucky!!   they were offering a free box. I don't know if that offer is still valid.  http://imgur.com/1ikPQeB   Because getting out of bed in the morning is hard enough   Nooooooooo!   Omg you are lucky you weren't all killed.  Please do not leave your kids unsupervised with that man.   meh you have to have a combined total of over $7,000 in their bank at all times in order to avoid the monthly fee.    it's not the bartender's job to be a babysitter....   "You don't even pay them anything to hold your money"  uh actually I do. Wells fargo charges me a $13 monthly fee.  They can also eat my asshole.   so... what's next, shutting down the bank account of anyone who has ever *rented* a porn?   this one's my favorite :)   how does the bartender know he was going to go drive drunk?   Does it ever leak? I have a diaphragm so I assume it's the same basic concept. I thought the diaphragm might be giving me a yeast infection so I stopped using it. I think it was the spermicide I was using with it that gave me problems though.  haha just a quick edit to say I was washing it every time I used it, I'm not gross. lol   From what I saw it looked really fun and cute. Plus the jewelry looked nice. I also liked that they had handmade bath goods, candles, etc.   Nah, I couldn't find it :( Ended up just emailing them   Take the dog to an emergency vet asap   Ahh! Good to know. I hate the add on items it seems like everything I want to buy is add on lol   is that the one with all the cute necklaces and stuff?    I was wondering specifically about the unbleached tampons. I used to get really bad yeast infections and the organic tampons seemed to help a lot.  I can only find them at whole foods and they're like $12 a box. So paying an extra $8 to not have to make a 10-20 mile trip is worth it to me, not including chocolate and tea, etc. I will look at amazon for those however. It just seems like everything I need is a damned add-on only item.  	104
    Most of the list is looking back at things the sport has done before which is always bad news.   Personally I think the formula is great, the speed always comes back as the teams develop the cars, I'd just like to see closer racing.   I'm from Northampton, although I live in London, and have been to about 15 BGP. Totally worth going, even if its your first and only time. General admission tickets have very decent views depending on how early you make it to a spot (go *very* early, take a friend, plan your spot in advance).   Don't take the train - rent a car - place is a buggering nightmare to get to by rail.       Now there are [photographs](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CGxHDWwXEAA3Tos.jpg:large)            From a recent [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2015/05/31/f1-revenue-accelerates-past-fifas-to-16-2-billion/) article:  Research by the Express newspaper last year revealed that Mr Ecclestone has signed deals worth an estimated $23.4 billion in the 30 years since he took over the helm of F1. It is understood to be more than any other individual in the history of professional sport has raised.  Pretty impressive record  Mr Ecclestone is directly in charge of bringing in new business across all of F1s major revenue streams. The sport has no chief marketing officer, no press officer and not even a deputy chief executive or successor for its 84 year-old boss. He says he has no intention of retiring and whilst he is delivering these kind of results it is little surprise that CVC too doesn't want him to give up the wheel.  You won't replace Bernie with one person. There simply isn't anyone who could do what Bernie does at the level he does it, and across the different disciplines involved. The board would restructure FOM into a more modern business with separate people in charge of the major revenue streams.   You can pay Now TV (which are a Sky brand) 6.99 for a one day pass or 9.99 for a week pass and have the high quality stream in the UK. It's pretty good and honestly its both cheaper and better than having the full Sky package.  The problem is the way rights are negotiated both historically and currently with national level broadcasters by region on ten year contracts - this type of licensing runs across many sports and is in general 'the way things are done' in the industry.  If you wanted a centralized streaming solution then FOM would have to come to an agreement with *every* regional broadcaster over a licensing fee on the pictures (because they've already licenced them from FOM), and another separate agreement over the commentary (the IP for which is their property of the broadcaster), and a third over how and when the revenue is distributed.   You could negotiate for FOM to hold the streaming rights exclusively, but FOM then wouldn't fetch a good price on the rights, and it would lower the quality of the TV shows because, as a business, the broadcaster will have to start to question the value of shipping a team of 30+ people around the world to every race in order to produce a show that it realises little or no cash flow from.  Achieving a global streaming deal would be a hugely complex effort and take years of negotiations - not only that but a centralised solution isn't necessarily in the financial interests of FOM or the regional broadcasters both of whom are buying the rights to a product they can repackage and sell at a profit. It may, however, save everyone the costs of producing and marketing their own apps and streaming and that might be attractive in the long run.  The new F1 app broadcasts commentary in multiple languages so I do believe this is the direction they are moving in, but you'll probably have to wait until the each regional contract is renewed for it to happen globally.  $1 a race is completely unrealistic pricing wise though, it wouldn't even cover the production costs of filming the races let alone provide enough revenue for everyone to make money - remember the TV rights make up about $6 - 700 million of the team's prize money - hurting the value of the TV rights directly hurts the teams.   No, but the engines can be reused unless they had to be changed because of a failure. You could take a change and then re-use an engine for a low power circuit.   There was a proposal to allow an extra engine for friday practice only, but it didn't go through.   10 place grid penalty per new engine.   In 2014 $398 million on $1.6 billion in revenue.         It won't - the FIA bidding document is seeking a sole supplier only.   I'm very disappointed in Max's reaction to the crash - he keeps doubling down on the braking claim. He declared on his instagram feed after the race that he believes he was brake tested and that it cost him points he 'deserved'.   That claim provoked a response from Lotus proving he was wrong and then a response from Grosjean, rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! Especially at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall.  Two days after the instagram post he said in an article on his own website.  "After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."  The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - and the fact that no one has talked him down suggests that he's surrounded by 'yes people' and that doesn't bode well for his future.  Hopefully criticism from F1's most experienced driver will hurt in a good way and bring him down to earth.   From a sports perspective you have to brush this sort of thing off and focus on the next race. That's really the biggest improvement Hamilton has been able to make in his racing.         To translate some of the figures the article puts Jordan Ford's 2003 budget at around $79 million, in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today. Minardi was pegged at $46 million ($60 million in 2015 money) and again that's about the budget of a 2015 back of the grid team.  Ferrari were spending $418 million in 2003 (equivalent of $617 million in 2015 or double Mercedes current budget), and they're actually spending around $250 million now.  Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same, accounting for inflation, rather than climbing as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. In other words the cost reduction efforts have been very successful.      In 2004 [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/2785546) put Jordan Ford's 2003 budget at around $79 million, in 2015 dollars thats $101 million, which is about the annual budget estimation for the mid-pack teams today. Minardi was pegged at $46 million or $60 million in 2015 money, and again that's about the budget of a 2015 back of the grid team.  Ferrari by comparison were spending $418 million in 2003, the equivalent of $617 million in 2015, and they're actually spending around $250 million now.  Overall that suggests that costs have slowed or remained the same rather than climbed as steeply as everyone seems to imagine. In other words the cost reduction efforts have been very successful.  FYI Read that article - it could have been written today.   Adelaide 1986 - last race of the season and an absolute [classic](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8vjjg_f1-adelaide-1986-rosberg-and-mansel_auto).   Keke Rosberg almost won what was his last ever F1 race but retired with a delaminating left rear, Mansell just had to keep 3rd to win the WDC having been elevated from 4th by Rosberg's retirement but lost his left rear 2 laps later in spectacular fashion, leaving the WDC to Piquet (the defending champion), or Prost. A precautionary tyre change from Williams left Piquet too far behind and he lost to Prost by 4 seconds having closed 11 seconds of a 15 second gap in the closing stages.  Amazing race, gutted for Mansell.   Villeneuve the driver was terrific, Villeneuve bloviating, bitter, and endlessly negative commentator not so much.  He's one of 'those drivers' now. It's a pity because his post F1 career has been pretty good and he's one of the very few with a shot at the motorsport triple crown.   I remember Raikkonen's rear wing flying off in a chicane - Kimi has the worst luck!   Given that 2010 caused Ferrari to fire Aldo Costa who went on to be the Engineering Director responsible for the W05 and W06 it was definitely worse!   Mansell's tyre exploding and costing him his second WDC.   Equally bad was Mansell's car stalling on the last lap of Canada 91'  Absolutely gutting.   If there had been double points in the last round of every season Raikkonen would have beaten Schumacher in 03', Hamilton would have lost to Massa in 08', and Alonso would have beaten Vettel in 12'.  Those, incidentally, are the only WDC's that double points would have altered between 2000 and 2013.      Its got little to do with the regs and everything to do with the driver position in the car - the height of the driver and their seating position affects the weight distribution significantly. /u/Blanchimont has a good summary of what can be [done](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/38dypt/merhi_bemoans_weight_difference_to_f1_teammate/crusb6l).  There are some things that the regs can balance driver weight wise, but its very hard to regulate for driver height not least because you have to alter the car to get the seating position right. Its questionable these days if Webber or Coulthard would make it as far as they did given they're both about the same height as Hulkenberg.   He, from his perspective, didn't have any worthwhile choice. In the end it was drive for Toyota or leave.   Its a negotiation ploy. No matter how badly your career is going you don't leave F1 unless you have no other choice.   Force India have said that they'd like to keep their current line-up.   The WDC would remain points decided, just with bonus points awarded, and that would bring it into line with other major competitions like the Six Nations. F1's present system is countback - which also rewards race winners above non-winners but is only used when there is a points tie.  A large chunk of the money teams get is based on their WDC points, the more points you get the more money you get - this would provide a mechanism to achieve that without renegotiating the concorde agreement which will remain in place until 2020.  In any case my point was that one group of people say that x is a problem, those in charge attempt to find a solution that fits within the frameworks in place that solves the problems put forward - at which point the teams fail to agree, put a broken version forward and everyone goes mad.            It didn't so much as get neutered as Red Bull broke it up.   My point really is that people spend so much time and energy on Bernie and being cynical and/or foolish about his motives that they fail to notice the actual politics of the sport and who really makes the decisions. The failure of the teams to agree on anything is the only real problem the sport has ever had - that was as true in the 1950s as it is today - and the teams should receive a much more critical press than they actually get.  Double points last year was a case in point. Bernie's proposal was for a bonus points system for race wins delivered through medals and double points through the last three races of the season.  The issues that proposal was trying to solve were three fold:-  - That the WDC winner should also have won the most races;  - That the mid-grid teams are struggling financially and more points means more money delivered from FOM; and  - That all but the top three ceasing development late in the season made the racing dull and more points available would incentivise continued development while spicing up the drivers championship.  These are all things widely supported by both fans and the teams, and all big issues.  The Strategy group and the F1 commission (i.e. the teams) could only agree on double points for the last race so thats the broken plan that went ahead - everyone went crazy at Bernie for a decision that wasn't his - and problems were only created not solved.    Whomever holds the presidency of the FIA and the Chairmanship of FOM will always be labelled 'the biggest problem the sport has' because it's very easy to blame them for any problem you choose to.   People act like Bernie and the FIA are the same thing, and this isn't the case at all. Secondly unanimous agreement is required.   They never have been able to agree throughout the history of the sport - thats why Bernie was so successful. This is just another episode in the motorsport equivalent of Eastenders.        That is true, and I do take your point. As ever though the teams find a way around whatever [regs are in place](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/fia-clarifies-process-for-power-unit-reliability-upgrades/).         You can, but this has been heavily abused by the teams, and as a result the FIA has come down hard on this in 2015.      Did Ferrari take a new engine for Monaco? I didn't catch that, they're on three this year so far?      I think that while RBR were winning everything in sight and were, to an extent, the big financial force in F1 they successfully sought to split FOTA and negotiate directly with FOM - as a result of their political machinations other teams followed suit and the 2013 Concorde agreement was formed.   A key part of their effort was the fallout from the various trials that Ecclestone went through over the sale of stakes in the commercial rights - I think there were three attempted takeovers a board level - mostly centring on the 15% stake owned by the Lehman estate rather than CVC's controlling interest. My bet is that Mateschitz wanted to acquire that along with another 20% stake which would give him the chairmanship of FOM's board and the controlling interest. Bernie successfully fought off those efforts and CVC retain control at the moment - but I don't think this is where CVC wanted to end up and I don't think they quite know what to do - there is considerable pressure from the teams for them to sell.  At the same time RBR lost a key political battle over the 2014 rules and we're seeing the fallout from that on the track. It appears to me that Mercedes were able to form an alliance with Renault fighting a successful rearguard action to set the direction of the Formula in the interests of the manufacturers. I'd be curious to learn if Honda were involved in the background of all of this.            Its rather like RonSpeak. If you listen and think very carefully about what's being said you'll understand the context and tone of his remarks - problem is most people don't listen or think, they just dismiss.   I think its all very well to criticise Bernie - he takes a lot of flak for decisions made by the teams and direction from CVC - but people fail to consider the alternatives.  In many respects Bernie is F1 - he's the chief deal maker - he has enough clout to bring important people to the table and keep them there and he's a very tough negotiator for the sport.   Were Bernie to go there isn't anyone in the background that is both a sharp political operator and has the clout to drag people along.   It seems that neither Torro Rosso or Lotus are interested in selling to Renault (they would be the ideal targets in terms of infrastructure with Sauber as the third option) but Manor would make a lot more sense than entering a new team entirely.   Lotus and Sauber come with a chunk of debt because Genii and Kaltenborn would want their investments returned at a profit - this makes them less than ideal takeover targets - but makes them interesting investment opportunities.  I've been wondering for a while if Mercedes might leverage its engine deal with Lotus to use them as 'B' team seats for its nascent young driver programme (the fly in that idea being a potential takeover of Lotus by Renault). For all the talk about McLaren and Ferrari 'B' outfits, people seem to have missed Mercedes obvious need for one of their own. They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in - as their 2014 attempt to get Verstappen demonstrated.  The timing of the FIA opening up entries seemed interesting. I thought that Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team if they couldn't find an existing team to buy, but going for Manor makes a lot more commercial sense. For all their lack of infrastructure they have an entry, basic facilities and staff, all of which is better than nothing.  If Mercedes invest in Lotus (both of their drivers appear to be out of contract this year), McLaren Honda bring in ART GP, and Renault take over Manor it will make for a very interesting couple of years ahead - this will put RBR under extreme pressure.  I've suspected that the background to the RBR 'exit' talk is their maneuvering for control of the sporting regulations against Mercedes and Renault - both of whom wanted the v6 formula. It appears to me that RBR lost a political fight they felt certain they would win over the 2014 regulations and unable to get the regs they wanted, a works deal with another supplier, or sell the team, they find themselves trapped politically and commercially.      Considering the Tory Majority is built on less than 20,000 votes it would be unwise to completely ignore polling. 7 of those constituencies went blue by, in total, less than 900 votes collectively.  People forget that the polls are +/-5 in margin of error, and that is not so far from the actual result in the recent election. Talking to friends who are normally reliable Labour voters a number switched to the Greens in the polling booth because they had so little confidence in the Labour leadership.   He's one of those good/reliable drivers who's been unlucky that there was always someone absolutely stellar ahead of him.   They broadcast the BBC when they're televising the race live, and Sky the rest of the time so it was good. The stream seems to vary by country though.      If you subscribe to the F1 app it streams commentary to your device - used this to listen to Monaco whist taking the kids to Comic Con. Worked very well indeed!    I've been wondering for a while if Mercedes might leverage its engine deal with Lotus to use them as 'B' team seats for its nascent young driver programme. They appear to be flirting with Verstappen again, Wehrlein is in the background, as is Ocon, and they can't do anything with them without F1 seats to put them in.  Renault seem interested in buying Lotus, but the Mercedes deal might prevent that from happening immediately, at all, or mean they take a stake and convert to a works outfit for 2017 or beyond once the Mercedes deal is over.   If Lotus aren't willing to sell, and nor are Torro Rosso, then the timing of the FIA opening up entries seems interesting. Perhaps Renault might seek to enter an entirely new team - could this be the project Berger is working on?  Grosjean is out of contract at the end of the season, and Maldonado must be close to the end of his having signed in 2013 for one year and then extended for 2015.      Ultimately the track position data was wrong about where Hamilton was on the circuit which made the result of any calculation performed with that data wrong - or have an unacceptably large margin of error depending on your view.  Either way its perfectly acceptable to describe the data as wrong.   You also can't blame a group of people used to trusting a system which has churned out accurate information numerous times for not catching the error when they had to make a last second call under extreme pressure.  Everybody's an armchair quarterback on this - and no one has a right to be.    GPS doesn't work at Monaco because of the terrain. So their computer system was relying on the timing beams for track position data, that introduced a large margin of error into what would normally be an accurate calculation, so their data was indeed wrong.      Force India appear to have a deal with Mercedes and want to keep their current line up, Sauber with Ferrari, and Manor/Marussia are basically getting people to drive for free - once they have a 2015 spec car they might be useful to someone, but most likely Ferrari.   I don't think the author is writing in his first language.   And he's provably wrong - he wasn't brake tested. He tried a junior move on a circuit where you can't get away with that kind of thing.   Verstappen declared on his instgram feed that he beleives he was [brake tested](https://instagram.com/p/3KKmnkSqjv/) and that cost him points he 'deserved'. That claim provoked a response from [Lotus](https://twitter.com/AlanPermane/status/603518447595737089) and then the response contained in the article linked to above from Grosjean (rightly asking what he would gain from doing it - the answer to which is nothing at all! *Especially* at Monaco where tiny mistakes plant you in the wall).  In the same [article](http://verstappen.nl/?locatie=bericht id=2134 lang=en) quoted by you on Verstappen's **own** website, published two days after the instagram feed claim, Verstappen includes the line: *"After an unlucky pit stop, I was charging through the field, before I got brake tested and had a hard crash into turn 1."*  The only reason that this is still an issue is that Max keeps repeating the lunatic claim that he was brake tested - he doesn't accept that he made an error - which is very concerning.               Its far from unique in racing series the world over. It's not even unique in F1, Super Aguri were effectively Honda's B team and financed almost entirely by Honda in much the same way as TR until the recession hit. In fact the first three decades of the sport were built on a model where drivers and teams bought their cars from works outfits.  But the reality on the ground is RBR weren't allowed to have TR function as a B team in the way they wanted. They share information, but not designs, mapping, development or day-to-day engineering staff etcetera. They kept the team because the racing seats were worth more to them than the team itself.  RedBull might be very successful (est. value $7.2 billion), but the largest company in F1 are Mercedes-Benz at $22.5 billion, Fiat Chrysler (Ferrari) are worth $20.69 billion.   To put RedBull's value in perspective Hyundai are actually worth more at $8 billion.   The rationale for GP2 was having a feeder series that travelled with F1, provided a support show, got the drivers used to being part of the 'circus', and allowed the teams to meet and use them as test or Friday practice drivers at no extra expense.  It solved a lot of problems, and has hugely increased the quality of the drivers, but it's not the same as driving an F1 car.      http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37tpl7/kehm_explains_schumacher_media_strategy/   Personally I've never had a problem with customer cars - it worked just fine in the 60s and 70s, provided an entry point for a lot of great drivers, and made for interesting racing at the back of the grid.   I suspect the latter. But that's about as much context as you'll get from twitter.   The 'B' teams, by regulation, are independent - look at TR.   As I've said elsewhere don't discount Mercedes, they're aggressively pursuing a young driver programme and need B team seats to put them in.               In fact it's a marketing platform for supercar and sports car manufacturers, everyone else makes up the numbers.    Participation should be justifiable based on the state of the sport in and of itself  But that has never ever been the case. F1 is a marketing platform and it has never been anything else at any point in its history.     Why does it need to be fixed?  Why does F1 need small teams that are unable to compete on track or be successful enough in the sport to gain investors and stay afloat?  We need teams like HAAS that are prepared to take a patient approach to entry and have a strong underlying business that can benefit from the team's participation whilst supporting the team financially.  All of the successful outfits in the sport have a strong underlying business, all of the teams struggling to stay in don't. There is a reason for that.  137 constructors have participated in the sport since 1950, the average team competes in 20 races for 3 seasons with 5 drivers, wins 0 races, and scores 0 points.   2004ish - they were sharing data with Toyota (who were banned from the WRC for a similar cheating scandal).            http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37miit/beautiful_1990_williamsrenault_f1_car_offered_at/   http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37onbu/door_open_for_indian_gp_return_as_ecclestone/   Yes. They're also the only team who have previously been involved in a wind tunnel data-sharing scandal.   Interesting that so much of the recent FIA clampdowns seems to have Ferrari at the centre of them. Wonder if someone is complaining or if someone suspects there is more to their recent return to form.   I don't disagree. Though Kvyat seems to have found his form and might be up to the challenge - he put in a great drive last weekend at one of the most difficult circuits.   RBR only hung on to Verstappen in 2014 by promoting him to TR. Mercedes are aggressively pursuing him again, it would seem, so this pushing him into the top might be how they keep him in the RBR family.         Ted K was saying, in several of his notebook pieces at Monaco, that Berger has suddenly shown up at recent races talking to a lot of people and hinting that he's 'up to something', I think it also came up in Brundle's grid walk.   Berger's a very popular figure and he'd be a great choice to lead a new team. I suspect this would lend credence to the idea of a McLaren Honda ART GP team moving into F1 as his history is with McLaren.   I did wonder when I posted, decided to play it safe!   Very little of what Bernie has done over the years justifies the idea that he's only in this for the money - he's the guy that does the big deals with serious people.  Whilst I don't disagree that it's time for a change, I don't think there is anyone with Bernie's clout or ability in a position to lead the sport, and anyone that has enough political talent to get in won't have the clout or experience to make real change happen.   I'd say there was some flexibility in that policy. Thanks for the interesting info, I thought he was much closer to the points he needed. In any case my overall point is that they're trying to build a young driver programme and need mid/back of the grid seats to put them in.   Basically. I believe you can stay within the rules and still buyout the whole car. Stoddart bought the 2002 Arrows package in the hope that it was better than what he had at the time, when that didn't turn out to be the case he sold it to SuperAguri who raced it in 2006.   If only...   I think they could manage it - theoretically you could sell the IP on an old Merc chassis to another company for change and start there - it's been done before. Wouldn't be easy but you wouldn't need to be competitive in the early phases.   The fifth engine business would allow the extra engine for Friday practice only, but the deal they were seeking on it's wider use would have seen the engine supplier rules relaxed going forward.   (obv. this is all gossip and supposition)   The rules relaxation in return for 'something' deal has come up a number of times in separate fights and was on the table during the token fight at the end of last season. Mercedes seem very keen on it, and I can't see who they would have as a customer that they don't have already, so perhaps they're thinking of the future.  Merc paid for Force India's testing so Pascal Wehrlein would be in a position to meet the new superlicence regulations, they were trying to snag [Verstappen](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/09/mercedes-pushes-young-driver-programme-pascal-wehrlein-new-f1-reserve-driver/) and Ocon in 2014, and I can't see why they would do that without having seats to put them in (RBR kept VER by bumping him up to TR).   I've been wondering for a while if they might do a deal with Lotus (Grosjean is out of contract this year, Crashtor is obviously Crashtor) and move their young drivers there on the back of reduced price engines. That would be difficult if Renault are keen for a buyout (unless they take a stake instead and move slowly towards a works team).   Anyway - all of this together makes be think moves are afoot for a Mercedes B-team.   See my comment [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37mldq/breaking_news_fia_opens_new_selection_process_to/cro2ei6) - just replied to the same question.   Technically. But they appeared to be offering a deal over the fifth engine a few weeks ago that would see that requirement relaxed (Lauda mentioning they were happy to supply the whole grid etc). IMO Mercedes are keen on customer cars, keen to supply more engines, and not too happy with Bernie's leadership...   Also a Lotus buyout by Renault, [which seems likely](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/05/28/have-renault-already-bought-lotus/), would leave them room for manuvre in the existing rules, they also compete in DTM with ART GrandPrix.   I don't need to imagine, this was what F1 was like until the late 70s.   Medical cars didn't even appear until the mid-80s.   I wouldn't discount Mercedes, they have some talented youngsters struggling for seats and the money to start a team from scratch.  Renault seem to want a works team by 2017 and if they can't buy TR or Lotus perhaps this is a route they might use.  One of these might be the 'Berger' project Kravitz was hinting at over the Monaco weekend - hopefully something else entirely - could make for an interesting 2016!      http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37mldq/breaking_news_fia_opens_new_selection_process_to/            Sadly.            The stat is for tracks, not races.   Formula One moved around a lot more in Prost's day than the current era - we now have 10 year contracts for staging races - in the 80's it was much more random affair. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, 6 different American tracks, 3 different British tracks, Austria, Switzerland, even Portugal to name a few. There were also plenty of one off and non-championship races at a wide variety of locations.  Its equally true that teams would have as many as 6 drivers in a season, just look at the [teams and drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Formula_One_season#Drivers_and_constructors) in the 1980 season.  That's one of the reason's it's taken 22 years for this record to come close to being broken. Prost had a 13 year career with 199 race starts, Lewis has had an 8 year career to date with 154 starts.         I don't see it - the stewards would have noticed something like this - brake testing is a serious matter. Also what would Grosjean gain from doing it? There would be no guarantee of a finish for him and, as his contract is up this year, he needs the points.   Painfully true isn't it. Strongly suspect Jensen has been looking forward to measuring himself against the driver of the decade. Thus far Alonso isn't delivering the fight everyone expected!.   He was having front brake/balance issues at the start of the race, I did wonder if there was a remaining issue with the car when he hit the position board. Lewis does seem to have some issues hitting his marks in the Merc and I've thought more than once that it might be a setup issue.   Alonso fans too. There are some spectacular reach arounds going on in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/37c9g5/vettel_eclipses_alonsos_best_after_six_rounds_as/).   Don't underestimate the dodgy behavior that was going on in the 1994 season.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Formula_One_cheating_controversy   Data apparently shows Grosjean actually braked later than on the previous lap. In any case the stewards would have been down on the frenchmen like a ton of bricks if there was a shred of evidence. I also can't see what Grosjean would gain from doing it.  Quite surprised that Max repeated the allegation! Midfield handbags at the ready!  The data shows I actually braked five metres later than on the lap before. I was braking as late as I could with my tyres as they were.         Try these guys https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/how-money-predicts-success-in-formula-1/   Honda seem to have fixed their drivability problems, next up is power and reliability. Small gains each time out appear to be the order of the day.   That's simply cutting the facts to fit your argument.      Any NFL or NHL game is geoblocked in the areas around the stadium - they would like you to buy tickets, not watch at home.   Greece - as I've identified above simply didn't reform its economy. Spain and Ireland's problems stem from their respective property booms and they both had pretty well managed economies. Italy is just a mess politically and no one had their hands on the controls.  Arguably the Euro played a role in all, it helped in some places but not in others, and none would have survived without Eurozone bailouts. I'm afraid you can't lay all of these problems at the door of the EU and pretend removing the Euro from the equation would have solved their problems.            http://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/373zr7/photo_of_the_day/      You lost me in the first two lines of your Greece argument - the real problem wasn't the Euro, the problem was that they had 20 years to reform their economy and labour practices and failed to even start doing it until it was far too late.   Tax avoidance was a national pastime, their public sector was massively bloated and people routinely held jobs but did little or no work.  Closed professions were also a serious problem which caused massive price inflation compared to the rest of Europe. Truckers, pharmacists and those wishing to join 68 other professions had to buy one of a limited number of [licences](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/world/europe/15greece.html?_r=0) costing 500,000 euro or more.   The truck licences alone made goods ludicrously expensive to transport and that was a drag on everything from manufacturing to general retail.   TBH I'm not hugely enthused by the whole field.  Burnham will always be painted as too close to the Unions, Cooper, also close to the Unions, is inextricably linked to Balls and that will always be used as a mighty weapon against her - both will quickly be painted with the failings of the Blair and Brown cabinets they both bore collective responsibility in.   I haven't enjoyed Kendall's stridency thus far, and am a *little* more swayed by Creagh. I do think it would be valuable to have a female leader and someone who represents a Northern constituency with irish roots would do very nicely in terms of drawing a contrast against Cameron and Osborne. She can speak to a geographic area in which we have start performing well from experience, and speak with authority on the EU. Reading a little of what she's written in the press it appears she 'gets' Scotland.  I like her position on business, she's good in the Commons and lands punches well, her background means she would be taken seriously on the EU and its is difficult to assail her with the usual 'metropolitan-elite' attacks despite her Oxbridge education.         I'm assuming from the uninformed nature of your comment that you didn't actually read the article, or the version of it written by every other F1 news site.   As Button said after quali: "Coulda, woulda, shoulda". Its very easy to be wise and armchair quarterback after the event. That they considered what might happen if Ferrari pitted is wise, its unlikely that it was the most persuasive factor in their decision in the end.  Drivers don't "complain all the time" drivers tell the team what's happening from their perspective, with the limited amount of information they have, and send messages to the stewards and race control via the only means of communication they have available to them.  With so little time to make a decision it's easy to make a mistake. Brave of Hamilton to maintain composure and say the right things despite what was obviously a devastating loss after a long weekend of very hard work and brilliant driving.  Looking at the threads after the event people are seizing on insignificant things like the team photo and the position bollard and using them to make completely uninformed criticisms. Hamilton put out an amazing quali finding 3 extra tenths over Rosberg twice, then pulled out a 20 second lead over Rosberg during the race at F1's most difficult circuit. Simply amazing stuff.   The team have the final say and they have access to information that the driver does not - ergo its the fault of the team, not the driver.   More than likely the terrain prevents it working effectively.    I don't see how you can claim that it's a widely held view that Hamilton was suddenly and unexpectedly told to pit or that he was at fault. His part in the decision was noted in the race commentary, in his comments after the race, and virtually every article on the topic written since.   Discussing if it's sensible to pit isn't the same as requesting to pit and many people in this sub are using this as an avenue to criticise Hamilton (who drove an imperious weekend) - especially the Rosbergerttes.  [James Allen's analysis](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2015/05/talking-point-how-will-mercedes-make-it-up-to-hamilton-for-lost-monaco-victory/) (emphasis mine) below. Interesting because it includes the timings (20 secs to make the decision), introduces Nasr's stop as a factor, and explains the parameters of the decision from the team's perspective.   Also of note is that Toto revealed last night that the [teams don't have GPS at Monaco](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) which would have affected their decision making ability.  Hamilton was part of the decision making process, as he confirmed after the race, telling the team that the soft tyres were losing temperature and pressure behind the safety car and *if there was sufficient gap to easily pit and rejoin on new, warm supersofts for the final 12 laps, it would make sense.* The team was protecting itself from a possible move by Ferrari to pit Vettel onto supersofts and then have him attack them at the restart, when he would have been right behind on faster tyres.  The top line is that there was a transition from Virtual Safety Car to Safety car; at the end of Sector 1 of the lap on which he pitted, Hamilton had a lead over Rosberg of 26.802 seconds, more than enough to pit with a comfortable margin. A pit stop at racing speeds takes 24 seconds at Monaco and at Safety Car speeds you only need a gap of around 17s to make the stop and retain position.  *What happened was that Hamiltons Sector 2 time was slower than he or the team expected; he took 53.240 secs to complete that sector, while Rosberg took just 44.5 secs. The gap came down from 26 seconds to just 18.*  Hamilton lost time behind the Safety Car, in other words, when it picked him up. He then lost another 1.5secs in the pit lane, thats how much slower his stop was than his first stop (which had been the fastest of the day). Nasr went past in the Sauber just as he was due to be released, which added a little to the end of the stop.  As soon as it happened, everyone realised that the move had been a mistake, but as Toto Wolff says, the calculations didnt keep up with the eventualities. Alarm bells should have gone off when Hamilton came through the Sector 2 beam and the gap had been reduced to 18 seconds  this made it a risky move to pit Hamilton. There was little time to think; Sector 3 takes 28 secs to complete across the finish line at Safety Car speeds and so they would have up to 20 seconds before he would need to enter the pits.  As for his reaction many people seem to have forgotten he lost the 2007 WDC on a team call to stay out a lap longer than he should have on tyres that were down to the canvas. I doubt the similarities of the two situations will have been lost on him.   You say potato etc.   Money is unlikely to be a major issue for anyone in this particular situation whatever anyone needs they will get, and it isn't necessarily up to RBR depending on the contract terms he has already - Jos is a canny man.  Williams admitted two races ago that Lotus were faster than they were in a post race radio call, both teams are currently outpacing RedBull handily, both have better engines and better development tracks.  Generally speaking for GP drivers the more promotional work the worse off they are, and it's something that the older they get the less work is in their contracts.   Either team would represent a move up the grid from TR.   Fair point, but the SNP aren't a single issue party.   Button's comments on the same situation last year:  But is Lewis strong enough to come back? I really think he is. You will see a more determined Lewis at the next race. Canada is a circuit he loves.  I remember with Lewis that when we had a tussle in a race or there was an issue between us or with the team, he would have a really bad race and be quite outspoken and emotional. **And the next race he would destroy me, he would come back stronger than ever**.  The mind games people play on him will not work.  Initially, he is an emotional character and he will be quite hurt but he comes back stronger than ever.  Monaco is a really special race for Hamilton, especially as he's had such poor luck there. But he's a lot tougher than he used to be and Rosberg is the one that chokes under pressure.   Toto issued an [explanation](http://adamcooperf1.com/2015/05/24/toto-wolff-we-got-the-maths-wrong/) - interestingly they have no GPS at Monaco so their calculation was a few seconds off. 3.5 seconds off to be exact!  The simple answer is we got the maths wrong, said Toto Wolff. We thought we had a gap which we didnt have when the safety car came out, and Lewis was behind the safety car and the calculation was simply wrong.  It was the teams decision. We are all in this together, we make decisions together and it is not one person to blame and we win and lose together and that is clear. In Monaco you have no GPS and this makes the whole exercise more difficult, so this is why we got it wrong when we switched from the virtual safety car to the safety car.   Hamilton built a 20 second gap over Rosberg at Monaco - *Monaco* - that really says everything you need to know about the pair.  Basically Rosberg wins when something goes wrong for Hamilton.   Anyone with any sense wants Max, but only RBR have the race seat. Merc's options would have to be paying Lotus or Williams to take him on in order to steal him away from RedBull.   I suppose both of those things are possible in 2017 (Massa's contract ends) or if Lotus tire of Crashtor. In fairness someone somewhere must be having a conversation about Grosjean's future as his contract is up this year, so perhaps both Lotus seats might be available in 2016.   Real problem for Farage is that actually having a referendum removes the rationale for UKIP's existence for voters, especially in the EU elections. Whichever way the country voted in a referendum UKIP would be spent as a political force.    When you look at their longstanding platform and voter base they pretty much did. One would have to say hubris driven by their best ever election performance.   Vince cable described what they got during the coalition as "crumbs from the Tory table". The membership of the party could have overridden Clegg at conference on several occasions both on the Coalition deal and on policy. So what I take from this is that, rather than stand up and vote for what they believe in, both the politicians and the party faithful were willing to compromise any position they held in return for those 'crumbs'.      I don't think the team need Hamilton yelling at them to know how badly they screwed up. The look on Toto's face said everything.   They don't need to rule it out - there is no army to send, or budget to pay for it.   Basically the article is an opinion piece based on the beliefs of a recently departed staff member and there is no evidence to back it up, it doesn't even mention her position or salary, merely her judgements on others working status.   The rest is a mish-mash of claims about a group of companies that mostly consists of non-profit NGO's specialising in project design and aid-delivery who maintain staff in the regions where aid is delivered and actually have a pretty good reputation in the aid sector. The 52,000 in the headline is based on the alleged average salaries of the staff at some of the companies, but is completely unsourced.  The remainder is a rehash of claims made by the DT in 2012 along with some sexy sounding, but obviously biased words like 'fat-cat' and 'barron'.                      I don't see a road back for them at this point. What's the rationale for a LibDem vote after the Coalition? Voters know they will compromise every principle they have.      The giant global recession that began in 2008. Economic growth has not returned strongly enough so companies need to keep cash on hand incase of another downturn or other economic 'weather'. Households are doing the same i.e. they have less money to spend on the sponsored products.  Equally true that many western countries have hit market saturation for many products and the law of diminishing returns applies - one of the many reasons F1 is going to new countries and new markets in order to tempt sponsors along.  Sponsors won't really come back until the economic climate improves.         To be completely honest I'm a little bit happy about being shorn of the 'Scottish Mafia' - a group that has held sway over policy and strategy since the dawn of the Blair era - perhaps this will help the party to new thinking.   I don't think they would want to be seen as interfering in the political process - now everyone knows this is happening people will demand the publication of the report in full, and its unlikely to be favorable to the eurosceptic position.   True. But public perception is everything.   Balls has never been popular, he was about the past not the future as far as most are concerned because he was so closely hitched to Brown's train.   It was a dreadful mistake to allow him to camp in the shadow chancellor's seat for five years - there was no greater signal to the public that our economic position had not changed and we had failed to learn the lessons of the past.   I'm curious now. I thought the same but given how [busy the airports](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-people-are-travelling-home-from-all-over-the-world-so-they-can-vote-to-legalise-gay-marriage-10268990.html) turned out to be with people returning home to vote that might be enough to change the result.   Each constituency party is entitled to nominate a candidate for the position of Mayor of London.   Candidates receiving more than 5 nominations from constituencies will go forward to a shortlisting panel which will decide which ones will be put before all members and supporters in a postal ballot to be held in August.   **It's important that you attend your local party meetings to take part in this process** Meetings to decide on the CLP nomination will take place very soon, all Labour Party members and registered supporters are entitled to take part in this process.  Candidates so far:-  - Diane Abbott - Tessa Jowell - Keran Kerai - Sadiq Khan - David Lammy - Neeraj Patil - Gareth Thomas - Christian Woolmar                               We have not resigned our seat, but we have no genuine influence within the Security Council. Thanks in large part to our appalling behavior in going into Iraq with Bush, the joke that was our military performance whilst in Iraq and Afghanistan, our absent Navy and outdated airforce. We have nothing serious to offer anyone - as our laughable part the Libya operation proved.  The City of London has been on fire since the recession, little has been done to combat the cultural problems that led to 2008 and it's the banks that have the power, not the treasury. Just look at HSBC's startling intervention in the election campaign - it feared a backlash from no one. An EU exit will lead to the serious players leaving en-masse. Preparations for such an exit are well underway at a number of companies I work with.  We sold Oxford, Cambridge and Sandhurst to the children of dictators and international students when we ceased properly funding higher education. Every university is entirely reliant on private funding and income obtained outside government to stay alive.  We are almost exclusively reliant on private finance, charity, visitor centre income or EU funding to preserve our world heritage and nationally important sites. I had a conversation with English Heritage last year seeking emergency help with a literally collapsing 400 year old listed monument - no money, unlikely to be any money for a decade, I was advised to apply to the EU or the lottery 'thats all we do'.  We remain culturally influential but we're not taken seriously in any office outside Downing Street. The idea of the special relationship is a thin and distant memory because it relied on our ability to influence Europe and military support.   And the team.   But a point most people have missed over the last few years is that RBR were winning with an underpowered car and relying on aero in the corners for speed - so there is more than one valid approach. Many of the problem RBR are seeing this year are issues that they've had plenty of time to resolve, they just didn't consider them big enough issues in the past.   The realities of design, testing, and manufacture. The tyre compounds are designed a year in advance, more even. While the tyre companies can tweak during a season they can't fundamentally alter their approach - we've seen the same thing with engines over the last two seasons.  In essence whomever gets the approach right at the start of the season will win, anyone else is screwed.  	197
 I feel less alone now.    Anywhere there's not updated youth, I guess.   So I've been living in a cave....is this slang now?    That's what I was thinking. Origin and the state of Origin was quite the give away. And the griefing being allowed.    I don't quite know what flavor, but it tasted great!   He wouldn't eat it, so I put it on his head. He was fabulous~~      You sir, are my favorite asshole.    I would actually find your gayness a turn on. I always feel I'll end up alone because I tend to have more of a thing for gay men. There's just something about them.    I'm that way as well. I always want to know more about what frightens me. No problem. Answers are always fun to give when I have them.    I like to believe Bloody Mary can only be summoned. I'm a child when it comes to summoning less than pleasant things, so I prefer to believe they only go where they are wanted.    I don't think so. Charlotte seems like she would only visit those who want her presence.    My bathroom has a mirror on every wall. Showers are always terrifying. We have those glass/mirror sliding doors. Perfect scene for some demon to pop out and kill you in the middle of your repeat of shampoo.    I thought the same thing! I was highly infuriated.   I enjoy using Unrelenting Force in the library at the College. Watching the books fly at that orc...it feels good.    The Crimson Nirn quest. I discovered it on my third character. I haven't started it yet, but it's found by going into a ruin, and then a building in that ruin, then picking up some red nirn. So pretty easy to over look.    If you're having trouble finding where the glass chaos starts, /tp 0 64 0   Spock is definitely my ladyboner. He's just so...Vulcan. It's lovely.     I have never held much love for Rodimus/Hot Rod. He was okay in the movie at first. But then I started to be unable to stand him. He just really seemed to be a forced character. He couldn't be Optimus-he was far too inexperienced and didn't deserve leadership. He also acted far too much on direct emotion, in turn, getting Optimus killed.    Radioactive -Imagine Dragons   Thanks-I didn't know what it was called or what it was other than some plant. Good to know its not poisonous.             The one thing that I'm really not linking about this map is the huge ice oceans and the mountains. That's about it-everything else is pretty grand.    Omai. This is worse than Voldemort and Crookshanks (Hermione's cat).   I actually came across a few cows wandering around the base. I was able to repopulate. If you need a cow, we could work on a price in PM.    I am only in need of one cow. I have a little bit of every ore along with stacks of melon and meat. I have carrots and potatoes too. State your price in a PM, and we can negotiate. I shall only trade with trustworthy players, who will not turn this transaction into a scam. I am mostly a farmer, and a non-PVPer unless in defense.   EDIT: I have found cows. A gift from Notch.   And the cows are gone as well. I have some stuff in a hidden room to get the farm going again, along with tools. I'm usually pretty paranoid about griefing and prepare for the worst.    And a lovely one, too.     ...did you make it?    This...why is this link purple....   The problem is, this comment is actually relevant.    I only allow myself to go down to 100 when I'm on reddit. If I have tabs open, I have to attend to those. Then get something done. Then keep redditing.     I really wish I hadn't emptied my base of all of my valuables. The minimap even had all of my old markers.   SEALAND! In the top five of my favorite countries. I actually screamed when I saw this post.   So an actual question, do you plan on maybe expanding the country?   It should be known that freerice only works if adblock is off as the ads pay for the rice.    I have stayed up until inhuman hours searching for a way to get shaders going (accidentally updated before I had all the files for mods) and you just saved me from insanity. If only every comment on a forum was this helpful.    Only self posts don't get karma.   Did I miss part of this April Fools joke? Nothing is happening to me.    I've seen nobles on horses armed by an Imperial guard or two a few times. But never more than that. 6-8 would definitely be interesting.   The iron helmet was my favorite for the longest time, but after a while ebony ones started popping up and I decided it was time to up my armor a bit.    I wish I'd gotten this advice. I'm far too attached to my first character, and regretting dumb things I did in the beginning of the game, and realizing I screwed up too late. Like selling things I shouldn't have sold for a little bit of coin. At least I didn't obliviously toss away Dragon Priest masks!   You are required to wear the wooden mask to access the shrine, although there may be a bug/glitch to get past that.    CUDDLY FRIENDS??? *hug* My friends are rather anti-touching (unfortunately) so my frequent hugging and petting and such doesn't bode well. The last time I got a new friend was at a convention, so I guess minimal social advice from me. But you're not alone on this~   Back in my day, food was *solid*.    Seinfeld. Get with it.    If it's rave-like music that has people just moving around, bounce slightly up and down while waving an arm or three in the air. Works every time. Slower songs, if you have a partner and you're both clueless, just rock sideways in a circle (as most teens won't waltz).   I would travel for free. And all the expensive food I want.    I'm not sure if you mean you found some covers or you're still a bit lost. I'll go with the latter. If I were to go out and buy Miku's voice (since she is simply software), and make her sing a Lonely Island song, it would be considered a 'real' Miku song as she did sing it.    I just read an article about this on Cracked. I LEARNED SOMETHING BEFORE IT WAS ON REDDIT. Just like Chef Ramsey actually saves very few restaurants.    I've used "I like my women like I like my glasses-sitting on my face!" It's quite effective. (Though before I may or may not be downvoted into oblivion, I take no credit for thinking of it)   I started shouting at him until I realized he wasn't trying to annihilate me.    This may just be the best thread I have seen in months. But I should probably contribute something.   "'Erecto!' she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen, which in one fluid motion rose into the air"    "Fucking shit not now I'm at school." Sixth grade. Right before social studies I had to buy one of those cardboard applicator tampons. I take pride that my first tampon was successful.   I'd be pretty content-less griefing!   Thank you! When I logged back on today, the server was back in order, so you must have done some magic. Yesterday was absolute chaos. Now hopefully we can go back to being peaceful with each other~   I'm not sure that means there is a lot of PVP, but I was attacked from behind by a slime. My health was low after the trip to Unity.    Hi! I died in Unity recently, and hadn't made a bed yet, so I'm back to square one and I'm afraid my stuff will have despawned by the time I make it halfway to Unity. If you come across a large pile (full inventory) of stings including an enchanting table, a couple brewing stands, some diamond, and a bunch of watermelon, it is probably mine (if there is a stack of beef in it, it is definitely mine). If you are willing to return some of the stuff to me, that's great! As a reward, well, I'm willing to negotiate. Probably most of the diamonds as I don't find too much use for them. And a brewing stand or two if you want.    What numbers are for saplings? That would be great for changing the saplings or just removing them.   [First and only.](http://i.imgur.com/kyiKUSB.png)   Wow. This accurately depicts my ex-friend [left] versus me [right] when it comes to gaming. Her xbox voice makes my ears bleed.

[Here goes.](http://i.imgur.com/9avYKWS.jpg)   Thanks!     I'm not out, so if I tell him I just don't want it to get around school then to my parents. I really don't care about school-it's the pretty anti-gay family I'm worried about.   This guy has randomly started talking to me on facebook. I already knew him at school, but we weren't close. I'm pretty sure he likes me. Even planned a date (we're to watch Big Bang Theory and Star Trek). He's really nice and funny, and we have similar interests, but it wouldn't work out. I like someone else. Not only that, but I don't think I can tell him that I don't necessarily like guys. So I guess I just need some help telling him no without hurting him-I don't want to be known as 'that bitch that friendzones everybody'.   That will be quite the challenge for me....meats and cheeses are my favorite foods!   I must ask...how do all of you girls get to these fruity flavors?!?   Transformers    Is this some type of Elfen Lied reference?   I saw it was down....and held a mental funeral.   Thanks!   I tried the non-whitelisted server, and it was great!

Painkillers and sleep? Coming up!    School spirit for a week with a big dance and football game at the end. It's mostly celebrating the athletes.   I always walked around doing a raptor impression (got friends to laugh...don't care how stupid I looked) then I got here and saw raptors. My brain made a tiny boom noise...I was pleased yet clueless.   As a freshman, it is my policy to walk against the walls and around other people.   Alas, Myspace has seen its time. I think it should retire and look back on its golden years.   We have semester finals Friday. Then Monday and Tuesday. Goodbye, borderline good grades! And I'm one of the nerds...         *Slow clap*. You did not shit yourself. You shit *yourself*.    Take all of my feels. Just take them.   After being home sick all day, I have now laughed so hard I almost peed. Thank you.   ######Ichigo supposedly being part Quincy.

 All shampoo does is make your hair greasy if you don't use shampoo. I once stopped using it for 9 months while travelling, my hair has never been lovelier! Humans simply don't need it, but once you start using it, you have to continue!    Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not some farcical aquatic ceremony!   Quite a story, thanks for sharing! Do you know who the guy with the dog was in the film?      I hope this doesn't get to the front page as it is such an horrendously out of context quotation.   Call me a square but I would hate to work there!    Aaah, tastes like feudalism!    [How the fuck do these people leave the house??](http://imgur.com/uDQ8er3.jpg)      I find that one of the many wonders of nature is just how stupid some people are.   Wait, the charge of the light brigade was a historical event? I always thought it was a poetic allegory, or Tennyson was using a fictitious event as a moral exemplar for pre-great war british children, not a documentable historical fact.  Also, I hate to be the one to point this out, but if this were an authentic battlefield there would be a lot more debris than just a few cannonballs. Not saying this isn't genuine, just it might be fair to assume this was either a very selective and pre-organised photograph, or it was taken some considerable time after the event.   "*Who the fuck is Oscar Wilde??*" - Shakespeare    No no no, I believe Noam Chomsky said that, not Oscar Wilde!     That wasn't in italics, I don't think its a real quote! Although it does rhyme.   Pig's knickers. This sounds like the sort of legend that springs up around legendary individuals   "*Quiet King_Llama, nobody likes you!*" - Oscar Wilde   Oscar Wilde only wrote one novel....  This leads me to believe this quote may be spurious. He wrote mostly plays and short stories, but only one full-length novel, '*The Picture of Dorian Grey*'   Sunshine - John Murphy   I had not heard about that, do you have a sauce? It's not mentioned in the article, which makes it seem like this group (called '*Hefazat-e Islam*') are simply demonstrating for much stricter Islamic rule in Bangladesh.         Holy balls, I'm from Sheringham! Do I know you without knowing I know you...?   I'm not attacking anyone, friend. I wasn't expecting 100% approval, obviously. I will stand up for myself when insulted however, or challenge someone with counter views to mine in a reasonable discussion, for the sake of expanding my own learning if nothing else.   So you take particular exception with my collection simply for my small set of atheist literature? Ergo you dismiss the works of Dickens, Austin, Marquez, Orwell etc. as unworthy of you, because they appear on the same shelf as Harris   Dawkins?  I realise you are trolling me, I would just like everyone else in the thread to realise that.   Seeing as there are almost 50 individual books here: some novels, some factual, some poetry collections, some academic works etc., it is a little blas of you to discredit them all *en masse* as porn. Do any specifically jump out at you as unworthy? Would you care to venture a suggestion of more highbrow works?    What exactly is your problem with my bookshelf, specifically? Is it that you don't like people reading books you feel are beneath you? Sir, intellectual elitism is possibly the most pompous trait a man might possess, and though you may feel superior looking at my modest bookshelf, keep it to yourself. I'm sure you read much more important and thought provoking literature, but does that mean that no one else should pursue their own tastes in literature, different to yours?

You think "*the government*" is really likely to want to come after you, or nuke you or shoot you? You really aren't that important. And "*the government*" are unlikely to attack their own people.   You seem to imply that it was better when militia's of angry men could do what they like.

What do you imagine, that your government will become corrupt and overnight become a dictatorship and you will someone be able to sort it all out because you have a gun? Don't be ridiculous, stop listening to paranoid rednecks.  The US Government is one of the most corrupt in existence, congressmen and lawmakers are payed small fortunes by companies and corporations to pass laws that suit industry rather than the individual, and the entire government is figureheaded by one man with infallible power. So, what you are you waiting for?   Sunshine. Mainly [because of the insanely powerful music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBP853AzraU)   Shine On You Crazy Diamond. You barely even need the drugs!   Mommies kisses. And if that doesn't work heroin.    I just graduated with a degree in Music. On my first day of Uni, first lecture, my professor did a full out performance of John Cage's '*4:33*'. It might not have have been inappropriate, but it was the most awkward 4 minutes of my academic career   Er, no. No it doesn't. Silly person.   The principal behind this is called exponential growth; every generation you go back your number of direct ancestors doubles, so you have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great-grandparents, 16 great-great-grandparents etc. By the time you go back just 10 generations you already have over 1000 direct descendants! Extrapolate this over such a large time period as 1000 years and the number of  direct descendants you have will be so huge that it will be far more than there have ever been human beings.  There is a story in China that uses the same principal. A peasant puts a single grain of rice on a square of a chessboard and asks the emperor to give him two grains of rice on the next square and to keep doubling it across the board. The emperor agrees and by the time the peasant has made it to the last square he owns all the rice China has ever or will ever produce.  The family tree scenario works because after only a few generations your family tree will become so convoluted that it is inevitable that it will cross over many many times, so the same person will appear multiple times on your list.   Mindlessly quoting Bible verses instead of thinking for yourself! We have officially plumbed the depths of whit and intellect! What a privilege!    I'm going to take a guess that you sought advice on circumcision from someone involved in the clergy? I'm sorry to disagree with you but it has been proven by the medical profession that circumcision does not hold any benefit, think about it logically. If it were beneficial for men not to have foreskin, we simply wouldn't be born with it. Evolutionary economy is ruthless, everything evolved on a human body either serves or has served a purpose, surely that is obvious. Also the idea of preventing infection is utterly ridiculous, how many foreskin infections have you heard of? Teach you son to be hygienic, don't mutilate his body. As for sexual pleasure, use your common sense please. It desensitises the penis, that is pretty much the whole point.  As to Mosaic law: Surely the obvious contradiction is why would one God set down the laws for man to follow in one book of The Bible only for the other God to disagree with the laws and use his own for the second book of The Bible. This is meant to be the infallible word of God remember, if you are a Christian.   The idea that forcing such an irreversible act upon a unknowing child makes me nauseous. Why wouldn't you respect your son enough to wait until he is old enough to make such a unalterable choice for himself, in full view of the facts? Why is it normal to do this to children?  I say it again, circumcision has no physical benefit. If it did, we would not be born with foreskin in the first place. Use your brain.   I happen to know a great deal about Christianity. The only old testament law Jesus definitively refuted was was that man could work on the sabbath, which remember was one of Gods ten infallible commandments, which of course negates the whole list of ten. The concept of having the Old Testament of laws followed by a the New Testament which negates those laws is utterly absurd, surely anyone can see that? If you are a Christian The Bible is meant to be the infallible word of God, why would one God disagree so much with the other (and himself) and what laws men should follow?    Nowhere did I mention Africa, nor anything related to race or any specific culture. Yet you assign these labels yourself. I shall not go so far as to accuse you of racism in return, but you seem to be more guilty of that you might realise.  Again you use the euphemism of *tradition*. Again, I point out that this is misleading, as a more accurate description might be *religious* tradition. I will of course admit that not all traditions are the same, but the uniting factor is that the *purpose* of genital mutilation of young girls is to stunt and repress sexual pleasure. This is barbarism. Do not protect such cruelty by claiming it as tradition. Do not patronise the thousands of miserable souls tortured by it. Do not be so cold and uncaring as to imply that such a vile thing should be sustained for the sake of *tradition*. To do so is moral equivalent of sacrificing these wretched girls on a stone alter.  Sources: Much of my specific information on this comes from various essays and books by Christopher Hitchens, as well as my own research in various journals (I volunteer with Unicef). For example, the use of the sharp stone, or the twine to be broken by male force upon marriage is part of the 'tradition', not me adding colour to the argument. I will not be so simple as to link the first article a google search will give me.   Personal strength.   Many people here are saying tradition which is somewhat misleading. The honest reason is *religious* tradition, rather than cultural. It is a commandment that all jewish boys must be circumcised on a specific day soon after birth. The man performing the circumsision is called a '*Mohel*' in Jewish tradition and to complete the process he cuts around the forskin, places his mouth on the severed penis and sucks off the foreskin before spitting it out with a mouthful of blood and spit.   Remember that the Old Testament of the Bible is the Jewish Torah, so in theory any Christian has to follow every law that orthodox Jews do. Many modern American Christian continue the practice for this reason.  Circumcision has been roundly proven to not improve hygiene in the male and lessens sexual pleasure (as is presumably the whole point). It does not serve any medical purpose.  Apologies if this seems profanatory, I have been as to the point as I can   I feel slightly sick that this got so many upvotes. Female genital mutilation is a very real thing and affects millions of women world wide. It is a disgusting and inhuman practice in which the clitorus is cut off, often with a sharp stone and the vaginal opening is sawn up with twine, not to be broken until the dreaded marital night by male force. The reason and justification for this practice sits squarely at the feet of organised religion, I am not an fire and brimstone r/athiest but blame where blame is due.

  I trust the immune system I was born with.  Most of the dead children in this world were born with that same immune system, but they still got a now-preventable disease and still died.   Yeah, but the one big one is a *doozy*.     From a completely practical standpoint, there are not many reasons to own a physical media collection.  Nobody can delete or alter your DVDs and printed books without your consent.   I'd rather spill oil or extract or milk on a cookbook than on an ipad.                                                         Mostly because I think it has a lot of good lines, and also it doesn't make me cringe in embarrassment the way some of the other light-hearted ones do. DS9 doesn't do light-hearted very well.   Yup. And he didn't have to do it. He could've said "Hey, listen, since Kira will die if she goes to the past, and she's not strictly necessary for this colony to exist, why doesn't she stay here with all the tech you're not bringing with you?"   Except it doesn't make much sense. Since Kira dies without descendents, it's not necessary for her to go back in time. They'd already offloaded all their junk that hadn't survived the original accident (but that the colony might need), so why not offload Kira as well?    Well, he kept winning the Alamo.   And it worked! Q never came back! I bet Picard wishes now he'd thought of *that* little maneuver.   Which is admittedly the best of the silly non-Ferengi episodes.   Nah, Harry's death was worse, because it didn't stick.      Is it?                               You'd be amazed how often you have to explain what most means.   Now that you've been exposed to "on accident" you'll probably hear it everywhere. That's what happened to me the first time I found out about "If you *would have* done this and that" where I would say "If you *had* done" and so on.   Wasn't he hiking the Appalachian Trail?   Thanks, will delete.   Here I am in NYC, where I've lived nearly my whole life, and I hear it frequently from the younger crowd, and back when I was the younger crowd (early 30s here) I heard it occasionally from people my age and younger.  But of course, when I say that it's heavily weighted towards the younger end of the population, I don't mean "all kids and teens say this", just "it's much more common with kids and teens and young adults than it is with older adults". Like if I say "most new yorkers don't have a car" and you *do* have a car (well, you don't, because you can't drive until you're 18 in the city, but you know what I mean) you're not doing it wrong, you're just in the minority.            Sure - and other subs function very well where they aren't.   I do, actually. That's just how I roll.   But comments have two options, an upvote option and a downvote option. Arbitrarily asking us to ignore one of those options is ridiculous.   Of course there is. On accident is heavily weighted towards the younger end of the population. Older folks more usually say *by* accident.  Associated with younger people = ignorant and stupid.                                                                                                                                                Finally watched it.  Liv, tell him *again*. You already did it once, and sure, you were hallucinating, but you based your hallucination on a real person.

The closed captioning had her saying "That's me", but I guess that line was cut.   Okay, well, as we don't know when your friend was in the 6th grade that's not very helpful. What year was this?   God, it's gotten to the point where I can no longer distinguish between people saying that sarcastically and people saying it sincerely.   Definitely, the Pit Dragon Trilogy. (There is technically a fourth book. It is not worth the paper it's printed on. I re-read all three of the previous in preparation for book 4, but I don't believe Yolen bothered to do the same.)   It's a pretty good book.   That evil space station episode makes no sense. Who made it? Why did they make it? Why not use a more conventional power source? Why does nobody seriously ask these questions?   Hogfather, of course.   Yeah, they're called pigeons. Or sparrows, or crows.

I'm not 100% certain that I'd want to walk the mile from 59th to 34th in bad or cold or hot weather, just because it's technically in the same area. It's two train stops (edit: guesstimate), and my *guess* is that the train, with your ability to not get hit by a car, might be a bit safer for a blind person than the streets. (I'm just guessing, though.)                     We don't read the comments, that's how.   Climate change is a huge contributing factor to the Syrian civil war.

Well, Dukat certainly does.   I'm sorry for your loss.   This pair of statistics sounds shocking, but there's a possible explanation.   The population which got a second opinion comes from the 30% of Americans who don't feel confident in their doctor's advice and do see a need to gather additional information.   We don't know what the results would be if the 70% who trust their doctors got second opinions. It might be the same, or it might not.   (Thanks!)   Train stations have [blind people bumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving), so he's safe on the MTA! And it's only a short train trip to 34th street, where I know for a fact that the Loews has audio description. (I was there ten days ago for my niece's birthday. Thank *god*, she's old enough that we didn't have to sit through the movie with her. I claimed poverty and went to the bookstore instead.)   Wait - tuna fish is turning some people to stone? (Real world question, is this a comics thing?)    Also, wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your body (or the body of your SO, parent, or sibling) was free for anyone to do anything with after they die?  No, I wouldn't. They're not there. They're dead. Their body is just so much meat. To me, this is like asking "Wouldn't you be at least a little upset if you knew that your house (or your mom's house) was free for anyone to do anything with after you move?" Why should I care? I've moved! So you can repaint in colors I hate, or screw in what used to be the nursery, or tear the whole thing to the ground for all I care.  What's the alternative? Stick the body in the ground until the worms and maggots devour it? Leave it on top of the ground for the vultures to eat, a so-called "sky burial"? Or burn it to a crisp and then deal with the cremains? They aren't just ashes, there are bone fragments, and prior to burning any internal devices, such as pacemakers, have to be removed.  Nothing that happens to the body after death is pretty. Thankfully, we're no longer there to experience it. My body isn't who I am, it's just where I live.   In the Paralympics, yes, but blind fighters such as wrestlers can and do compete with sighted opponents.  http://blindsports.on.ca/sports/wrestling/  Some sports are easier to accommodate for visual impairments than others.   The Edge Chronicles. I don't know which book in that series it's from, but it's from that series.   Theaters nowadays do offer audio description on movies.   With Braille Playing Cards.  http://www.braillebookstore.com/Braille-Playing-Cards,-Plastic.1   She would have mentioned if she had friends? So would Ron, I imagine. Given that Harry was still meeting people in his own house or year as late as OotP, it's entirely possible she did mention friends and Harry just didn't notice and so we never got wind of it.  I'm sure she didn't have that many friends, because her social skills are really poor, but Harry is an amazingly blinkered individual when it comes to other people.   Do you remember the first book? Vernon's scared of *Petunia*. She's the one with the abiding hatred at that point. People have this fanon that Vernon's the driver in all this, but it's not backed up by facts.   Dumbledore doesn't really get people, though. I mean, this is the guy who thought it was appropriate to inform a woman of her sister's death via a baby and a *note*. I don't care if they *were* estranged, that's the sort of thing that merits a personal visit!     Have you noticed Hermione didn't seem to have any muggle friends before going to hogwarts?  Why, because she never mentions them? Does that mean Dean had no muggle friends? Neville and Seamus and Ron had had no friends of any sort?    No they are nice people, she goes skiing with them in Paris and things like that during the summer.  Skiing's not really her thing.  I have no idea what sort of people the Grangers might be, but I really dislike it when people assume that superficial things - like going on vacation with your child - mean that you're a good person or a good parent. Plenty of people who are subpar parents or actually abusive take those kids skiing and whatnot, for lots of them it's more important to *look* like a good parent to others than to *be* a good parent to their child.  (That doesn't mean that the fact they took her skiing makes them BAD parents. It means that the skiing and the vacations are no proof one way or another.)   Do they? We hardly even see them in the books... and to be honest, I have trouble thinking too highly of people who blithely send their daughter to live with a boy during vacations after she's been away at boarding school the entire year.  They could be nice people. They could be emotionally distant. They could be abusive. They could be giant stuffed cabbages for all we know.   I completely agree. I'll add to this the fact that, over the course of seven years, she spends less and less time each year with her family at home and more and more of her vacation time with the Weasleys. Hermione is not so subtly trying to distance herself from her roots, and it shows.   Never can tell what people know and don't.  And that's nothing. After *years* of carefully avoiding all mention of two girls, one cup I finally had to sit through two kids talking about it on the bus. Never in my life wanted so hard to reach over and smack somebody.   I asked why he wouldn't be good at touch typing, and you responded that he didn't have an incentive to learn. I think one of us misunderstood the other, and that's not a snide way of saying "you misunderstood me".   Results from the recent past can be a little more illuminating than results from the more distant past. Right now there has been little job growth outside of the service industry. That doesn't bode well for the "well, they make more jobs in the long run!" mindset.  And while I, too, look forward to our inevitable post-scarcity paradise (well, assuming we don't hit the equally inevitable climate-change fueled dystopian horrorland instead, and yes, I know what inevitable is supposed to mean :P), the years between now and then are gonna *suck* as we transition to new assumptions and ways of living.   That's a funny definition of "normal". By that definition, it's not normal to be against marriage equality, because you are most definitely in the minority.    There, there. Happens to the best of us.   Okay, this is not terribly likely, but maybe Zahrah the Windseeker?  If you have any other details, no matter how trivial, they can help.   A greater number of people report having had same-sex experiences than call themselves gay or bisexual.  Conclusion? Surveys that rely on self-reporting aren't as accurate as you might hope. We still don't know the real number, although we do know it's greater than .5%.   That's been the case before, but past results are no guarantee of future success.   Do you remember when you read it?   Straight people have anal sex too.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/06/anal-sex-heterosexual-couples-report_n_1190440.html  A sizable minority of straight men and women have engaged in anal sex. It really is normal human behavior.  You and I aren't alike. I don't have a prurient fascination with other people's sex lives. That really isn't normal human behavior.   More than 50% of the US population approves of marriage equality, and that number is rising.  https://xkcd.com/1431/  You're in the minority, I'm happy to say.   Do you even *know* any blind people? Because the blind people I know, even those older than Daredevil, use computers all the time. Heck, most of 'em I met *online*. (Most of my friends are people I know online, you know how it is.)  Blind people have just as much incentive to be independent as sighted people - especially those blind people who also happen to be *lone vigilantes*.            Why wouldn't he be good at touch typing? It's not a difficult skill to learn.      Can we please not juxtapose "gays" and things being "shoved down our throats"? It's just such an awkward combination and certain parties use it *all the time*. In the case of the homophobes, it's probably freudian somehow.   Whatever happened to not taking the bait?   Mmm. It's certainly true that less than 4% of the US population self-identifies as gay or bisexual in surveys.  However, that doesn't mean that less than 4% of the US population feels any same-sex attraction.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation  Dealing with self-reporting can give you odd results if people feel a pressure to identify as straight.    Oh, bless your heart, you are *so* oppressed, you poor thing!    There've been a lot of them on HGTV for well over a decade by now. My mother used to joke about it. If a couple came on that wasn't interracial she'd be "OMG! They're the SAME!"    (s)na(rt).   Gosh who doesn't?   I suppose that's part of the gay agenda too. "If you don't accept your children, they'll become SUPERVILLAINS."  Which would be much cooler than what frequently does happen to gay and trans kids whose parents can't accept them.   Some people do that, especially if they've been dating awhile before the engagement   1/7 of the US population is in an interracial marriage, and yet when that adorable Cheerios commercial came out, omg the idiotic outcry.   It didn't seem terribly forced to me. Replay it in your head. If he'd said his "girlfriend" or "wife" wanted him to eat healthy, you'd consider it a throwaway line and probably not even notice.   And it wasn't even a big thing. She asked, they answered, and it was *done*.     But damn, some people treat it as if any mention of sexism/racism/homophobia is this blatant attack on everything they know and love.  That's because deep inside, they liked it better when everything they knew and loved was bigoted as heck.  It's like the people who whine about "PC" and when you look at the specific thing they can't stand it's nothing more than *good manners*.   Oh, yeah.  http://www.evula.com/jokes/homosexual_agenda.html   Wait, did you really not know about that before?   A minor character mentions his fiance, what, three times and this is being "forced" on you?  Sounds to me like you're the one with an agenda.   Gotta love how these folks always think that having nothing but straight people (or nothing but non-interracial couples, or nothing but whites, or nothing but men, or whatever it is they're whining about *this* week) isn't pushing an agenda at all.   There was a bit of an outcry when Netflix released Daredevil without audio description - and Netflix *did* know this kind of thing exists, because people have been asking them for over a decade to include it on some of their programming.  As with closed captioning, some providers are required by law to produce a certain amount of programming every year with audio description. Netflix's argument was that they are not included in that law (that was the same argument they used about CC until they settled out of court), but after the media around Daredevil they have agreed to add audio description to some of their shows and movies, including Daredevil.  It costs between $2,000 and $8,000, IIRC, to provide audio description for one hour of scripted entertainment.   Blind people can use the internet. Why wouldn't they?   The Books of Umber, P. W. Catanese   And it's not weird if he isn't a zombie?   Ouch! Do you correct them when you hear them, or walk on by? I'm frequently bit by the pedantry bug, and just cannot resist the urge. (Which I'm aware makes me probably a jerk, but I can live with that.)   And you don't know the half of it. Needless to say, I was more than willing to never see him again.   Our mutual dislike was so great that when I had him again he pretty much immediately suggested I do self-study instead and report in to an entirely different teacher to boot!   Demons, spirits, afterlives, none of that have any bearing on whether or not there are deities.  If you define "gods" as "beings who can do things I cannot do", then by that definition Superman is a god. Heck, so is my *cat*. She can see in the dark. (Of course, she's terribly nearsighted, like all cats, but such is life.)  Perhaps you define it as "beings who can do things I can't do and also can't explain". My cat is off the pantheon, Superman is still on. I sure as heck can't explain how that dude can leap tall buildings in a single bound *without* leaving giant holes in the pavement every time he lifts off.  Merriam-Webster defines "god" as follows:  a being or object believed to have more than natural attributes and powers and to require human worship; specifically :  one controlling a particular aspect or part of reality   I suppose that does knock out Superman (finally), but it still leaves the field marvelously open with all sorts of beings that aren't conventionally considered deities of any sort.  Additionally, even if you acknowledge that deities exist, it doesn't follow that you acknowledge that you, personally, ought to worship them.    Audio description?   I can never unsee that.   I know the term, but I couldn't give you a precise definition. Caitlin's probably in that group. She has a vague idea, but she wanted more details.   The year I graduated high school was 2002. Had a jackass teacher who insisted on calling it 'Ground Hero'.                            I don't think so. It looks like price gouging is only illegal in NY during "an unreasonable disruption of the market". Being stuck on line waiting hours to get into the memorial probably doesn't count.  http://www.ag.ny.gov/price-gouging  Failing to list prices, now, that may be illegal. Don't know how to google for that. Hold on.  Edit: Yes, it looks like not showing prices is not legal.  http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dca/downloads/pdf/about/general_vendor_law_rules.pdf   I don't think people *do* have an intrinsic right, actually, to control what happens to their body once they're no longer using it.  And yes, I think you can do pretty much what is necessary to survive so long as you're not hurting anybody else. She isn't. Dead bodies aren't people. There's nothing left there to hurt.   She's at an amusement park. She's a customer. The park's sole purpose is to entertain customers. It's not to enforce arbitrary rules. Simply requesting a seating arrangement that makes her more comfortable is ipso facto "unreasonable"?   I don't subscribe to "the customer is always right", but it seems a poor policy to act as though any request to alter SOP is automatically "unreasonable".  Now, this request may have legitimately *been* unreasonable. Especially if the park was crowded, they may not be able to accommodate repeated seating requests without delaying everybody else and making all their other customers unhappy. But her simply *asking* is not unreasonable. Unless you ask, you don't know what the response will be.    Next time I go to Luna Park I'll demand at any congestion stand I'm at not service animal products. I'm sure they'll understand because of my beliefs, right?  This is more like asking if they have veggie dogs than asking them not to serve anybody else meat.   Even if they *didn't* respectfully ask, the correct response is "We cannot accommodate that request. If you'd like a refund, I can get a manager."  There's really no excuse for escalating the situation.     As I understand it, Muslim women aren't allowed to speak to men that they're not related to (how did they order pizza before seamless? The horror...)  Islam isn't a monolith, and not all Muslims are equally religious. Just like with Christians, for that matter. Some Christians - think the Duggars - won't let their children go on unsupervised dates with their fiances. Others are okay with premarital sex.   Plenty of observant Muslim women have no problem speaking to unrelated men, and there really are Jewish and Christian women in this country (and not immigrants) who *do*. (Seriously, Christian patriarchy is a real thing.)   GB has fewer than 5% of the population being Muslim. Italy and Norway have fewer than 4%. If 4 or 5% of your population is "too many", I suggest it may be the remaining 95% of your population that is "the problem".   Yes, asking not to be seated next to a man is *exactly the same* as blowing shit up.  	200
 I awoke to my alarm. I quickly dressed myself and drove the 15min commute to work.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   I arrived at my workplace and checked in with security. The guard gave me a simple "Good Morning" as I saluted her with my own "Good Morning". After a couple of ID swipes and automated doors, I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   I browsed my daily online news articles, then jumped on reddit to read my daily subs. When someone passed my cubicle, I would quickly switch over to an online HTML tutorial. I've read it several times, but I didn't want anyone to know I was goofing off.  All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   The line for coffee was long. Some people looked like they were dragged out of bed. Others were too chipper to be natural. How do they do it? Was it just a mask they wore, hiding their tired, grouchy nature? I drudged to the front of the line and got my coffee.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   I had a brief meeting with my supervisor. She droned on about deadlines, quality, work ethics, and the rest. I nodded my head every so often to appear attentive. I drew funny doodles in my notebook whenever she said something that appeared to be important. The meeting finally ended, and I traveled back to my cubicle.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   I gave away 8hrs of my life for $80 minus the government's pound of flesh. I clocked out and walked through the endless cycle of automatic doors and ID swipes. As I left, the security guard gave me a cheerful "Have a good day" as I saluted her the same.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   I arrived at my house and sat down in front of my computer. I browsed my nightly news articles, then jumped on reddit to read my nightly subs. I played a few games of Hearthstone and CS-GO.   All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before.   As I rested in bed, I kept thinking upon the days events. All the while, I kept feeling like I had done this all before. I recalled every minute of day with such clarity, as if I had re-read this page over and over again.   I had been feeling like this for the past 5 years now. Every day, the same old routine. Like cogs in a machine, I only fit in with the daily turn. Not tomorrow though. Tomorrow would be different. As I told myself that, I knew I had said those words before.    Wow, I remember hearing a show on the radio yesterday about a guy being doused in gasoline and then roasted alive.   What are the odds?  	2

 Vermont flannel co make great quality flannels for under $100.  I've done factory work in mine many days a week for the past 2 winters.  Make sure you size way down, this is an x-small..I'm 5'11 155 lbs  http://imgur.com/w3A2tjI       Were they women you knew before and then after, or just recently met.  Sometimes a sudden complete change in looks can be a bit jarring for old friends.  If you just met them, don't worry about it.  Maybe they just like men that wear sandals with ae bootcuts, and you don't really want those types to be hanging around anyhow.   There is a game in this file/disc 10 out of 10.  900p minus 1 point.  30fps minus 1 point.  Consensus 8 out of 10.  Objective reviews are really fun to read right?   Essentially, cosign!   They must have caught up on the 08-09 GPU failing class action lawsuit.   edit:07-08 and it was an nvidia class action, my bad.  But here's a source from that if anyone was interested.  http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/09/29/07_08_macbook_pros_included_in_nvidia_class_action_settlement   These ones, but i mean those boxing ones are pretty damn hype.. heh http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2014/10/alexander-wang-hm-collection-39-960x640.jpg   Jusdan rules   Fair point, didn't even think about the generational leap.  I like the idea of expansions mainly because if you have friends that don't buy them right away you can all still technically party together albeit on old content.  I would like to see their numbers though on what would sell to a higher % of the current user base.An expansion or a sequel.  I know people still haven't made the leap towards accepting a digital only purchase.   An expansion is not a sequel.  Everquest has survived 16 years and is still making expansions.  Their sequel flopped horribly.  World of Warcraft has thrived for 10 years, and making world of warcraft 2 would be a mistake.  Obviously in an expansion you will use the characters you have right now, so why make a sequel?   Confirmed? there has been a lot of hearsay but I hadn't heard any confirmation.  I don't see any reason to make a sequel, it will just fragment the community.   Those gloves look nice   Resin in a crack pipe will probably get you possession if narcotics, especially if you are a common offender.  Plus if the bike was over $400 it's larceny, class A misdemeanor 3-5 years, I believe.   So when 40k people are trying to watch a world class dota2 tournament they will get sent to random small streamers?    I don't care for a lot of the huge streamers (daily streamers) but telling people what they can and cannot watch is crazy.  Imagine if Comcast sent viewers of the breaking bad finale to pbs to spread viewers out more evenly, the internet would lose their shit.   Yea I'd like to see more stuff like this in the community, really glad I got one.   Thanks, I'm really happy with it.   There is only 1 game that is free on ps+ this month that is also offered on the psnow service.  I understand that their streaming technology probably costs them an insane amount of money, but offering that 1 game as a free to stream game from October 8 to November 5 wont bankrupt Sony.  They could put a countdown timer on the games icon, similar to the countdown on pre-loads.  "This game will expire on this date, if you want to keep playing you can rent it."  Offering this would also get people involved in the psnow ecosystem, if they play that one game for free and see that it works really well they are more likely to go in and spend money to rent things.   Haha wow, didn't think I was being that illogical.   It would be nice if ps+ subscribers could stream it for free from the first wed in October until the first wed in November.   I like the ps4 controller better, and my ps4 is in my living room.  It would be nice if I could stream it there, rather than bringing my ps3 back and forth between rooms.    Launch ps now, scroll down to the game that is currently on promotion on ps+ and instead of saying rent for 90 days for X-price it would say stream for free X days remain on promotion.    People would realize they were streaming the now version because they launched now to get the game.  Im pretty sure people are reasonably comfortable with launching the store and getting their free games for the month, so how much confusion would it cause.   Im not saying its the perfect solution, or that there is even a perfect solution.  But it would spread more good will towards their ps+ subscribers.   consistency across sony platforms is the key though.  It would be nice if ps+ subscribers could play the game via psnow for the duration of the ps+ promo.     they are both sony owned services, they should be able to control pricing on services they provide.   It would be cool if they would even let you play the game on ps now free for the duration of the psplus promotion.  If you are a psplus sub that is.   It's free with PlayStation plus, which I have.If I want to play it on ps4 my only option is to rent it for 6.99. Just saying consistency across psnow and ps store would be pretty nice.      12, Camera was angled a hair so they look huge.  Wish they were smaller though. Heh   Thanks, the shoulders are a hair narrow but the rest is pretty spot on.      50 tops.  15 for the games, 30 for the nes, 5 for the accessories.   I'd check and see if they have a dress code, and what it is.  Cap toe shoes/boots, or chukkah boots should be fine.  If you can get in wearing denim then go for the darkest blue denim you can find, go with slim or slim tapered.  You might feel weird if you are used to baggy denim, but you will look better.(so long as you really are slim, also depending on how tall you are).If jeans are a no go then try some slim chinos.  Personally I'd wear a slim cut button down, no tails so you don't have to keep it tucked in depending on if the rest of the crowd is tucked vs. Untucked.   Posting some shots of yourself will also help people guide you a bit better, and definitely check the dress code.You don't wanna be the one that keeps your group from getting in, unless you are rolling in with like 10 girls.then you might get in wearing your pajamas.   Good to hear, and another cheap security option.get an adt security sticker and put it on the door.  A petty thief probably won't risk calling your bluff when there are plenty of doors out there that don't say adt.    My bike lives in my living room, but I have the luxury of living by myself.   http://imgur.com/a/Xi4uM Managed to grab some 3t ergo drops and an angled origin stem for $20. Craigslist deal.  I've got big hands and got the hand numb thing every time I hit 15+ miles with the vintage 38cm drops (no flats).    I know the aesthetic doesn't quite fit, but I plan on getting a new frame set this winter.  Something my size, and black.   That sucks.  You might want to show the receipt for your new bike to your building manager.  Don't be a dick, you don't wanna get on his bad side.  Maybe he will cut you a deal on rent.  At the very least he might consider improving basement security.  You could even try to get some of those fake security cameras.most petty criminals won't bother to risk stealing right in front if what looks to be a camera.  Best of luck!   I've been thinking about it, just for comfort.  Did you remove the lever so it's just the hood?   Left leg faded, right leg brand new.  Classic look.   Dang, I'll be in Montreal the 11th-13th.  :(   Soldier of fortune 2   mannn those combs    The crotch is sagging about knee level   Wearing your pants that low is cheating..   I had to get long reach tektro brakes in my recent conversion.  The arms can be set between 55-70 mm I believe.  And you will probably have to drill your fork for recessed bolts on modern brakes.  That's what happens when you go from 27 wheels to 700mm   Send em to self edge to get repaired XD. Never take the deal.   The men's stuff is hot garbage.  Gonna have to check out the woman's symmetrical and bootleg ass HARE tunnel neck sweaters in person.   Gap makes very durable, good looking windbreakers.  They might retail fairly high, but I picked one up off season for $8 on clearance.  You might want to check that out once the weather gets cold.  I figure your student might like wearing a jacket that is a similar material.   Should have bought a ps3 and that version of Destiny and kept smoking.   Vermont flannel co.flannel, 3sixteen st, Brown cdb's.  Getting cold again finally    I found it comparable to kara or 10 man nax.  Certainly not end game progressing in wow.  The tricky part is the fact that the vast majority of people trying have never been involved in anything like it. It's amazing that they managed to make a fun fps raid with a few relatively interesting mechanics. Been interesting stepping up to be somewhat of a raid leader dad and guiding people through mechanics though.   The asteroids moved, they wouldn't burn in like Pac man where everything was stationary.   I've been seeing a lot of people lately riding around with horns and drops that aren't taped.  Trying to understand why, lazy? Better road feel?  It just seems like it would be really uncomfortable.   That Hodor   Agree, I think they have better fits than the gap solid color t's.  Im pretty partial to my jcrew v necks though   They scale it well and all drops are geared towards your level.might as well cut the player base in half right?   I have a void rocket launcher but using that was hopeless, didn't even think of trying a large machine gun.it would probably speed things along, or at least it wouldn't hurt. Thanks for the advice.   I've played about 50 hours and am in all legendary gear except for my boots.  Tonight is the first time I've even been in the crucible.  Personally I like learning patterns and killing bosses.  To be honest this is the first time I've ever played a competitive first person shooter on a console.  It would be another story if I could plug in a mouse and keyboard   Limiting somebody to one specific type of damage, I find myself sitting in the corner with my void shotgun waiting for someone to run by to kill rather than being on the field helping my team.  I don't want to be in any danger because that makes my bounty slower to complete.  When I'm out of shotgun ammo rather than helping the team with another gun I'm running to find more special ammo, because kinetic kills are pointless.   I would rather do 100 strikes without dying than play one crucible match, not because I think the pvp is bad but because I don't like pvp in games.  I appreciate the fact that Bungie made exotic weapons bounties difficult to complete, they shouldn't be a cake walk but they have seperate pvp and pve vendors.  This means you should obviously specialize and primarily concentrate on one or the other aspect. Why not have separate pvp and pve exotic bounties?   I feel bad being in part of the game I don't want to be in riding the bottom of the leader boards, hopefully people are angry about this.  If someone was doing a strike with me stuck using only a shotgun I'd be pissed. Sorry for this rant, but at this rate I'll be bringing down my team for over 500 matches... great.   I think everyone is instanced based on geographic locations.  Everyone I've met so far lives within an hour from me.  I don't much care for that, but it is what it is. Edit.probably to help with latency   Tragedy khadafi and pharaoh monch. Shaped modern rap quite a bit in the late 80s.  Capone n noreaga did really interesting collab work in the mid 90s.   Ra the rugged man is really interesting, especially his work with biggie.  Cage's life story is out of control, his movies for the blind album might be worth digging into.  Oh and epmd before Capone and noreaga.   I'm guessing amour is rarer at higher levels, because it's how you level up.  Special weapons vs other weapon drops is probably just bad rng   A lot of cs:go streamers will play cs for the majority of their time streaming, every now and again they will play a round or two of something else to kill time and or wait for someone who may be afk or whatever.  Don't really see a problem with stuff like that, although I havn't really experienced anything extremely flagrant or excessive. Plus changing the name of your stream is usually really temperamental for me, it seems to say I'm playing whatever twitch wants me to be playing.   How much will people willingly pay per month year round to watch a single tv show....    Xexyz was one of my favorites growing up, figure I'd throw it in because it isn't an obvious response.   Run your game in a window, and stream just the game.rather than a whole desktop screen region.  A second monitor would be way more optimal though.   ArmaniXchange=/= Armani   But you can guide this youth, and make sure he doesn't make the same mistake.  As for you... Don't wear sneakers to your wedding, in-laws hate that sort of thing. ;)   Just not to prom.   Cargo shorts and a tank top breh breh...   Marketing, and adequate testing.   Around 6th or 7th my school had a computer with sim ant.  Real rough life. Haha   Try http://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/   Polygons... My grade school had black monitors with green text... :(   Suspect website.   Edit: they also wouldn't release that info the day before the ps4 version was released.  They want to sell more copies, not less.   Sure thing, on vacation until tomorrow so I only have my phone.  Once I'm back by my computer I'll send you a pm.   If you're gonna be in Boston let me know,I can throw you together a list depending on your style and budget.  	72
 NSFW   Sorry for the vagueness and ambiguity but its 530am and I don't know why my brain just started to think about this but about ten or fifteen years ago I remember seeing this movie where this guy who is an increasingly shitty husband comes home to find a really fucked up video of his wife confessing to a bunch of fucked up shit like cheating on him and the video gets worse and worse until the end it actually shows her cheating on him on the video with his neighbor and then he finds out that its not a recorded video but a live feed from the neighbors place and he tries to kill her and or the neighbor or something. It may not have been in theaters maybe just made for/by HBO or Cinemax or something. Sorry/thanks.         Www.pornhub.com .... One lifetime of HIV prevention.   ANUSTART   Also why is he laying on his back with no pants on in what appears to be a dirty bathroom in an old insane asylum.    I feel like 80% of rap songs from the 90s are full of those sounds too.   I would either choose "oops" or "what's that?".   Its cool because English is such a garbage language that when you read it out loud all the a's make different noises.   Because of Facebooks-n-such.   There needs to be infinity more of these types of videos   If the husband of some bitch can be president, then some bitch who's husband was president can also be president.   Holy shit      Panda Venom new band name I called it.         Look it up, its actually a physics phenomenon in the sport of table tennis.   I dunno man I saw one on the Science Channel that can essentially print 3d buildings from locally acquired mineral resources, which NASA is considering using for building a moon base, and moon bases probably won't have to be breastfed, have diapers changed, wake up crying every night, and throw up constantly for the first year of their lives...   And that every straight guy age 12-35 walks around with a banana in their pocket.   Well, in the kitchen, women complain about doing the dishes, and in the bedroom they complain about having to make the bed and fold clothes, and in the TV room they complain about the TV being too loud or food being left on coffee tables; ergo, they need something to complain about in a bathroom that is otherwise dominated by their mess, so they use the toilet lid as their vehicle.   Baby pandas are in fact much more dangerous than adult pandas because their venom is just as potent, but as adolescents they haven't learned how to control the amount that they inject into their prey when they bite.      The 14 year old me was pretty certain you were supposed to pee inside a girl's bagina when you had sex, too.   I feel like Lynch is a pretty racist surname too. It's like having the last name Gaschamber.   I'm tempted to create numerous extra accounts just so I can give this more upvotes.  	27
    "The FBI has been telling us only pedophiles use encryption, so of course we didn't use it..."   Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said last week that Chinese intelligence agencies have for some time been seeking to assemble a database of information about Americans. Those personal details can be **used for blackmail**, or also to shape bogus emails designed to appear legitimate while **injecting spyware** on the networks of government agencies or businesses Chinese hackers are trying to penetrate.  Interesting that he believes all of that. I don't recall him advocating against NSA gathering all of the same information about Americans because of those same reasons. Oh right, the "good guys" would never use that same information for those purposes.               I hear "torture works" - maybe try that to make them tell us?               What's there to "study"? High-end smartphones should've had it since the first half of this year - one of the more disappointing aspects about Galaxy S6 and other flagships.            Not just privacy...but security. You know how encryption would've protected the OPM data?      Was yours a secret Court, too?                  Which is exactly why tuition prices have spiraled out of control - thanks to the government guaranteeing the loans, no matter how much they hike up the price.   Automatic breaking is one of the nice side-effects of research into self-driving cars, and I expect a lot more like it to spill over into "regular" cars in the near future.   ZeroCash aims to fix that, but it's not quite finished yet I think.                              Not the "Internet", the 100 or so websites they will allow in their Internet.org project.   Facebook does that with like 90% of its announced products. I don't know why people even make a big deal about some of them when they get announced at this point.                              Wait a minute...I thought only child pornographers and terrorists need encryption? What are they implying if they move to encrypting all the sites now ?!   This is still valid? I thought Google moved away from that a while ago?      Does this ROM have anything to do with this? https://guardianproject.info/   Does this ROM have anything to do with this? https://guardianproject.info/                                                                           And yet somehow others managed to stole all federal employees' data.  NSA's actions: both illegal *and* completely worthless.            That's not true. All of Intel's mobile chips are normally significantly more expensive than the ARM equivalents, but they get subsidized for devices.     The chip is more like ~1.3GHz with Turbo-Boost up to 2.3Ghz. The max speed isn't always activated.  Also, the fact that Intel has to do emulation for many apps means that the chip will perform less well than otherwise, and it will also [consume more power](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/):   The results weren't pretty: when using binary translation on this CPU-centric benchmark, power consumption went up nearly 90 per cent and performance dipped by over 40 per cent.   Probably just to catch their own [manufactured terrorists](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/26/fbi-manufacture-plots-terrorism-isis-grave-threats/), too.  My advice? Stop giving their idiotic ideas prime time (whether in the media or on Reddit). Don't let their propaganda spread. Just ignore it.   The future (in the long term) seems to be to "decentralize everything". I think energy will have to be decentralized as well, which is good not just for individuals but nations as well as they won't have to depend on other countries for oil and such.               I've been asking for YEARS that Google should make a "PC interface" for Android, and then when you connect the phone to a monitor, it would show you that.   The same could work with a TV, to show you the Android TV interface, although it would have to happen wirelessly otherwise no one will bother.                               It would be nice in the future if there was an internet permission that somehow allowed ads while blocking everything else, although this would obviously be quite complicated  I don't think it would be complicated at all. They could probably just open up a special port on Android that only works for ads. Plus, Google owns Admob, which represents lie 75% of the ads on Android apps, so they could "force" the change pretty easily.      Android's ~50% market share in the US hasn't changed for at least the past 2 years, maybe 3.  It's just that in the winter holiday season, the iPhone manages to get like 5% or so extra market share, and then Android drops to 47-48%, and many Apple-loving tech sites point to that as "Apple growing and Android losing" in the US. But then they fail to write about how the numbers jump back up to over 50% for Android a quarter later.                        This happens all the time too - I mean those connected to the NSA for instance, leaking classified information to the media that makes the NSA or the government *look good*. But somehow nobody is calling for *those* people to be put for "endangering national security" in prison or even assassinated for leaking the data.  I think it's even emerging as some kind of litmus test. Are those in the media trying to discredit the personality of the leaker and call for his assassination or arrest? Then it must be great leak for the population. If not, then the government probably had a hand in it and is trying to manipulate us through that leak.   In other words, Android Pay is nowhere near as private as Apple Pay. Got it.   They've had like 3 or 4 restructurings so far.         Just some bad apples.             Encryption is for the elites. The rest of you are basically two steps (or should I say "hops"?) away from becoming terrorists.   tl;dr: "We apologize - we should've done more lobbying in the EU."   This also includes things like banning the Disconnect app from the store (anti-tracking protection).  Google can only claim stupidity for so long on such actions. Was it also stupidity or a mistake when they banned ALL adblockers from the store? I don't think so.  They *should* be punished for stuff like that.         I think they've been saying that since 2011.               What makes you think he was joking? I'm pretty sure that's exactly the *main* reason for why he wants to kill the Human Rights Act, but he's selling it to the public as something else.  For instance, Cameron and Tories hardly mentioned their surveillance plans during the election, so they got elected for different reasons, but within a week of getting elected passing new surveillance laws seems to be by far the main priority of the party. So why wouldn't you think that's the main reason for killing the HRA too?   "We have always been at war with Eastasia."  "We have never been at war with Iraq."                     If you need a free VPN for your phone, [Opera Max](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opera.max hl=en) provides exactly that and it even allows you to block apps from connecting to the Internet on their own. However, it only works on Android right now. It also  compresses data in about half, which is actually its primary objective.   As usual, Microsoft is more about misleading people than doing something real. They purposefully chose the "holo" name to mislead people into thinking it's a hologram - for marketing purposes. That says a lot about Microsoft's honesty as a company.               Moore's Law.   If only the US government wasn't so anti-strong security and anti-encryption for the sake of making spying easier. Even as we speak, the FBI is spreading its anti-encryption propaganda on WashingtonPost and other such media sites.               I like how this came out right after Obama patted himself on the back for signing the "surveillance reform he has been requesting for many years", exposing him as a liar and hypocrite (not that I believed him prior to this article, but still nice to see this thrown in his face so he stops with that charade).                                                                                                            You mean other than being heavily influenced by the NSA?    Homeland Security Committee Chairman warns that encryption is a tremendous threat to the homeland.   That sounds a lot like something Russia would say. Just replace homeland with motherland.                        Probably not.   We need to go BIGGER!   I wonder if 50 years from now it's new genetically modified humans that will have kill switches in them...   OOOH SNAP!   I think it's important we at least make it explicitly clear in laws what they can and can not do. The problem is they may be using other programs or have different interpretations, which is why transparency and oversight is also very important. So we need to get more people like Ron Wyden in the Intelligence Committees, and fewer people like Dianne Feinstein, so we can know if they are actually obeying the laws as intended or not.  We also need to *actually cut* NSA's funding by a significant margin (at last half say over the next 3 years). I mean if we're going to stop some of the major "mass surveillance" programs, then they won't need as much budget, right?! Otherwise if we leave them that budget they could just restart the *same* programs under different names and in different locations. Starve the NSA of resources to the point where it *only* has the necessary resources for targeted surveillance. There should also be regular audits (twice a year) of NSA's expenses by the Intelligence Commitee's staff.  So it's not impossible to rein on the NSA. But it does require a lot of political will and some good systems in place to ensure that they *can't* now that they "won't" do some stuff.  We also need to *start punishing people*, even with prison, when they break those laws, which again requires political will, and therefore a lot of activism from us.   I wonder if in the past year or so, worrying that the Patriot Act might actually expire, the NSA/FBI started putting everyone "under investigation" just so it can continue spying on all when the Patriot Act expires, thanks to this "grandfathering" feature.           	200
 No problem :). If I came off negatively I didn't mean to.   /r/tipofmytongue/   Last November I went to visit some family in Shanghai. And I got to tell you that when you're walking down these crowded streets in the middle of a freezing downpour with neon lights flashing all around you, you forgot you're in the present: it feels like your in the middle of a Cyberpunk adventure.   The only thing that comes to my mind is Knights of the Old Republic. I know it's a comicbook and not a book, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it. The only problem with it is that near the last couple of issues the story gets jumbled a little.   How did your family respond to you voluntering for this experiment?   The cover system in Max Payne 3 was much better than the one in GTAIV and since the shooting in V looks like the one Max Payne i'm guessing they're are using the same cover system too :)   Yeah I thought it was Franklin at first because of the clothes he had on. But since the bar in the lower right is blue I guess it was Michael in the bike race.   If that since the game is split between 3 protagonists, there won't be a large amount of missions for each of them. I know there is a shit load of stuff to do outside of missions, but I would be disappointed if they all have small campaigns that just add up together to match the previous games. Also I hope they bring back checkpoints and mission replays from Ballad of Gay Tony.   Probably Franklin, because in the trailers he's mostly seen as being the athletic one with the cycling, parashooting, and dirtbiking. I never really feel in love with CJ or his gangster story, but Franklin and his story to me seems interesting. Also I love driving and its been shown that he's the best one at it.   In Kingdom Hearts 1 I agree that they were bad and I think a waste of time, but in Kingdom Hearts 2 I felt that they became pretty fun (especially that "death star" one that lead to twilight town).    While I do like the look of the multiplayer, I'm mainly wondering if this means Robin will also be playable in the new challenge rooms, because I loved playing as him in Arkham City and the talk of more skins is really getting me excited.   I was bugged that Red Robin was hardly in Issue #19, him being there just seemed weird.   Books that have any of the Robins and Batgirls working together, with or without Batman.    slightly off topic  O_o   try it, I already have 26 hours on it (and two playthroughs for the single player).   Riffs leader: You Warriors are good. Real good.  Swan: The best.   Fifteen bucks little man, put that shit in my hand   Son of a bitch must pay.   Just remember what ol' Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol' storm right square in the eye and he says, "Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKPvEfBCPSk Jiffy! 0:00-0:08   O_O..... Just kidding. I can actually believe he did something like that.   roll again for crit confirmation   I've played it and I got to say it's really good. The shooting is fun and it has a nice story. I also thought the first one was ok but I love this one. You should check out some gameplay or the demo.   [I know this is a right hand but....](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=2gSf5UMZ8ms#t=131s)   My friends and I disagree.   Did you give her the old Pork Chop Express?   I don't know if this would count but I would like my feet similar to an Ape's. So I could climb faster and just pick up stuff.   If not a tail, so I could hold stuff.   Oh my god, same here. I first watched MST3K when it was on Netflix a year ago and when I saw the Arrested Development cameo I searched to see if this subreddit existed.    I saw your earlier post and I couldn't believe it either. They made sure to have a lot of cameos this season :)   The movie is The Fantastic Four, the one from the 90's      I'm beginning to write a Cyberpunk novel and the thing I'm having trouble with is describing my characters and the world they live in. For characters I'm wondering if I should go into detail (clothes, facial appearance, etc.) or leave most of it up to the reader's imagination. And for the world I'm trying to find a way to describe it without going into long stretches of exposition. I'm just an amateur writer in High School so I only have a small amount of experience with creating anything beside short stories.   A whole bunch of pain   "Jesus lifts up Muhammad and does a Cross Piledriver!"  "Can I get two hallelujahs and a amen!"  	35
 I was gonna say either Wake in Fright or Mad Max: The Road Warrior, but then I remembered - oh yeah - Mad Max: Fury Road.   I know, but look at the opening of District 9. That's also in a mockumentary style and that looks great, not just because of the set design but also due to the cinematography.  Better yet, look at Veep. Also by the same writers and creator. Great cinematography, identical style. I just think In The Loop has bad cinematography.  	2

 Hya all,I have a couple of items i would like to trade away! So here it goes Ember Tipped Antennae, Shattered Blade of Levinthal, Direstone Liferipper, And others looking to find a new home from my inventory! Feel free to either offer here or simply add me,cheers!   Dragon Knight,makes you a black dragon with a desolatorish effect on your attacks   Great man,i added you on steam so we can talk there more about the games :) cheers!   I want to participate in 5v5 I live in GMT+1:00 timezone and am most active during 17:15-19:00 hours of the day. I am comfortable with a 0 to low levels of risk and reward when it comes to item wagering. Im sorry if im double posting this from the last one,cant remember if i already signed up but im happy to participate.   Im up for 5v5 0 to low wages.Living in UTC/GMT + 01:00 timezone and i should be free between 5:30-7/8(depending on agreement) every day except friday/saturday   Hi,i guess i could spread the word across some other trade sites/groups.If i manage to bump into something,ill let you know.Good luck to everyone! Also if you could PM me the price youre buying them at it might help me get the attention of sellers.   How much are you asking for the Wyrm of uldorak set for DK?   I have the shield you are looking for(wyvern) feel free to add me on steam,ill be online later   I completely agree about the farm time.It was just a bit too long and felt forced to me.As for the DK lore,im pretty sure if you read it you could ind out he actually became a half-dragon by fighting a dragon and eventually both of them dying to merge into one.But anyway,i think that would be a bit too hard to make,I mean they could just let you fight your dragon for as your human form until it ends with a stalemate,but i have no idea how it would end up.   Actually managed to sell a ton of the juggernaut ones recently through the market.Sadly it was not enough to remove them all,though they did sell for 0.15$ each which is awesome   Is that the one that can switch its head?I used to have the same,but of course someone stole one of the two heads.Anyway,i still have a yellow tiger like Autobot in my desk drawers   Glad i could help   Think he meant necronomicon   HARASSING IS FOR PUSSIES!REAL MEN DONT HARASS!God i need to read that guide again   No,it doesnt seem so.Theres no mention of Diretide.   Hya all.Just want to thank you in advance.I have absolutely no idea how much i could get for these two,got them both to drop during the holiday events so im completely oblivious of their value.Thanks again!   Hi,just wanted to ask you a question when you come online next time!Is there any chance of your games coming to Steam,now that Greenlight is up?Im sure it wouldnt be long before you would get 'lit' by the community.   Honestly,it was a decent movie.I mean its great when you think about it as a free film,but there were a lot of moments when i had to cut the sound down.Im not talking about the slenderman scenes,heck those were expected but the [ scene where Chases sister cries,i cant remember her name,while they are both tied up was just too much for my headphones. ] (/spoiler)  But all in all,if you like slender man,you will like it.Have fun    And we seem to have been arguing over bullshit.Go a little bit lower,someone linked OP trying to sell his account,which probably led to his ban,not this F person.   But the problem isnt in him accepting him,the real problem is that it makes absolutely no sense to ban someone just for accepting someones friend request.I mean would it make sense to you if you got banned from steam trading because you accepted a scammer?Heck i see the deal Microsoft probably saw,hey this guy stole someones account,now hes probably adding his friends,so lets ban them all so they hate him!Back on the point,they really should have done more research before banning 100 people    The server kick?Well if i remember well in that time it would take you a lot to get a hat.I remember that getting 1 drop per 50 hours was fantastic,because that was all the way before they updated the drop system...Well anyway,the kick was just a running joke we had on the servers,even if there were no admins around the guy that got the hat would just leave and come back,hell i even remember when my friend got a Camera Beard(mind you they were awesome back then),left the server,came back only to have another Camera Beard drop for him.The funny part was that one of the head admins was hoping to get that item for awhile,and with no trading implemented then all we could do is laugh at his fortune   Wait wait wait,lets use your logic.If a thief came to you on the street,randomely talked to you for no apparent reason,of course without you knowing he was a thief,would it be okay from the police to just come and put you into prison for not being AntiSocial?   Trading has been up for 2 years now?Damn I remember when having a hat drop on a server would give you a complimentary kick from the server....Damn i have to get back to Calculated Chaos.   Looks like a united colours of benetton comercial.      Ill give you the crown of polymorph,im looking for drow ranger sylvan guard set items,add Doctor Von Foster on steam so we can talk   Depends really what MMO you are playing.I remember people being quite polite in 90% of matches in Guild Wars(except those Assassins raging at monks).Heck,even when playing against bots they were programmed to say GG at the end.   Just did the whole thing...and honestly,got a bit confused at the end with all the DLC price questions...you guys cant seriously be planning to release an unfinished game and spam the dlc upon the customers?   Pretty much describes Fable:The lost chapters.God that was one hell of a game   About the ads.Honestly,the only thing so far they did to me was good.I wouldnt have found out about Guardian of Middle Earth if there were no ads on the dashoard,and sure as hell i wouldnt have heard about happy wars...But heck,to each his own.   Dont be a dick,op lost a friend   Yep   Rip his heart out.that should slow down the nuke building process   Count me in!GT: train_subject4021  	34
 I'll probably be picking that up soon      It is an epic western about the Texas frontier. It's a very dark cowboy and Indian story that spans about 100 years, similar to Marquez.    I work in the book biz, so I saw dozens of reviews for this book when it came out. If I can help it I won't read a review before I read the book, so I basically ignored The Son until a few weeks ago, when I met Philipp Meyer and had a beer with him. I started reading the book the next day and, though I'm only a dozen chapters in, I know this will be one of my all time favorites. The writing is as close to perfect as I've seen in recent memory. Have you all read the book and what do you think? I'm afraid I'm just a fan of the man instead of the writing.       As a publicist, this is an awesome list that will add hours to my workload next week. Thanks.   There's a book called Christian Nation that is all about if McCain won the election and died weeks later.   I'm a book publicist in NYC. My firm is a freelance consulting outfit so I have worked with virtually all publishers and about a dozen bestsellers every year.

The money we raise is headed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM-meqdHUw4   I thought the book was inspiring. The whole time I was reading it I was thinking that I should really get out there and do something big. The specifics didn't matter so much to me as that feeling I got while reading it.       What's the fun in that?      We had a middle school gym teacher fired and jailed for being intimate with a student. I believe this occurred on several occasions, and they were discovered by the gym teacher's wife, also a gym teacher at the school.

 I saw this episode of the Muppets.    If you ever visit Vermont message me. I've got a nice view if a river but am also close to the downtown. A nice city with lots of music and art.    As a Miami Dolphins fan it made the quote seem like a joke.    Not taking it as a put down, criticism is important.  1) it's a small state (Vermont) that I would do this in, so I feel like it's feasible to promote them internally and to visitors.  2) I own a number of premium local domain names that I would build sites on to promote all of the restaurants on (sites would have to be established first), and build relationships with other media outlets to promote them in exchange for online advertising.  3) I see the cost to the restaurants as that 12% (10% to the customer, 2% to the credit card company) with my 1% coming from the credit card. Yes, that's lower revenue for the credit card company, but in exchange for hopefully increased usage of the card.  Thoughts?   Shocked as shit that this is something someone would pay for. There's no useful information there -- it's all common sense. If ESPN is going to charge for content they better do a lot fucking better than that. I would feel ripped off.  But thanks for sharing :) I know to stay away from their paid content!   Hi all,  I think I've seen others do this, but am finding it hard to find information on where to start.  To make a long story as short as possible, I'd like to start a business where I provide people with a credit card dedicated to local restaurants. If you use that card in one of the participating restaurants you get a small discount (let's say 10%, and in return the restaurant gets promoted through the program) and I would receive a small percentage of the transaction fee (1%).  Is this possible? Are there resources online on how to build this program with a credit card company?  Thanks for any assistance!   This exactly.  You don't just hire based on need, you have to look at the market. If a **proven** GM knocked on Ross' door and said "Give me the power, I'll give you a Super Bowl" he'd probably do it.   Philbin's a eunuch? Great. We are fucking doomed.   Pioli's good man! Patriots, and Chiefs...Chiefs were poorly coached, but with the exception of Smith that's his roster today.   I have that feeling as well. Changing GMs like this, while keeping the coach, rarely works out. Look at the Browns, seems like every single year it's either the GM or the coach being fired.  You have to wonder how this sets up Philbin for next year. A GM may come in with a promise to keep Joe for at least a year, but you know he'll be heavily scrutinized, as will RT. So much for consistency.   Are we just trying to keep our 2013 "fuck" record for 2014?  Shit, I'm on board. Oops, I mean "fuck".   I'm a bit concerned since Sherman's offense is all RT has known for 6 years. But he's a smart kids, so will hope for the best.   True, true. But don't discount a coach that was successful.  Gruden got 2 teams to the super bowl, one being the Raiders who have been a mess for decades. I'd take him.   I don't think you have a point. There's always a reason why someone is fired, doesn't make it a good one.  Lots of great coaches were fired...Belichek, Dungy, Lovie Smith, Ken Wisenhunt (this guy will win a super bowl one day as head coach), Gruden...   That's some backwards logic there.  I'm not going to go for the hot chick. She's hot for a reason.   Considering the owner's history, i don't think a proven coach would take the job. Ross went after a new head coach while still employing one, then gave the next guy only 2 years. I know i wouldn't join that mess.    Because that's just not the case. Before this season I went through and compared a draft of Ireland's to Newsome's and he does well.  For some reason people think you're supposed to walk away from the draft with a handful of top performers. That's just not reality. If 4 years after the draft you have 2-3 starters from it then it was a good draft.   That was. He was great at Denver.   Zone blocking...hmmm isn't that a forte of Kubiak?   It's a great analogy, but you would want to sit down with the person and discuss why the goals were not met.  Context is lost on a lot of people. It's easy to point a finger, but there's more going on in reality. If you're going to lead an organization you better figure out what's really happening and not jump to "the GM is doing a lousy job".   Good point, and I agree. The loss of leadership is my issue with him.  Ireland could still have said what I typed, then it would have been Ross' call.    This assumes wins and losses are at the complete control of the GM. It's more complicated than that.   "You have to work with them, Coach, because that's your job and I'm not going to cut every strong leader we have. So, why don't you tell me which 2 of the 4 to keep, and those will be the 2 I keep."  As a manager, that's what I'd do. I'm beginning to wonder if the Dolphins as an organization just don't know how to work a business or a team (team as in group of people working towards one goal).    People like to talk about his crappy drafting without taking a look at other teams' drafts. If they did they would be impressed with Ireland's drafts.   My issue is the gutting of the leadership in he lockerroom. He shouldnt have allowed that to happen. I will not be upset if he sticks around.     I'm tired of statistics that mean exactly nothing.   Stayed in, put in a couple movies and feel asleep before the turn. Boring.    How's McKee's on new years eve? Anyone know?   He's not the worst name on the list. Tannenbaum....really? Guy brought in Tebow.   Tebow.   Let's just let that sink in a minute.  Sink in like an infected herpes sore into your lunch time cup-a-soup.   I disagree. If I'm in the position that Ross is in, where I need to determine if some employees are sticking around or not, I wouldn't want to be surprised later by something in an independent report.  It isn't good business to make a decision when you know more information is on the way.   You can do this with any GM. When you compare his drafts to other successful GMs he's good.  His issue isnt the draft, its handling personnel overall. Like gutting team leadership. Looks good on paper but negatively impacts the lockerroom. He cant see the forest for the trees.    Fuck thats a tough schedule   I don't throw comments like this around, but if that happened (hired as head coach) i would literally stop being a fan. It would demonstrate the complete ineptitude.    I think i was premature, saw it on r/nfl but apparently not confirmed. Feel free to downvote me to hell.    On phone so no link, sry.

I'm not a lawyer, but this might help:  "Section 230 of the CDA specifically addresses the nature of information ownership by online users. The Section states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  Generally speaking, Section 230 protects website administrators from being held accountable for information posted by other users. The CDA is a federal initiative, which means that Section 230 trumps any state or local laws to the contrary."  From http://www.brand.com/review-sites.html  My work is entirely online.

Really only 2-3 are needed, clearly being able to handle the weight then not.  I'm sure some photos already exist but I'm having trouble tracking down.  Any help is appreciated.

I agree on some of those as possibilities, but we just don't know how they are in the locker room. And from what's happened recently, I wouldn't be surprised if Starks or Solia are already on Ireland's list to chop.   Someone needs to step the fuck up and kick some asses in line. Ideally that would be Tannehill but I don't know what his personality is like.   This is probably the best article on the situation. I've defended Ireland in the past, and feel he does a very good job on the draft. This past off season, however, was a disaster. It's easy look back and say this (hindsight being 20/20), but Ireland should have known better.   When was the last time a team made wholesale changes to their roster like we did? When has that worked? I remember the Redskins (maybe the 90s) making a number of changes and they won the Super Bowl, but they brought in proven and trusted vets, not a WR who was a bit of a diva, linebackers (don't get me wrong, I think Ellerbe and Wheeler are very good) and OLs who are still green.  This will continue to affect us. Next year won't be good either unless some leaders are brought in or miraculously emerge.   It'll be one of those statements where there's a lot of talking without really saying anything.    Much snow. Wow.   People can also be really fucking high on meth.   Saying he's better than RJ Stanford is like saying Chlamydia is better than Herpes.   Have you tried Google reverse image search?   Hmmm, yeah I see what you mean.  Did you use regular spray paint?

 So there was a precedent, I don't see the same precedent for Ideis, however I believe he is a very talented actor so if he proved me wrong I wouldn't be surprised.

 VSCO Cam. They just released their app for Android, and that was the deciding factor for me to be able to switch to the G2 from iPhone.

I thought the OIS would be more helpful in fixing that problem, but it's still really apparent in this phone. Either way, it hasn't really bothered me, but fixing that would have made this camera near-perfect.   Hey, John. Big fan, so thanks for your work.

Bryan Cranston's done phenomenal, but I think you would have given the character an entirely new flesh.          Maybe next time I can try getting the point across without saying as much. Not that I didn't try here either.    That title describes exactly what the post is about. Did I admit that it's got a cheesy title to make the post more accessible for people? Yeah. But I don't see how that's me admitting it's a misleading title.  Whether it's blogspam is up to you to decide. I can't upvote this more than once, even if I tried. I put it up to hopefully help someone out there that could use a few tips, and I'm guessing a few people did find it useful.       *"In just 5 minutes, this young man will change how you view your life forever."*   I should have been a bit more clear. The biggest reason I haven't been able to use the 5D for a while is because a lot's been going in terms of school hours, LSAT stress, and work issues. I haven't been able to focus on photography as much as I used to. Having an iPhone 5 (and then eventually an LG G2) helped fill that void since it's something I always have on me either way.   It wasn't because of the iPhone 5 that I stopped using the Mark II. But I did start using the phone more when I had to stop using it.    I was focusing more on scenic photography when writing that article. When you're at something like a dinner with friends and you want to get a group photo taken, I don't care at all about using the flash. Someone else commenting on the article brought up the iPhone 5S as a good example. Flash can be helpful as hell when it's used at the right time.  It's the same way using flash on a DSLR is appropriate when you're shooting something like a wedding. That would be different from taking taking a picture of a scene you want to capture in its natural look.   Hey, guys! I'm the author of this article. I just needed to address a few things:  This isn't really an article I wrote for photographers. I wrote this for people that don't know anything at all about photography. A lot of my friends that want to do some photog as a hobby don't tend to have actual cameras. I wrote this for them as some basic tips so they could get a kickstart with their phones, at least.  The way I see it is most of the time people don't tend to think of their phone as an actual camera so they just treat it like a point-and-shoot, where they would probably try going into learning more about actual photography tips if they had a DSLR. I remember treating every picture I took on my phone like that before I started using a Canon.    *I FORGOT ABOUT AFTERLIGHT.*  Ever since moving to Android, I've been waiting for it to come out on that. Afterlight is fantastic too, but I wouldn't use it for filters. The editing tools are what I love on it. They're the best I've seen on an app. I always took my photos for editing there, and then to VSCO for the finish. But yeah, Afterlight is definitely worth it.  As for the filter pack, look through VSCO's website and see how they describe the filters and what they're typically used for. It gave me a lot of ideas to start off with. A really useful thing I've also learned is if you've got a bit of noise noticeable in your picture, choose a filter that has a good fade to it. It takes out the noise and gives it your photo a more solid look.     I don't regret it one bit. I was ready to buy them again when I realized I didn't have my purchases transfer from iPhone to Android until I found a way to restore them.   I really should have included this one. I never leave my house without a lens cloth now.   In theory, yeah. I targeted it towards smartphone users because it's the most common demographic. It's meant to be a short basic set of guidelines for people that wanna get a kickstart into photography with what they've got.   ...Hence the Buzzfeed-sounding title.. which I'll admit with guilt. Marketing classes.    [You'll use it.. when I say you'll use it.](http://i.imgur.com/BNZELhP.jpg)    Color balance. If there are people in your pictures, do them a favor and move the color balance to the right (warm) 2 or 3 ticks. It will improve their skin tone especially if your photo was taken under harsh light.  There's also a skin tone pack you can download for free! It adds a skin tone adjustment in the editing tools. I've been using it every time i have a picture with faces.   I'm on the LG G2 here. I literally use this phone for almost everything now.    Yeah, a lot of my friends that want to do some photog as a hobby don't tend to have actual cameras. I wrote this for them as some basic tips so they could get a kickstart with their phones, at least.  The way I see it is most of the time people don't tend to think of their phone as an actual camera so they just treat it like a point-and-shoot, where they would probably try going into learning more about actual photography tips if they had a DSLR. I remember treating every picture I took on my phone like that before I started using a Canon.   Oh, hell yeah. When you're at something like a dinner with friends and you want to get a group photo taken, that thing is amazing. I was focusing more on scenic photography when writing that article.    Any progress is always progress. There's so many times I feel embarrassed when I compare my work to the things I see other people doing online. That's what drives me to get better at what I do; knowing there's always someone better.   An artist is someone who practices forms of expression through different mediums. Synonyms for the word 'artist' include 'creator' and 'originator'.  There's no specific guidelines to what makes something art. We're all artists, and we can only become better at it by working on us. What I wrote in that blog were just small guidelines and steps that someone can take in order to get themselves in the hang of the game. If your pictures aren't turning out like the way you see it, then build on it and find a way that works for you. You can't lose from there. You only lose when you tell yourself you're incapable of it.         It's awesome. I'm really biased towards stock Google android, so I wanted to get the Nexus 5. But put a custom rom in the G2, and it runs like a beast. As for the stock LG software that comes with it, it's still powerful. It depends on what you prefer when it comes to software, but in terms of hardware, this phone is more than enough for my uses.   I'm an idiot. Sorry, guys. It being 6 AM when I uploaded this after exam cramming must have gotten me. This is I-35.               thanks, hugo   I'll try seeing if I can make one!   I love your interpretation of it. I took a lot of time to focus on the differences in color each rendition. The last one of him was the palest because he felt like such a ghost by the end of it; at least to me!   Thank you!

Inception:  *'Because I've done it before.*' '*...who'd you do it to?'*   I'm such a child.       Hi, Mr. Hanks. Let me start off by saying that you're my absolute favorite. It's not even funny how much of an impact you've made in my life, from childhood to adulthood, so thank you for that.  What is one movie role out there today that you would have taken in a heartbeat if it were offered to you?    Here's a look at the original sketches used for this. http://i.imgur.com/RviqwKf.jpg      I literally just had the first three sales of my art career today. Thank you so much, man! I'm really glad you liked it. Knowing things like that is one of the biggest things that keeps me focused on getting better with every piece of work I do.   I really hope that print comes out amazingly in XL! :)   The updated artwork on the link should have no more of the artist text. Thanks for pointing that out.   I'm not that happy about those price tags either. I'm still trying to find a viable way for you guys to be able to buy it and being able to afford it at the same time. So far, that website's been the best I can find. I'll let you know as soon as I find a way for the prices to drop!   Good question. I just realized that may look out of place on a large print. I'll update the site with a print free of that text. I think it'll just be replaced with a small transparent signature. Thanks for bringing that up.    Thank you for the feedback on it! I had the file set at a printable resolution and sent it to my Society6 account. They automatically select the size ranges that the file's suitable for, so all the ones that are doable should be shown there. I'll be using it as the vendor for now, so [here's the link](http://society6.com/Maazcon/Chemistry-Hjg_Print#1=2) to it. Thank you for your feedback on it too, by the way!  	57
 I feel personally as if this is the true horror in the world, I have read nosleep often looking for anything else to scare me, and found it very rarely.  	1
 Yeah what is this   Unless New Blood contains information to contradict this..   Pretty dumb if serious. That will not work. However, you will succeed at creating pain for both of you, imagine taking that off. Plus scratching the inside of your vagina. He has to cum, so where's it going to go? Not stay in his pee pee that's for sure. It'll come out.   Just use spermicide, birth control and have him pull out. You'll be fine.    You got HOT. Nice progress.   It isn't   Fuck welfare   Tell him to read a couple parenting books. A lot of good advice and time tested methods   Yeah, I thought it was perfect and fit with the past seasons   "If he was any better, he'd be a Spartan"   Idk. It's like crack for my free time. So I enjoy it.   Armor lock was the worst thing to happen to halo   What?      What type of clan do you want to join?   Why'd it suck? Dealing with idiots?   How did you accomplish that   I really hope it's not Macer to be honest. I kind of want to forget nightfall   You'll have people complaining the Spartans aren't plus size.    I wanted Stacker, Dubbo, and Buck on the team   And Spartan Ray. I just hope they don't go overboard with this diversity thing.   This seriously needs to be addressed. Honestly, Halo 5 MUST have this feature. There is absolutely no reason to not have it.   You're quite attractive, but i might have to come steal that dog though    I don't understand what is so hard about allowing business owners to carry our transactions with who they want. That's what business is, mutual agreements and exchange of goods/services for money.    Then why the fuck is that guy wearing jeans and a polo. Who works out in jeans and a polo.   She's just mad she can't grow a beard   Okay fox news   What an idiot   Pretty much hit the nail on the head with that one   Why did they ever stop using marvel...   Noise in space? Tight ship formations? The explosions I would attribute to when ships explode, the atmosphere leaks allowing for flame to enter the vacuum.  Either way, I was referring to the stories themselves lol.   Good. Hard work and determination will get you to mental health. You control your mind, don't let it control you. Find a reason to be happy everyday when you wake up and make it a goal to have a positive outlook. Good luck bro   Most of the weight on society, comes from corporations using government regulations to their advantage, and lobbying government for one way or the other. Ultimately they're making an environment where they aren't subject to proper market competition, thus you get a shittier cheaper product/service because you can't go anywhere else, and corporations that don't have to worry about things smaller businesses would.   A businesses purpose in society is to make a profit. If profit is made, the consumer has benefited and they are giving society something they want. Supply and demand. Unless of course this business buys policy and saturates it's industry with regulations, and corporate welfare. Which creates something that is absolute shit for people while enriching the corporation (Comcast). By the time those profit decisions actually harm society is when they use the government to make more money. If you subject the "evil" corporations to proper market competition, they'd be forced to compete to provide a good product or service. The best ones would get big.  However, the case for environmental protection is pretty compelling.    Wait. How bad does it inhibit? My curve is only like 13 degrees.   What has your diet looked like specifically? cuz damn nice progress. I have a similar build to you.   I'll respond again with saying democracy did very little in building this country. I'll refer to democracy as government, because it's a gov system.  The government didn't do much in regard to advancing the standard of life of the average American. Capitalism did that as well as provide a means of improvement for the working class and create the american dream. The only thing "democracy" did was invest in infrastructure and start wars.   In this case. It was capitalism that amazed the Russian. Democracy didn't do what we see in the picture.    You might not want to hear this. But I hope you are trying to get better and deal with your issues, she'll only be able to support you for so long.    Sanders is still big government though.   We tried. Media wouldn't play ball    However, I'd say the drug war is a big issue. Which Rand has stepped out against.   Now we get action packed terrorist plots from the perspective of the infallible good guy agents that make it seem like we actually need to be safer, rather than freer.   Capitalism. But ya know, reddit seems to hate it.   You have amazing natural beauty and a great body. Solid 10   Would you be able to format that a little better with spacing?   Get it. It's an amazing SciFi universe with amazing gameplay. Also get into the lore   You should totally redo it. It would be awesome   Haha Tashi is there too.    wat.    You're point? It's still frustrating.    That's true. The only other possibility is that Chief had good reasons. But then again, wouldn't ONI say that? For damage control? Unless the only "reason" he could have would be incriminating to ONI.   You'd be surprised. Most pro e-girls are quite attractive.   You gotta feed her right if you want to get the best blend. It's a delicate art gentlemen.   The political spectrum is a sphere.   It's a possibility. But ONI doesn't want Chief's name slandered. So i'm betting it was an innie spartan.   Was this after I got offline? DAMIT   It really sucks because The Halo channel had so much potential. I still get on there frequently because I enjoy the content they put up.   I live in America. We literally bomb countries into the stone age. Either way, he made that decision without even considering her POV, he took it into his own hands to depose of a democratically elected official whom he himself said would usher in a golden age for Britain.  What gives him that right, especially when she was protecting her planet from a possible return of that species? And if history tells us anything, belligerent species often don't just leave us alone. 10 acted like a child in my opinion.   /u/bravo343   Actually we do bomb their home country. But regardless that wasn't a country. That was a hostile ship.    She didn't commit genocide. She was protecting her planet from a foreign threat. Malevolent Aliens with superior technology came down, fuck shit up, and they begin to leave, who knows if they were doing to come back in stronger numbers? Or if the doctor was going to be around to "protect" them. And realistically, there's only so much one man can do.     I dislike 10. For a variety of reasons. Mainly, because he was extremely vain, often times a complete selfish child and asshole. Being all grandstandy when in reality being a huge dick. For example, the Harriet Jones situation, there was absolutely no need to get her removed from office. She did what was right and best for her people. The Doctor fucked her over and she even came back and died for him in the end. As much as he talked about saving life, he had quite the disregard for it.   Nothing. You're hot as fuck.   He's gotta get the pedo look going.   Easily Halo. When you get into the lore, it's an extremely gritty and realistic military world.   Why?   Norwegian obviously carries more meaning than Whovian. It doesn't matter how much it has to do with who you are as a person, just that you are apart of a community of fans that have common interests and enjoy the same things. End of story.   The term Whovian isn't the problem, it's the people that over do it and act like tards. Just like with anything.   Yes, but why say Norwegian when you're just a citizen of Norway? You're whole argument is a subjective reasoning that it's "silly" to call yourself a particular name identifying yourself with a certain group. Fans of Doctor Who are in fact a group and a community of people. So it's *not* a false equivalency and it's perfectly reasonable to use the term Whovian.    Then they only reference that book.   Public school and common core for you.   So with that logic. You don't need to use the term american. You just use the term Citizen of the United States. It's just easier.   The term Whovian has been around since 1963. The fucktards ruined it.   No dude. Those shows are amazing. It's idiots that get to into them they ruin it   This makes me embarrassed to be a whovian, or like all three of those shows. Because they are great shows   Why does everything that gets posted in this sub, get vigorously downvoted? It's almost as if socialists come here and downvote every thread.    It's milf age.   Except the CIA actually does abuse their power.   So that's our sun? Holy shit that's huge. Bigger than many stars.   Most of those policies are liberal concerns.    Goin for the ol' sneeze look I see   I'm in the same boat you are. I spent the last month ranking up in that playlist for it to be taken away? No matter who you are, when something you've worked for and put time into gets taken away, you get upset.   Is it possible to her halo online gameplay as intended without p2w in america   Looking pretty damn good. You do the dark hair and complexion look really well because of your eyes. Ya got purdy eyes kid   Better hair, makeup, improve your skin.    Why would his son just give you all this?   In reality. It is pretty bad. But it's portrayed hilariously and in a way that it isn't a big deal. Mainly because everyone in the show are idiots in their own way. Except Leela.   That's a horrible excuse that will only make the situation worse.    I really want planetside halo. But alas it won't happen   Why be a dick? And why haven't you told her?   I do think they will unite under Jul, however. I recall seeing somewhere that the religion is back on the rise.    I suggest adding the books that have yet to come out because those contribute to halo 5 significantly.    I hate to say it. But it's like this question gets asked every week in some form or another on here or /r/halostory. Is there an official list in the sidebar that lists it all including upcoming media.   Seriously, if ESO can do it on a console. Then so can halo, and be enough to bring it back better than it ever was.   Almost 100% of the time when guys post in here complaining about how women don't find them attractive, it's not because of their looks. I've seen ugly dudes score with solid goddesses.    Lift and eat   This is basically it.    You do the Indian face well with amazing eyes and facial structure. Compliments your complexion. 8/10   No problem. Some sub's to check out if you want opinions/advice on hair or fashion. These helped me  /r/malehairadvice /r/malefashionadvice /r/malegrooming     You have a face similar to his. So you could go that route. But I would change up your style.   Awesome. Thanks man. I'll take this into account.   You could EASILY pull off a David Beckham   Holy shit. Someone message him on fb to see what happened   Awesome. Thank you!   I just started bodybuilding and was confused when I went to /r/gainit. It seemed like all these skinny guys like me that were lifting for months haven't made much progress except putting on some fat. Then I observe some of my IRL friends go from skinny to decently muscular in a matter of months, and continue to pack on the muscle. My fear is ending up skinny fat or simply not making the progress I want in terms of muscle gains after a long period of time.  I'm not sure if you'd be able to shed some light on this with any advice but I'm counting calories and macros with a reputable program on bodybuilding.com. I just want to pack on lean pounds (not afraid of a little fat)  Edit: Added to 1st paragraph.   I've been talking with my friends about this for a year. Imagine it:  Players can choose between three armies, then choose Spartan or Elite, both with a plethora of customization options. You get an entire halo ring in all of its glory to explore and fight for control over. Three armies fight for control of many large bases, strategic positions, containment facilities, even the most prized possession of them all; the control room, all the way down to small skirmishes over small areas..   You can start squads and clans, get a large number of many different types of missions from command. Or go freemode with your squad and explore the vast expanses and caverns of the ring, hunting the various terminals, datapads, and audiopads that explain exactly what is happening and why it's happening. The enemy that lies within the labyrinth of the installation may be enough to unite the bitter enemies of the surface...    I'm wondering more about how you got that nice body. If you were skinny, how'd you bulk and how long did it take?  I left a comment on your other vid. You can reply here if you want.   I'd like that. But what are the possibilities of it happening?   I shoulda put the /s. But we really aren't that obese. We aren't even in the top 10, or 20, or even 30 most obese countries in the world.   	107
                                                    I've always wondered how to go about the trickily-shaped borders. No way you can scratch around them perfectly and that would bug the hell out of me.                                   	29
 Do an AMA   Boondock Saints: Two misogynistic religious fanatics from another country execute countless American citizens without a trial; the public remains divided.

Yeah, I guess that's technically possible. But I think it's more likely that all politicians feel comfortable with some degree of deliberate distortion.   Merriam Webster definition of Lie: "to make an untrue statement with intent to deceive."  I doubt Obama was really trying to pull one over on us with that one.   Did you check out my links?   It isn't hard to find comprehensive lists of any candidates' lies; check out many of Romney's [here](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/statements/byruling/false/) and [here](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/mitt-romney/statements/byruling/pants-fire/).  [*edited to correct links*]      That's nuts.   Criterion's occasional mainstream releases often help finance their Euro/art offerings, and have the potential to spread awareness of the company's mission to a broader base. Provided they're able to craft a compelling package that makes a case for the films' cultural and artistic merit, it shouldn't matter if they're widely popular or not, hipsters be damned.   If you like pop rock, they definitely have a few gems--[Change your Mind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-mW_0TUSy4) is a personal favorite.   I can't tell you how many times I've futilely started this film.   It doesn't feel all that secure to me--living in Lansing, I'm seeing huge roadside signs for Rogers, Romney and Ryan everywhere. Swing state or not, they're fighting for it.   That's a pretty grandiose take on it.      Watch good stuff/make bad stuff. That's how you get better at every creative endeavor ever.   It always seems strange when people do blatantly phony stuff like this for cameras, especially in this day and age--an olde timey photo op is not the only source of information anymore.   ain't no "one of" here, Debando. You're fucking a hundred duck horses.   While a very interesting and detailed read, I don't think there's much evidence that Caden committed suicide. The film is obviously surreal and obsessed with death, but it doesn't seem to be governed by anything so concrete--relatively speaking--as purgatory. My two major objections:  1) Caden dies at the end. I would argue that exploring a confused, subjective and decidedly purgatorial life and death is a simpler, more elegant and more meaningful reality for the film than literalizing that purgatory and necessitating an unfocused set of rules for leaving it. Basically, there's no sense in killing the poor bastard twice.  2) There is no afterlife. This film was conceived as a horror film, and deals with all the worst fears a man like Caden can suffer, right up to the permanent disintegration of his tortured but solipsistic ego. Death is absolute, impersonal non-existence, and that is why it is terrifying.   or a therapist         Seriously. If strangers were excessively nice to a famous person on Reddit, then that would totally affect me somehow.   I appreciate that. :) Enough time has gone by that it's fine now, but it really was a surprisingly hurtful, emotional experience.   I hardly think this article qualifies as a comprehensive list.   home break-in actually, lost a ton of other electronics as well. still good advice though.   looks great! do you have any experience with it?   A few years ago my laptop was stolen, and it was pretty devastating. I quickly learned the value of backing up important files, but does anyone have any free/low-cost tips for physical laptop tracking and creating comprehensive backups on a multi-hundred gigabyte level?   *shhhhhhhhhhhh!*   I think it was a house of cards built on illogical and implausible scenarios, I think it violates its own logic throughout the movie, and it panders to the audience with cliche "chance" situations.  Oy. That's a different disagreement entirely.  Ah well, stalemate it is. I've done my best to provide some examples of this movie's unique qualities as differentiated from similar films, but there's nothing to be done about different, subjective reactions to the film's objective novelties. I *will* invite you to consider how your own favorite "original" works fare by the standard you're applying here, but I do concur that we'll likely not agree on *Looper*.   Losing a hand is one thing, conscious ongoing torture of a future person through mutilation of their past self is quite another--by the same token, time regulation is one thing and time travel as an exclusively criminal enterprise is another as well. All time travel movies will have some things in common, much the same way that all Westerns or slashers do. A creative genre picture is measured by what the author does within those parameters.   Where, if I may ask, have you seen the torture and dismemberment through time travel scene before? That's certainly a watershed moment. :)  I would also be interested to know where, if anywhere, you've seen the organized use of time travel for criminal executions, which is of course the sci-fi premise that distinguishes the movie. The only thing I see that Looper and *12 Monkeys* (1995) or *Frequency* (2000) appreciably have in common is time travel.    To be fair though, you can make literally everything this side of *Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat* sound derivative by reducing it to its broadest elements. The implied gore of the disappearing fingers, the completely unexpected curve into horror territory, the brutal simplicity of the executions, the little things like the Rainmaker's henchmen wearing the same clothes as the character on the poster on the young boy's wall. For me, it adds up to one of the most clever, surprising movie-going experiences of the year.   I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see an Original Screenplay nod, that's where the edgy/creative movies go.   It's entirely possible to feel sympathy for the professor and overwhelming relief that no one was hurt, and to laugh because it's such a bizarre situation. Go green!   Dinosaurs!   **FUCK YEAH I LOVE THEM!**         I think the point is that it's cool.   Yeah, you can tell it's a classy joint as soon as you walk in and see the glossy gold painted walls.   I'd just like to chime in in favor of signature flavor Sesquicentennial Swirl, a birthday cake and frosting flavor.   Welp, I'm convinced! Thank you, Bob Thompson!   By not giving a shit?   **I BROKE IT**. Feminist avant-garde filmmaker/dancer/actress Maya Deren [has no Bacon number](https://www.google.com/search?q=bacon+number+maya+deren).  Finally, my degree in film pays off.   on 9/11, yes.   No disrespect to the Special Olympics, but if someone earnestly asked you if you were going to participate, you'd probably be a little offended too.   I laughed at this, and then I thought the sentence "spaghetti is a lesbian," and then I laughed again.   Shit dude, you must be starving.  Oh, you mean the picture? That's not so bad.   Recently moved, and couldn't take my old TV with me. I cover TV shows for my second job, and I'd like to be able to switch between cable programming and some sort of PC input. Any help is much appreciated!   You win?   Fireside cats.   This strikes me as a reskinned, better articulated version of the classic r/atheism facebook post. Harumph.   Fine, I added three unessential words to the conversation. To be fair though, you added nineteen. ;)   You're not *universally* wrong, but it's worth exploring how systemic socio-economic pressures shape perception of such opportunities, how effort toward "self-improvement" offers vastly different pay-offs depending on one's starting lot in life, and your own role in the cyclical, real-word social climate propagated through the trite dismissal of the disadvantaged as "lazy."   Their [interview with Kubrick](http://paulnahm.blogspot.com/2010/06/playboy-interview-wstanley-kubrick-in.html) is another great non-boob related Playboy article.   This was made as part of the A.V. Club's Parameter short film contest, details [here](http://www.avclub.com/parameter/info/).      tl;rd: i don't like all these i-gadgets, but that Jason Mraz fella is pretty good!   Yeah, the Onion/A.V. Club video player is pretty flaky. Here it is on the contest's [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BlynQBynQI feature=plcp) and on my personal [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/46409913).

I believe in plain speaking, foolishnesss. What does "look up Lisa Ferentz" mean? Her institute doesn't appear to offer a Master's program; are you saying that you know her personally, studied under her, or are actively pursuing a trauma certificate?  Regardless, it seems that we're talking past each other. You're describing a hypothesis, and I'm saying that there's no evidence for it. This is compounded by the testibly valid prevalence of false memory--something we both appear to acknowledge--to the extent that "recovered" memories, being indistinguishable to the subject from false ones, should bare no legal, medical or personal weight without objective corroborating evidence.   You know, like a masters level class...  What, is this a hypothetical? What is your Master's degree in? What department was this class in at what university? Have you taken this class? Who was the instructor, and what are his/her credentials?   With regard to your questions:  A) Compare the memory to the objective facts. *Conscious* memory has proven time and again to be surprisingly malleable; "repressed" memory has yielded no provable information to my knowledge. Citations to the contrary are welcome.  B) The brain is a magnificent organ, but it's understandably not great at gauging its own accuracy. Simple as that.  The description of repressed memories as things people "think they think" is reasonably accurate. We code our memories in fairly broad strokes, and unknowingly update the context and details in accordance with our changing understanding of events. When the friendly policeman or the authoritative Freudian suggests that the subject was abused by Satan, he/she slowly and unwittingly updates their memory to comply with their evolving perspective.   I don't know what "counseling class" means, but my understanding from five or six psychology courses over the past few years is that A) there's significantly more testable evidence for fabricated memories than there is for repression, and B) *if* repressed memories exist, they're not reliably distinguishable from fabrications, and are therefore not useful in any real sense.   [Here you go!](http://imgur.com/9ENJ9) I'm of much the same mind here; I'd like to balance out the hundred of roadside signs everywhere.               is there any answer in particular you were looking for? if I say "ur right no difference," will you give me an asker's best and 500 yahoo points?   Nearly every single Beatles song by either is [credited to both](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney).

What exactly is bad-ass about "[Daddy Sang Bass?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGUP8oc9Bgs)"   Bullshit. This is about consumer sovereignty: if a business engages in a practice you strongly oppose, then you organize a public boycott.The average American citizen doesn't have a ton of of political power, but we sure as fuck have this.  You say "opinion" like these are a bunch of riled up Packers fans or something. No. This is about sending a legal, moral message that bigotry doesn't pay.

Here's his [blog post](http://www.allegiancemusical.com/blog-entry/keep-myself-physically-strong-mentally-awake-and-morally-straight) on the matter.   I'm reading all of his comments in the spazziest, slurringest voice possible.   Jimmy Fallon has joined Justin Timberlake in my Small Club of People Who Are Much Cooler Than I Initially Thought.   I think you're right that the openness limits growth, and I think that that's completely fine. When "growth" trumps an open forum for provocative and edifying content, I'll leave.   There's a monumental difference between supporting the right and advocating the message, one which Hines establishes clearly and is following consistently. I don't think his actions make much sense in the context of what Reddit is as a whole, but it's ridiculous to claim he is in any way opposed to "the right to free speech."   Christopher Tin: How do you approach a new composition? Do you start with a melody, a general sound or instrumentation, a chord progression? How involved are project leads in the conception and shaping of your music?   If getting optioned in the studio system is the goal then I don't disagree, but you can follow whatever rules you want if you produce independently, which is fairly feasible these days. Study and criticism are hugely important to any creative endeavor, but breaking the rules doesn't have to mean "you're doing it wrong, rewrite" if you're willing to make a film yourself and good/lucky enough for it to make an impact on somebody. :)   That depends entirely on your goals as a writer and in life.   Chaplinesque   It delivers on the theme of hope, for one, as Batman's memory lives on. As for doubting validity elsewhere, Ra's Al Ghul's ghostly appearance is almost certainly a tortured fantasy.   One which didn't conflict with the clear, unambiguous depiction of him sitting in the cockpit four seconds before a nuclear explosion--I realize that people are saying it's a temporal shift or something, but that would be an unprecedented break from the film's established editing style and would be jarringly out of place. As it stands, Bruce either deliberately killed himself in spite of having fixed the autopilot, or is a god. Those last thirty seconds are an unfortunate bit of nonsense capping an otherwise incredible, amazing film.   With respect to your addition: coercing someone into driving drunk *is* morally wrong by the exact same standard, and one could easily imagine a situation in which the coercer is found liable for wrongful death or guilty of manslaughter, particularly if they're sober. While conceivable, however, the idea of a sober person coercing a drunk person to drive for their own selfish interests strikes me as so uncommon as to be negligible.   Because no one understands what we do in western society besides other philosophers.  That is a massive failure on philosophy's part in no uncertain terms.   This really drives home for me how old Redditors are.   Fair enough. I would still point out that Man *does* imply adulthood relative to Boy, which is the context Ardenfrost initially used it in. Also, I didn't mean to use the "pompous ass" label as an argument for or against any specific points, just as a friendly personal note on the tone of the discussion--that's why I separated it from my content-based arguments with "on a personal note." :)  	101
 What will the movie be about? The making of the game or using the world for an adventure movie?   Lets see how it plays out?  	2
 Thank you... And it's Summer. Please don't call me that.   	1
 App?   Main thing though is that my adjusted hourly rate needs to be as high as possible... i.e. I decided against law because I'd be working insane hours for the same salary I make now in 40 hours A week.  If I'm only in it for the money, and I'll pay whatever tuition it takes, what field of study should I go into for grad school to make a 6 figure income in the next 5 to 10 years almost assuredly, while working less than 50 hours a week?   I've already ruled out medicine and law due to time sinks and opportunity cost.  What about software engineering?  I'd also really like to live out west.      income based repayment.  A doctor would be on income based repayment if they were making 150k A year and had 300k In debt   You could make more than 30k just doing a blog, branding it properly and giving free legal advice (and supporting yourself off ad revenue).  Are you contractually prevented from doing that?   How long have you been there   What stops the recent grad from opening their own firm right away?  Also, if I wanted to work in Southern California would I expect to make a lot more starting due to cost of living, or are the salaries going to be similar no matter where you go?   If you are on the fence about going to law school you probably shouldn't.   I'm on the fence because I literally just started thinking about it as a possibility the other day.  I took some LSAT practice quizzes and did pretty well, drawing out the logical problems and solving them is second nature to me. Is there a timed one you recommend?     Great point   Sent you a PM. I'm also amused and depressed that people keep calling 48k high paid    No because my job isn't easily automated. At least not in 2050   We will own robots and take out a mortgage on them similar to how we have homes that take 30 years to pay off and most who didn't have special skills would run small robot staffing businesses (i.e. a family would own a robot) and then sell its services to a local business (i.e. mcdonalds) at a contracted rate.  instead of working a job the family would research new technologies repair and perform maintenance and save up to buy more robots.       Becsuse debt is eventually paid off.   Yea good point. I'd do that before commiting to this right now I'm evaluating it as an option.     I see. Thank you   To see if I like it or because I need the experience on an application?   Jesus... I thought it would be clerks making 35 to 40.  you're saying most lawyers make under 50k?   If I have a passion for anything it's researching, busting and exposing scams and unethical business practices.... specifically ones that fleece those looking for a job or trying to start a business.   I wasn't worried about the loan due to the income based repayment on the student loans. They only make you pay what you can afford. If i decidea to flip burgers instead of practice law I wouldn't pay a dime for 25 years but would end up with a Huge tax liability as the foregiveness Is taxed   Are all 100k+ lawyers working 60+ hours a week? My job is stressful now but over petty things like getting yelled at for making minor  mistakes on a three week project we had 1 day to finish, etc.   Can you give me an example of something that would stress a lawyer out?  I wouldn't necessarily mind long hours if I enjoyed the job.   That's a good point. I was throwing around software engineering as well but I think I'd find law more fulfilling. I'm not crazy about any job to be honest but based on my skillset (Was always off the charts in reading comprehension, analytics etc.. not so much math/science) and my love for argument aND logic I thought id check it out   .... that's really depressing then. I hate my job.   I thought new lawyers made 60+ To start?  I make over 60 when you include my other income but I'd still be making that if I quit as its Army/Rental income (full occupancy = about 75).  This would continue if I became a lawyer obviously so that decreases my OC. I might have to sell my house though if I moved too far away to maintain/landlord it.  My office job for what it pays is not worth the stress of being the whipping boy at the intersection of two dysfunctional departments.   I'm interested in law because I'm extremely analytical. I've always stood out well above others at any analytical task. I also want a job that will pay a 100k salary, even if it means going into a lot of debt to do so.  That being said, it seems like my best bet is to work my ass off to get into a T14. How difficult is that?  I think my cumulative UGPA was around 3.6 or something, if you include classes from the community college I transferred from to my 4 year. GPA is about 3.7 if you only look at the 4 year.  My degree is in Business Management, I also have about 6 years in the Army Reserve (still in, do I get some type of affirmative action bonus for military status)?  Assuming I got a good LSAT score, how hard is it to get into a T14? I'm not worried about scholarships, I will borrow the full bill if I got accepted as it seems T14 is a license to print money if you make it through.  I currently make about $48k at a crappy office job I got right after college. (I graduated 2 years ago). I have almost no student loan debt, so I'm wondering what my opportunity cost will be to go to law school, and what kind of salary I can expect starting if I graduate from a T14 and place middle of the road in the class.  EDIT: I live near U of M, and they appear to be a high ranking school. Would I have a shot there? What kind of salaries do they see starting? I could literally go there with free rent as I have family in the area.      	23
 "Fantastic at compiling fake job histories and references"   Someone posts the same question every other day it seems   Yes people can. Would you like to be bound by something you said 2-3 years ago?   Polaris would have nothing to do with it, but yeah, they made it into a makeshift studio. Mark hangs out there a lot.     No, none of that should take 20 minutes. And that's not even real editing, that's just overlaying text, and if that takes you 20 minutes, then you might want to consider a different field. Plus, if you use the same font and color every video (like the Grumps do) then you would have it saved as a preset, reducing a 2 minute job to 2 seconds. Keyframing text to fly in does not take a lot of time, though it would vary, it shouldn't take longer than a minute (and consider that it happens once per episode ON OCCASION)   With the format of editing Kevin is given, using primarily presets and an assembly-line style of churning out episodes, there is no reason he should have messed up any of the times people have counted (other than laziness) The only time he's even responded to people's criticisms is when it legitimately wasn't his fault (an episode being six minutes long)   just because "it's the internet" and it's what people have come to expect, doesn't mean it should be that way and that nobody should focus on improving it   If they brought in someone that was funny, I think it'd be better.  Plus, it's only Ross that's played with them, so you haven't seen them play off of anyone else   Remove the last one, then replace Kevin with Holly and I'd watch it   That would be the best series imaginable! This was one of my favorite PS2-era games, I forgot it existed, I'm gonna go look up and see if I can buy it somewhere! Thank you!  (And like everyone else saying this: It would HAVE to include Dan, so either him on Grumpcade or a series on GG)   I'm sure VentGrumps has a good list going. Mostly from what I've seen, people say "Kevin edit this in" and he doesn't   Every edit that he's missed or messed up on takes about a minute or two to complete.  Source: I'm an editor   oh yeah, I forgot about that.... this might suck then   I get it! :)   He's just a watered down Pewdiepie to me. Neither of them are funny in any way   Well, it's already been debunked quite a few times. Didn't even think it was still a fad. I'm amazed he's on it, considering that he seems to think of himself as educated   Or he could just be at their office again.  God, I hope this guy is never on GG   I don't think working on something with the Grumps and this project are mutually exclusive. It's not too distracting of a task to stop into the Grump office for two hours to be a guest on their show   he's not forced to do anything by a Multichannel Network, they'll just recommend certain collaborations and deals to him, likely providing him incentive to meet their requests.  He probably just hates Los Angeles, most people do, honestly.   But I agree with you, the Polaris collaborations are so pointless. Most people don't know the majority of their partners and most of them are kinda the same youtube channel, producing the same content under a different name. But I'm willing to bet this isn't a Polaris project, but a JonTron project that he requested Polaris's help in scheduling/contacting these other youtubers   look, dude, I understand it's just a joke, but I can't suspend my disbelief entirely!  **At his job?** Seriously? Jokes have to have SOME sort of basis in reality here   Dude, you gotta follow through with the setting and details: For example:  "In prison."   Hopefully this raises awareness enough for people to not put their fucking change collection in an unprotected container in a bathroom!   Only funny if it's not a parent or a relative. Just some guy   fire   probably some kind of "look at this neat trick I can do" video   That's some funny goat-related humor! :D   Everybody shut up! This post has given me an erection!   I think it'd be more likely that he ditches it for his two bands and other projects full time, along with moving to Cali. But perhaps there's also an available physicist job out there?   Lol, I had a webseries in mind that was a parody of Dungeons Dragons type stuff that would use this joke.  This is the only sub where I figured I wouldn't get downvoted for using it   I created the joke. I always thought it'd be funny if some actual racist people in a fantasy setting referred to them as "Shadow People"   It's just a joke, dude   lol, "I left mah lyrics at home, nigga!"   They're like people, but their skin color is the color of a shadow   Kinda funny. Could've been a little clearer   Did they sink?   Shadow People   Argonians   I actually want to hear the full song   He's black. Blacks (aka, the Shadow People) stereotypically abandon their offspring (mostly just the males though)   E.T... phone Health Insurance Agency...   I'm not enjoying it. It has some funny moments here and there, but I hate when they talk about the games, which they're doing a lot of here (unless the game is interesting, which Bloodborne does not appear to be.) I was actually thinking about getting it, till they started playing it and I realized how boring and repetitive it seems  Edit: Don't forget to downvote if you disagree with me, cumfaggots :)   Other than Dave Chappelle and Ron White, I don't like a single one of those or a single joke I've heard from anyof them   Write a youtube comment demanding that he come back.   Ya know what bugs ME? Steel Panther is in it. God, they suck   Then name me some funnier ones   (This is not confrontational, I'd actually like to discover some if you happen to name any I haven't heard)   lol, that story is what sold me on Jim Jefferies. i saw bits and pieces of his anti-religion stuff, but when I listened to the album that one was on, I realized he can be funny with any subject matter. His TV show is pretty good too   The funniest Stand-Up Comedian Alive Today   And a shapeshifter (He's actually Danny in his spare time)   Jon's getting a sex change operation    Beej 2: The *coming* of JonTron   As much as stoners like to THINK they are funny or interesting when they're high, they're not. I don't think a single one of them even smokes weed (excluding Danny, who used to) and despite Stout Train existing, none of those episodes were good at all. (And I LOVE alcohol, so I thought it would be interesting, at least if they discussed it)  I wouldn't mind a Drunk Grumps with just Dan and Arin, especially if it's Arin's first time being drunk, but it would have to be a chill, non-obnoxious episode and not act all stupid-drunk like Barry and Ross did. Something more along the lines of Toon Grumps would be interesting. (I mean, they can play games, but be FAR less into whatever is on the screen)  But stoned? Sorry, but I'd skip over an episode of them just laughing uncontrollably for no reason and talking about how hungry they are.   That would be the most horrible edition of Game Grumps in its entire history   Yep, played it last week. It's aged beautifully and I don't think a single Mario game has topped it since   Anyone know when he'll be on Sleepy Cast? I'm more excited for THAT   I know, right!? How can they not know shit about the dude who invented **Salad!?**   incorrect statement   Complaining can get annoying can't it?  Maybe now you understand why we don't like his bullshit with this game (An insanely easy game to master)   FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T STICK THAT THING IN MY ASSHOLE!!! PLEASE!! I'll sacrifice the lives of my children if you leave my anus intact!   Does this look RARE to you!?!? This steak should've been mooing a little when you set my plate down!   fuck, shoulda read the comments first. i posted the same thing   Et Tu, Brute? .....and vice versa?   This doesn't suck at all!   "Your performance in this position has been unsatisfactory and I'm afraid we'll have to let you go"   "Whatever! Come at me, SCRUB-LORD, I'm Ripped!"   The Second Endless Ocean is my personal favorite. They're both at the top of their comedic game in that one. That's the first episode of GG I've rewatched (haven't finished it yet though. Been meaning to start it where I left off)   lol, dude, Game Grumps doesn't have a parent company and you're reading WAAY too much into them going on vacation. Do you know how much Starbomb albums have sold? They can afford multiple vacations   2 is the only good one anyway. If he played the first one I can see why he hate it.  I'd like to see a Spyro game on Grumps. Danny seems to love dragons and shit like that, so that could stir up some passionate discussion   He should get one or two stars from each, then fight Bowser   My fellow Americans... this nation is------ **I'll be right back!**   "Well kids, sorry, but that's the seventh night in a row... you know what that means!"  "We have to eat the firstborn?"  "That's right... Cody, you get a 10-second head start. RUN!"    (Arin.... how do you **LIVE** with yourself!?!?)   If you watch Grumps for the gameplay, then something is seriously wrong with you.  However, it isn't entertaining if someone keeps making the same fuck-up over and over and over and over again and blames the game for it. Not because I'm watching the gameplay and I want to see progression, but because the conversation becomes stagnant, and it's just annoying to hear Arin ~~bitch about~~ er- "analyze" video-games.  Personally, I can't even stand when they talk about games at all, because for the most part, they aren't funny about it. But there were a few episodes recently where the fuck-ups actually were hilarious. Maybe they just need to learn to edit some moments out like that. If there are a bunch of fuck-ups that are funny, leave em in. If not, then just cut out that footage, and use the star selection screen as a point of transition, that way nobody knows anything was edited out  Just treat the show like a podcast that uses video-games to inspire discussion and it's entertaining. Otherwise, not so much. Arin and Danny are both super funny guys and I don't watch GG to see them beat games. It'd be better if they stopped playing them every time they weren't having fun   I can't stop laughing at this! :D   Ah, an illiteracy joke. Clever :)      Probably not that far from their real-life relationship   did this work?   Here's a copy of my resume... You'll find that I did some work for a little organization called "FoxNews..." so I have plenty of experience of instilling fear in the hearts and minds of Conservatives. I heard you have a lot of them down here.   And he's gonna find out... it's not easy being Satan's Toilet!  "Hey, Rob! Why do you always act like you're such hot shit!?"  "Ya know what they say.... You are what you eat!"   "I'm your Friendly Neighborhood Eight-Legged Arachnid Individual"   Can you believe we're in the EXACT room where Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy!? How ROMANTIC!   "Fuck It! I'll Write It Live!"  (confused look) "But, we can't read it! There's no words there!"   perhaps in real life? But no, Pewdiepie isn't to thank for this   Gravity  (I want to fly)   Some random guy named Jim from the 1500s.  Just to see the look on his face and how he reacts.  "I have to do WHAT? Why ME!?"   Breathe and Speak   It transforms into cotton candy   Browsing Reddit   Doesn't have Bad Controls  Doesn't have Bad Camera  Doesn't lack level variety or design  "Same Boss Fight Every Time" is a recurring Staple of the Mario series   I think it's just that it can't be only Dan and Arin. Then it would be a Game Grumps serial   It's being edited. It's an actual project, not just a Let's Play. These things take time. Perhaps Barry is the editor and perhaps it got delayed because he felt overwhelmed by *real* editing work. Perhaps it's just a really huge/long project and they don't want to start uploading until it's all done.    But Ross has answered posts like this multiple times with a resounding "yes, it is coming"   Literally the most plausible theory I've seen on the matter   and doing a bad impression of Jon   Little do we know, that comment at the bottom was by Chris himself   why are the characters drawn like talking penises?   Nice guys finish last  	93
 Besides looks, is there a actual purpose for long nails on men.   /r/karmaconspiricy - they did this on purpose all this time just for that once a year front page post.   In reservoir dogs the woman who gets pulled out of the car by kytell is the same woman in pulp fiction that gets hit by a stray bullet when Wallace tries to kill butch after the accident.       I moved in with her.   Nope, they had smaller guys and and the vehicles had a lot of spikes and attached missiles and stuff. Thanks for the suggestion though.   Had a few of these and can find the name. They were a series of battery operated alien war machines, maybe the size of my fist and smaller. There we two factions good (grey with red strip onvthe heads) and bad (green, more alien looking) the figures themselves were tiny and simple. Maybe the size of a push pin. The vehicle were the main toy. Any help will solve years of wonder. Thanks      When the Brits did the changing of the gaurd at buckingham palace they played the Star-Spangled Banner, it was one of the most touching things I've ever seen and I still get chills thinking about it. I'll post a vid when I get home.       Where's Virgil? He belongs at this.       Mozarts ghost?      This gives me hope for my missing cat.    Can i buy that for burning man?    On the same note, when peeing I see if I can cover the surface of water with the bubbles that form when I pee.   I see how long can resist scratching a facial itch.    ASTRONOMICAL!   My name.   Time crimes. French time travel thriller   Or coke.   Please someone make a flash animation of this.  	23
 2dank4me   Agreed   Im calling it. After all of the CLG, TIP, Liquid hype, it's going to end up being a C9 TSM final again   You can start going aggressive in the majority of match ups once you hit 4. It's just    level 2 and 3 that you really are weak in.   Just put them on a late game hypertank, plus a hypercarry ADC and mid laner. The game will make it to 60 minutes either way so might as well abuse it.   The other assassins got nerfed while she got a (small) buff. She also synergizes with the AOE all-in meta right now.   I really want to see him against sneaky. The flashy hard-carry ADC versus the consistently strong ADC who never has a bad game. Plus they're both arguably the best in their region so it would be even more hype.   I find it funny that fusion has a larger support staff then many LCS teams. I sure hope they make summer split, both the organization and the players deserve it.   TIP just communicates in basic English. Everyone there has good comprehension and reasonably strong speaking.  It's not like SHRC where they have a legitimate language barrier.   She offers a ton of pick potential, but with the Lissandra, Maokai, Ahri, etc. popularity she isn't really needed.   He also had a lot more success with support veigar in solo queue though then he is with naut.   Sneaky is still a world class ADC though. Second best in the west easily, and if forgiven is as easy to ban out as last weekend showed, you could make a case for sneaky being the best.   Gangplank is one of the most fun champs to play. You buy Trinity, Shiv, IE. One shot carries with your Q. Or you build full AP, and have your ult wreck the enemy team, you chunk with a lich bane Q, and have a bullshit 1khp heal. Or build pretty much anything and still have a use for it. Gangplank has easily the most versatile build in the game.   I had a game recently when I wanted to try twitch jungle, and I got matched up against a shaco. Long story short, my jungle became his, and every single time he killed somebody he would post :^) in all chat. Fuck Shaco.   She's had two consecutive nerfs now   As an Elise player, would you rather see her get small buffs until she's a strong yet not oppressive pick, or see her get a large buff, and become pick/ban tier again and subsequently nerfed into a weak state again? She's not even that bad right now tbh, I've seen her carry a ton of games recently.   Urgot actually just got a huge buff. He's still not the greatest champ, but he's actually at a half decent win rate now. (~48%?)   It's like people don't realize that riot is slowly trying to buff her back to usefulness, instead of giving her a massive buff in one patch and having oppressive spider bitch V2.0.   If c9 continues to struggle, I could honestly see the rumor of hai stepping down and incarnation joining c9 as a mid coming true. Meteos has shown he knows how to be a half-decent shotcaller, so it might actually work out well.    Lemon is doing fine IMO, he was one of c9s only bright points last week   C9, Gambit, WE, and YFW won a previous IEM tournament.   GE, CJ, TSM, and SK were chosen for their performance in their regions.    The players that leave from EU just want to be able to play in a competitive region   If you have watched any LPL before this, it's quite obvious that this version of WE is nothing like the 12th place team that left China.   According to recent events   NACNKRTWBREU   The team that won had 2 substitute players, never won a match, and was the last placed team in China. They were expected to lose every game. They just beat what was thought the best in the world to go to the finals, against the NA team TSM   I'd argue it is, this blows Alliance and Kabum out of the water.   I'd argue that Apollo has been the biggest surprise this year. Who honestly expected the Apollo/Adrian bot lane to be as successful as it is? They're no rush hour or sneaky/lemon, but they are consistently doing what is needed of them, and doing it well.   To be fair, it's basically the same as benching them, except they get at least some LCS experience out of it.   Remember when they both lost to korea?   Inb4 Froggen gets relegated and joins cloud9.   I'd argue that YFW would be a mid-tier team in NA. They're on the same level as gravity or team8 imo. Cloud nine still should have won that though.   TW is still a better region then BR though.   At least cloud nine isn't in danger of being relegated   I'd argue that he is only slightly weaker then he was pre-nerf. Weaker pre-11, around the same 11-16, and slightly stronger 16+. He'll end up sitting at ~45% like beforehand I believe.   It's funny cause c9 used to be famous for a godlike pick ban phase   Sneaky is a pretty damn good ADC though. He's no forg1ven, but he's still one of the best western ADC's. I'd argue top 3.   Cloud 9 is known for their mid-late game shotcalling, while SK is known for their early game snowballs. If anything, SK resembles TSM, just with more of a bot lane focus instead of a mid lane focus.   Lemon's picks on Morgana was one of the only good things C9 did today, and Sneaky played quite well himself. Sure, C9 had a stronger early lane, but they were still beating them pretty convincingly until the disaster began.   Exactly. GE is a much stronger team,  I agree 100%. But just compare cloud 9 today to the cloud 9 at worlds. Uncalculated, sloppy play. I understand what they were going for, but the execution was terrible.   Deciding to drastically change their entire playstyle against the best team in the world is a pretty stupid choice. They could have easily played it like they did SSB at worlds, and they mightve just had a chance. Rumble had a early first blood, Sneaky/Lemon were dominating lane, Hai was in trouble, but could just play it as safe as he could. Instead they try stupid plays, that just get capitalized on over and over and led to the stomp that this was.   It was more C9 playing godawful then anything.  Balls was tilting before the game even started, (like chasing a lissandra under her tower with her ult up? Really?), Hai picked a terrible matchup and got snowballed on, Meteos made way too many risky plays that backfired, Lemon honestly didnt play too badly, and Sneaky honestly isn't to blame at all.   I found that promoting a melee minion gives it a fast push, as well as giving you a lot of CS due to the massive DPS buff it has (it will last hit the most). The downside is the melee minion will die the fastest because of it being the front of the wave. It also shreds turrets (just make sure it doesn't draw the turret aggro right off the bat)  A ranged minion will slow push the wave, and last the longest of all the minions. IMO it's best if you want to pressure somewhere like baron and apply pressure to the turret at bot with a wave building up.  A cannon minion is a mixture of the two, it won't push as fast as a melee minion, but it won't last as long as a ranged minion (due to getting focused down by turrets and other minions) . It's by far the best to upgrade if you have baron buff though. It gets focused down first by turrets which is a downside the majority of the time, unless you need to hold turret aggro for a long time (as it is the tankiest, but actually has the lowest dps increase of upgraded minions)  A good rule of thumb is melee = dps+free gold, ranged = survivability + slow push, cannon = tankiest + baron siege   I found that promoting a melee minion gives it a fast push, as well as giving you a lot of CS due to the massive DPS buff it has.

She has some of the fastest clears in the game, and scales into a massive dps tank like mundo for late game.   How are you reasonably going to fit 40%cdr on Kassadin without making his damage nonexistent?   He has a two second riftwalk CD, and arguably the worst base damages in the game on a AP carry. If you actually take the time to get 40% cdr, you will do nonexistent damage late game. The only cdr item that synergizes with him in the slightest is a IBG, and I would prefer a lich bane 90% of the time.   It's 5am pacific time   I never knew XWX was such a troll until this ama   Just shove her in. She has absolutely pitiful waveclear and she is very bad at last hitting under turret.   I like how you call c9s record abysmal when they're currently third in the LCS.   Agree with everything you say except the lack of damage, especially compared to Maokai. Damage is the one thing mundo isnt lacking. Mundo has the largest attack steroid in the game, and a 25% health nuke (with a high base damage on low health targets),  plus his burn does some consistent DPS.   To be fair, irelia has more early game sustain, free tenacity, and higher base stats then Hecarim, making her tankier with only a Triforce. Late game Hecarim is tankier and has higher sustain though.   Pretty much the only person who prioritizes him right now is TIP Rush   You can go trinity force into tank and be a unpeelable AD bruiser... Hold my beer, I actually sort of want to try this.   Like I mean XWX has better mechanics, better csing, etc. but bjerg is better at trading, roaming, and all of that   I think XWX is more skilled then bjergsen, but bjergsen is the better mid laner, if that makes any sense to you.   So much potential   The one champion where it's okay to feed to win, and XWX doesn't die once. What a god.   Apollo deserves his spot IMO. He's really stepped it up.   I see plenty to support IMO,    They have arguably the most skilled mid laner in NA, the jungler with the most potential, a very strong top laner with tons of experience, and a good bot lane that is completely exceeding their expectations. If they get their communication down pat I can see them being the best team in NA.   Give Keith more credit then that. He isn't some solo-queue trash player. He may not be a mechanical God like piglet, or a consistent rock like Sneaky, but he's still a strong ADC that does what the team needs of him.   They have a great record with Keith, and an abysmal record with Piglet. It doesn't matter how good someone can 'potentially' be, if the team obviously doesn't perform with them.   Balls is  good on Maokai IMO   At the moment, I would say Trundle. He's got clear strengths (Tank killer, strong duelist), and clear weaknesses ( CC wrecks him, kited easy in open areas, low burst). He's strong when tanks and split pushing  are strong, and weak when they aren't. He has his niche in the meta, and that's a good thing. (This is also why I don't like his buffs on the PBE, he's going to be oppressive when tanks come back into the meta.   Veigar was literally first pick or ban in Korea and China for around 3 weeks.    They actually looked somewhat like a team with Cloud. Like, they still weren't very good, but they didn't feel like they were relegation-worthy. With Azingy it just feels like a solo queue game.   Benching Cloudnyugen for Azingy was such a mistake   Meteos is actually mechanically strong. Watch any of his Nidalee/Lee games for proof. But even then, mechanics isn't everything. In just general jungling, Meteos is the best in NA, and could be argued as the best in the west (I'd give the edge to Diamondprox tbh)   IMO it's RyuHai, MeteosLoulex, Oddamme=Balls, SneakyHjarnen, and Lemon=Kasing.  This isn't including the other things the players might bring to the team, like Hai/Kasings shot calling, Lemons P/B, etc.   Reminds me of C9 during their prime. Three strong laners giving them an early lead, and then great shot calling and objective control to extend that lead. Then they can easily clean up teamfights with their big gold lead and decent teamfight   Wait, Ryu's face changes?   I'd argue that H2k is the C9 of EU. Game styles are so similar, and both have amazing shotcallers. Main difference is RyuHai mechanically, and MeteosLoulex.   I could just see it. Worlds finals, game 5. Right before the game starts, Nick Allen enters the stage and announces a rule change. Game 5's are now blind pick. Ryu and Faker lock in Zed, and history is made.    The only one I can see was overstaying at dragon, which cost them 2 kills and a tower. Still a near flawless game though.   They didn't have any vision there, the call to try to get top for fifth drag wasn't terrible IMO, just UOL played it well by leaving graves to solo it, and Wickd got caught.   It's also only 2/3s the mana cost   Thunk thunk THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK "your team has destroyed a turret"   They go TP ignite because Hecarim is a very snowbally champion, with high kill potential, and flash isn't uber necessary on him compared to other champions. He has no real flash combo's, and has a fairly strong escape in his ult if he gets caught.   Shaco is designed to have a weaker late game, due to having such an oppressive early game in strong hands.   I love nocturne into him. Out trade his Q with your passive early on, all-in him level 2/3, GG. If you fall behind you can farm easy with your Q, and if you get ahead you can become opressive. Post-6 you can shove him in and pressure the rest of the map.   To be fair, old Nid had a longer range, and a much lower cooldown. Blitzes hook is a much longer cooldown. Plus he has to be selective on who to hook. If you hook the enemy Amumu or Malphite into your team you'll going to have a bad time.   When it comes down to it, the extra 50 range won't mean anything when compared to the extra mobilty from this update. Its literally half the size of teemos model difference, but a massive mana cost reduction and an extra cool down off.    Calling it right now. Kassadin will become a meta pick again if these changes go through.  I'd honestly argue that he will be stronger then before at top tiers, but his win rate will stay in the shitter for low elo   They had piglet scrim mornings and Keith scrim afternoons   Let's say GE tigers loses game one to C9, beats Yoe wolves, and then loses to SK. They would be out of the tournament, and rightfully so. They finished group stage 1/2, while both c9 and SK won 2 games each. Would GE still be the best team in the world? Most likely. Were they the best team at that point and time? No.    To be fair, C9 has more or less returned to their form. If you ignore the first two weeks which they were playing terrible, they're 7/1. I agree totally that GE is the better team, and the odds are definitely in their favor, but it's entirely possible that C9 does get a win, even if it ends up being more of a cheese. It's just a best of 1, anything can happen. Look at Alliance vs Kabum for example.   He's definitely viable. He's my highest winrate champion at the moment. He does have his weaknesses though, which is sub-par burst, little pre-6 pressure, and high CD ultimate. If you play him to his strengths though (high DPS, longest gap closer in the game, vision loss ultimate, near impossible to peel with a banshees)  you will have success.   Because he's a mid-tier mid laner on a top tier team. They've got a top 3 western ADC, arguably the best western jungler, a top tier NA top, and strong support. Hai isn't terrible per say, but he is the weakest link, and when he plays bad, he brings the entire team down with him due to him being the shotcaller.   Give sneaky Kalista, and lemon Morgana while you're at it as well.   Okay so you gave hai, sneaky, lemon, and balls all one of their main comfort picks, and give meteos nidalee. Yeah, this game was over in champ select.   Nasus is at his strongest ~25 minutes in the game when he has 500 stacks and no squishy has a any armor items yet. Later on the adcs will have a QSS, and he'll get kited for days. He doesn't fall off in duels though.   I sure hope Syndra comes back in the meta after the recent buffs. He was great on her   He's got a massive move speed boost, plus botrk is a core item on him. There's no walking away from him. I agree that his E is inconsistent, but pretty much the only adc that can escape from it without flashing is Tristana, who cockblocks pretty much all divers. I'm not saying he's tier one, but he definitely shouldn't be classified as garbage tier.   Agreed, taking E second is a mistake as nocturne jungle. I personally prefer going krugs first though, as I run a lot of attack speed in my runes, plus the attack speed from the W lets me negate a lot of damage from the camps.    Noc top can outtrade him level 1 with his passive, all in him level 2-3, and shove him in for the rest of the lane. At 6 you can pressure the map with your ult, and later on you out scale him hard in both being a godlike split pusher, better duelist, and much better teamfighter.    I don't understand why everyone says nocturne is weak. People say the first clear hurts, but I do a full first clear every single game with no problem. He's near impossible to peel in team fights, and he scales really well. He's absolutely godlike at making picks if you have decent vision up. The amount of games where we were way behind, and I catch somebody out with my ult, and turn the game around is absurd. I think too many people try to play him he's a Jarvan/Vi/Rek'sai and then think he's a terrible champion when they don't play him to his strengths   I get your point, but this post is sarcastic   Heimerdinger won't see the pro scene, except for possibly being a niche counterpick. You can just put him in a 1v2 lane and negate his early game if he's played top, or pick Xerath/Syndra/any other long range Mage against him mid. He thrives on the disorganization of solo queue, but in the pro scene junglers won't dive him and give him a double.   That's why I speficified early clear. On a buff with ~3k health, the traps do 300 bonus damage early on, as well as rooting the buff.    Because they didn't buff her. They shifted her power from the %health (which is massive on the first clear),  to her burst. Basically, she won't clear as well early on, and the poke from her traps will hurt a lot less. But in return, they solidify her assassin role by giving her higher burst on her E.  	101

Like the beat change in the original  Edit: After listening to Excuse Me, I know understand. Comment retracted.    I see exactly what you're saying, but I don't think the term "Greatest" is what we should use to describe the guy who transcended the game culturally. I think the Greatest Player should only account for on court play. I think MJ undeniably has had the biggest impact on the game because of all the things you said, but the greatest player should only deal with what happens on the court. Completely agree Jordans impact was bigger though   The rings argument is so flawed in a team game. It takes an entire organization to win a championship, not one player. That is what I think Lebrons greatest ability is, to completely flip a franchise around. No other player in history, simply by their individual presence, could turn a team into a Finals threat. If you put Lebron on the Knicks or Magic, they're a threat immediately. No one else can do that   Also, I'm tired of uninformed sports fans continuing to say MJ had the Flu. He did not. He had food poisoning. Which is just as awful to deal with during a basketball game, but nonetheless, let's be historically accurate and call it what it actually is    "cant close" clutch 3 in the corner "cant close" drives by your whole team for the finish "pussy" puts you on a poster for the rest of your life.     But for real it was probably just a cold towel   I got you bruh http://i.imgur.com/qh56qoH.jpg   After reading all these comments, I've come to the conclusion that no one will ever fully respect Lebron for the incredible things he's done in this league. The man can never do anything right. Get over your irrational hate for the guy. Dude needed a breather, hit the deck and got it. If you've never done that after a hard fought game then you've never busted your ass to complete exhaustion before.

She 100% would kill you   except she's annoying and could kill you   this one will always win   This is from 2011. So, catch up bud   Cross-generational comparisons are worthless. But Lebron has Jordan in a specific stat line. So he was better at doing that one thing that Jordan was. That's all I'm saying.    I say you give the bottom 5 records the same percentage chance to win that too pick. Say, 11%. Then give the other 9 less, split into 3's. For example, 6 through 8 would have an 8% chance, 9 to 11 has 5%, and 12-14 have 2%. You can change that into whatever increments you want but that's just the first i thought of that equalled 100. Anyway, you have more even chances across the board, it doesn't eliminate tanking all together, but it doesn't incentivize being the worse team in the league either. I also think you draw for every drafting position, not just top 3. I dont know how logical this is, but I think it helps reduce the need to tank for some teams.    Cant argue with a guy who refuses to recognize when a great player achieves something great. MJ homers will always be MJ homers. No convincing them otherwise.    that's a testament to how great Lebron is. not to be used as s crutch for Jordan or an asterisk on Lebrons advantages statistically.     He started out of high school but that doesnt effect years and seasons played..? I'm just not seeing the point you're trying to make here.    just standing there, holding her tongue tryna talk this thitthhhss?   I KNOW LEBRON IS DOING DUMB THINGS RIGHT NOW, BUT THAT WAS A FOUL. THESE REFS JUST HATE HIM   HE CANT. FUCKING. CATCH. GET SOME FUCKIN HANDS. I LOVE HIM, BUT SHIT   the bench   ceremonial FUCK TEAGUE is in order   Kyrie git hammered in the lane on two consecutive drives. no call. TT got mauled getting offensive boards on multiple occasions. no call. my statement is justified.    V   We're gettin screwed by the refs and it's blatant and it's tied. JR SWISH IS THE MUHFUCKIN MAN HE DONT NEED NO HELP *Drake voice   Dont count on that   I cant believe these refs.    Gotta stop going under the screen on him. too many open looks   NO THATS NOT A FOUL. THATS A DAMN SEAL   Kyrie needs to settle down. Trying to do a little too much   My thoughts exactly. I could totally see a remix later on with him on the track   A Roman Empire era Jedi   "Back once again, chillin in the back of the lac with a pass or the gin..." gets me so hyped every damn time   Honestly just want the Lakers to lose their pick. That's all I care about tonight   Same for me with The Prestige! Loved it when I saw it but went in knowing absolutely nothing about it.    Sanctum. Great movie   That Logic track was on point too   everybody put ur hands up high   agreed   Really wanted a Drake verse tho   IBeenStackinUpLikeImFundRaisin   What about adding teams in Seattle and Pittsburg? Send the Pitt team East and Seattle West? Obviously makes sense for Seattle but I think it makes a lot of sense for Pittsburg too. Historic sports town, only sport absent being basketball outside of the collegiate level. I don't know. Just a thought   Can't look at season number because half the year we didn't even have our team assembled. You have to look at how these teams have played recently.    the Kyrie, Shump, Lebron, TT, Moz lineup has the best defensive rating in the playoffs so far. And the cavs as a whole have the best offense in the playoffs so far. i feel like that's all i need to say   the bulls would beat the Hawks in this series right now. so two games to them, one to the Hawks, makes sense.    There isn't a single defender on the Wizards that is as good as Lebron, JR, and Shump. Hell, even Delly can defend full-court just to put pressure on the ball. So I don't see back door cuts and off ball screens being an issue simply because we have better overall defenders on our squad. Kyrie will have issues though and I fully acknowledge that. I guess I'm just assuming Delly gets more minutes than usual this series? I don't know. That's a big question mark. But as far as TT, Moz, and JJ go on defending Horford and Paul, I just don't see many issues coming up that can't be effectively game-planned for. TT can guard either of them on the post or outside. JJ can take Paul if he is playing more outside with another big in the middle and Moz can definitely hold his own against Horford. Call me optimistic, but I just don't see anything that the Hawks do and think that we don't have a counter for it.    Wasn't trivializing. That's just how you talk about basketball. You state what the opposing team does offensively, you tell why you think your team can either, guard against it well and why or, why they cannot. So get outta here with your douchebag approach to responding to my opinion of how the series will go. You can respond with your opinion without being an ass. But bruh, pin downs are easy to guard. Off ball screens are easy to guard when you have smart and quick athletes like JR and Shump on the wings. And, like I said, TT and Moz can handle the post actions because they are both great defenders. And I dont give a shit how much film Carrol watches the next few days, he isn't going to magically get bigger and stronger and quicker and D up Lebron effectively. And if you think the Hawks can beat a Lebron James led basketball team 3 out of 6 times to force a game 7, you're delusional.    He can't handle Lebron in the post. Not worried   Thank you, Captain Obvious   all black is a nice choice boss. best shoes out right now imo   hahaha stop.           just, stop.    I disagree with the "offense that won't let up" idea simply because their offense is so unbelievably easy to guard. It's a ton of off-ball screens and pin-downs, back door cuts, and high-low action with the posts. TT and Moz can handle all of the post actions and they've proven that. JR and Shump are more than capable at staying with Korver and Schroeder/Carrol/ whatever other wings they play. Kyrie and Delly can more than handle Teague and Schroeder PG wise and Lebron can guard whoever the hell he wants and lock em down. Defensively, I'm not worried. I just don't want Lebron to keep hoisting jumpers up all series if they aren't falling. However, there isn't a Jimmy Butler caliber defender on that team so I don't know how many jumpers he is going to want to take anyway. Cavs in 5 is my prediction. Remember, the Hawks almost lost to the Nets in a playoff series. hahahhahaha   Felt like every game was an anomaly. Lebron was out or the hawks shot lights out or we shot lights out... dont really know what to expect. but i expect a win  	102
       Per his UFC Q A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHFkLlpodBQ x-yt-ts=1422579428 x-yt-cl=85114404#t=669   Silva v. Maia Kimbo v Houston Alexander            Great read, thanks!       Food wise, do they just eat lean proteins?   Are they intaking nothing but water and a few calories?      It's bullshit that the UFC keeps its best stars on the bench for so long. 2 fights a year? Jeebus. Why schedule the Also/McGregor fight for July when it could just as easily be May?         First thought.. Burt's on Twitter?!         Haven't heard much of AvA.. how does it conflict with how he's living his life now?   And yet, the Jones/DC theatrics really pumped people up. What makes this theoretical type of theatric so intriguing is that it's rare.. especially coming from a guy like Also.  How great when Anderson Silva put on the mask when he faced off against Vitor? Can't MMA purists have a little bit of fun and enjoy the show?!   How friggin pumped would that make you for the fight?         Great read.. so much for being open.   How'd you meet these folks? What made them so amazing?   brilliant.. we've all been there!               You cold for that one brah         Frankie Edgar comment ftw   And unless I'm mistaken, am I correct in saying that there's nothing intrinsically amazing about the Harold, aside from the fact that Del Close came up with it? which is to say, its used not because its the best/ideal form for new groups, but just because that's the tradition?   Another theory: Perhaps this is no longer the case with the new IO in chicago, but at the old building.. there were so many teams and just 2 stages that some teams performed 1-2 times a month.. which goes back to your point that teams didn't work together enough to hone a good opening skillset.   I suppose its rare, having seen innumerable harold shows, that I see a great opening. Perhaps I'm jaded, but just food for thought I guess :)   Time and time again, I see talented groups of improvisers put crowds to sleep because they're beholden to the Harold form, as if it's the be all end all. The avante garde openings often leave theatre goers scratching their heads and doesn't seem to INSPIRE the performers in the way that it's intended.           Good one.. but did anyone at the time realize just how f'n good Silva was and overmatched Leben was?   If Mcgregor faces Aldo, that's a huge jump in competition.. is it the biggest jump we've seen in MMA yet (brock lesnar aside)                  that clinch destroyed franklin.. weidman loosened it up with one shot to the dome      I had heard rumors of recreational drug usage, but assumed MJ was the extent of it               and the "pathetic" barb was because Jay talked to the cops? You'd think if Adnan were really innocent he'd be ranting and raving about how Jay is a complete liar, no?      You think I'm just gonna let you poke me jon?   This just keeps getting better. Weigh-ins are gonna be INSANE         Lost my hat   Or maybe, just maybe, he thinks the legal case is weak.. genuinely.      Translation? Let's get it on!      Does he have mythical wrestling strength or nothing outside the norm in the LHW division?      Two fights per champion seems light... Why not make it 3? It does have a big roster it needs to develop but the development doesn't seem to ever come from any of the bevy of fight cards they put on..  If they had the top 20 guys fight more frequently, I think that'd be better than having the top 50 guys fight twice a year   Per a UFC special that just ran on TV. Thats basically 42 fights a month. Too much, too little?         lol, good call   Sort of makes things even more bizarre      If so, wouldn't it be smart to combine mega cards for a 1 million PPV buy instead of, say, getting 450,000 buys each?            A reasonable guy who knows his current place and is fighting to get to the top. Unlike some of these fighters who would bitch and moan for not getting more prominent placement.            do podiatrists take xrays?      worded it poorly.. meant to say that unproven fighters earning 20/20 is a bit excessive   That's fair, but isn't there a difference between proving yourself 2-4 years in college and perhaps just 2-4 fights on the regional fight circuit?  I'm all for fighters making more money, but to me, the argument is more persuasive when talking about fighters who have been with the UFC for a while and serve a purpose -- while not champions, they are solid performers, gatekeepers, or even gatekeepers to gatekeepers.  20/20 for first time UFC'ers with marginal experience seems like a lot to ask, no?  Tennis players/golf players don't make $$ unless they win.. is that analogy too far off?   But NFL teams make so much more money than the UFC. Also NFL players have proven themselves in college.  At a certain point its just economics. The UFC pays out a percentage to their fighters and a disproportionate amount goes to a) fighters who win b) fighters who can generate viewership and c) fighters who perform well in the cage i.e performance of the night.  Is that really that unfair?     Am I nuts for thinking an unproven fighter on an undercard that brings in no revenue or fans has a right to earn 20/20 ? Just seems like a union would be more sensible than a lawsuit alleging that the UFC is a monopoly.. Look at what happened to affliction and their ridiculous payouts. Folded. Fighters are contractors who can determine how much they make based on performance. It's high risk high reward. That's the nature of the business                              I remember a handful of people meekly suggesting that Johnny Hendricks was gonna take it to GSP.. GSP of course won but the consensus was that you were a moron for thinking Hendricks would even win 1 round against GSP            Nate knows how to smile?!         "Dos Santos said he has been able to survive because of sponsors who pay him monthly."  Wow, didn't realize sponsors did that.       I get that Dana White could give an F about askren, but doesn't joe silva carry any pull here?!      Who are the 4 fighters mentioned under Dolce who tested positive for PEDs?      3k a week?! from which podcast?       Schaub only making 32 grand   I went to high school with the guy in the Hangover.. Justin Bartha.. the guy who they are looking for..  Was mostly a nice guy, tiny bit of an ego. shorter than you can imagine.. He once got super pissed off at me in gym class playing basketball when i blocked the shit out of one of his shots.. i was a nerd who was even shorter than him so hence the anger.  Supposedly, i heard from a friend, that in HS he once said that if he goes to hollywood and struggles and doesn't get his first commercial/break until he's 80, it would still be worth it.  Guess you can say he had a goal and was dead serious about it   Dustin hazellet vs. tamdan mccory... amazing finish         Supposedly Hendricks walks around at 215??   On UFC embedded, Hendricks kept saying it was going well, that he's "on the Dolce diet" and that he's just 12 pounds over..... Here's hopin he makes it, but doesn't look too good for Dolce         Any love for Sherdog's Jordan Breen?                  Not sure how encouraging this is... will Anderson now be fighting in white reebok shorts? Oh the horror!                              Looks like he's raising the roof or saying "gimme cake!"   are there flying toasters on the back ?         That's valid. Perhaps I'm missing something, but what I found utterly bizarre is that if you watch the interview, she's talking about how Uber would have had cars posted up at her house, her kids lives in danger.. It all seemed purposefully blown way out of proportion due to her visceral hatred of all things Uber. The "they're coming after my family" reasoning seemed delusional or purposefully misleading.     What made the b5 so unexpectedly brilliant?      Agreed. It's like a bizarre press tour where something that is objectively bad has been amplified as if it's the most evil thing humanity has seen. Bunch of self-important Silicon Valley pricks on both sides of the equation, I think            Family of 4? Single guy... what demographic of folks will be waiting in line to get the model x?     	150

 "Too big to fail"   That sounds too reasonable for this sub. You need to flair it up with some hyperbole to get the attention of naive undergrad students to understand and follow your message.   This is patently false. There have been cooler periods through out history with CO2 over 700ppm.   Actually, In 15 years there will be less climate truthers. Polls show that this new younger generation is more skeptical about the alarmist claims from the AGW clique than the previous generation.  	4

[Spoiler](#s "Bigby mentions in his first meeting with Faith(which was before meeting Nerissa) was that he feels like she had a sense of familiarity to her.

 Is it available in anything other than a shitty cam yet?   I'm a pretty pessimistic asshole.  I watch it sometimes just to remind myself to be nice to other people.  I'm 30.  I also grew up with Flash-based animation, so I like their art style.  No jerking it to horses, no dressing up in outfits, no annoying other people with it, no "brony" t-shirts, etc.  I do occasionally listen to MLP-based music though like Cupcakes, Trixie the Pony Troll, etc.  But people don't generally make fun of me for watching A:TLA, Korra, Kill La Kill, Ghost in the Shell, Futurama, Fullmetal Alchemist, etc.  Most are surprised that I watch MLP at all.   [](/abchaos "YAY SECRET PONY THREAD!!!")[](/ajlie)Scary.   Scumbag elderly driver:  Drives 40mph in a 50mph zone...  Continues to do 40mph through the school zone...   It is likely your jerk/accel setting.  Increase jerk to 5-10mm/s.  It looks like perhaps your printer is getting to the edge of vertices, and slowing down (and filament continuing to pressure-equalize) causing this effect.  Those are _really_ low jerk and accel settings.  Sure, they help but what also helps is making sure that your hot end isn't wobbly because what is happening is the inertia is transferred to the nozzle as you make quick jerks around a part.

The laptop was promptly switched to Linux.   Honestly, some of the AT T prepaid MVNOs aren't bad.

 I only recline my seat if the person in front of me has reclined theirs. If I couldn't recline mine because the guy behind me used that thing I'd be pretty pissed/uncomfortable.

Higher speeds can be attained if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also freeflying).

It seems like the only people who were upset by it were white people.  Where did you get this from? The article doesn't mention the race of the people who were upset, and the woman who is defending the lecture is just described as "married to an African American," meaning she's probably white herself.

Thank you and keep the videos coming.   Emergency fund = cash.   You have to piece meal it all together. jQuery and Knockout are libraries, not frameworks.  Knockout gives you two-way data binding.  jQuery gives you a x-browser abstraction for events, DOM manipulation, ajax and animation (high level overview, of course).   No back support = not designed for sitting.   This is why you keep receipts.   In theory, the benefits of everything that comes with either of those frameworks (MVC/structure, two-way data binding, SPA/routing, testing, documentation, etc).  I'm pretty adamant that right now is just the wrong time for us to do a new app in Angular given what we have to support.   We've actually used Knockout on a mobile app here, though it's a bit of a pseudo SPA.  I think what Knockout does, it does well, but it obviously is very limited in what it does do.   We have a couple developers here who are throwing around the idea of rewriting an ~ 2 year old app in Angular. It's currently a JSF (Java Server Faces app). I don't think Angular 1.2 is a very good idea at this time and I'd like to hear opinions/justifications by those much smarter than myself.  **We have to support IE8** (we dropped IE7 last year, so not very long ago) and it looks like this would mean we'd need to use Angular 1.2. This is a minor version behind the *current* release of 1.3.  I've read the Angular team plans 1.5 - 2 years of support for Angular *1.3*, but we most likely wouldn't be able to update due to needing IE8 support.  This, to me means we'd essentially be hitting production with a deprecated framework.  As for when we could drop IE8 support and have IE9 as a baseline, that's pretty tough to say.  If 1.3 is supported for 2 years, I would guess it might be possible to upgrade any 1.2 app to 1.3 in 2 years, but then we're back to upgrading to a deprecated framework.  Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x is also a big unknown at this time.  I've read that is an unknown upgrade path as well as the angular team plans to work on an upgrade path.  With the fundamental changes in 2.x, it seems any 1.x to 2.x upgrade will be quite a bit of rewriting, if not mostly a full rewrite.  So I could see it being yet another rewrite in a couple years, which seems a bit ludicrous.  We've never built anything in Angular 1.x, either.  I've done a personal project in 1.3 but that was just to go from reading about Angular to actually doing *something* in it.  This is not saying much as I read and play with a lot of stuff just to go from a 50,000 foot view to a 25,000 foot view.  I've looked at Ember as well, which looks like we'd be topping out (with IE8 support) at [Ember 1.13. They also claim an upgrade to 2.x will be "relatively simple" when you can drop IE8 support](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/45#issuecomment-93009469).  Ember looks like a better choice to me at this particular point in time, but I'd love to hear what you guys would do if you were in enterprise land, needed to support IE8 (for the next couple of years at least) and wanted to build some type of modern MV* app.     Portlanders.

Ajax (what $.load() uses) needs to be run via a webserver (not the file protocol) and you'll want to be loading files from the same domain, or else you'll need to look into CORS (cross origin resource sharing), which is a separate set of issues if you don't control all the domains in play.   I frequently see this from our back-end java and sometimes .NET guys, so I'm assuming the authors of that guideline came to the front-end via the back-end, i.e., they're your typical computer science guys.    Sure, just setup a partial html page that other pages can consume and use jquery's load method.      $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html" );  If you only want to load part of the page-to-load-into-parent.html page:      $( "#elem-on-parent-page" ).load( "path/to/page-to-load-into-parent.html #container" );  Where #container is just the parent element you want to consume. When you have a space after the url, it acts as a jquery selector so the above is loading page-to-load-into-parent.html then filtering it down to just the element with the id of container.

IMO, you're making the assumption other opinions are invalid because you don't share them.  In the end, what you need is data supporting your rant. Do this repeatedly and she'll start to trust your suggestions/direction as it's backed by something tangible.   Why don't you try implementing her suggestions/assumptions and actually test them in production to see how they play out?   Hello from Portland.  If you end up going and have a smartphone, can you post up a video of your walkthrough as well as a general review of your experience? I'd love to see this as they've piqued my interest as well.   Pick up a hooker.   Your best bet to determine if an old poured bar is fake is to melt it down.  If it turns out to be legit, you should re-pour it.  I have Photoshop and can help you make a mold.   $.19 over spot.  Wonder if the bars are the style pictured or a variety. I know Englehard has several styles of 100 oz, APMEX usually has several varieties in-stock, though certainly not at this price.      Yes, [there's one here](http://imgur.com/gYOww7z).   I've been using a local recruiter very successfully since 2008 (been placed 2x). Last time I looked around myself, [indeed](http://www.indeed.com/) seemed to be the best thing out there. Granted, it's been years since I checked it out but I still hear it brought up in casual conversation from other devs every now and then.  I never found any decent leads/gigs on Craiglist, but again, it's been years since I've looked.               You should start with ES3 because that's going to be what you're going to be maintaining.   What should you do when you've completed a basic Java course, and can you get a job with Java?    I have a 10 oz Rarities bar, didn't pay too much of a premium for it.  Your 5 oz would probably fetch $100, IMO. That would be a "retail" price, i.e., to someone like the folks here. If you were to sell it to some type of retail establishment, you'd probably get $15-20 less, I'd guess.  I don't know if the 5 oz is particularly rare. I'd guess not so much but can't really speak with any authority. You don't see the Rarities bars much, but I don't think they're that collectible outside of being an older type of silver bar.      As long as people have their air conditioning, cable tv and walmart, nothing.   I can understand this point-of-view.  I'm a big proponent of financial history, though, especially money and the institution of banking.  Don't get me started on The Federal Reserve. I won't even ask people about the 3 central banks that came before it in the United States.  Hey, look over there, Andrew Jackson, what a guy.   Not a ton of details, but I'd recommend checking out [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).  It's a MVVM library (not a framework), does pretty much one thing (2-way data binding), can be easily incorporated into any project and has a low learning curve.  I'd also recommend using knockout's mapping plugin which takes care of mapping your json data to your view model.   That's a Morgan Dollar, named after its designer George Morgan.  If you show that to most people, they will have no idea what you're showing them.  It's a bit of a shame there is very little knowledge of common US financial history.   2 oz Fine Silver - One Amero      $18-$20 for 3-6 months is way below market.  You're going to burn through that for lunch in 3 days.  I will pay you $180-$200 for 3-6 months.  You're still going to run out of money to eat, but don't come crying to me with your problems during the 3rd week, we have a contract.   Be sure to [check out the demo](http://pixelscommander.com/polygon/htmlgl/demo/filters.html#.VR1tSZOPyF4), crazy stuff.   Forget about launch, I get this feeling when walking into a project kick-off meetings with our marketing/UX team.   I'd definitely look for the "about us" or "our team" page that has the most plaid. If they have Sasquatch in the firm name, perhaps with a logo of bigfoot riding a fixie, that would be the ultimate trifecta.   Under "breakdown of time", what's the difference between "companies" and "projects"? Assuming this is billable -vs- non-billable time?      Canary looks very interesting, thanks much for the reply.  It's a shame they don't offer a discount for multiple cameras/units. http://canary.is is definitely worth checking out if anyone else is interested in this topic.  There's also https://getpiper.com/ which you can pair with open/close sensors for doors/windows (which is cool and something Canary doesn't offer), but I've read some people have issues getting those to work/sync with Piper.         Would like to look into adding some home security where ideally I can monitor via my Android phone. I don't know what's really out there nowadays but figured a lot you guys do and are possibly using it or can recommend what to look into.  BTW, I don't have a static IP address at home, but could probably get one. I go through Frontier. I don't have a land line (phone).  Basically looking for the cheapest way to add some security/monitoring at home.    Would like to look into adding some home security where ideally I can monitor via my Android phone.

Also more important, IMO, are error messages on the request level, but that's more geared towards apps.   Looking at the silver price over the past 5 years, I think I might go crazy later this month.   I think that's the best I've ever seen for a JM.  Monarch has .59 cents over spot on their 100oz bars, but not on ever make.   I'll try again from home tonight, might be the corporate firewall I'm behind.   The Maggregor download button doesn't seem to work in Firefox, is there a FTP mirror somewhere?   But [a lot of the jobs suck](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/business/economy/recovery-has-created-far-more-low-wage-jobs-than-better-paid-ones.html) and wages aren't growing.  Also, [labor participation rate is lowest since 1978](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000/) (change the from date up top to 1970).  Sure, you have a growing aging population, but I'm sure a lot of people are just giving up.  Do you really believe the [official unemployment numbers?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louisefron/2014/08/20/tackling-the-real-unemployment-rate-12-6/)   I'm digging on setting up my preferences to disallow custom subreddit styling.   Not in London, but just yesterday I received an email from my recruiter for a "front end developer" titled/position that in the requirements also indicated full stack, 7-years of python, java and .NET (all of them, not one of them) plus dev ops responsiblities.

I bailed on your article because of this.   "Can't load a stylesheet properly"   By reading this commentyou agree to pay me $500 and provide naked photos of your sister.   Enforcing that will be another question.

So let's watch what happens this week. We're at $1,189.40 as I type this on Monday eve.  I'm not finding any silver deals from them, though I'm just looking very quickly, filtering down to bullion--silver--uncertified--1 oz.  I see they have a tube of ASEs for $411 but not much of a deal.  JMB has them for $400 shipped at the moment. Silver spot is $16.82 at the moment so if I'm missing any APMEX silver deals, please post it up for the record.      [Good](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/76/f7/c6/76f7c6bc37625d26afac2fcd59f080a9.jpg).

You'd be much better off, IMO, if you would have spent that $ on semi-numismatics.  With those generic APMEX bars, you're directly tied to spot price.  Take a look at the price of silver since 2011 - it has crashed.  What if you would have been doing your research then? Would you still have jumped in with the doom and gloom dollar collapse scenario that proliferates from the silver pumpers? Do you really think you'll find yourself in a silver barter situation?  For someone who has done a "ton of research" and "endless research", yet makes a large first purchase of generics, I'd say your research is failing you. I'm not bashing generics as I have generics, but you really need to be aware of what you're buying. Diversification can be fun, but that doesn't mean it will yield you the greatest gains.  I would strongly suggest researching and getting into semi-numismatics where your silver won't be tied to the spot price of silver, which may not have bottomed yet.  Welcome aboard the silver train.  	200
 I came here thinking someone has to have it. We must get our hands on that video!   I don't play anymore but personally I always liked the 2D graphics beyond the stuttering.

I live in Virginia Beach but this would be really cool for some of my condominium listings.   Dwa dwa, I win.   I need a boat...   Submit an offer is greyed out until I make an agreement with the player. I accidentally put my game on vacation mode at the very beginning and the CPU signed many players for much less then what they demanded.   It's annoying because if I ask for a response and it's low they raise the demanding price. Just out of curiosity I kept asking for a response and a player demanding 2 million got up to 12 million dollars. I simmed ahead 2 weeks and tried to resign him and he was still asking for 12 million even though he was only demanding 2.  Thank you    Edit: Whoaaaa, I was not expecting gold for such a stupid comment but thank you!!   Yurp   Very frustrating but I ended up pulling up OOTP on finder and was able to delete it from there. I went back to the App Store and redownloaded the game. Surprisingly (or maybe not if you're more advanced in Mac's/Safe Files/etc) my saved games were still present.   Figured it out, but thank you!   First off I know this is my fault. I know I'm an idiot, and I know I'm not worthy. Ok now that I have made my peace this is what I did last night.   I own OOTP, purchased VIA APP STORE on my macbook pro. I downloaded patch #6 from the official forums. I did not read the disclaimer not to do this. I downloaded and added to my apps. Now I can't delete the game from my apps list and it thinks I'm using a demo version of the game.

 For me, it's Somebody by Natalie La Rose feat. Jeremih      I generally just use rush and dark impale for mobbing. What level is your Dark Knight?   LOL wtf! In Scania they're selling for around 7-10k each. Even in bulk no one will buy them for 50k thats just absurd.   Why do you have your berserker skills on your keyboard? I'd honestly just keep all the 4th job Dark Knight stuff.. all the old skills are pretty much useless except for rush.   Leveling was pretty bad back then but I honestly don't care too much about that. The game itself was more enjoyable because of the tight knit community. People also didn't care too much about damage and mostly focused on enjoying the game and socializing.    This is so incredibly true. Nexon in the recent years seems to be a bit more money hungry although in the past few months it's been getting better.

Many years ago I was on a road trip with my parent's friends and we were stuck in a small car. Since it was a really hot and humid summer day, opening the windows only seemed to let more hot air in.

The remaining 4 hours of the car ride was not fun!      Chris Christie. Honestly, if you're last name is Christie why the fuck would you name your child Chris?   You don't remember?

I would freak the fuck out and spend the rest of my evening watching Teletubbies.   I have a classmate and friend that I play LoL with all the time. Sometimes he would host the Skype calls and everytime we try to do a match, his internet would always go out for no apparent reason. Since then, I preferred to host the calls with my superior Optimum Online. :D  	56

 The track *Kid A* from Kid A should not have been 5 minutes long, though. Two minutes? Perfect. I'd love the album.     I'd probably love it more if they replaced that track altogether with I Might Be Wrong (which was recorded in the same sessions)   I would adore In Rainbows if they left out Videotape. It's suicide-inducingly depressing and bleak.   [*Jigsaw Falling Into Place*](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU) - Radiohead   *every CW show*   She's unrecognisable in Game of Thrones.

They changed her name to Yara (because apparently Asha sounds too similar to Osha) and cast her as [differently](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130611131832/gameofthrones/images/3/34/Yara_Greyjoy_3X10.png) as possible (dirty blonde?).

Stephen King's Wizard and Glass is amazing. Best Dark Tower book IMO.   Yeah, I mean, it's not like glasses are cute or anything, right? Total turn-off /s   Apparently Eric Clapton's son was quite an accomplished author. I heard he did more than fifty stories before he died.   When you get around to it, watch them in the order IV V II III VI. It's called the Machete Cut. Completely leaves out Episode I (1999).   Almost everything you said was answered...   *What was it that was so wrong with me? What about me?!*   It's also a Mass Effect quote.   Someone else might have gotten it wrong.   She's not even from New Zealand, her husband (the guy next to her) is.   Still, for me, the worst one is the one where you attack the fucking bots before they reach the hideout. How was that on Hero?   I thought it was hell on Earth trying to complete it on Normal, ffs.   I might be wrong. It's a fun read either way, no matter whether you read into the silly little references like I did. Go for it - it's a good book.   The Paiks would not have let Jin keep her. He's supposed to be dead, he's probably going to assume a false identity, and Mr Paik would probably put a hit out on him anyway. I think it was justified.   From my own personal experiences, you're probably onto something.   The Wind Through the Keyhole makes no sense. If Roland is telling the story as it's written, then all of the references within it to Sombra and the MiB are total retcons. That book made me so mad.   Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman have been trying to get it financed for years and years. Warner, Universal and MRC all passed on it.   I'd make *The Gunslinger x Wizard and Glass*.     First 15 minutes - Tull.     Next 100 minutes - The Gunslinger flashback + Wizard and Glass flashback.     Next 35 minutes - The rest of The Gunslinger and the beginning of Drawing, with the injury + discovering Door One.   So everyone dies?   I can still respect Lost as my absolute favourite TV show of all time because its highs are so fucking gloriously high, but Season 6 was a total mess.     Don't get me wrong : *I love the pseudo-religious bullshit*. The flash-sideways and the ending, IMO, were the perfect redemption for such a muddled-up final season. The Temple was a disappointment, Widmore was completely wasted, Ilana is one of the most misused TV characters of all time in my opinion, Sayid's death (if you think about it) is pretty racist, and Ben's character becomes unrecognisably apologetic and meek.      I love the ending, but oh boy does the show take some pathetic missteps to get there.   [Radiohead - *Let Down*](https://youtu.be/-Z_NvVMUcG8). You'll get it when you listen.   With Hewitt. Harry's conception.   For me, it was the Remastered edition on Grounded difficulty. 60fps and higher stakes gave it this extra layer of realism that really broke me.     Most cinematic game I've ever played (yes, Ubisoft, even with dat framerate).   I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF BENFORD GOT OUT OF THE BUILDING BEFORE IT BLEW UP, GODDAMNIT.   What did they say?   It stars Uncle fucking Bully. I wouldn't expect less.   Isn't *Airplane!* PG? Explicit boob shot in that flick, bouncing around, centred and in the foreground.   What song do you identify as something revelatory? How did it make you feel?     Get real with me, here.   *You're a bisexual wizard, Harry.*   I will second that recommendation for Radiohead's  [OK Computer](https://youtu.be/w4GsSCfOeAk).    Username checks out.   The **Teletubbies** episode with [the fucking Bear and the fucking Lion](https://youtu.be/ASnh7_zSimU). First time as a child when I was truly terrified.     Edit: Read the comments section of the video to get an idea of the effect this shit had  on people.   *"Hey, Scott!"*          *"I'm Steve; Scott's dead."*   Palmerston North, New Zealand. *John Cleese* said that if someone's contemplating suicide but not quite sure yet, a trip to Palmy should settle it.   You'll end up really good at the game. My advice is, if you go for it, don't play Vanguard. I can imagine that being the worst possible class considering Charge constantly takes you out of cover. I'd probably suggest Infiltrator (though I played Soldier, which was probably a bad idea).   ***You get my father down here RIGHT NOW, and if I'm drunker than he is, you can fire me!***     Knowing the context with the twist at the end makes this so much more sad.   *Hold me closer, tiny dancer...*   Furious 7 will make *a lot* of money, no doubt.     That means nothing against the sequel to the third-highest grossing movie of all time,   It's 4:20, Saturday afternoon here in New Zealand. Too early to say.   Up until recently when it came on, it was the track [Kid A](https://youtu.be/7RwvZSfLUXM) by Radiohead.     It made me depressed for the rest of the day; scariest thing I've ever heard. Fuck that song. Deleted it straight away.   [I know, right? Great song.](http://youtu.be/rDAjFstQrTk)   Christian.     Not for any religious reasons at all, but I named my first Commander Shepard that after the character from **LOST**, and it's absolutely stuck as a name I really dig.   And if you're in New Zealand, you can watch it all on Lightbox.   [You mean Rick Grimes?](http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/B9BNAB1oilsl.jpg)   Not anymore.   The entirety of Mass Effect 2 on Insanity. I spent over two hours on the first combat checkpoint on the derelict Collector ship trap. Completing that game on Insanity with every squad member loyal and alive on my second ever playthrough of the game, and immediately seeing my first platinum trophy ever - best gaming experience ever.          All of that frustration and anger totally paid off. I suck at hard games, but it can be rewarding/satisfying as fuck.   YOU AAAAAAALLL EVERYBODY     and Dharma Lady   Enjoyment and anxiety   But Tali...   The first three seasons and the last three seasons are like two separate shows. The Season 3 finale is the perfect ending to the show as it's set up in the pilot, tying up as many character arcs as possible and doing away with the flashback structure which had been ingrained in the show since the very beginning.          And then the sequel show begins - the final three seasons, during which the show went batshit fucking insane and lost tons of viewers. Not me, though - I loved it.   Episode 17: The Garden of Forking Paths, the one where Gibbons captures Demitri and forces Benford to race against time to save him - this was probably their best episode. Ironically, it was the first episode they aired after the show officially cancelled.   Massive LOST fan here. I disagree about the pilot. On rewatch, in comparison to the style and structure of the rest of the series, the pilot is super clumsy. It may have some eerie moments and tense scenes, but the dialogue and the directing are awkward and uneven. *Guys...where are we?* - I hate this line so much.     Get to episodes like The Brig, Ab Aeterno, The Man Behind the Curtain, Through the Looking Glass, Jughead, Flashes Before Your Eyes or The Shape of Things to Come and the pilot is hilariously outmatched.   IMAX   This had better be international eventually. NZ PS+ shouldn't be the handicapped little brother of the big US PS+. We've been on the same level of value this whole time. Don't change that now, Sony.   Not quite my tempo.   Oh...*OH*...**OOHHH**   Is Cliff Curtis playing a Mori character, or are they pretending he's Mexican like in Training Day?   The exact episode he becomes sympathetic is episode 4.09. He went too fucking far by not coming out of the goddamn house. That whole "She's not my daughter" scene kills me.   It's about someone trying to try as hard as humanly possible to avoid seeing themselves as they really are. I loved it.   Tali, no contest.   **WE HAVE TO GO BAAAAACK!**   Juliet causes the pregnancy issues by detonating the bomb, giving the Others a reason to need a fertility expert in the first place. Faraday sets his entire life in motion by giving Eloise his notebook, which is the source of all of her wisdom. Locke was the one who told Richard to find him as a child, Richard believed him because Locke was a time traveller and in effect the reason the Others believed John was special is because John told them he was, giving MiB the perfect opportunity to kill Jacob. Ben helped get everyone on the plane, which gets Sayid back to the 70s where he shoots kid Ben, leading the Others to take him in and make him the person he becomes.   Username doesn't exactly check out.   *"Why do you find it so hard to believe?"*     *"Why do you find it so easy?!"*     ***"IT'S NEVER BEEN EASY!"***   IIRC that's Season 2 Episode 19, S.O.S.   **Lost**: The entirety of Season 5 is spent having its most of its characters cause their own misery. The whole thing is one big paradox without any rhyme or reason other than to cause itself. Faraday, Juliet, Locke, Ben (present and past) end up causing some of the most important events in their own lives believing they're doing work of the utmost importance, and instead setting off events which may end humanity.     People in general looked past this, but it's fascinating how deep the irony goes.   Hey, not always.   Used to be obsessed with CoD Zombies   I wouldn't have thought of blind people to be big fans of eyes.   The flashback structure is so iconic for Lost, that it felt weird to watch another show do the same thing.   The post is called Watch Chappie, but the post was tagged as *Recommendation*.   *Go and see this movie or don't* isn't that groundbreaking a point. This post recommends a film, so we're supposed to take that as it is - someone we've never met adding a positive opinion to a divisive movie. That's worth something. There's no need to shoot it down. You'd be better off saying why you didn't like it, but you didn't give off the vibe you'd seen the thing.   The difference is that Chappie seems like it's trying to make statements about the nature of humanity, whereas John Wick is trying to be a simple fun action romp.    Could have been longer. Yes, it was very well polished and virtually bugless. But we could have had more enemy types, side missions more akin to inFamous 2, a longer, better story more comparable to the two previous games etc.     Rushed job was a terrible choice of words on my part.   Both are well regarded. It's pretty much impossible for either to be underrated.   Second Son was a rushed job. I'd love a legitimate new inFamous game without such a weak, short story and filler side content.   He should do *The Dark Tower*. Get Ron Howard and Akiva "Winter's Tale" Goldsman the hell away from DT and let the best Stephen King director of all time work his magic.   The Russos are directing Infinity War, so unless Whedon is doing Captain Marvel, he's free.   *You* referring to the other guy, not me :)   It's not confirmed he'll be in SS, just BvS. Could you link the interview?      (Even if I'm wrong, I still like reading)   It's most likely because the showrunners were part of the Lost writing staff for 5 years, and let's hope that's it.   The island all of Lost (bar two scenes) was filmed on.   Which also spells cock   Whiplash: *"Upswinging!"*   The story was sooooooo dull. Killed any tension for me.   Is there a Vita trophy list?   I still can't get over them calling a character Dick Rider.   :(   No one asked the obvious: *"How long is the movie?"*   *We have to go back, Kate! WE HAVE TO GO BACK!*     Me: **ASDFGHJKLPOIUYTREWQMZNXBCVwhatthefuck**   [Fucking really, OP?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2xi7pe/what_phrase_makes_you_cringe_every_time_you_hear/)   I think you might be getting the wrong idea from that phrase.

I have been always pondering about the movie for a long time now. This is what I always thought about the movie :   The country in which the movie takes place is a mixture of both the United States and Germany. Sometimes, the movie hints at Germany and sometimes at the United States. Let's start of with the main character - Sam Lowry. He is a normal guy. Who wants a normal job. He loves old music. But, Is always unable to listen due to the government poking their nose in his affairs (Stasi reference maybe ?? ). Then, there is the infamous Flying scene where Lowry is trying to save a damsel in distress. But, he is constantly being stopped by forces such as huge walls (Berlin Wall maybe ?? ). There is a scene where a bomb explodes in the restaurant but the people seem to be going on casually after it explodes showing how they have been brain-washed by the government to believe that everything is okay (Censorship and prohibition of free-speech.)   Sam Tuttle (De Niro) represents whistle blowers and the group of resistance who always oppose the Government. He always points the common people in the right direction.  Could someone tell me if I am interpreting this the wrong way ?? How did you feel after watching the movie ?? What do you think the movie is about ??         was recis ?   "You shee Johnny Boy, If you shaven't watched al of Chris Nolan's movies liek I did, you are a digusthting pleb. Nothing more to say now. Bugger Ohff."

 You tucked me in, stopped my tossing and turning.      Thanks. Descendents are rad. I love them   Thank you, I appreciate the compliment.   Thank You!   I may not have the highest self esteem, but i do like showing people what i look like behind my account. These are from that past month. I try to smile in my picture, and as you can see im a huge music guy. Don't mind my shitty face and smile.  http://imgur.com/a/eYn1j   Just be true to yourself. I suffer from multiple anxiety disorders and extreme depression so i know for a fact drugs would fuck me up.   Im 16 but i am straight edge. It may he stereotypical for someone my age to be, but i never saw the point in doing shit. I much rather keep myself clean and not end up like my brother and all the people i saw get destroyed from drugs and alcohol. I dont know man its just not for me. All my friends do stuff and its kinda lame, but hey its my life.    Congrats, Im happy to hear that. I hope everything goes well!   Sorry for just replying to all of you're original comments. I did not know how to go about this. Im awfully sorry for the inconvenience.   I thought i should update everyone on here.  We are back together. Not necessarily a relationship but more than friends. She does not like saying its a relationship since she feels like it complicates things. She feels as if that makes it more of a responsibility than two people being together, and that stuff like spending time together and such is more forced than a choice. I agree with her (we are basically in a relationship though). I am taking her out Valentine's day snd we've been happy being back together.  I am still struggling with my depression but trying to hide it more and more. Its difficult but i much rather not explain how i feel to anyone. I may stop seeing my therapist and try to focus on work and school more. I believe that if i just distract myself i can forget about it for a little. I've just been struggling trying to gain motivation, trying to raise my self esteem, fight my anxiety, and keep myself alive. Ive been sleeping and eating less and less but i think ill be okay. I just need to pick myself back up before i let myself slip any farther.   I thank all of you for replying to my post and offering help. Your words have helped me and gave me the insight that i needed to get through this. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I wish all of you the best.  If anyone ever wants to talk just inbox me. Thank you all. Goodnight and have a wonderful morning! (its 10:33pm where i live.

Ill probably be up for a while die to insomnia and my dumb over thinking paranoid mind)   I know exactly how you feel when it comes to this. There is so much pressure to get good grades. If i get a low grade i feel dumb and worthless. I hate that i have to constantly stress myself out to get an A on all my tests. I fear for the future and what might happen if my grades start to slip.   The concert was at Cattivo in pittsburgh. You may be thinking of anothet one. It's still an amazing line up though. Rozwell kid slayed. They were so much fun. Plus like The world is played an amazing set!   We can all hold on if we try hard enough. Its hard to think poorly of her especially when she does not present any hate towards me.    Thank you for your reply. Your words do help. I understand what you are saying. I just hope we can fet baco together after she gets her GED. I miss her so much and im just trying to get through the day without thinking about her all day.   Rozwell Kid slays! They are so much fun and TWIABP just plays such an amazing show. Jnasty from posture and the grizzly is a rad dude.   Thank you. You seem like a very strong person if you were able to make it past this. I hope things look up for you too my friend.    It's just so hard imagining that i will never be able to kiss her, hold her, or any of that stuff again. I hope that she will come back. I'll admit i cried while she held me and I couldn't control myself from ranting to her. She basically said that she needs to just do some stuff first, but it's so hard trying not to miss her and think she won't come back.    She's just the girl of my dreams and is so extremely important to me. I've been dealing with depression for most my life. It's so hard to wake up in the morning. I just have such an overwhelming sense of dread. I just can't stop crying. It hurts so much. I'm a fucking mess right now. Thank you so much for your words. I means a lot.    I am so damn depressed, and recently my best friend became my girlfriend. After a month of dating she broke up with me because she needed to work on things like getting her G.E.D and stuff. My only issue is that I Still Fucking Love Her and this overwhelming sense of dread is killing me. I miss her so much. I have been so damn depressed the past couple years. I'm struggling so badly with trying to not cut myself or kill myself. It's so hard to not try to do these things. I feel like i deserve it. I hate this. I miss her. I miss us. I wish i wasn't so depressed. I'm sorry for this mess of a post. I don't want to wake up in the morning.    The world is a beautiful place, the hotelier, posture and the grizzly, Rozwell Kid, and brightside in PA. Cant remember venue name.   1. Tatsuhiro Sat from Welcome to the N.H.K 2. TK from angel beats! 3. saito hiraga from the familiar of zero.   Sorority noise - Forgettable   Same. I think it may be better in like a day or so i hope.   I have actually been having the same issue. I havent seen any update or way of fixing it.   	28
 Speed. I was 6. My entire family loved (and still loves) that movie, we'd watch it all the time.   There was a MAP communication like four or five months ago that said we're supposed to mark food down 50% up to 90 days after expiration.   Either way, though, this company is super wasteful. We're not allowed to sell the food, take it home, give it away, donate it... we just have to throw it in the trash. It's ridiculous.   I'm in WA too, and my store is hiring, especially for Easy Tech.    Came here to say this. That grilled cheese he makes for his kid in the beginning... my god. Watched that movie once and I still think about that sandwich all the time.   Like someone else said, Napoleon Dynamite. I never appreciated it when I was younger. Also HATED The Departed when I first saw it, I wanted to leave the theater. But I must have been a total moron back then because now I love it.   A Few Good Men   Primal Fear.   No one truly knows what's going to go down. I'm sick of hearing these bogus threats on every conference call. Maybe Staples is going to keep some Office Depot locations because the people that don't like Staples like Office Depot. Maybe they're going to keep every single location of both stores and turn them all into Staples Depot Max.  NO ONE knows, especially us. The merger hasn't even been approved yet. I don't like Staples, I've worked for the company for too long for too little, but these scare tactics are just stupid.   I watch Veep and every time someone goes into their supply closet it's full of Staples products. Pens, paper, folders, everything.  Same with Chasing Life, but they put like a post it on every Staples logo, but it's still clearly our stuff.  This is how you know you've worked at Staples too long.   Target - all black shoes, $8. And I'm sure they have pants, too. Dress code is a pain in the ass. I despise telling people they have to tuck in their shirt, so much that I don't really care unless their ass is hanging out. But someone shows up in yoga pants... that's another situation.   Interstellar (2) The Avengers (3) Inception (4) [boyfriend I were obsessed about the different theories so every time a new one came out we saw it again] The Dark Knight (2) Star Trek (3)    The last half hour of so of Speed drives me INSANE. I love Speed, I have seen it literally 50 times. I just cannot stand the whole subway part.  I know they had to resolve it but god it's awful.   My boyfriend I have two american eskimos (SUPER hairy and fluffy dogs). We recently got one of those Himalayan salt lamps and it really seems to have reduced the dust and the air seems clearer.  	13
 I overthink my responses. You summed it up for me well. I "vote with [my] dollar." Thanks for understanding.   I am not. I dislike Papa John's after he criticized the Affordable Healthcare Act and said he had to pass on the costs to the customer. I understand he's running a business and I wouldn't mind paying the additional (I think it was) 10 cents, but it was his attitude. It's unfortunate because he has some decent pizza. But that's me. I hope everyone here can understand that I speak with my money. I don't mind helping someone out, but I'm going to do with the best intentions possible and not feed into a money-hungry asshole (again, my opinion).   I've requested pizza before, so now it's time to give back. All I ask of the user who receives the gift is to please pass it on when possible. I want to this to become the "Pay It Forward" of pizza, but I'd prefer not to die at the end please. And if that spoils the movie for you, watch it anyway.   SO, in order to receive said pizza, please post a link to the song that plays at the end of "Pay It Forward" (before credits). Please have the title of the song and the name of the artist/s. First one to do so, wins.  I will be providing a gift card to the winner via Pizza Hut or Dominos (Sorry, I do not support Papa John's; hope that's understandable). Good luck and have fun! Try not to cry so hard when you watch/listen to the song.  Edit: WINNER, WINNER; Chicken dinner. u/Askanner won because he linked the song with both the title AND artist first. Having some technical difficulties as this is my first time gifting. I feel horrid because I may have done something wrong when purchasing the egiftcard. But I promise, I will make this happen!   It is higher. I'm just saying that it can equally affect someone of a heterosexual identity as harshly.    I'd disagree as there were two teenage boys who killed themselves back in 2012-2013 merely for being accused of possibly being gay.   Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Spoilers below!  Season 1: MOTW, very awkward effects, odd stories, but interesting ending that has Buffy accepting her destiny as the "Chosen One". Best episode - "Prophecy Girl" (Buffy vs The Master!)  Season 2: Embracing the "demons are metaphors for your real-life problems" motif by making Angel become the "abusive, asshole boyfriend" WITH SWORDS! Best episode - "Becoming Part 1   2" (Slayer vs Angel, YAAAAAS!)  Season 3: New Slayer Faith teaches Buffy that she can do whatever she wants because SUPER STRENGTH, but that makes her morally wrong. Also, germophobic Mayor turns into an overgrown slug/snake thing. Eeek! Favorite Episode - "Graduation Day 1   2" (Slayer vs Slayer, gasp!) AND "Gingerbread" (Witches! Oh my!)  Season 4: The weakest in my opinion. Buffy goes to college and meets Frankenstein and the government-funded tactical team that made him. Best episode - "Hush" (Creepiest monster in the entire series plus great use of miming in an episode!)  Season 5: Pretty much the best in my opinion. Buffy suddenly has a little sister that wasn't around for 4 seasons. Sounds ridiculous right? Well, there also happens to be a God that puts the Slayer in her place a few times. Willow becomes a bad ass witch! Favorite line in the entire series: "Glory. You're not the brightest god in the heavens, are you?" You may ask why this is my favorite season since it sounds so ridiculous; this season wraps up a huge amount of foreshadowing, plus it was the most adult Buffy ever had to be thanks to Dawn (her sister). While Dawn almost adds that whole Cousin Oliver complex, she brings a dynamic to the show that was lost after Buffy graduated Sunnydale High. Plus, Glory is an AMAZING villain for the series. Best episodes - (there's a few) "Buffy vs Dracula" (I said it, DRACULA!), "Family" (Tara is a Scooby!), "Checkpoint" (Buffy takes on The Watcher's Council and learns Glory is a God), "The Body" (Buffy's mommy dies, *sad face*), "Spiral" (Buffy does everything in her power to protect Dawn, but even that's not enough), and "The Gift" (Buffy takes on Glory and sacrifices herself to save the day).  Season 6: Buffy goes dark. Lots of adult themes here - rape; infidelity; addiction; murder; breaking up; theft; etc. A lot of people judge this season for going so extreme. Buffy needed it after the year she had in Season 5. It was basically the only time she got to do what she wanted, but there are consequences. Best Episode - (Again, a few) "Once More with Feeling" (THE MUSICAL! Such a good episode); "Normal Again" (This entire show might be a dream!?); Not so much "Seeing Red" except the ending but more "Villains" (Dark Willow, FUCK YEAH!) and "Two to Go" (More Dark Willow goodness).   Last but not least, Season 7: Buffy goes maternal. Kinda. This basically ties up the loose ends. It brings back villains from the past thanks to an interesting main villain along with its henchman. We dive into topics the other seasons haven't grappled with such as identity. Plus, we get the mini-Slayers! Best Episode - "Lessons" (a great throwback episode in my opinion to the early days); "Beneath You" (Spike has a soul!?); "Same Time, Same Place" (Willow deals with being the Big Bad from last season); "Him" (such an old-fashioned funny Buffy episode; "Showtime" (Buffy vs Primordial Vampire!?; "Potential" (Is Dawn a Slayer!?); "Get It Done" (How the First Slayer was made); "Dirty Girls" (Faith returns!); "Touched" (Spike gives Buffy a HUGE pep talk); and "Chosen" (Buffy and Faith aren't the only Slayers anymore).    The past week and a half has been depressing to say the least. My roommates moved out on me, leaving me with $760/mo rental agreement that still has 9 months. I have a week to gather funds for rent this Friday. Further, my landlord lost my dog and he's nowhere to be found after countless days of searching, going door to door, and posting fliers. My internet is out, no furniture except my bed, and I have no friends nor family to turn to. Lastly, the $40 I had for groceries this week has gone missing. Feeling very bitter and alone. Something to eat for the next two to three days would be appreciated beyond words. Sorry for another sad-sack story. It just so happens to be my story.    I've firsthand seen them go outside their subreddit/s to harass people. So you're wrong.   Will there be voice work?   Then you're not reading through all the comments unfortunately.   I want comment that people have constantly tore Ginger down throughout this competition because she's playing the game. People attack her for being a big girl, as if that's something new. Big people's weight is the first thing to be used against them, but it isn't new nor creative. But last night, Violet's [BACK ROLLS](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZbyH-tiiCdc/UwJAMLosBJI/AAAAAAAAL8g/OUVQsJFjB_M/s1600/backrolls1.gif) looked worse than anything Ginger has ever shown us and I'm including her b-acne. Yet NO ONE has said a thing about it because God forbid we tarnish Violet's reputation as the "winner" around here. There's some T for ya.   I'm 27. I currently live with my 19 year old niece and her fiance, and I find this incredibly sad. I can't even be grownup enough to keep a job, work for my degree, or keep my car running to allow myself a chance at living on my own. Instead, I have to live with my niece, and this is her first time living outside of her parents' house. I work now, but it's part-time. My vehicle is making strange noises. Meanwhile, I have no friends nearby to do anything. I usually am broke or too scared to go out and meet people. Plus, nobody is interested in me dating-wise. I'm gay and overweight, which is a huge no-no in both society and the gay community. There are guys interested in me but I am too intense, usually act desperate. I'm thinking of killing myself. I probably won't, most likely won't, but I'm so tired from the stress and worry and feeling worthless.    The question of what? That Present Bobby isn't gay? The only evidence that he's straight is his relationships. It's funny people say his lack of long term relationships doesn't mean he's gay, yet when the writers state that his homosexuality is a precursor to his failed relationships... That's just poor writing.    Yes. I can see this as a reverse "outting", BUT we obviously see how things end up since Present Bobby lives a life of not knowing.    That's completely true. Unfortunately, this isn't the case.  	15
 Tanks alot...   Thanks for responding! When i used version 4 of both crack and update it worked... Haven't had any crashes, works really well! Your tutorial helped a lot, Thanks again :) Now that i know that it runs on my pc i'm going to buy it.    All 3 the cracked files are in the right map and i did everything you said but i still keep getting the "please run GTA5.exe" error... don't know what i did wrong... Maybe a dumb question but does it matter what versions i use? Does crack v2 give an error with update 3? And do i need all the other updates before i can use update 3? (hope you know what i mean)   For a second i thought these were huge fitness dumbbells, but then i thought.. nahh its Reddit.    Desolation of Smaug review is pure gold  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIy_uLF6xI8 list=PL4NL9i-Fu15iZLbSfrxZCpZfKchWr9Vna index=5     Its the details that did the trick for me, you could just feel the impact of the punches in my theater. This movie has the best sound design i ever heard/felt in a movietheater!   Exactly, the whole movie i thought he would die, especially because of all the emotional wife and kids stuff. I'm so glad i was wrong.   Its one of his most quoted lines from the movie by now... don't know the exact context anymore. Oh well, now i have an excuse to go see it again.   America wants to be in the centre of the earth so bad it rips Russia in half... Looks so weird to me (European)   For number 2 i was thinking Planet Hulk, him flying away like that, still transformed...   fair enough    Thats why these movies are great, you don't just want to see them F up badguys... (gotta watch the language)   I laughed so hard when Hawkeye was about to shoot Quicksilver whilst saying "I could do it... no one would know..." i did'nt like Hawkeye in the first movie, but they made him one of the most likeable characters in this movie.    I don't know what they do right, but you could feel the impact of those punches in the theater... Amazingly done.    Absolutely loved this movie! It was such an entertaining experience, but those Russian accents from Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were terrible.    Even the shittiest theater in the shittiest part of the shitty Netherlands has Age of Ultron, and i have seen the first screening of it... Take that America, Ne-Ther-Lands, Ne-Ther-Lands (i guess the chant works better when you shout U.S.A)   David Luiz... 25 million for each nutmeg.   i don't know why but this comment made me laugh out loud...   Pack of Velociraptors, jurassic world style...  	19
       It's the only reason I kept watching      Let the trampling begin      I'm going there in early March. Any tips on how to dress? Raincoat or umbrella? What kind of shoes do people normally wear?   Ah yes, one of my favorite .gifs http://i.imgur.com/NKkt6.gif      What time was this taken at?      I saw the same thing happen, except it was an average guy running full speed on the treadmill. It was very early in the morning so the gym was relatively empty. He slipped, and the treadmill shot him straight back, his towel flying into his face. Dazed and confused, he looked around to see if anyone saw. I did, but he didn't realize so he tried to get back on, without realizing that the treadmill was still on full speed. He slipped again, fell on his knees and got shit backwards into the stationary bikes. Probably one of the funniest things I've seen at the gym.     I thought he was more like "come at me bro!"   Isn't this Stephen Lang?      It's ok, LaRoche did the same thing to us. Then we became the world fucking champions so I like the trend where this is headed.   omg...too soon?   Rule #4, remember to buy a boat and live near a gulf stream to dump the body.   would you be too fly for a wi fi?      That's quite a polarizing argument   I like how people assume the best costumes are from Halloween, but if you look closer, they're all from Comic-Con      http://i.imgur.com/zNxdK.gif   Actually as a Giants fan, I know their pain from game 6 in 2002, but then again, we won it last year so lol.     	26
  I read everything else below and think you are getting an unreasonable amount of shit for your post.  Thanks for your reply. I never meant to be rude but I was careless in my phrasing. I'm glad and proud that Columbus finally passed this law -- that's what I was trying to convey, but the way I said it completely undercut the intent.  You should also know that this sub has a reputation for being so brutal that it once was near the top of the list in a discussion of most toxic local reddits, and that in particular that I have a small posse of haters who downvote and disparage almost anything I say. That doesn't account for all the critical comments-- some were right on target about how unwelcoming my original comment was -- but a couple of those people hate me so much they'll come into a thread on /r/aww to snarl at me. So it's not all about this discussion.  Anyway, I hope you find what you're seeking here, and add that the weekly "Bar Thursday" gatherings listed in /r/ColumbusSocial are reportedly very friendly. I won't be there, because I don't feel welcome.   You did see that I apologized, right? And I didn't call names.   The relative is, for lack of a better word, delusional.  I don't know how close a relative this is, but you might want to consider the likelihood that what's happening with the dog now is a preview of what will happen with the human eventually. The ties you make or break within the family now may be even more important later...  I'm now convinced of your sincere concern for the dog, and wish for you all the best outcome, whatever that is.     vote in a new economic system   Who suggested that? This whole thread is full of strawmen.    I wish you'd just give up being an asshole already.   I'm being authentically me: sometimes wrong, but always willing to retract and self-criticize if that's truly the case. I can't do anything about your opinion of me (and I can't even judge you the way you judged me because your current account is only four days old), but I would politely suggest that the above language is way beyond the limits of how to maintain a healthy subreddit.  Adding, keeping one username for almost 8 years and never deleting mistakes is not easy, but you should try it.   Not really. I know a lot about Suprynowicz. The Drega killings happened in New Hampshire. But you did detect something there: the reason I paid extra attention to Dennis Joos and the Drega rampage when others were looking at Diana's death is that I was a journalist, too.  BTW, there's a new book about this coming out this summer from Beacon Press that may finally correct the public record about Drega. I've talked to the author, and it looks like it will be an excellent read.   [Here's the article announcing the naming of the wooly lemur, *Avahi cleesei*.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4427160.stm)      Once again, a [Dirty Fuckin' Hippie](http://www.cafepress.com/mf/22025047/dirty-fing-hippie-oval_sticker) gets it right. Thank you for that *moral* as well as strategic clarity. I can never understand the willingness of the theoretical purity crowd to throw away the tiny margin of political and survival space for the poorest among us, just for the sake of their own self-image as revolutionaries.    That's a grotesque distortion of the position taken by his critics.   The Review-Journal is unfortunately Nevada's largest newspaper, but the more reputable choice is the Las Vegas Sun.  What would be excellent is if you could never let anybody forget the Colebrook story, and Suprynowicz's role in its aftermath. The attacks happened before most people understood the danger of lone wolves motivated by Sovereign Citizen crackpottery, so a lot of people wrote it off as a singular event with no political significance. (It was also the week Princess Diana was killed, and that ate the newshole almost everywhere outside the affected local area.) But Supryowicz took this horror, turned it upside down and spent years touring the backwaters of the US using his book to mobilize anti-government RW crazies.   More people should know about the reflexive heroism of another newspaper editor, Dennis Joos, who threw himself on Drega when he attacked the newspaper office. Joos was killed trying to save his staff and friends. The local library is now named for him.  All of which is by way of saying, too late, that deleting this post might not have been the best choice -- although I understand the logic.   hahahahaha   By a completely despicable "newspaper". This is the home base of Vin Suprynowicz (editor), who made his name by [championing the vile rightwing spree murderer Carl Drega](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/08/10/1230293/-Carl-Drega-Folk-Hero-to-Free-Staters). So don't get carried away by praise from these hate-mongers.   Another one! You should totally also post this cutie over to /r/catsinsinks.   Shhh! If the theoretical purity crowd hears you, you'll be drummed out of the ...oh, wait; there IS nothing they could ban you from, because they never build anything.    Because kids are too young to understand the cause of those itchy welts that make them so sick. Seriously: I know they must serve *some* purpose in the grand global ecology, but if we could wave a wand and rid the world of mosquitoes and spiders, adults might be less freaked out by other bugs.   No, I meant Maoism and FULLCOMMUNISM -- in 2015.   Search before submitting with keywords from your topic. The search box is in the upper right corner of the subreddit.   Okay, let's quit the personal attacks (which I admit I started) before both of us get banned.    Bernie Sanders is the only one who will be able to talk in this "mass arena"  ...*IF* ultraleftists like you succeed in demobilizing thousands of young people who otherwise would be going door-to-door, writing letters to the editor, etc.    Fortunately, I think your likely success rate there will be about the same as most of your posts here. Go back to /r/Maoism, will ya?    This case was not decided on the basis of anything about free speech.    What this candidacy presents is a opening to talk in the mass arena at a level that hasn't been possible for at 40 years.  Well, that and an opportunity for some people to feel superior because they have a wee bit of theory, mostly without real world experience.   go away, idiot spammer.  reported.   by itself all day sitting in it's own piss. I'd qualify laying in your own piss as won't move.   Okay. You didn't make that clear before.  But when you say it can't be solved within the family, I have to ask if the rest of you -- starting with whoever took the dog to a vet before -- can't do a *collective* intervention. This would have the effect of spreading around the responsibility, and might even make family relations go better in the long run.    [Here's what the same intersection -- Fifth Ave. at 27th Street -- looks like now.](http://lostnewengland.com/2014/05/looking-north-on-fifth-avenue-from-27th-street-new-york-city/)  This is a very cool website that does that for many old photos.   If that doesn't work, I'd resort to the universal fix: duct tape.   Why isn't your assistant busy doing comparative reviews of different brands of catnip?    If the pet is still eating, it's not time yet. When the pet stops eating and *won't* move (as opposed to having difficulty), that's the end. Until then it's at the discretion of the owner, for better or worse. It's not animal cruelty to be unable to say goodbye to a beloved friend, and your eagerness to report what should be solved within the family undercuts your asserted compassion.   You might want to explain to your family member that many pets stay alive for their owners' sakes, and that past a certain point that's not really fair to the animal.  Finally, if the owner once allowed someone else to take the pet to the vet, would s/he allow a third professional assessment now?   That was *yesterday*. Read the rules.   Note that this was decided not on a free speech basis.    I'm so very sorry. That's not an export we're proud of.    Note that this case was *not* decided on grounds of free speech, but it's still going to cause problems.      ...but Breitbart is an American problem.     In a globalized world, there's always a place to escape consequences.  Not forever. The connection between wealth inequality and climate emergency is becoming clearer every day to those who are willing to see it. Those who refuse to see it will find themselves forced, one way or another, to confront that reality. I hope that realization comes at the point of a global popular uprising, not at the point of a global economic and environmental collapse.   Oh, come on. If you're being honest, you know that I give lots of help and information to /r/Columbus, which can't really be outweighed by politics that you don't happen to like.     Go back and see the rest of my response.   Sorry it came out that way. But it's hard for smokers to understand that many of us could not go to *any* bar in Columbus until this law was passed. I missed almost the entire experience of [Stache's/Little Brothers](http://www.ootb646.com/columns_profiles/venues/littlebrothers.html) because of this, despite being a friend of the owner and a fan of many of the bands that played there.  I do appreciate your effort to be respectful, and rest assured that someone here will give the precise info you need.   What's judgmental is your overreaction.  You're about to adopt your first kitten and know so little about cats that you had to ask others what age to adopt and what to feed it. I've had to deal first hand for decades with the effects of people not neutering cats. I suggest that you step back, look beyond your personal scope of vision, and realize that this is a heartbreaking situation that I dealt with fairly politely.  EDIT: By "this is a heartbreaking situation" I meant the crisis of homeless cats, not this particular cat.    Welcome to Columbus, where we actually care about [the respiratory health of non-smokers](https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-503.aspx):  The new law applies only to enclosed areas. As that term is defined, however, it includes more than just indoor spaces. Decks or patios that are covered overheadby a roof or even umbrellas or awningsand on more than two sides are also enclosed under the law. Smoking is not allowed if members of the public are invited or allowed into these areas, or if anyone works there as an employee, an independent contractor, or even as a volunteer. Business owners still have the option of making their entire facilities non smoking, both indoors and out.       Yes, she is. Now imagine how much better she'd look lying in a soft bed in the safety of a home where the humans cared enough to have her spayed.   OP, do you really rely solely on redditors for your news? There are plenty of serious, competent news orgs offering breaking news 24/7, just a click away.    Can't. They're almost all too relevant, even now.   I grew up in a house where Adlai Stevenson was right behind Franklin Delano God in our parents' opinion. I was too young to quite understand why, but now I get it.   [WOSU is already doing this.](http://video.wosu.org/program/columbus-neighborhoods/)   You're not wrong to rant, and don't take it too seriously if this post gets downvoted to oblivion. Some of us hear you.    Don't think they have the revolutionary drive to support massive change for their workers.  And they won't until there's more engagement and education within the unions -- which are, after all, pretty much all there is in terms of a class-conscious infrastructure in the US. Remember, unions have been the money and mobilizing force behind major struggles for civil rights and against unjust wars.  [Teamsters for a Democratic Union](https://www.tdu.org/) will be an important ally if you do get into this.   Believe it or not, I did not know he is a redditor. Thanks for that!   This is good: it's how you build a base for *eventually* standing up. And I can tell you from my own experience that denouncing them isn't the way to go. Asking pointed questions (to which you already know the answer) is a better lever for prying open closed minds.  It will help to study what the standards are in unionized plants, you can find out what's up in your area through Unitd Food and Commercial Workers.    Right. Not all mice carry the virus.   That is absolutely delicious!   So what did *you* say in this meeting?  What you're facing is Standard Operating Procedure -- and the reason it continues is precisely because so many retail workers see themselves as just biding their time until they can leave for some imagined better place. Stand in the place where you are, for what you believe in. There's no other way.   [Alley Cat Allies](http://www.alleycat.org/Kittens) can help you with every step of the decision, from assessing their age and degree of socialization to building an outdoor shelter or finding a rescue org. They can even help you [find out who in your area is working with feral cats](http://www.alleycat.org/FeralFriends), which may lead you to the individual who is feeding them. (Because this is dubiously legal in some municipalities, they may be working at night.)  You could also try posting in your local and state reddit communities to ask how to contact local feral cat caretakers.  One thing you can do immediately is make sure they have access to clean water. Sometimes feral cats are fed, but not given water -- and that's a big deal.  There are many, many people doing this work, all of whom will be happy to help. Good on you for wanting to help, and good luck!   She's looking for subcutaneous, not intravenous. Sub-Q is a standard treatment for feline kidney disease, but I dunno about a UTI.    Just go to the vet. The initial visit will cost about $50, the fluids and rig will cost about $25, and you'll go home *knowing*, not guessing, whether the problem is a UTI or (also possible) early CKD or something else altogether.  [Rascal Animal Hospital](http://www.rascalanimalhospital.com/pricing-information.html) is probably the cheapest -- it's a $15 surcharge for walk-in, added to the $30 comprehensive exam. But get there when they open, and expect to wait -- they're currently booking appointments for routine care about two months out.   Yeah, that's part of the problem. There are union democracy movements particular to many national unions, but most don't have a high enough profile to reach down to the local rank and file unless there happens to be a member who has wide general knowledge of and interest in unionism in general. Some such groups, like Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) have been so well-established for so long that they have actually wrought major changes. I'd suggest that anyone who is a union member should go looking for their union's rank and file oppositionists, because there usually is help to be found.   ... and that's what the [union democracy movement](http://aud2.uniondemocracy.org/) is about. Too bad you didn't reach out to that faction in whatever union you belonged to.   What union pursues an *unsupported* grievance, with no basis in contract language? This is a serious question. That is not normal.   Or until enough collective action on many levels changes the whole paradigm away from individual rights to social justice.   It's more basic that that, even. Americans are taught to think of themselves as individuals and to distrust "collectivism". Until we get past that legacy of anti-communism, no call for change will work as well as it could.    [It isn't true, and they do have a choice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/37yx09/robert_reich_one_big_reason_america_was_far_more/crqz97x)    That is their job. they have to defend every single worker.  No it isn't, and no they don't. Not all complaints are legitimate greivances; the job of the union steward is to sort them out and decide whether/when to file a grievance.  The biggest problem workers have with unions is foot-dragging on filing and aggressively pursuing grievances. The most annoying problem for unions is members who don't bother to read the damn contract and thus either don't bother to seek redress or do so for ridiculous complaints.  Source: former local union officer and national union staff organizer.   And the worst part is, if everybody would just read the damn contract *before* they personally have a complaint (which may/may not be a legitimate grievance), everything would be so much better. I tell people, "You'd better believe that management studies every word and comma and line break in that *legally binding contract* -- why would you want to disarm yourself by not reading it?"   [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) is essentially the faction within the Democratic Party that doesn't want Clinton to be the nominee. They are not the problem.   Many PACs serve a legitimate purpose and do good work. Super PACs, which don't have to disclose who their donations come from, are the biggest part of the problem. The "Ready for Bernie"/"Bet on Bernie" PAC is another sort of problem: they disclose, but although they claim to be supporting Sanders, there's no way to tell whether the uses they put donations to are helpful to his campaign.  I say "they" when referring to this PAC (which is a hybrid form, but not a Super PAC), but right now [there's no reason to think it's more than one person, with unclear motive.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crql9z6)    Not all PACs are bad. The problem is Super PACs, which don't have to report donors.   [Progressive Democrats of America](http://www.pdamerica.org/about-us/history) worked to get Sanders to run as a Dem, and are now working to get him the nomination. They are not the problem.   Um, maybe someone should be thinking about what it takes to become a delegate to the Democratic Convention...    I think this might be a PAC set up by Hillary or the Republican's backers (billionaires) to slander Bernie   No, it's just a ["political entrepreneur"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/37xffz/this_website_claims_to_be_a_bernie_sanders_super/crqlleo) who serially uses whatever issue he can raise money around to bolster his resume and, not so incidentally, pay himself as Treasurer.  It will be exactly as much of a problem as Sanders' supporters let it become. The way to avert that is to educate ourselves and teach others how this system works and why they should only contribute to the official campaign.   That's what everybody who supports Bernie should do: not only give to the campaign directly yourself, but make sure that others do not give to these unaccountable PACs. It's unlikely that the Sanders campaign will make any statement like this, so it's up to the grassroots.   And that's a good thing: talking about what's wrong with campaign finance is a key part of his agenda.   It wasn't just lamps: the ceramic statues were on every other coffee table. The original was designed by [Royal Hickman for Haeger Pottery](http://www.haegerpotteries.com/haeger.php?section_id=3#1941) and was first produced in 1941 in three different sizes.               I agree. That's why it's so important to teach supporters about how campaign finance works. I do not believe the Sanders campaign will have much if anything to say about this; it's up to grassroots supporters to do this. And it's not a distraction -- objection to conventional, currently legal financing is an key part of his platform.   go away, idiot spammer.  reported.      This is the correct answer.   The press is not going to call this thing a Super PAC, because it isn't one. Fox might do that, but no serious news org will.  BTW, [**here's a good primer on every aspect of campaign finance**](http://www.amazon.com/Unstacking-Deck-Reporters-Campaign-Finance/dp/0976603756) *except* 527s and Super Pacs, which arose right after this was published.     Thre's nothing to report: it's a real, legitimate *but uncontrollable and unhelpful* PAC. See my other comments here for more info.   This is the critical point. The linked PAC is just the first to come to this sub's attention. There will be many more. The task is to educate supporters to only give to the campaign.   They haven't donated, they've pledged. [He has only recently started taking actual contributions.](http://news.yahoo.com/cary-lee-peterson-love-media-085228219.html) The list you see is autogenerated when potential donors typed in their own info, which is why it looks so ragged. Be sure to see my other comments ITT for more inof.   There is, but it's not what you think.   The PAC is real, and apparently registered with the Federal Elections Commission. That doesn't mean its existence has the approval of the Sanders campaign.   This PAC, which is in no way connected to the Sanders campaign, is the project of a middle aged lobbyist named [Carey L. Peterson](https://sites.google.com/site/caryleepetersonprofilearticle/).   From a quick survey of this lobbyists' history and other projects, he appears to be a political entrepreneur -- he's in it for the money. I don't see anything that suggests he's a true believer, and sending money to this PAC is not a good idea.  EDIT: [**Here's an article from Bernie's hometown paper that explains this PAC.**](http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2015/05/30/sanders-unable-superpacs/28184005/)     It's not a trend. It's just the simplest way to keep track of a pencil when you're working mainly with that (rather than a keyboard) and also need your hands free for other tasks. In publishing, especially newspapers, editors used to use special blue pencils for copyediting, and keeping track of those was especially important, which is why the stereotype of an old school newspaper editor shows him (of course) with a pencil behind his ear.    I hope he's making better use of his time than that!   Maybe you've got to vote for who you've got to vote for to keep the worse of evils from gaining power.  Fortunately, between now and the next presidential election there's  time to do a lot of education on root causes and strategies for bringing justice. Thanks, Bernie!   Amen! I haven't been able to get back there for several years, but I love camping there and dream about it often.

There are some extremist "feminists" who act more like female supremacists  Yes, and how that happened deserves a lot more attention.  OP, while you're doing background research, be sure to look into the movement that *preceded* second-wave feminism: Women's Liberation. Based in an internationalist, class-based analysis, this is a perspective that simply could not ever be warped into the grotesque caricature that academics made of feminism. And the women who considered themselves part of a global women's liberation movement were the ones who shook the world in the late 60s/early 70s.   Home is a good place to be. Give that li'l fuzzball an extra few pets from his online fans!    Please tell us the messy face is from medication for his eyes ...?   Yes, because it's not backed up by any hard data. You're asking about a social dynamic; they're whining about their individual experiences.   Because most people are too smart to think men *as a group* are routinely victimized simply because they are men.      Whose media do you mean? Men claim victim status here on reddit  every day. You can rebalance your views by reading about how ridiculous such whining is [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/againstmensrights/).  EDIT: Sorry for the duplicates -- my internet is stuttering b/c rainstorm.   Because they have no choice: there are [at least seven different laws in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_of_origin#United_States) requiring that all imports carry a Country of Origin (COO) label.  The "Made in China" labels in clothing are especially galling to those of us old enough to remember when many garments carried [this label](https://laborrightsarecivilrights.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_20130405_155016_375-1.jpg) instead. That was something to wear with pride.   It's not illegal for women to be topless everywhere in the US. The right has been litigated in several places (e.g., Columbus OH) and the legal basis for the right is clear. Places where a law against it are still on the books are those where nobody has yet filed a lawsuit.  Adding, the organization that *seems* to lead on this issue, GoTopless, is actually a front for a cult -- the Raelians -- who believe humans are ruled by aliens, among other forms of nuttery.   But now you're the expert among the friends you have that don't already backpack. You can be the trip leader!   And don't totally give up on meeting new people this way. Just make sure you spend more than a few minutes talking to them before heading out.   Remember, the "bad co-hiker" experiences will someday be hilarious tales to be told around a campfire. Like the time I led a hike in Grand Canyon with a guy who brought along a 36 lb. pack loaded with two hardback novels, a fifth of bourbon (which of course broke and soaked all his clothing) and a crackpot notion that leaving his cigarettes at the rim was the best way to quit smoking. By the end of day one his longtime GF hated him so much she left early and hiked out alone with a torn ACL; the rest of us wanted to throw him to the condors but settled for making fun of him at every turn.   You never know what tomorrow will bring to your parking lot. Maybe a traveling circus will use it to stage their parade to the tenting ground. Maybe someone will decide to have extremely inappropriate personal relations with a parking meter. Maybe Oprah will stop by, and get locked out of her car, unable to escape her entourage and fans. You never know ... keep your eyes open, your camera handy, and bring the winners back to /r/WTF!   I hate to say it, but I think your co-worker wins this round. You can't exactly solve the mystery of what motivated the singer by asking the internet.    Don't be talking to yourself, then.   go away, idiot spammer.  reported.   I do have a very good idea why I'm talking about, and I never denied the ongoing damage. But your claim the "the Indians forgot" is asinine. Try making that assertion in that in any Native community (even one of the reddit subs) and see how it is received.    Remember to ask in the local reddit community where you're moving.   it completely turned me off to backpacking with others.  Oh, come on. You went backpacking with *strangers*, not friends. With friends it's a kind of fun your non-backpacking friends can never even dream of. Especially when you plan a big trip that takes months to jointly plan and prepare, which can be the best part of any trip.   That's pretty insulting. Nobody forgot. This is about wealth and political power imbalances, as usual.   The shelters are separate from the HQ of the organizations that run them. The hotline is widely advertised, but not the physical address of the actual shelter.   Amen. Another option is to find a *foster* home by Sunday night, then keep working to find the right permanent home.  OP, why did this *suddenly* become an issue with a five y.o. dog?   Nah, for small amounts the people to talk to are at (614) 466-2660.     You're not helping yourself here.   Of course I know it was local. But you were responding to a guy from California.  There is one buffet chain I've loved in other cities over many years that I wish would come here: [Souper Salad.](http://www.soupersalad.com/) Among other goodies, they have an outstanding gingerbread always on offer.    They think they're privy to secret/privileged information.   That's a major dynamic in *all* conspiracy theories. Overwhelmingly scary things seem to require overwhelmingly big singular explanations -- compound dynamics and "we don't know yet" don't cut it. So it must be that the Big Truth is out there, it's just being kept from ordinary people like the speaker because they're not part of the powerful elite -- except that now their "knowledge" of the Big Truth gives them special standing above the sheep.    Aww, c'mon: Potlucks are a great way to socialize, and most often safer than your average commercial buffet. That one made national news because it was so unusual. Anyway, this one comes with [music](http://www.potluckshows.org/AquacatToTheRescue.mp3).  Good luck getting that chorus out of your head.    I'm guessing you're kidding, but the issue here is the union contract. They've been able in the past (don't know if this one is still true) to do things like define "unfounded" in a way that automatically ruled out any complaint against an officer that came in more than 30 days after the incident, regardless of how serious or well-documented.    On of the reasons I ask questions about the details behind high quality photos that show up in the sea of cell phone snaps that floods the "new" page is to find out whether the image is original without having to bother with a reverse image search, so thank you for that info. Faking it is especially bad form in this sub, which values OC.  Now I'm taking back my upvote.   Weird: I have hardly ever seen photos taken from the bottom of the incline.

Try chaining your bike to a tree in NYC and you'll have it confiscated and face a $1000 fine. Chain it to any other public infrastructure and it can be removed as "abandoned property", although enforcement varies. That's just one city, off the top of my head. You're welcome to test this out, or do your own research.   If this were real, you wouldn't be the one posting it. It would have been every post to the front page, linked from serious news orgs, two days ago.  I replicated your Google search and there isn't a single credible source there. Are you new to the internet?   The lock ceases to be "yours" when you leave it on a public bridge. It's not theft to repair vandalism.

How is it possible to steal what is essentially litter?   They're not neutered?     I believe they call it autistic now  autism != retardation. In any case, neither of those terms is appropriate, and both are offensive when used out of medical context.   What you both mean is *willfully obtuse*.   This is an officer known to  many people: Sgt. Steve Livingston has been the community liaison officer for the whole northern part of the city, and is a specialist in community policing. He's also been in the news because he was hit by a car in 2012, breaking 17 bones. The FOP made a huge stink about the outcome of the case against the driver, IIRC.  I'd love to be snarky about this, since I think the FOP is a big part of the problem with policing here, but I just can't manage it.   [Here's a guide to caring for small kittens.](http://www.kittenrescue.org/index.php/cat-care/kitten-care-handbook/) There should be a recipe here for making kitten milk replacer at home until you can get to a pet food store to buy some.  Another thing you should do is look around to see if there are more kittens out there. If the momcat is around, she'll take care of them, but it not you'll have to intercede.  This is a great adventure you've embarked upon. Watch out for falling in love with that little squirt!              Checking your ID? Using your cell phone to call his GF? Stealing credit cards?

[Previously submitted (with link) and discussed, 7 hours ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/37qmng/sobriety_checkpoint_friday_529_state_st_in/)   I've had stoner kitties, but they all seemed to outgrow it after age three or so. Give him a flying send-off!   This piece is from a libertarian group (published in *Forbes*...), so there's some weirdness near the end about "mandatory donation disclosures stifling participation in the democratic process", but it's a welcome reminder of an incredibly important and hard-fought legal victory.   Adding, I had the privilege of meeting Corliss near the end of his life, and he was a great man. He never stopped supporting peace, justice and socialism.      ...  a reporter is considering doing a brief news story that might negatively portray one of the sponsor companies and the company prefers they minimize coverage...  I don't know how much of a problem media corruption is...  The kind of corruption you cite is infinitely less common than you imagine. The vast majority of reporters and editors in serious news organizations are honest. The problems you see are primarily due to the model of journalism being practiced: a blind belief in "objectivity through balance" combined with a skewed agenda favoring what readers want to consume rather than what they need to know, all dialed up to 11 by the concentration of ownership that happened over the past twenty years. Investigative teams all over the country were disbanded and defunded as marketing experts convinced the new beancounters to chase reader/viewer eyeballs with increasingly salacious clickbait.  This isn't something that's going to be fixed anytime soon -- especially not by non-journalists after the main players have spent two decades trying to figure it out.  So focusing on this instead of on-the-ground organizing would be a serious mistake.      [Harvey Houses](http://www.legendsofamerica.com/66-harveyhouse.html) are a fabulous legacy in the west. I happened upon La Posada while it was being brought back from the dead -- it's now a showcase, well worth a side trip.   No you're not, you silly furball! You'd do it again in a New York minute if you saw another pompom.   Yes, although that's a subset of being politically inexperienced in general -- the minor downside of having inspired lots of new activists.       There are new people in the room every day. Don't deny them the chance to discover this because you're already hip to it.   Keep trying! A delayed response is not the same as no response. Sometimes it takes sending those "come out and play with me" (even online) messages many times before a person can really hear them, and then the sheer number of times you've tried becomes a factor in itself: your friend can't ignore how many times you've reached out, and some part of his brain will have to recognize that you do care, and that this is because *he's someone worth caring about*.   The first thing that goes when you become depressed is your judgment. And the thing that keeps you from turning that around is the notion *which everybody has* that all your thoughts and feelings are real because they're yours. But they're not, and being willing to trust one other person who is telling you that a certain belief is "just  the illness talking" can be a lifesaver.   May it be so.   I wish, however, that it was a better union than the Guild. I'm old enough to remember when GCIU represented Newsday, and negotiated 40K buyouts in advance of a layoff. That couldn't happen today, but damn, they fought hard for the reporters.    You're right, but the website is still awful.         That looks a lot like a very old dessicated tree stump.

Those are site-wide ads, over which subreddits have no control.   As a journalist, I completely agree with your second part. But journalistic integrity has never had much of a toehold in TV news, and CNN seems especially resistant to shaming.  I don't think there's much point moaning about this.

She wrote in Joel Chandler Harris dialect, and her appropriation of this has been the subject of extensive debate. She says, "Authorship doesn't matter. Content doesn't master. Form doesn't master. Meter doesn't matter. All that matters is the trace of poetry."  So the answer is, no, tweeting GWTW doesn't make this poet racist.

Try some documentaries, like the original Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, any of David Attenborough's "Life of X", Planet Earth, Blue Planet, and Nova. Avoid documentaries with overly simplified content or CGI content like the "Walking with" series, which as much as I love, are not as objective and easier to reject. Stick to the more objective, critically acclaimed, documentaries with "real" content.   It was one of many fan theories about Amon's identity before it was revealed.   Amon is Azula.

Steven Universe is fated to end in a human/gem instrumentality.   Human cloning.   Not currently.   Tardigrade   I think we still evolve in fundamentally the same way all organisms evolve. We interact with our environment, change our environment, and that affects gene x environment interactions, which effects the frequency of genes. But all organisms interact with their environment, all organisms construct niches around them. Culture is not new, in the sense that other mammals and birds have limited cultural feedbacks with their environment. I think what's different about humans is the *scale* at which alter the environment through our culture. Whether that counts as a fundamental change kinda depends. We aren't the first organisms to manipulate the environment, but we do do it better than any other organisms. The *real* fundamental change in our evolution is yet to come, and happens when due to our understanding of evolution and our own genetics, we intervene in our own evolution using genetic therapy and engineering. That's a fundamentally novel evolutionary process that has never been seen in nature.   I agree. I don't really buy the argument that evolution has changed "fundamentally"--it's still the same evolution. Other animals also have culture, in a more limited sense, so really, the question needs to be changed to define exactly what is human specific about our culture and what does it mean for there to be a fundamental change in evolution.   Not only that, but you're impeding their egress, which slows them down AND slows you down since you STILL have to wait for them to get off. No one benefits.

Your comment has nothing to do with what I said, so I don't understand the purpose of your question or followup. My response was to a comment about the gaming community as a whole (to quote: "gaming world" and "everyone and anyone playing video games"). My comment was a disagreement on the statement "everyone and anyone playing video games is going to be harassed and it doesn't matter if you're male or female." To be very very very explicit about what I meant in my comment (because apparently, there's some confusion, though I don't know why), I disagree that it doesn't matter, because it seems clear that the most repeated phrases used in video gaming culture to harass other players are, in their very substance, anti-female and anti-lgbt, e.g. "get raped", "suck a dick". How that connects up with your reply is beyond me, as I never said anything concerning Smash specifically.   Now, if only there were other body parts we could damage to help with sexism.   But it does matter when the substance of the harassment is anti-women and anti-lgbt.   Clearly the solution is scissor fights.   *megatons   I don't disagree, but that doesn't mean that we don't have to face challenges from both over and under fertility. I never said that the solution to under fertility is to raise fertility. The reality is that while solutions to over population are easy to think of, the problems of long-term under fertility do not present an obvious solution. The 21st century faces a dual population problem.    It is important to talk about reducing fertility and reducing consumption  I don't disagree. I completely agree that we need to reduce consumption everywhere. I also agree that we need to reduce fertility *in underdeveloped countries*. There's no real need to reduce fertility in developed countries, when almost every developed country in the world is now at under-replacement level fertility (less than 2.1 births per women) and continues to fall to almost *half* that of replacement fertility in some Asian and Western European countries. Most people in the public have naive notions of demography that do not concur with what demographers, developmental economists, anthropologists, and other people who study populations for a living understand them to be. Most developed countries do not have a long-term overfertility problem, but an underfertility problem (see P.S.). That said, I agree that *world* overpopulation is still a problem, but when we talk about it, people need to agree that the real problem of overpopulation is the *delay in completing the demographic transition in underdeveloped Africa and Asia*. The *natural course of development is a reduction of mortality followed by a reduction in fertility*. The magnitude of the problem of population growth comes from the *how long fertility decline lags behind mortality decline*. The long-term problem is whether Africa develops in 100 years or 200 years, the difference in time meaning a difference in billions of people when world population finally stops growing. The best way to speed that along is promoting women's rights, education, jobs, and reproductive choice.  P.S. The 21st century will be the century of both *over* AND *under* population problems simultaneously. The challenge is to develop the means to support 8-12 billion people sustainably without destroying the environment, while also dealing with the fact that there will be tons of old people around, failures of social security, shrinking economies, rising senior medical costs, and unemployment. Unfortunately, as with many problems, trying to solve one problem produces others.   Sure, but it's not like population decline isn't *also* a huge problem: collapse of social security, shrinking economies, rising unemployment, rising medical expenses.    And though I think women deserve access to education and jobs in developing countries, I also realize that the more people there are living a Western lifestyle, the more pressure there is on all the things I value, listed in a previous comment.  The only solution to this is to give women access to education and jobs without delay while also promoting lower consumption. The problem right now is high fertility and low mortality. This is due to the lag of women's reproductive rights (which reduces fertility) following widespread women's reproductive care (which reduces infant mortality). Either we move forward with improving women's reproductive rights, by promoting education and jobs, without delay, OR we kill more people (babies and old people) OR we do nothing and prolong the lag phase dynamics of the demographic transition in underdeveloped countries resulting in a higher number of people in the world in the long-term. The first one is the only reasonable strategy. There's no "although".   What do you want us to do? Kill billions of people? There are only two viable actions we can take: (1) empower women in underdeveloped areas of the world with education, jobs, reproductive rights, sexual education, and contraception--this is the surest way to reduce fertility in the long run, and is the reason why fertility is so low in highly developed countries; (2) reduce per capita consumption in every way we can while developing technologies to reduce our impact on the world.  The fact is we're stuck with 8+ billion people for the next few centuries (it'll grow beyond that but then shrink), and we need learn to live like that. It doesn't matter if you *think* there *should* be 4 billion people in the world, it won't happen this century.   Most highly developed nations have very low birth rates. It's a pretty universal correlate of development. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=asc   http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last sort=asc  Interesting. For reference, a fertility of 2.1 per woman is generally accepted as replacement fertility.   Yup, agrarian society - children make economic sense. Wealth flows from child to parent.

A ton of old people, but with even worse support systems for the elderly.   Death.   Sorry. You're not an idiot. Your suggestion is a good one.    TIL. But to be fair, Lamarck got it all wrong. Just so wrong. Darwin was the first to come up with the correct theory of evolution. Lamarck doesn't really count.  That's what I said. You're statement was still wrong. Darwin did not discover "evolution".    He came up with evolution.  No he didn't. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_evolutionary_thought Darwin was not the first to propose or observe that animals change over time, far from it. Lamarck's hypotheses predate Darwin by many decades, and while wrong, they concern how evolution happens. You are correct in saying that Darwin and Wallace independently came up with natural selection, the first people to realize the true underlying explanation for evolution, but they were obviously not the first to come up with evolution itself.   He was one of the first to realize that life in the animal kingdom was a game of eat or be eaten, and that only the strongest survive.  C'mon, "survival of the strongest" is false, and "survival of the fittest" is also false, and "reproduction of the fittest" is a truism. These are all terrible descriptions of natural selection.

Then they'd be put to death by spoon.   My point is that living past expected life span results in *probabilistic* diseases (e.g. cancer), not deterministic biological events (e.g. menopauase).   Dude, you're fine.   Shrug, do you have any reasons not to?   Of course, this is after you've decided to attend.   Don't those people tend to come from evolutionary biology, human genetics, or genomics programs than they do from anthropology programs?    The hard sciences don't seem to have the same hang-up.  Could it be due to anthropology papers being far less cited, so citations are not as useful of a metric as in science? As someone who works in a lab that does human evolution from genomics, it's a bit discouraging, given that there have been recent calls among human evolutionary genomicists for greater integration with anthropological research.   Ultraporn.   When you keep other species in captivity, their life expectancy also improves, yet they never go through anything analogous to menopause, they never stop being able to reproduce. This begs the question, why does this happen in humans? I can not conceive of a reason why females genetically should have a timer which starts at menarche and ends at menopause. Your suggestion that it coincides with life expectancy is a correlation, and doesn't suggest a causal mechanism for why humans are quite different from other mammals. The high prevalence of cancer in human populations is *also* a consequence of us now having a very long lifespan--with age comes more time for a probabilistic failure in cell regulation systems. Yet this is not what we see in menopause. Menopause is not a probabilistic failure of biological systems which grows more probable with age. It is a universal event in females, that happens consistently around the same time.  My other point is to reiterate what was said by the other redditor. Life expectancy statistics doesn't say much of anything about the proportion of the population which lives to old age. It's just mean age, and is primarily skewed downwards by infant mortality.   You're conflating concepts. The difference in (any trait) between populations is a difference in *mean*. The genetic concept of *heritability* is an analysis of *variance*. Also what has ignorance have to do with brain size? And how is ignorance equated to lack of education, and thus, how is lack of education heritable to future generations? I suppose this is true in a socioculturaleconomic sense, but now we have multiple concepts being conflated. The question as proposed is inconsistent.    No it doesn't. That's not how it works. Traits aren't automatically selected 'for' if they're not selected 'against', or vice versa. That's like saying humans have two eyes because there is selection against three eyes!  It is true that a trait that is selective non-deleterious is not selective beneficial (because they could be neutral). However, I don't see where they are making a Panglossian fallacy. It is certainly true that menopause is a derived trait and that it's evolution is an interesting phenomena in that it would seem to reduce fitness and would be selected against--hence, why they review both non-adaptive (antagonistic pleiotropy) and adaptive hypotheses. Your "eye" analogy is poor, life-history evolution is pervasive and not constrained by development, while the number of eyes is constrained. Also, there's an extensive literature on the evolution of menopause in humans.    Do you have examples of such models?   Thanks. I do think that there will be a place for systems that act like humans in the sense of apple's Siri or a nursing robot--essentially greater penetration of machines into service jobs. I agree that they may never have true human-like experiences or creative abilities or free will, just advanced tools where the task is to provide services to humans through a NLP user interface.   What do you see as the biggest advance in evolutionary biology research in recent years? What are you most excited about for the field of evo bio going forward?   Carver   Thanks   We now have good genomes of modern humans closest relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisovans. It would be completely unethical to clone them, but it should be possible scientifically, and I think the result of observing them would radically change our perspective on human evolution and what it means to be human. I would love to know if they can use language and how they might experience the world in a way that was very similar to us yet perhaps also in ways that are extremely different.   The amount of meta reddit here just made me ... *happy*   What's your opinion on the following: My opinion is that he far more likely path to truly super-human intelligence is not through AI from scratch but through AI by augmentation of existing human brains, either as cyborgs with mechanical enhancements, or through genetic means at conception. It's far easier to start from what we know works than to build an intelligence from scratch. At the very least, there is a market for people who want to be smarter or who want smarter children, if such were available.   Sloppy joes for the little kiddies at school.   No, just ... bear.      Unfortunately I don't work with networks myself.   Thank you for your comments.   I should also mention game theory in studies of the evolution of cooperation/selfishness.   A good book to get is 'practical computing for biologists'. Python is overtaking Perl among biologists, and others probably have better recs than I have. Try http://swirlstats.com/students.html for learning R.   Population genetics is a very math heavy field in biology, with lots of mathematical models, probability theory, and statistical inference. Network theory, dynamical theory, and stochastic processes are important in many biological fields, including epidemiology, ecology, and cell/molecular biology, etc. There are a lot of interesting algorithmic developments right now in computational biology especially due to genomic technologies. tl;dr there are lots of applied mathematics, statistics, and computer science applications in biology.   Thanks for your perspective. Two things, it seems that if EEB students do know what they want to research, that does not facilitate rotations, when the small number of PI's who do the research they want to do rarely cluster in the same institution--moreover, the risk of misjudging a lab seems to make EEB students research their options more carefully, compared to a CMB student researching a program which might have faculty of interest but no guarantee of a position in their lab. While, there also seems to be a risk on the CMB side of not rotating through any "right" labs but having committed to a program, or is that just rare (rarer than EEB students who misjudge labs)?   Some other uses of computation (overlapping a lot with your suggestions): high throughout data gathering and analysis (e.g. next-generation sequencing studies, GIS for biogeography), simulations of evolutionary models for theoretical studies (e.g. simulating evolutionary dynamics), doing computationally-intensive Bayesian inference or machine learning (e.g. clustering for identifying population structure in genetic data).   Ah, yeah, good points.   But every state except Hawaii is north of the Tropic of Cancer.   If you want to do NLP, shouldn't you want to go to a program where you can interact with other people doing NLP? I'm not familiar with the admissions culture of CS to give comment on whether it would hurt your admissions chances, as that's somewhat program/field dependent.   I've definitely noticed the difference in personalities, but the insight on labor demands is new to me, and makes a lot of sense to me. I'd add that, at least in ecology, having an 'off-field' season probably means a lot more flexibility in structuring your time around analyzing data and writing, thinking about big questions, and professional development.   For example, the idea of doing rotations to find a lab seems extremely stressful to me, I don't really understand it.  Edit: I do have my own opinions on this matter (from my own biased EEB experiences), but am interested in other perspectives.   The reality is that the balloon metaphor is just that, a metaphor. The fact that space itself is expanding defies common sense intuition yet we know it to be true. This shouldn't be surprising; physics has again and again shown that the universe does not behave like what our intuition based on our limited sensual experiences would suggests. General relativity and quantum mechanics have many phenomena we know are true but which completely defy our intuition. An actual balloon can only expand into another space, yet the universe does not--all of space itself exists in a finite volume but that volume is getting bigger. There is no "space" outside of space, in the same way that there is no "time" before the beginning of time. Our intuition suggests space and time are infinite, but they are not, and if you think about it, there's no a priori reason they can't be finite.      Would they really make the most jobs? Seems like nuclear would employ the least number of people per gigawatt.  	109

 I won't know the difference if you put veggies in your "stock?"  That is laughable.  There is a reason that people wonder why restaurant  food is so good and they can't replicate it at home.  Stock is vegetable based.  What you are talking about making is broth, which is quite different from stock.  Not that it is bad or wrong, just two different things.   Ok.  Time justified!    Roasted bones.  Start it with cold water.  Raft it clean.    I would like to know why op spent more than 1/2hr making stock...   Nope. It was a call from bartenders to let people know it was last call.  Mind your pints and quarts!   almost everything you need to know about feeding children  http://news.nationalpost.com/the-kids-menu/   All good ones, and somehow you missed my favorite.  The one which I want believe to be true is that "the bars will be closed from 8 to 6 on Election Day."     Right. But why?    Random trivia!  Who knows where "86'd" came from?  I mean, I do.  But I love my bar trivia.  How about "mind your p's and q's?"  Or "wet your whistle?"  Hospitality trivia is the best!   Will you tell the owner I have some awesome beachfront property in AZ that I would love to show her?   Holy shit man.  I've no knowledge of legal stuff, but can this guy be taken to court somehow? Or did he do this "above board" as to how papers were signed?  I mean, how or why would the owner or management allow free drinks?  Free drinks? what in the holy fuck?   I'm actually an asshole, but I'm usually really nice about it :)   Interesting.  I'm glad to know that the McApplegarden tocque wearing food network wanna be fucktard hacks are everywhere and not just here. I mean, it does make me sad, but how and why and what the fuck?  I'm so glad I don't have to deal with restaurants anymore if I don't want to, but this asshole puts what we do in bad light.  I was accused recently of "helping" a shop into the ground to liquidate it.  Sure sure, I bought gear after they closed.  But they were closing before I walked in there and there was nothing nobody could do about it.  Simple fact, some places should close.  But when it happens intentionally...   Might look good, might taste better.  But please do our trade a favor and don't call yourself a chef.  I put gas in my car and change the oil, I ain't a fucking mechanic...   I mean, wow?  Sounds like some people need to disappear.  Is this consultant still around?  I mean, how in the hell do you run a shop into the ground, hoping to scrap it off into the brand new shop you open down the street and not wind up in a ditch?  If you don't mind, where are you located? I'm just curious as I thought it was fucked out here.  Wanna talk about theft?  One shop here was paying $38k monthly in rent.  Yes.  That number is correct.  They did for years.  How/why is beyond me.  But it's currently in court and they got the rent *dropped* to $12k/monthly.  I'm in New Mexico BTW.  Not even NYC...  Edit to add... The sq footage of that place is about 3200...   How and why was this guy hired if this is all true?  Does nobody make phone calls, follow ups, or send in there troops to do some sleuthing before hiring someone into a lead management position anymore?  I know this is the kind of shit you can't make up, cause I've seen a lot in my time.  But this guy makes the strawberry cranberry and celery pie I recieved for my birthday seem to be a grammatical error...   Stay home, unless you want to make a bad impression as someone who can't even make a reservation on the single busiest night of the year for restaurants.     Yes.  It is used daily for anything and everything.  I don't own a blender because I have an awesome processer!   Hence the title of the post ;)  Making bacon is easy.  Before you graduate to doing hang cures and pancettas, give your hand a try at some quick cures, salt box methods, smokes, etc.  It'll give you a better grasp of what is happening during the curing/drying process.  Which book did you pick up?  FYI.  Talin has awesome small chunks of skin on pork belly.  The 99  has decent stuff too, but you have to go into that store.  Also, if you ask nicely, the kind folks at The Alpine Sausage Kitchen *might* have some whole belly to part with.  Other than that, check the carnicerias in the area if you want belly and don't have access to restaurant wholesalers.   that is highly unfortunate.  On both accounts.   the carbonara it makes...  http://i.imgur.com/Q0XN1XK.jpg   Pasta - 2 cups flour (plus more to dust), 2 eggs, 1 yolk, 1 tsp salt.  Processed in a food processor and cut with a hand crank roller.    Pancetta - salt cure for 12 days.  Desalination for 36 hours.  Seasoned and hung for 3 weeks.  To make the dish.  Heat a saute pan hot hot hot.  Drop your pasta in boiling water.  Fry pancetta in a dry pan until slightly fonded and then add oil.  Fry until crisp and remove from pan, reserving fat.  In a stainless steel, warm bowl, crack an egg with 1 tsp minced garlic, punch of chopped parsley, punch of parm.  Mix and then slowly add in hot fat to create an emulsion.  Add pasta and toss.  Garnish with more parm, chopped parsley, and crisp pancetta.   http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2vkpef/fresh_fettuccine_carbonara_with_hatch_green_chile/      My house!  I'm up in SF and currently making myself a carbonara ;)         "They will offer a stage to anyone..."   Trues words couldn't be said.  I was just looking at the "about" section of a local $25 ala cart entree restaurant that was doomed to fail from the beginning.  It lists all the places that he staged at.  I want to go in there and ask him if he can teach me how to pick herbs...   You we're yelled at for a 1/2 hour and you feel you're being treated unfairly?  Would you care to explain why in the fuck you are still working there?  If you're as good as you say, just go get another job.  You don't have to put up with that BS and shouldn't.   Please explain to me how my employee, who is producing product at a rate of $x/hr in profit, is costing me money.  Edit to add...  I was talking about hourly wages of labor.  Not the fact that people lie, cheat, and steal.    Labor is neglible if you are producing efficiently.     Well fuck that person then...   Maybe the reason to not be there is inside the brick and mortar?  And maybe (depending on your position in the place) the guy did call.  Wouldn't be the first time a manager or an owner lied to their employees....   The Blowhard 3000 is also a perfect mushroom drying rack too!   100% I've been using his cardboard box smoker anywhere I don't have mine.  That man is a junkyard genius.  I opened this thread to see if someone had posted about the Blowhard 3000.   Also, if you drink alcohol, you can take a couple of tablespoons and dump it into a bottle of unflavored vodka and let it sit for a couple of weeks.  Filter it through cheesecloth or a fine mesh strainer and you'll have lemon vodka for drinks.  Another great use for the meyers is to make Lemoncello, which is fairly easy to do if you know anything about cooking...   One tsp per cup of sugar.  Shake it up and leave it in the cupboard for a few weeks.  Give it to people.  Perfect for frostings, cookies, tea sugar, etc.  Preserved lemons.  Lemon curd.  Sprinkle the dust over bowls of mixed fruit salad.  Lemon zest is also something that can be used extensively (in proper amounts) for pasta dishes.   Santa Fe, NM.  $50K+, 20 hours a week.  Private chef, recipe development, and restaurant consultant.   Try $240k ;)  But still a steal IMO...   No shit huh?  I stopped and ate at that place years back.  Now, when you want to talk about remote, that place is about it.   That is gorgeous.     there are a Handful of rooms sectioned off with several bathrooms.  One of the things I thought of when I looked at the space was some additional kind of production for grocery stores.  It is basically Halfway between Albuquerque and Denver.  I know for a fact that shipping pickup either way is easy and relatively cheap based upon previous work.   Just a restaurant can be made sustainable to make payments and a living, anything else would be gravy.  I see so much oppertinity in the place for the right person and little investment.  It is too bad that nobody really wants to do small town America anymore.  Then again, maybe someone will swoop this place up and do it right...   They want to sell it lock and key.  However, it has been on the market long enough that they would just like to get it to someone else and have mentioned that they would take a reasonable down and a % of sales until paid.  I believe that they just want to have someone else invest in the community.   I'm not the owner.  Just someone who has walked through of the property and has chatted with the realtor.  This was about 5 months ago.  They can't get anyone to take the property.  If we were ten years older with kids, we would jump on this place.  But the rural lifestyle isn't for us, we are actually looking to move back to the city.  However, I know for many people, this is a dream.  Random place in the middle of fucking nowhere.  Raton, NM has a population under 7K on I-25 between Santa Fe NM and Denver, CO.  In all honesty, a prime location that someone could make a mint at.  Simply because it is just off the interstate in the middle of nowhere and with social media, it would be easy to drive traffic.  There are so many benefits to this property is is crazy.  A rancher just across the way with organic certification who raises pig, cow, chicken, and goat.  Multiple hippie farms in the area growing veg.  The community would kill for an awesome cook to move into town and set up shop.  For what it is, this place could be had for a steal IMO.  It is right on a main shipping route corridor.  Traffic count on the freeway is huge.  The area is beautiful with great access to skiing, back packing, mushroom hunting, and everything else landlocked outdoors.  The kitchen has brand new stainless.  There are buildings to spare.  Which, to me would mean two things.  Smokehouse and curing room.  This place isn't for everyone, but it is looking for a new home.  Maybe I'm just trying to pay it forward in helping someone else out.  Or maybe I'm just killing time until the next piece of wood needs to hit the coals...  Happy smoking saturday r/bbq!  http://santafe.craigslist.org/bfs/4865647772.html    ....and this is why I quit doing fine dining.   Thanks.  It is my goal to take the knowledge I've accumulated and out it into a PDF cookbook/reference guide for ya'll.  You too can make sandwiches like this!   Crusty hoagie roll and yes.   RI?  You have me mistaken for someone else...   Thanks.  You have to take extra special care in cutting the hinge, otherwise you can't eat your sammich with one hand!   Not usually.  I hate throwing food out ;)   Sing it with me!  "Hoagies and grinders, hoagies and grinders..."      Proportions?  It'll be in the book ;)  I typically make about a half gallon at a time.  It keeps at least 2 weeks, probably about 3 if stored correctly.  I've never had it go bad or mold...   farmers cheese  http://i.imgur.com/ppMxSFg.jpg   Colby, sharp white cheddar, med orange cheddar, pepper jack, pecorino, parm, mozz, dry farmers.      Yep.  Ya do.      That is one of the best ideas for a pool ever.   Fuck the knife.  I care about the table.   Grub on!  But why would you stand there and take a picture of a guy using a serrated blade on a stainless steel table?   You can stop talking about federal and state funding.  The argument behind it is invalid.  Simply because we already place those funds in other areas.  The money is currently allotted.  It is about application of resources.  It is called capitalism and economics inside the manufacturing process.  For sometime, solar has been at the break even point.  However, because it hasn't been inside the consumer marketplace, you can't even discuss how profitable it is.  The simple fact (and this comes directly out of the mouths of the manufactures) that over half of the built solar technology never sees the sun, refutes the claim that it isn't "profitable."  We honestly don't know if it is, or isn't.  But tell me this.  How can you say is not profitable, when I/you/Joe Blow can outfit a house to be off the electrical grid here, pretty much anywhere in NM, for around $10K in material?  Would you like to rephrase your statement and say that solar isn't profitable for the companies that currently run our energy exchanges?  Or would you like to hold onto the stance of being a fucking dumbass?   By Crom all mighty man, in New Mexico liquor licenses sell starting at 50K and push up to 500K.  Depending on where and what kind.  And that ain't even the tax.  That is just the permission to sell.  Or you can opt to lease them from the private holder (if allowed by the state) to the tune of $3-5K monthly and then pay the state an operation + sales tax on top of it.  I say, $25k?  Do it and consider yourself lucky.     As long as the old guard is in power, we won't have things like this.  The current NM administration is against alternatives to fossil fuels and will fight them every step of the way.  For example.  When the new Walmart was proposed to be built in Santa Fe, there was a community cry to demand that if construction was to be built, that water cisterns and solar panels be required on the building.  It was in traction in the city and county.  Martinez's team came in and squashed it.   Yeah, about that.  This is a misconception based upon information that is 30 years old.  Just FYI.   Less than that. Like 4:1?     To a certain extent, yes.  Can you control the environment in that way?  No.  It is a good trick for at home use, I do it all the time.  For those experimenting and getting a hang of how salt works, it is a good trick.  However, I would call the consistency of the mush I make to be wet salt, rather than salted water.   Most states allow for curing on site and selling directly via retail, but have different provisions for wholesale.  Standard safety procedures and they don't care about pink nothing.  Start with bacon and pancetta first.  Salt box cures, smokes, and short hangs.  Easy easy.  Move to duck prosciutto.  These 3 cures you can do open air in your garage if you like. Than move to coppa and other small whole muscle.  After that, start dealing with grinds.  You can set up a curing chamber for under $350 if you have a suitable fridge.  Double doors are best, but a beverage fridge works just fine. Don't have one? grab a refab for $200.  Just make sure the seals are good.  If you need instructions to build one and where to order the humidifiers and what not, let me know.  This shit is a science. But is has also been happening in caves along the seashore of the Mediterranean for ages. As others have said, you can kill people.  But chances are that you won't.  Don't bullshit with the nitrate and nitrites.  They are necessary.  They are dangerous.  But don't listen to anyone tell you that they are bad for you.  Science says otherwise and some quick research will help you educate others on the matter.  Curing meat is fun.   Sure sure.  Some people can do that.  It is quite rare though.  However, I highly doubt your internet toughness since you can't format or spell...   Fucking whatever.  Wages are so low because people like you accept them.   what the fuck did you just say?   What to call this?  A reason to learn how to cook?   or maybe he doged a bullet because he doesn't live to work.   Reccomendations please!  I'm headed that way at the end of March :)   Why?    Hot pastrami with kraut.   I don't understand how it would be strange.  I'm in New Mexico and all the good "native" food here is a cross between spanish and mexican.     St. Louis and Decatur. Been there 60+ years.  They rip off drunks, tourists, and lawyers alike.  That place is legit.    In all honesty, both.            The general rule is that if you show up with baked goods or a casserole and are willing to move some wood, you are welcome by the fire.  I've met a bunch distant family out there...   Now that is something I feel to be completely within the real of reason.  I've been trying to explain such things to my vegetarian girlfriend.  She doesn't get it.   Bigger piece had just been washed of a green chile cure.  Top white - preserved lemon salt pork  Middle Black - Hatch Green Chile "pancetta"  Bottom red - Chimayo Red Chile rubbed and cold smoked   Not much.  Bigger piece is about 2 1/2.  So I'd say somewhere between 4-5 total.     Every time I stop by her place, she hands me a jar.  I never know what kind it is until we check the notebook.  The jars are pulled off the shelf in the back room where there are hundreds more, all waiting for hands like mine.  Mom is a real gem.  No one goes without and while we can talk about barter, she always says the best trade you can give is some more room in your heart for her and to share your bounty with others.  I wish there were more people like this in the world.  http://i.imgur.com/uVTEItk.jpg      Dammit!  Now you have me questioning my sensibilities...   I attempt to live my life Swason approved.  Tomorrow I will go buy another whole belly to get my standards up.   I don't want to over complicate anything or try 15 different attempts to get these right.  Simply because I probably will never make these again.  There is so much just terrible BS online of what people call good, it is hard to sift.  I'm hoping someone can go *poof* here you go!   I pulled the piece on the left out of salt a bit ago to desalinate.  And I realized, while I finished off another end piece last night, I still had 3 other pieces in the fridge...       A friends mom passed away suddenly and I was asked if I could make scones for the reception next week.  I have no clue what I'm doing in those regards.  I'm a trained and accomplished cook, but baking vegan food is off my radar.  Any help would be greatly appreciated...   That is just impressive.  I mean, I understand the other posters questions of how/where/why and all that.  I mean, the first thing that went through my head was "Where in the hell did that happen and why was I not there?"  I mean, holy hell.  That is absolutely not necessary.  But I can't believe how awesome it is.  The only real question I think should be addressed is how can that be wrapped in bacon?   A couple of other pics from the making...  http://i.imgur.com/nCBRS66b.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/fCX6Oyub.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/I91T0Ydb.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/auWCp5Vs.jpg     I'm making posole with red chile rubbed and smoked chicken thighs and green chile smoked lardons.  So far, all the components are fairly fantastic...      I'm not going to go thru to many details in a public forum nor via reddit PM.  Do you have an online portfolio of places you've opened/flipped/fixed?  PM me an email and we can take it there...  How would you feel if I told you that with a little help I could walk into any market, tailor a restaurant to the local demographic, and start turning a profit in short order?  Having a large market such as LA   SD, are you looking to keep that vicinity?  Or are you willing to branch?   Where are you located?    About?    Thanks!  And I'll tell you the same thing as everyone else who tells me I should be slinging grub out of a shop - if you have $100K you want to float to open a restaurant, I'll either pay you back 10 points in 2 years or double your money in 5.  Your choice.  No BS and for real.  I can provide the numbers for it.  If ya got it and you're interested, lets talk :)  In short, yes I have an extensive culinary background...   I'm currently in Santa Fe.  I'm getting ready to move somewhere to open a sandwich shop or truck.  Dunno where yet though.  In the meantime, I'm in the process of writing a couple of cookbooks. One being about sandwiches from scratch.   Next time, crack up the heat on your press by 50 degrees.  Before it hits the press, throw it on the cool side of your flat top.  Toss a bowl over it and steam that fucker for a minute on each side.  Then, brush it with butter and put it in the press.    Two things will happen, both of which will give you a better sandwich.  One, your cheese will be melted and it will be hot through.  Two.  You will get a nice crispy and brown butter crust on the bread.  Seriously, give it a try.  This technique will enhance your skills/palate as a cook and simply improve your life through better sandwiches.  No bullshit.  If you would like verification that I know what the fuck I talk about...  http://imgur.com/a/BYZRe   Well, I'm going to have to do something like that.  I didn't realize people would want something like this.  Folks are even offering to pay me and I'm all, fuck man, I just want to make some snacks...   That is basically what I've been working on.   Carbonated water.   Ummm.....  I just winged it.  Something like this...  1 and 1/2 pound cheese (I had chvre, cream, and goat ricotta in the fridge)  4 eggs  3 or 4 T cream to thin if needed  Seasoning (fine herbs, savory, etc)  Bake at 350 in a half blind baked tarts shell until set and lightly browned, approx 30-35 min.   I do restaurant consulting, recipe development, and private chef/catering work.  Plus I teach food, foraging, and work with local ranchers and farmers min/maxing their productions.  I work, but not for other people and only on my terms.  I'm just blessed with a girl who is happy to pay my daily rate to keep me home ;)  However.  She would eat like that every day regardless if I still pulled 50hr weeks.  I like food and believe everyone should eat well.     I'll tell you what.  I'm in the process of finishing up a couple of cookbooks.  One of em is to be tailored to Redditors/office workers specifically on this topic, based upon all the work I've done for my girl over the last 2 years.  Writing a book on the matter wasn't something I wanted to do, it was requested from her coworkers and from some random redditors.  I currently have it slimmed down to 60 different boxed lunches with recipes for them all, 5 items in each lunch (300 recipes).  I'd like to trim it down to about half that.  If you're interested in getting a copy when I'm done, PM me and I'll add your name to the list of recipients.  It will be in PDF and tablet formats and I'm hoping to have it done in the next 6-8 weeks.   I'd like to think so.  But it is part of our deal.  She likes having a personal chef at home, I don't want to work for other people.  We both seem to be making out well with this arrangement...   Think about single serving water bottles as ice blocks (20oz bottles work best for me).  They will keep a lunchbox sized cooler cold for a day and you don't have to worry about the blue freeze packs leeking fluid.  What you are asking about is something that I do daily for my GF.  Down to the fact that she doesn't have a fridge at work, but a nuke.  She works 12-14hr shifts, so I send her a lot of grub.  Today, I sent a piece of goat cheese quiche, mixed fruit salad, hummus and tzatziki with dipping veg, applesauce, sloppy joe mix, bubble water, and chocolate truffles.  I write weeks of menus for her at a time.  If you need ideas, shout away...   Hanging over the kitchen sink.  That is straight up legit.   you are almost correct.  however, it is fett.  i also don't want to offend the internet police and call something a carbonara that has vegetables in it...   That cheese is softened by indirect heat.  It is melted.      Sure sure.  But just because you know how to cook an omelette, it doesn't mean that you know how, or should be trusted, to raise hens.  You simply don't have the experience to do so.   You've been trying to interview for jobs since you were 10?  And people don't take you seriously?  You're going to claim 12 years experience at 22?  Experience in what?  Stacking boxes?     This pic is how I rack a piece of meat (no more than 2 inches) to air cure for more than 24 hours without a humidifier.  Make sure the pepper/seasoned crust is nice and tight.  Hit the meat and the salt in the pan with a spray mister ever other day.  As long as you have your ratios proper and the temp is under 55, you're good like this.  Duck breast is 1 day down, 4 or 5 days up using this method.  I've taken pork belly up to a month.  Rib eyes do well like this too.   http://i.imgur.com/nR0dtNq.jpg   Don't be scared.  It's not rocket science.  Don't fuck with the humidifier in the garage, it's not worth it.  Specifically if you have things that you don't want damp.  I can help you set it up to where you can slide a pan onto a shelf and you're good.  If you're interested.  As long as you have an under 55 degree room, a child can set it up to do open air month long cures.  I mean, if they can read.  I always tell people that if you can bake cookies you can make bacon AND beer.  I've been curing meat in my garage, spare bedrooms, fridges, chambers, at salumi makers, and hanging up in a damn tree outside in the middle of winter for years.  Don't be scared.  Worse thing that is going to happen (if you're not a fucking dumbass) is you get a little belly gurgle.  Live a little.  Take a fucking chance.  People have been dealing with food this way for thousands of years.  I don't understand why people are so afraid of germs and bacteria.  Don't be afraid of Darwin.  Know and understand him and you'll do just fine ;)  Smokehouse.  You said a magic word there.  That is a different beast all together, 100%.  But, it is some of the same principles.  And if you still have access to a smokehouse, good for you.  That is a piece of history and Americana that most people have never even heard of.  And yet was a staple on every farm until the early 1900's...   Well, it depends on if you think you know what you're doing.  But people have being doing stranger things with their cured meats for a lot longer than you've been thinking about it.  I mean, seriously.  Think about the conditions people have been doing this kind of preserving in around the Mediterranean.  For thousands of years.  It has only been the last 100 years or so that we've had any kind of hard scientific data on all of it.   Under 45 for some time now.  It bottomed out at 34 a couple of weeks ago when it was seriously fucking cold out.  	122
 Freaks and Geeks. I watched it as a kid when it aired and identified with the geeks and watching it now I identify with the Freaks. Someday I'll watch it and identify with the parents. It's a great show that has lasting power and something for all generations.    I loved Repilot. The ending was alright for season 5. Personally though, season 5 is my 2nd favorite  season   Well, Season 6 is my least favorite but 7 and 8 are just ok. They moved on from the movie business part of it in favor of b-storylines with the other characters. Season 5 (my favorite season) is the last time until the movie that we see really what goes on behind the scenes of making a movie   I actually thought it was great. The cameos were plentiful for sure but most never took up more time than needed. I liked Ronda Rousey (although you are right, she is not great at acting). For me, I always loved the characters but the last few seasons missed what I personally loved about the show, the behind the scenes of getting a movie made. This movie brought that back and I really enjoyed it more than seasons 6-8. Yea, it didn't have a whole lot of heart but what it did was well done (Johnny's arc in particular). The connection of Vince's troubles is shown slightly in the Piers Morgan show but it doesn't weigh on that because there is not enough time. That would only fit in in the series and if it were in the movie, it would have been even more "crammed" as you said. This movie is a glimpse into the end stages of a movie and being that we know the characters and can't follow the entire production, we are caught up pretty well.   I never felt that it was to crammed or half assed but that's just my opinion.    People, stop trying to relive the glory days. Community has evolved. I wouldn't want them to turn back.    Its an app to watch Ultraviolet digital copies and story your library. It works with Chromecast as well. And its an all in one app, it has trailers, info, rotten tomatoes scores and your personal ratings.    Blu-Ray on the big screen with surround. Also rent on the google play store and use the chromecast on the big screen. And streaming services, Netflix, Flixster, HBOGo   Link Me: UpTo Calendar   Frank hit the jackpot!   I think there were some good episodes but mostly not as good ones. But really the finale of season 4 jumped the shark with doing Paintball again and saying they found a way to make paintball cool again but it was totally lame and super forced. But like I said, that was fixed in season 5   I don't expect them to not talk about it. But there are many die hard fans like myself that can't do that. All I ask is to use the spoiler tag and not put the spoiler in the title of the post. That's not asking much.   And I do wish Yahoo released episodes like normal TV time slots. 7pm or whatever to give everyone a fair chance to see it before it's spoiled.    All of season 4, but they reversed it in repilot and all was well   No need to take it like that. I merely meant, don't spoil anything for people who have not seen it. I'm certain I am not the only person who had to wait until after work to watch it because I can't stay up until 3. I created a multireddit that had every subreddit I subscribe to except Community just for Tuesdays because the first few weeks I had a bunch of stuff spoiled. And going back through the community subreddit each day after I watched it, I noticed a ton of posts that would have spoiled stuff.   But yes, on a personal level, I did miss out on most of the discussion each week because by the time I watched it, everything had already been discussed.    Ha, yea. But still. No new episodes does suck...    Not worrying if /r/community will spoil anything from a new episode since they watched it at 3am and are already putting up quotes and discussions all day until I can watch it after work.    Same thing here, haha   Yea, I don't mean to cut down the show at all. If it wasn't good, I wouldn't spend the time to get caught up for the next season.    Not saying that you are false. But either way, we got a season 6 because of them and they could have easily not done it.    Sorry, by the time I got to this thread, it had a spoiler tag. Must have been added after your comment   And so it is delivered my favorite Pierce line "Jeff, i think your shirt is trying to get out of your pants". So subtle but i laugh every time.   I dont know if this counts dramedies but Shameless and Better Call Saul would be mine   I love the show but every season so far I've gotten like 3 episodes behind and just end up binging the rest of the season once it's all done. It's well acted and intriguing but falls by the wayside in favor of other shows until I have time. This season I even told myself I wouldn't let it happen... But it did.    Upvote for awesome show AND ballsy but awesome username   Maybe you should get an app that doesn't automatically show the body of the post. Even if a post's title says "Spoilers", the body always says said spoilers   Start at "Fast   Furious". That's the fourth movie. That is where the storyline picks back up with the original cast. Then go in order "Fast Five", "Fast   Furious 6". Then watch "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift" because chronologically, that's where it belongs and it's actually pretty good. Then "Furious 7".   The only other one was Hulu but talks fell through because it was too expensive. The contracts for the cast were expiring the day after Yahoo announced the Pick up. No Yahoo, no season 6.   Considering that board is from 2 years ago and in this case "Ham" isn't replacing "Damn" and it's not even for Chang's character... I'd say no.    By that logic, NBC owed us a proper ending. And we don't "deserve" anything. We are incredibly lucky to have had 6 seasons of this show that could have been canceled after 1 season. It's very arrogant for us fans to say they owe us and we deserve this. Yahoo gave us a season 6, they did not need it. They have a well received concert series and could bought any other recently cancelled show that has a following.   They could have bought any other recently cancelled show that has a following. Even ones that supposedly had more viewership than Community. Yes, we brought attention to Yahoo Screen but so did their concert series (which is how I first heard of it) and a ton of us ungratefully bitched about issues using Yahoo Screen.    I saw it again this weekend (saw an Advanced Screening and my brother wanted to go this weekend). I was a big fan of the Entourage TV series (especially seasons 1-5) and really enjoyed the movie. I just hope more people go see it.    "I Love You, Man". It's just a great movie that has a super funny cast   I had never seen a Mad Max movie before but was convinced to by Reddit. I didnt hate, just didnt think it was perfect like most on here. Anyway, it was just a joke. I didn't mean to hijack this thread.   I know there is... I just had to be a smart ass because it's not much of a plot.    It only made $3 mil less than expected in the opening weekend. WB never expected it to be the next big blockbuster. They should be able to recoupe the 27 mil budget and hopefully make money   Mad Max: Fury Road with a movie that has plot   They kinda gave us another season when the show was cancelled. No Yahoo, no season 6.   The creators have said that Holt and Gina will not be at the 99 but will still be on the show and will explore their new jobs   https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pearl+harbor+trailer+%231   No, because the difference is that he was playing William Hartnell. He was only playing The 1st Doctor as Hartnell and none of it was featuring new story. Only re-creation of Hartnell's stories in a biopic. If he were playing a new Doctor in a new story or even the 1st Doctor in a new story, then yes. But that is not the case.    I love this show. It's one of my favorite shows of all time and I've been with it since the pilot aired. We lived through Cancelation threats, hiatuses, major staff changes, character departures, actual Cancelation and renewal once again. Throughout all of this Community defied all odds and was consistently great (besides season 4 of which we know why). And we beat Cancelation... We won. We got 6 seasons of this incredible show. That should be enough for us fans especially considering the continuous quality that is difficult to maintain for most long running shows.   Having said that, I will definitely watch it if there is more but I am finally ok with it ending.    Season 5 was my 2nd favorite season (behind season 2) and Season 6 was better than season 1 and 4 for me.    I like 5 and 6 more than i like season 1.   It's not a perfect finale but I thought it was good. I enjoyed it as an episode. Anyway, watch Season 7 of Curb Your Enthusiasm if you want to get a partially new episode of Seinfeld. The storyline is that Larry David (starring in Curb as fictionalized version of himself/creator of Seinfeld) decides to do a Seinfeld reunion episode. The entire season has all of the meetings with the cast and crew, table reads, writing, dress rehearsals, and footage of the "reunion episode". It's pretty cool   They made reference in season 6. Frankie says "I keep emailing the IT Lady but they keep getting bounced back to me". Since she is both Frankie and the IT Lady.   Also, no offense, but the season 5 episode with Paget Brewster aired over a year ago and the episode referenced in season 6 was a couple months ago now. With how quick some Community fans are, it's safe to assume that anything found months after the episode would have been posted.    They should really just rename this sub /r/MadMaxandsomeothermovies   Just so you are aware, Season 6 of Community is on Yahoo Screen. Just finished last week.   Nope, they just finally took advantage of being on the Internet and not network TV.    You got me there, but most of them are terrible and forced. And that type of finale is not right for Community   Haha!    Your description of what you wanted for a finale is exactly what happened. "The future will be uncertain, but we'll keep in touch and get through it together with the community we built". That explains exactly what happened. You only see it as a lazy writer deal because you personally know that they purposefully left it open. But you take that out of it and it is a well written finale that yes, has a opening for more, but also serves as a very good series finale and is Community at its best. Hilarious, sad, thought provoking, incredibly meta, and when you get down to it, about the characters.   As for the potential comment, I see what you mean now. I thought you meant the entire series initially. But I also disagree with you that seasons 5 and 6 were anything less than strong even though we have lost great characters. But that's just our differing opinions.    Oh, ok. Cool   He actually wasn't an issue for me. I've always liked Topher Grace   I haven't seen it so I don't know if that is a diss. But I've seen him in Friday Night Lights and he was very good   That is a movie I would watch   That feels so right.    That "someone else" exists. Their name is Sony. They forced things into the movie that Sam Raimi did not want to do   The finales that wrap everything up are the most unrealistic and worst finales. It was meant to feel teasing for the viewer and for the characters. The uncertainty of the end is what made us fans a Community and now it's the thing that they end on. That's amazing to me. I think this was a very good season (not lackluster) and to say the show never realized it's full potential is unreal. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen.   And you say you don't like that the end did not fully wrap everything up but you want more?    I started watching when the pilot aired. I started watching the show because Chevy Chase was back on TV but I stayed for all of the characters and the witty writing. I knew right away that I liked the show and as the first season went along, it started to show signs of the amazing writing of Dan Harmon and crew. The first episode that led up to Paintball was the Chicken Fingers episode. That was the first true concept ep. When paintball came, by that point I was in love with the show. I knew it was coming from the promos but until I actually saw it, I had no idea how good it would be and in that way, it blew me away.   I only joined Reddit a year ago so I was kind of on an island for awhile since no one I knew watched it.    Because it shouldn't be an issue. He is a really good actor and got a good role. End of story.    Maybe... Probably... Maybe.   That was an incredible episode. Amazing season finale and perfect series finale if that is in fact it.   Also, loved the f-bombs   There were parts that I liked and I wanted to love the movie but just couldn't   No problem. Just thought it was funny. But you may be right. Unless he met Pavel first?    Spider-Man 3. It had so much hype coming off of Spider-Man 2 and it was before I read reviews or anything so my expectations were so high. The entire movie I was fighting with myself trying to think it's good but then the emo dancing douchey Peter Parker just absolutely made me go "This sucks". I was so incredibly disappointed   Seriously.../u/Masri788 watched six seasons and thought it was Geoff Winger?    Nope, I just watched it a few days ago again and really enjoyed it.    Due to low ratings on NBC, the creator/showrunner Dan Harmon and Chris McKenna were fired. They hired two others who tried their best with the writers and cast to replicate Community but what we got was a empty shell. It looked like Community and sometimes felt like it, but mostly it was just trying too hard to be Community.  Dan and Chris were hired back for season 5 and 6 and it is very noticeable. Seasons 5 and 6 are great. You could skip 4 but id say just stick it out.   Holy Shit! Was he? I'll have to rewatch   More. They projected $12-15 mil initially for the whole weekend. Then  updated it to $20 mil. Now it could be more if it has staying power through the weekend   Magnitude was in an episode but he never said "Pop Pop"    You are the winner for best reference of the day... Incredible   /r/MadMax   Having thought about it the last few days since someone first brought it up just before the finale. I initially said, if Dan Harmon is doing it, I'd watch it. But two things dawned on me. First, Dan would never do it. Second, I'd much rather see Dan Harmon write a brand new show with a whole different concept just with the same humor. It's time to let go.   I just had never seen a Alien movie before. I finally watched Alien, Aliens, and Prometheus and loved them.   But I can see how hype would kill it.    Didn't know that. Interesting   Yea, we were lucky to get him in season 5   Yea, it gets a lot of flack for not having a point. The point is that it's a reason to get these funny people together. Best movie ever? No. But it's entertaining for sure   I'm pretty sure most people liked American Hustle. As did I   I only just recently saw it and really enjoyed it. Didn't know most people hated it   Absolutely! As someone else said, it starts slow but really gets good   Jesus did   According to Pierce, its an original song   Gay Dean   1. Modern Espionage 2. Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television 3.

Love both of them. I liked Hickey because Jonathan Banks is awesome but these two ended up fitting in so well.    If you want the glory days, rewatch the other seasons. This season, although not the best season, really was excellent and still had the Community humor I love. It's not supposed to leave you with the "Good Ol Times" feeling. The show changed, it went through many major changes and dealt with them in the most Community way. If you don't like it, fine. But to say it's "not Community" is way off base.   And I never found Elroy or Frankie to be that much quirkier than the rest of the group nor were they forced. They fell naturally into the group and they didn't spend too much time focused on their characters. Yet they developed them slowly throughout the season   Entourage was so good seasons 1-5 and then just left all of the behind the scenes of making movies and went all about b-storylines. The movie is great though.    It has never been on US Netflix instant. But seasons 1-5 have always been on Hulu   There is a thing called the Internet. And, although I starting watching when the pilot first aired, I survived 4 and a half seasons before joining Reddit. Since joining, there has rarely been a moment of the show that I missed a joke or reference. I've seen the Harmontown movie but never listened to the podcast. I have however read many many articles and follow his rants on social media. Which all will exist after the fact.  I think future Community fans will be fine. Sure, they won't quite have the huge moments of joy (renewals and new instant classic episodes) and low points (delays, Cancelation threats, Dan and Chris fired, actual cancelation) but that history exists on the Internet. And anyone who finds this show and loves it, will search out the story behind it   If at all possible, IMAX 2D. If not, regular 2D then IMAX 3D   That is exactly what I said   Jurassic Park and Jurassic World both take place on Isla Nublar. Jurassic Park: The Lost World and Jurassic Park III take place on the 2nd island, Isla Sorna. I think there may be references to them but you should be fine only having seen the first   If they do it, he has to play the same character from the Jump Street movies   I have made peace finally that that might be it. It was perfect. Having said that, I would absolutely love more Community if they can continue the quality and keep the cast   Good luck getting him, but yes, that would be awesome!    I liked it but didn't love it. It felt like it dragged a little bit. But the cast was great and it was a solid first direction by Joseph Gordon Levitt   Totally agree   I saw the movie but also am a big fan of the series. I would say you will be ok, you'll miss out on some of the relationships between characters and inside humor but overall you will be good. And it is a good movie   Yup, that was one of the reasons I starting watching and I'm glad I did. It has Jeff from Curb Your Enthusiasm, Young JB from Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny, and Rita from Bridesmaids   Step back from the ledge, it's still entirely possible we get another season or the movie. Even if not, was that not the most perfect ending you could have asked for?   	102
 As you said it, it does require a lot of commitment, especially mentally, because you have to treat the kids deliberately and need to listen carefully. I think, if someones not able to fully concentrate on the kids (for whatever reason), the person of reference is more likely to act pedagogically irresponsible... and since they are more or less responsible for the kids  development, they must thrust aside their personal problems.   It's been awesome! Although it was tough sometimes, because either some of the kids where quite suspicious and had problems with opening up at least a little bit (which is quite understandable, since they were neglected for the most part of their life and don't even really know what trust means), or because they wouldn't listen. But after a while, when they knew I was there with the best intentions, that I cared, listened and that I really liked spending time with them, I had the best experience in my life!   May I ask, what exactly do you think you're not sure you would be able to handle?     "Can I tell you what I think?" love this one   when it comes to every day life, I just try to be nice and understanding. and I smile a lot for positive forces.  in my school years I guided new students, to get along with everyday school life, showed them in which project groups they can become involved etc. I also volunteered in a protectory and now I'm going to volunteer in a home for physically and mentally disabled people, which I'm really curious about... this is probably going to be a decent challenge...   	4
 No, the Soviet leadership was corrupt on its own and then killed itself. Afghanistan didn't help but still   I think you are claiming "evil" to be objective. which is completely and utterly stupid   evil is subjective.  To people who the US has invaded, Black Americans in Poverty, the Native Americans would see the US as evil  White middle class workers, first world nations, and Latin-american Immigrants would all see the US as bastions of Freedom   LOL I just got the mental image of Rambo shaking hands with Assad  r/PhotoshopBattles   So this one will be "Dedicated to the brave Shia warriors of Iraq"  (10 years later)  OH WHAT THE FUCK   Do you disagree that there is a connection?   well communism as marx wrote (statelessness) hasn't happened yet, and you could make the case Cuba, China, Vietnam, etc were all endorsing Stalinist forms of government. So quite possibly  	7

I'm in   Damn, I wonder how the dudes in the humvee they lit up with the cannon fared.   Our gunny told the local people that there were gnomes that ate people living on the mountain top and showed them a picture from the movie gremlins. It scared the shit out of them and they mostly avoided the mountain after that. In reality there was a bunch of russian mines up there.   I was in Afghanistan in 2010. We used to always ask a bunch of standard counter insurgency type questions: have the Taliban been around recently, have the local soldiers given them any trouble, have the Americans given them any trouble, have they heard anything about weapons/ieds, is anyone in their family in need of medical care etc. Our last question would always be "Do you know where Osama Bin Laden is?" This always got a bunch of laughs.   Yup, if I was the boss I'd also want to know if any of my employees had excessive credit card debt, were cheating on their spouse, had any chronic medical conditions, used any illegal drugs etc. That doesn't mean it is the responsibility of anyone and everyone to inform me of these things. It doesn't sound to me like your friends are so terribly concerned with the reputation of the PI and lab as much as they are excited about "getting" the the heckler.

Probably was thinking "finally won't have to deal with this nut anymore."   It may appear that way when you see them used in COIN but things would look very different in a conventional war. That tank would be operating with infantry and artillery support, so anyone shooting missiles is going to be on the receiving end of artillery, auto cannon, and machine gun fire. Few (if any) high end antitank missile systems are disposable so you may get shot off but the system will likely be destroyed by the return fire when the launch signature is noticed. Disposable systems are very unlikely to score a hit and short ranged enough to be almost suicidal in anything but an urban environment. There also is the issue of transport. Man portable anti tank systems might be fairly effective in a static defensive role but then you just get killed from the air and by artillery. If you want to maneuver you need to be transported in trucks, which are not very survivable.   Small voting block with influence far far far exceeding their numbers due to financial resources. They do generally vote left but if you think support for Israel only comes from the American right you haven't been paying attention. The reason the evangelicals like israel so much is because of a concerted effort by the israeli government to recruit and groom their leaders.    large amount of campaign funding for American politicians  ding. ding. ding.   I loved it back in the day when I did shift work.    I don't speak retard either, still confused      Sure, why not spend a few hundred  mil on a new city hall, I mean, what else would we spend the money on?   It looks like a war-crimes tribunal after world war III   In other words...people say things that sound good when they don't have to back it up with anything. In other news, I'm against child sexual exploitation and cancer. I know, I'm a pretty good person.   I don't speak tumblr, I don't know what this means   yup   I read this title as "Denver Police Office" and I was thinking "well a major metro department, 40 complaints and a million in settlements isn't really that bad" then I reread the title.   that pig had it coming   as was the style at the time   I thought you guys called them "oculists"   [it could be worse....](http://i.imgur.com/CT85Ae6.jpg)   Anecdotally, the problem with a lot of activists is that their primary technique is telling people that their beliefs are wrong and stupid.   Man, I want to Iraq and all I got was lots of money and benefits.   In my experience they would just get assigned to "headquarters platoon" AKA shitbag platoon. You get to spend the deployment digging holes, stirring burning shit barrels, filling sandbags, picking up trash etc.   dude, she has 72K tweets.....

Well, you could say it's kind of a luxury for your greatest fear to be your democratically elected government as apposed to a rampaging horde of assholes rolling over the boarder.   does this mean I'm gonna have to give up my handicapped parking space?   do you have a citation?   smoked pot and banged hookers the whole time  I think this makes me like him more   "The Shit" is old American slang for combat in the Vietnam War. This is a Wes Anderson movie, his style of humor is known to be kind of understated. People generally either love it or hate it.   He asked a very loaded question in a remarkably casual way and Murray responded with a very serious answer in an even more casual way. If you don't find that funny you're not "missing anything," you just have a different sense of humor.    As far as I'm concerned Murray's "second career" started in 1998 with this exchange: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4qQ66LgM1c#t=33   wait is this a real quote?   I bet ANYTHING he is suffering from some kind of ED and is too embarrassed to tell you.   It's not illegal, just frowned upon   Fuck, make it 50% and have it go to the MBTA   I love them, bring up student loans next, I want to laugh at some people.   sounds like he is a rude, lazy, douche...what does this have to do with the fact that he's from a small town and his family has less money than yours? It's interesting that you feel that way.   took the words from my mouth   so true   A long time ago when I was in a human anatomy lab: I dreamed that my lab group was sitting around our cadaver in fancy dress slicing up the body with fancy silverware and gobbling it down.   A CHURCH AND A LIBRARY??!!! Now they've gone too far!!   Cabbie's Cab   bwahahahaha   wait till the snow melts...:(   We should have just ignored the airspace thing. Ireland couldn't shoot down a 747 flying over their country if they wanted to.   I love it   you can just look through the iron sights and see the red dot, or you can fold the iron sight down.   It's still an insanely broad, sensational headline and the idea that a handful of nuts in a trailer park is more of a threat than the Islamic State is just beyond comprehension. Even the dog thinks it's retarded.      Looks like area bombing is gonna make a comeback   I wasn't intending to be hard on the French, my point was that things happen fast and the idea of "building up" in response to an invasion is a joke. Things today would likely happen much faster than during WW2 and at least then France was EXPECTING an invasion. Now Europe just has its head in the sand AND depends on Russia for much of its natural gas. Yes nukes are out there but I somehow doubt the willingness of France or GB to be wiped off the map for Poland or Romania...or perhaps even Germany. Yes there are satellites, but how long would it take the Russians to mobilize? Certainly less time than for the Germans to build 2000 tanks and train 500,000 men. Lets not forget that the first day of the war could involve Russian strategic bombers hitting high value targets all over western Europe...a move to which the allies would be incapable of responding in kind.    So what you are saying is France was much more prepared to fight than Europe is today and STILL got violently raped by a force without 1/10th the mechanization of the modern Russian military in 45 days. What you're also saying is that the Americans were unprepared for WW2 and got kicked around for the first year or two while they got their shit together....those two oceans were mighty convenient. Too bad Berlin is less than a 20 hr drive from Moscow.   I'm actually descended from Germans that came over in the 1700's but the vast bulk of Germans came over in the mid-1800's to early 1900's (ie several hundred thousand vs 5+ million).   I've got a scenario for everyone in this thread. Say the USA pulls out of Europe and says "not our problem anymore." If Russia turns off the gas, rolls through Belarus with a wink and a smile, and then heads into Poland....when would NATO stop them? Would they deploy their forces to the front in Poland, or safe them do defend their own borders? How about when they got to Germany? Yea, France and GB have nukes...when would they use them? If they did Russia would respond and put them back in the dark ages. Would they take that for Poland? For Germany? For Belgium? What if they Stopped at the Elbe and sued for peace...would you accept?   That takes time. Last time Europe played the "its never gonna happen again" game France fell in 45 days.   It was so great that so many germans left the region that they form the largest ancestry group in the United States.   to quote my (straight) female friend "penis out of context horrifies me"   Does anyone know how to reliably tell who is who in these videos if no one is displaying insignia?   Which line?   someone needs to make a "men react to vag pics"   who is this "exact same crowd"   You don't have to. The prosecutor has to prove that you killed the person and you weren't defending yourself.    It would probably come down to the physical evidence....   Absolutely, we should have saved the $1000 and let the Northern Alliance deal with him.    There may be people that can answer this a little better, I think unfortunately this may be a crap shoot to a degree. You could say something like, "I'm a very inquisitive person and I like to take an active role in my medical care, do you think your style of care is compatible with a patient who asks a lot of questions?" Unfortunately, I think that the vast majority of doctors would say "yes of course," even if this wasn't really the case. The best would be if you know someone who is very satisfied with their GP and go to that doctor. There are online review sites, but my personal feeling is that they are basically worthless because patients are far more likely write a review if they are unsatisfied and EVERY doctor is going to have some unsatisfied patients.   Yea, age definitely could be a factor (culture can play a role as well). The truth is that some patients WANT an autocrat that will just tell them what to do (perhaps an older model), while others want a partner that will discuss options/risks and help them decide (perhaps a more current model), and others want someone who will just do whatever they tell them (probably not very safe/ethical/legal). It sounds like this guy doesn't fit you very well.   Yea, that sucks. Out of curiosity (don't take this the wrong way) does this doctor work in an area with lots of poorer/less educated people? Sometimes doctors in that serve populations like this can adopt an autocratic style because they are used to passive patients who rarely ask any questions. Ultimately, it sounds like his bedside manner sucks. You should never be afraid to ask your doctor questions and they should be prepared to give you clear answers. If they won't/can't find a new doctor.   totally agree   He's probably worried that you have cervical dysplasia and that malignant potential could be increased by hormonal contraception (there isn't a clear medical consensus if this is a real risk). He wouldn't be able to know for sure if dysplasia is present or not until the pathologist looks at the sample.   It's not "Americans" it's retarded people   I'm starting to think these ISIS chaps are a bunch of dicks.   They should get the 5-tons http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M939_Truck to move all the stranded commuters around   The USA needs to reform VII Corps and put it back in Europe.   totally agree   *reddit/boston suddenly changes opinion on olympics   You guys should switch   I know you're joking but we can contact republican congressmen/women and demand they repeal this. If they do, Obama will have to let it go or be the democrat that vetoed it. This will affect A LOT of gun owners, many of whom are not republicans.    edit: wait, this is just you posting your friend's shitty article and then defending her non-news. You and Shirley should try to get jobs for buzzfeed.   You're absolutely right. I've posted this numerous times but it doesn't matter. This is about feelings not facts. People simply want to be able to ride the T and have someone else pay for most of it....cause feelings.   Those numbers are massively overstated because (from the MBTA) Unlinked trips are the number of passengers who board public transportation vehicles. Passengers are counted each time they board vehicles no matter how many vehicles they use to travel from their origin to their destination. Bus and subway ridership is estimated based on CharlieCard or CharlieTicket or cash transactions on MBTA fareboxes and fare gates. We then adjust for customers who transfer within downtown subway stations or who show their passes to an inspector, or children and others who do not use the fare equipment.). The adjustment is calculated from statistics from studies and inperson ridership counts. Currently, farebox and fare gate information is not 100% real time. It is not immediately available at the end of the month. However, the MBTAs goal is to develop daily real time counts in the future In reality only about 300K people use the ANY FORM OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION for commuting in Massachusetts. http://i.imgur.com/5Mkdl4f.png http://i.imgur.com/8j3jG0O.png UNDENIABLE 100% TRUTH: MBTA riders make up a tiny percentage of the state's daily commuters   how is this even news   If you youtube Ross Kemp Afghanistan you'll he's done this shit a whole lot  	104
 I'm guessing the former.   Whole frontpage is still full of these posts. Looks like they're being deleted as fast as they come up.  Edit: anyone know what that code is? 16c9a924d61b5c33f830d1725701ca4d for e.g.      Try using this: http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri   Elo Elo Elo.. that name rings a bell... isn't he the one known as the 'slippery man'?   Nice video, but why would you take out the comms, that's the best part!   Edit: Didn't check the description, comms in original video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGLtv78bleM   Thought as much.   Am I missing something or is this just a standard shitpost?  Edit: I take that back, this song is actually pretty good.   IRL   10/10   The expansions are free, what you're probably paying for is some useless ship skins and a few really cheap frigates. These links pretty good: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1c211z/the_have_a_tip_leave_a_tip_eve_thread_round_v_the/   Personally i'd go 3 torps and a scram. Not sure if that's the correct decision, however.   Really? Can people still do this even though CCP owns the rights to the game?   Damping is basically the more reliable version of ECM. Personally I prefer ECM to dampening, purely because it's more rage inducing. You're right, things like the scorpion do tend to get primaried. I'd suggest going into the tech 2 frigates for small gang (Keres and Hyena are the most favoured) and the Recon for fleet/black ops fights (although even those tend to die fast, as they're not very tanky at all). Something to note too, techinically the Armageddon (Amarr battleship) is an EWAR ship as it gets very good bonus' to neuts. I even think BRAVE might have it as its doctrine.    I think it's just 4chan trolls trying to make reddit look bad. What they don't realise is that reddit probably shares a large ammount of its userbase with 4chan.   Use the extension hide fedora.   Yeah i'm more thinking of lowsec/nullsec.   Shit, should I have added a /sarcasm tag? I can't tell who's joking anymore, this is too meta for me.   You need someone to refer you. Sent you a pm with the link (posting it in comments is a big no-no.)   Awesome iniative. I might donate if it gets rolling. A sidenote, battleclinic has some *really* *really* bad fits sometimes. I find it useful to corroborate them with zkillboard losses, and always check the date on the fit, in case it was made a few years ago.   Lmao. Space drama best drama.  de*veldrin: you walk around like you're fucking high and mighty. my morning shit today had more value then you  Best line.     Holy shit. If that isn't the most stunning thing i've seen all week I don't know what is.   Do ittt! I'll even double your isk if you come back now! :D   Yep. There is a warning before you accept the contract, however, saying that you might not be able to enter the station. You have to be pretty silly (or tired) to accept it.   Don't know *where* you wont be killed, but I know ships like the Skiff are a deterant to suicide gankers becuase they're so tanky and deal so much damage.  Also the lower the sec status (0.5 vs 1.0 for example) the longer it takes for the space police to respond and kill your attackers. Keep that in mind.   Imagine having a courier contract set to inside fort knox. Basically guy turns up in a fedex truck and gets told to fuck off. 1 day later courier contract fails and the scammer gets the collateral.   An apt description of the couirer contract scam (one of them, at least).   really cool video. Would probably be a lot better if voiced differently (something about the tone is off?).   Think I read (dont quote me on this) it was going to be around 1.1b, bit cheaper than a freighter.   You should watch some videos on how to fit a ship (looks like most of your ships are missing rigs, and modules) , then go on zkillboard and look for losses for some example fits.  Edit: if you'd like I can help you out with the whole fitting a ship thing, PM me.   How much did he get you for?  Edit: Nvm.   I would have given the money back.   Fught ev0ke a few months ago who were in HAM(?)gu's and basi's. Good number of them too.   I'm sorry, the anti-PL circlejerk is only okay in my eyes if it produces some quality OC.   Yeah I think they did. Maybe make them have 0m/s, need support machs to bump them!   He changed his flair, hes INK now! Magic!   I think if it was that easy CCP would have done it already (or they think it's just fine as it is). From my quite limited experience dealing with them, i'd say maybe you could make them go slower. Most of the problems i've had with them is actually catching the damn things.   Yeah, that Tech 2 sentry train is a bitch. I guess we'll only know when there's something better than them, not necessarily when they're balanced.   No idea, should ask someone that uses them!   Pretty lazerbeams.   Yeah i'm relatively new to the game, I don't think i'm in a position to suggest nerfs or buffs. If it was so easy that I could suggest something (or even you, having used them extensively) to 'fix' it then CCP would have done it already.  Granted too most of the bitching i've heard is either from reddit or corp mates, i've never actually flown one. I can see however why they're considered OP.   Not turning off formatting in pidgin   Good question, I don't really know the exact numbers or even the bonus', thats up to CCP to decide through tons and tons of playtesting. It's pretty well agreed, even by the people that use them, that ishtars need a proper nerf. They're the goto PvE and PvP ship right now, I know that much.   I'm fine with that as long as Ishtars are nerfed too.   https://zkillboard.com/kill/42928756/  What is this ship meant to do?   Good thing my railgu is almost finished.   It's basically real life spaceship simulator with no rules against scamming and infinite respawns.   A suprisingly apt description.   And nothing of value was lost.   In the end, there is only one survivor.... the one with the most ishtars.   CEO is also fond of SeBo'd fed navy commets... https://zkillboard.com/kill/42636105/ ... is this actually a thing?   Aw yeah, Widow represent.   I'm more interested in the people in the right corner. I wonder what their story is.   Then you think of some clever work around to get that function working. It's all downhill from there.   Someone with 10 accounts going around and downvoting everyone, rofl.   Well if you weren't banned before you're going to be banned now... Also is it possible you didn't warp because maybe you lagged? There's plenty of possible explanations as to why your Garmur died, and they're not all CCP's fault. It's certainly not worth getting your account(s) banned.   Was he in a paladin? That looks like a bastion or a siege module on the right?   Means he got shadowbanned.   I wonder if this would make people actually use them.   Yeah it looks fine on firefox, probably just my browser.   I mean you say that... but I still don't know how territory is counted. Maybe it's the app I play on that fucks it up but I doubt it.   Or cuts your hand off with a machete, either work.   Must have accidentally set a break point before the REM function.   Sounds like a dream vacation.   I'm on windows 7 64bit, I do get some other wierd text errors on some websites so it's probably on my end. Weird because it's showing up as Helvetica Neue light on my end (using whatfont).   Probably intentional, like the Phased Weapon Navigation Array Generation Extron, or PWNAGE.   http://puu.sh/dgwmq/8d1615979a.png  The text at the bottom and on the side looks really packed in, is that intentional? I'm on Chrome 40/W7 - no extensions.   Not just any nubbins, *hisec* nubbins. I can't tell if this is a troll post. Look at that rattle fit, then look back at the thread title.   Is... is he on a fucking tower? ANOTHER FUCKING TOWER? GOD DAMNIT UBISOFT WE DONT NEED TO CLIMB ANYMORE FUCKING TOWERS.   Here we see a perfect example of autism.   Recall program got cancelled.

Don't let this intimidate you however, it's pretty easy to pickup in the first hours of playing.   I'm curious your opinion of this:http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/24/slavery-exhibition-black-actors-cages-shut-down ?   They'd have to pay *me* to get me in there.   rofl   riiiip, do ratting carriers usually have those highs?   Toppest of keks.   What would they do to fix this?   shieeet, thats one blingy caracal.   Too bad nothing expensive died!   It's not directly said but it could be inferred from "You are buying/selling the character ONLY and nothing else".    CHECK CHECK CHECK, i'm pretty sure that word looses all meaning when you say it every two minutes.  ["They're not awoxers, they're waffles, theres actual waffles in the fleet."](https://i.imgur.com/wUmTrQQ.jpg)  Quote of the day.    Am I missing something or does that FAQ not state that all assets stay on the character once transferred? I appriciate that he probably could give it back out of good will, but I don't see it in the rules.   You should take out those pictures of the GM conversation, pretty sure that's against the rules. Not sure what that GM's on about either. At least from my interpretation Rule 7 just states that you can't *list* items for sale, not that you have to return them if the owner forgets them. The FAQ pretty clearly states you lose those items afterwards. I could be missing something, however, and this is just my uninformed opinion.  Edit: I see how you could interpret that rule to mean that you're not allowed to leave any assets in the character, this does however seem to contradict that FAQ.   Not sure about the hat on the medic but the soldier looks really cool.   Launchers useful if you're going to be switching characters on the same account a lot.

You forgot: Kills a 4 year old CFC vets titan by accident     Its fine tho, didn't you hear? It's already replaced, didn't want it anyway.

Aint noone that can stop soemone determined enough from just breaking it into dance.    I'm 90% sure that's Niles Crane from Frasier, just by looking at his body movements and hair.   I am the Mittani.   Here's a list of the coalitions and the alliances in them (dont believe that dude underneath me): https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2fdcpk/rough_coalition_headcount_thread/   I have very limited knowledge on this, but I know there are some alliances that have people specifically to produce caps/super caps, so theres that. Even if you join a big alliance as an industrialist you'd probably be expected to be able to fly some of their doctrines, I imagine.   Have you considered seeing a counselor or therapist? Would most probably help.   I mean, you're not wrong. Part of the reason I love playing eve is because of the political drama, real or fake, and i'm sure thats the case for a lot of other eve players too.   Just turn yourself in and it will all go a lot easier.   Don't get me wrong, I love the circlejerk, but that's about 20% of my motivations, the rest is me wanting the CFC outed as the completely insane alliance they are. Again, you're right, if this dude is telling the truth (which he probably isn't) then he should just go to CCP/the police, my intentions are selfish (mostly). Also awesome username by the way!   You're right, he should, if he has concrete proof on that, which he probably dosen't. Getting someone to verify his identity is really a service to the community, more than anything, so that we know for 99% sure that          the titan kill was wrong, and that anyone trusted at alliance level in CFC is likely to be doxxed illegally. It would be a huge blow to the CFC.   Check out this, hah: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2nlncj/on_goons_and_doxxing/   This means nothing unless you're willing to verify you're identity with a trusted third party, /u/ChribbaX, for example. Someone you can trust not to reveal your identity to CFC, but that we also trust not to lie to us. Otherwise, assuming you're not lying, good read and thank you for posting.   Cool model.   You're right, not like releasing evidence would stop CFC super pilots from looking over their back, wondering if they're going to get kicked for frequenting the wrong bar or misspeaking on teamspeak.   I don't even think they know tbh.   Why would you even say this if you're not willing to provide any evidence, and thus further the discussion in any meaningful way. From what I gathered at least Reddit was dropping the subject, as they do most drama within a few days. I also wonder what GSF would have had to say if they hadn't kicked him, i.e. if SMA would even be in CFC anymore.   Any chance of getting it without the vocals?   Do you think that's the majority of people? I'd imagine the majority of people on private trackers know what they're doing, maybe i'm too naive though.   Dude its super secret opsec that they can't reveal (even to renew the trust of CFC super pilots who can't talk perfectly 100% of the time).   Nah man, it would "compromise our IT services"   [Hmmmm......](http://replygif.net/i/1242.gif)   The place is actually pretty clean, nothing like that sticks out in my mind like that (oh wait, I just remembered I found a hair in my sauce once, but that dosen't really bother me). I've never gotten ill off the food (at least to my knowledge), and i've been eating it for years, which makes me wonder what the criteria are for these ratings.

Ah I see, it makes sense now, cheers for the explanation.    Is this just a badly hidden advertisement for your characters? I don't get the joke, sorry.   Oh, yay, it looks less like a space turd!

 I pretty much all leftovers up to a 1-1.5 weeks ago. Never had a problem with anything before. Just make sure they are getting properly refrigerated after cooking.    I still cry every time I read it.    I have a feeling this person is gonna get expelled and face criminal charges. Kind of curious what motivated them to do this - seems really dumb.    Sorry can't make it, will be working.    I love this! Do you have a romanization of the arabic saying?    Holy shit - this guy was one of my econ TAs back at Duke.    Edit: Duke game at 5 pm so sorry guys don't think I'll make it. :(   Someone please remind me about this... I will totally forget otherwise.    Ditto - that's what I thought OP meant in the title. That would be a hilarious compilation.    Yes! Actually while I was in college, Gmail filtered an interview email from Google itself into my spam folder which was complete fail. Unfortunately, I didn't see it until 3 weeks later so I completely missed out on that which really sucked.    Sorry - still out of town on business trip. Be back next week.    I thought it was Ward at first walking out of the ocean in that opening scene. Got really excited for a split second.    That sounds like Samuel L Jackson from Kingsmen trying to read their names normally.    Let's take a vote guys. Bobbi/Mack = SWORD: yay or nay?    I bet if it ever came down to it, Bobbi's totally going to place the blame all on Mack when he tries to go to her for help or to try and cover it up. That or they're gonna try and bring Hunter in on whatever they are.     I bet Bobbi's totally going to place the blame all on Mack when he tries to go to her for help.    I totally thought it was Ward when they showed that first shot of Lady Sif walking out of the ocean. I got really excited for a moment.    I did think he was going to reach down deep inside him and bring out those crazy strength powers and beat up the Kree.    Love Hunter just walking nonchalantly in like eh, just some inter team sexual tension, no biggie.    I'm starting to really dislike Mack, maybe because he's been so shady these past few eps. And I liked him so much when he and Fitz were the dream team. :(    That just sounds like pornographic skittles.    Simmons bailing on Fitz was kinda shitty too though (regardless of her reasons). :/    Especially when Whedons are involved. :(    Yeah I like how everyone's like we totally weren't going to do anything bad to our *friend* Skye. Lies. You were ready to lynch her last episode.    Too soon.    Those pesky Whedons better not do anything to my precious Hunter!    Well at least they didnt drag out the Skye pretending to hide her Inhuman powers. Though I did think the reveal was a little bit underwhelming.    NOO! Hunter!! Whedons you better not do anything to him!    Coulson: Who can explain the mysteries of the Asgardian brain?   May, with extreme snark: I can    I felt like Lady Sif was underused in this episode. Also, felt a little too much like a filler ep overall. I thought it killed the momentum from last week a little bit.    Sorry will be out of town for the next 2 weeks.    The Three Musketeers (Disney version with Keifer Sutherland)    Sorry doesn't look likely that I'll be able to make it.    Will try to get my work done so I can make it. Keep you guys posted.    Dan Stevens is on the up and up. Can't wait to see all the amazing stuff he does in the future.      Second this. I'm a big fan of the Daughter of the Lioness books (there's only two sadly).    And then the camera pulling out to show the pic of the Howling Commandos on the wall. Three generations of family dedicated to fighting Hydra. :(    These two deserve their fates. And each other.    Yup, they're are just rocking it. :)    That scene where Coulson has to deliver the bad news to Tripp's mom is just heartbreaking. :( And then that camera pulls into the apartment to the picture of the Howling Commandos on the wall and it's even more gut wrenching. Three generations of the family dedicated to fighting Hydra.    That would be so awesome as next season with a tie with Captain America 3.    Agreed, she's just so kind and considerate normally that it seems like a total 180 in personality for her. :/    I hope so. While it would be interesting to see a Fitz vs Simmons square off, I really disliked Simmons' angry outbursts this episode. :( She's just so nice normally.    Promises were made!   https://twitter.com/ChloeBennet4/status/572787751835213824   Cut off a limb, and two more shall take its place!   The premise of the show is ridiculous: *Dr. Henry Morgan (Ioan Gruffudd) is a New York City medical examiner who studies the dead for criminal cases, and to solve the mystery of his own immortality. Since his first death 200 years ago while working as a doctor in the African slave trade, Morgan disappears almost immediately each time he dies, and returns to life naked in a nearby body of water.*   The pilot is also laughably bad.    Hm that would be interesting - I had not considered the possibility that Bobbi and Mack were working for Fury (or some other Shield faction).    Would love to see them tie Agents of Shield back into the MCU movies. Even as quick cameo appearances.    The things I'm so happy have to back:   * May being awesome. * May and Coulson carrying on like an old married couple.   * Bobbi and Hunter giving each other shit   * Cal and Raina's batshit craziness.  * Puns. * Coulson's red car.  * Tripp :(     I was just thinking about how I don't think of them as FitzSimmons anymore but as Fitz and Jemma (I feel like they say her first name a lot more now.)    Or as Bobbi would put it, "you're a rock star Skye."     I think they tried a tiniest bit too hard to make Skyes new powers a horrible thing and turn the team/teams perception against her. I thought Jemmas outbursts were a little much. And Fitz freaking out and suddenly covering for Skye a little out of character as well. I understand the plot point, but I hope this doesnt turn into a whole season of Skye hiding her powers from everyone except Fitz.   Also, did anyone else think that Fitz was suddenly very articulate after he came back in with Skyes fake results?     I thought for a moment there that Hunter was a Hydra spy in that post car crash/escape scene.    The married adventures of Coulson and May continues with some scriptwriting role playing.   Theyll never take us alive? Really? A little over the top dont you think?   We only had a day to come up with the whole thing, and if I had let you write the script, no one would say anything.

Also, did anyone else think that Fitz was suddenly very articulate after he came back in with Skyes fake results?    Poor Coulson, having to deliver the bad news to Tripps mom. :(     *Shell never love you, you stupid man.*   Cal is insane. Loved his pure glee at finding out Skye had transformed post metamorphosis.    For the tiniest moment, I thought Hunter was a traitor.     Sierra returns!!    I think youre a rock star. Ha. I see what you did there Bobbi.    Coulson always telling it like it is. If Tripp were here, he wouldnt be arguing, he wouldnt be complaining, he wouldnt be bitching. ...Tripp :(    Of course Coulson would have a replica of his precious car in his office.    Are Bobbi and Mack traitors???   That was a very Godfather-esque sequence where they killed the other members of the Hydra inner council.     God I have missed Bobbi and Hunter.  Drop the accent, it makes you sound like a douchebag.  Were in a support group.   AHAHAHA. Thats the best thing you could have said.   Youre a jackass.    So do you guys pass around a talking stick or?  /jab in side    Lol Coulson's replica car.    Are Bobbie and Mack traitors????    Um why did Fitz suddenly lie after freaking out?    THEY SAID IT INHUMAN.    For the *tiniest* moment, I thought Hunter was a traitor.     Coulson always telling it like it is. If Tripp were here, he wouldnt be arguing, he wouldnt be complaining, he wouldnt be bitching.    "I think you're rock star." Ha. Ha.    I see this as more of a popular/people's vote, just like IMDB is. Dark Knight is very highly ranked there as well.    TIL Reddit really likes The Social Network... #39??    More like 1/10 would not binge this season if not for s1 and s2 hype.    I'm going to be late because of work. I'll try to be there by 3.    Absolutely. She looks way better as a blonde and it gave her an air of fair beauty that contrasted amazingly with her icy personality.      It was like Frank Underwood was staring straight into your soul.    For some reason that scene between Claire and the writer made me think that the writer is gonna be interested in Claire and her story and wind up publishing an expose on Frank instead that winds up ruining him more and fueling Claire's rise to power.     I thought he was giving him a very valuable life lesson. Yes, everyone should strive to be the best that they can be, but admit the limitations they were born with as well - whether it be height or money or ethnicity. There's a difference between a dream and a fantasy indeed.    Which I thought was weird because she spent the entire season completely spurning him and getting happily married.    I highly doubt it.    I'm not sure if I buy into Frank caring about Doug just yet. Maybe I've just become cynical after everything I've seen of Frank or maybe I'm just getting horrible flashbacks of the Peter Russo incident. If he cares about Doug, why has he been sidelining and ignoring him this entire season so far? He must know how fiercely loyal Doug is and that all he wants is for Frank to succeed and that it will only drive Doug to the current state that he's in.   I don't buy it, it has to be a play.     Let's hope he escapes the fall out from Frank like Jesse does in the end though.    Though she was all smiles when she stepped back into the other room. So scary as well.    But if he cares about Doug, why has he been sidelining and ignoring him this entire season so far? He must know how fiercely loyal Doug is and that all he wants is for Frank to succeed and that it will only drive Doug to the current state that he's in.  I don't buy it, it has to be a play.    If they're going down that path, they need show more Meechum in these next few episodes.    Absolutely. She looks way better as a blonde and it gave her an air of fair beauty that contrasted amazingly with her icy personality.    Is anyone else just really over this Russia/Petrov storyline this season? As much as I like Lars Mikkelsen, I feel like Frank has just been getting dominated by this Petrov all season, but crawling back to try and make peace. And that storyline is honestly sort of yawn worthy overall.    For real. Though at least I buy into him (mostly because he's been sort of pathetic all season), but Frank crying earlier in the season was really jarring.    I didn't realize this was up for debate. Especially since Doug is alive.    I really wanted to see him butt heads again with Claire (and her take him down) or with Frank. Boo.    There is not enough of Meechum in this season so far. Highly disappointed.    I have to say even though I'm hanging in there, I'm definitely not enjoying this season nearly as much as the first two. :/    Freddy being the realist.    I also thought it was weird because when I'm crying or upset, the last thing I want to do is have sex. I feel like that's furthest away thing I want to do. So in that sense, I almost felt like Claire violated him. (Even though he appeared to be right as rain the next day.)    I also thought it was weird because when I'm crying or upset, the last thing I want to do is have sex. I feel like that's furthest away thing I want to do. So in that sense, I almost felt like Claire violated him. (Even though he appeared to be right as rain the next day.)    Wow I totally forgot about that until you just brought it up. Feel like anything weird sexually is eclipsed by the threechum.    I wasn't really sold on him in the beginning, but I have to say he's really grown on me. All of the supporting characters have been kind of weak this season so far (Remy, Meechum, Seth, etc), so I'm really glad his character is really getting fleshed out here.    Or some other conflict around scheduling, actor/director relationship or personal matter.   It's too bad we didn't get to see Frank and him butt heads directly, especially after he was such a dick to Claire during the Senate hearing.    Cruel to some, but I thought he was giving him a very valuable life lesson. Yes, everyone should strive to be the best that they can be, but admit the limitations they were born with as well - whether it be height or money or ethnicity. There's a difference between a dream and a fantasy indeed.    Hm I'm not entirely convinced he's a double agent. I think he's doing this of his own accord because he sees this as the only possible for him to get back into Frank's inner circle and prove his worth.    The moment he admitted he didn't write the majority of Scorpio to Frank, I was like these guys are cut from the same cloth - they will get along just fine.    Stop teasing us with all these tiny glimpses of Meechum. We want moar.    I almost feel like the term flash forward is from Lost so yeah definitely gave off that vibe.   Agreed. They were completely nasty to each other. I want Team Underwood back though I'm starring to think that Claire is just setting herself up for when Frank inevitably falls from power. And this is all just sly political maneuvering.    Love the non linear open that turns out to be a flash forward and not a flash back.    Oh damn... did not see that one. I was too busy just hoping that Netflix has to do a fourth season based on the number of cards in a deck.    Lol at the monks and Meechum's deadpan delivery of "they'll be here for a month."    I still can't decide if it was a good move, a calculated move or Claire's political inexperience or morality coming into play here.    I'm still reeling... I think this is the first time we've seen the two of them just go at each other completely unfiltered like that.    Did I miss something or is there a reason Claire and Frank aren't sleeping in the same bed or room?   Edit: Nm apparently I just needed to watch more of the ep.    Frank moving on from Call of Duty onto indie games? I approve.    Dat product placement.    I like how he's still holding onto a piece of it too. Just standing there like a little kid with cookie crumbs on his hands like noope wasn't me.    I really thought that's where the episode was going with that scene with Petrov saying he needed to think about what he wanted and Frank commenting he knew exactly. Especially after Frank told Claire to work her charm on him. I thought were literally about to see Frank pimp Claire out as Petrov pointed out.    Damn did not recognize him without that beard he was sporting in Sherlock last season. I thought he looked and sounded awfully familiar.   "To President Petrov... and his little pickle."    If only Frank had expressed his stairway thoughts outloud while the two of them were lighting up.    I wonder if Doug is making moves or just making moves to get back in Frank's good graces... hmm... though I'm not sure why Frank decided to completely sideline Doug to begin with. Seems like he could use all the allies he can get right now.    Just beautiful and elegant. I wish I had black tie events to go to so I would have a reason to dresses like that.    Might be higher cost of living in DC. I have a few friends who live there and their rent and such is pretty high. Also, you'd probably be working all the time in a job like that. (Just watch any of the West Wing staff - I felt like they never slept.)    A bit jarring as the end credits but it also sucked that Netflix's auto proceed to next episode timer kicked in so soon. They should have let the credits run here.   	124
 from an economic standpoint, in a world without countries the currency would be the same. so we would be better able to help the sick the sick and poor right?   thank you obliging my stupid mind. i would love to have a discussion about this but i'm pretty drunk   do you think that dogs have dreams when they sleep?   nothing that communistic. i was just thinking of either  1. countries without borders: which might make the rich richer and the poor poorer but would help the desperate.   2. a unified world: which has the potential for disaster or peace   do dogs dream?   i don't know but if the love of my life looks through my stuff she will see people like me and will contact me and we will meet and then she will be grossed out but not before i smell her and take some of her hair   i just delete my posts that get bad karma. except the ones i think are funny even if no one else does   without borders everyone could be happy but there's a chance that everyone could be sad. with borders some people are happy and some are sad and the happy people want to separate themselves from the sad people.    how does this affect me?   i liked the story. don't worry about about knives it'll be ok   awesome! my mom works for the IRS and we're going to the movies tomorrow now      it's been awhile but i think i just didn't like their design. it reminded me of that old game Space Invaders    mainly i didn't like the new enemy   i keep thinking about gurran lagann because i dropped it after it jumped ahead in time. i wonder how it ends, but i don't really want to watch it anymore   i can't believe i'm the only one wondering why they don't just clean the bathrooms and kitchens? are all of them just waiting for someone else to?   i don't like it when that woman talks   i can't get food stamps because my parents claim me as a dependant, but don't feed me enough. where's my government assistance?

Whats a good one?   thank you for this, helps a lot. money is my main concern so i think i'm getting a KLR   yeah i would like a DRZ more but it's a lot more expensive.    i'm missing something   which is better for a 6 foot 3 tall person?   which is easier for a beginner to ride?   which is more durable/long lasting? needs less maintenance?    why flatten the tires?      how did the photographer get in the stall?   wheelie    Thanks. Which one were you talking about though?   what's the difference between a dual sport and supermoto?   i loaned $500 to a "friend" and now she's ignoring my calls and texts except for when i call from a different phone, then she hangs up. i have no way to get the money back because she moved   but now what are they going to rape? oh yeahh   what is it?   i took speech therapy for about 3-4 years (elementary and middle school) and that only made my problem and anxiety worse because it was always on my mind. and that was when my parents paid for it, i can't afford it now anyways   but then i would have to piss ten times before i get a buzz going   i won't remember. but thank you   i'm friends with most of the cashiers and they don't check my ID. i'll bring it up next time i go in but i don't want to cost anyone their job even if he was a dick. fucking effort went into this grammar. hope you appreciate all my spellchecks haha   I've never been able to pronounce the letter R. Speech therapy didn't help so i'm stuck with it and with my stutter, and i've always been pretty embarrassed about it so i don't talk much. I just got off work, i work overnights (9pm to 6am) and went to go buy a couple steel reserves at one of my usual stores. Some new guy was working and after the pleasantries and he took my ID, he said he wouldn't sell me the beer because i'm slurring my words. i told him that i have a speech impediment and i can't pronounce the letter R, and that i just got off work so i can't be drunk yet. then he changed his mind and started ringing me up again, but i couldn't help myself and muttered something like "this is fucking nuts." he asked what i said so i said it again, and then he changed his mind again and wouldn't ring me up.   i had to go across town to get my beer and am drinking pretty heavily now. i only wanted a couple beers but now i'm getting shitfaced because i don't want to face that i'm always going to sound like a fucking cartoon character.   just curious, what would be a good price for it?   I want that bike for my first bike too but craigslist isn't helping me out. Where did you get it?   thanks, that clears things up. i'm thinking a supermoto would be a better first bike then. but which would be better suited for a really tall person?      didnt mean to sound like a dick my bad   if it's the one off of the highway by Outback steakhouse then make your employees wear some fucking hair nets. shits disgusting   i'm confused. you talk about having money problems but you have a shrink. doesn't make sense man   i work overnight shifts and so i usually buy most my alcohol around 6 or 7am. i always get weird looks   what are the main things to look at when buying my first (used) bike?   what does the MSF course consist of? i'm looking to take it sometime next month and don't want to go in with no information beforehand   i'm glad those people weren't redditors or they would have kidnapped the fox cub   new rider here, is there an exact speed that i should from counter-steering to steering normally? i mean if i'm certain to crash, should i steer normally or counter-steer at.. 11, 12, 13mph?   i got to watch the finale for the time twice because i was blackout drunk   at what speed to you go from steering normally to counter steering? i mean if i was lane splitting at 10mph and can't make any mistake, should i steer normally to get into a lane or counter steer? 20mph?   i assume counter steering at higher speeds comes naturally once i take my test, so i guess that's my only question. but i'm still curious of the balance between counter steering and leaning   i want a tortoise so he can play peek a boo with my cat   egg cartons  	72
 That's a good honest slogan.  [edit] but I think Seaside heights holds that crown.      Haha, any time!   Well the rides and water park are still fun!   Try visiting Japan. Their candy is only a little sweeter than American bread. I think 2/3 of Americans have an undeniable sugar addiction.   I love how this is turning into a mixology thread.   I like a Gin   Ginger.  And if you're feeling nuts;   Gin + Ginger soda + Fresh Ginger = Gin^3   I think added sugars is one of the biggest problems in our economy.  Our government regulates everything but allows food produces to add what basically amounts to poison to almost everything in the grocery store.  Makes me sick.   I can't argue with this type of sound reasoning. It's *science*.   Not fat, cultivating mass.   That's sound logical science. Drinking is like breathing and breathing burns calories.   You sure about that? Last time I checked water had chemicals and chemicals are bad.  [edit] but Popeye's still OK b/c chicken = protein = good   Haha, great map.   Yea, Wildwood has really gone down hill.  Also, I grew up on the Jersey Shore. And it's not like the TV show.  Sure, I used to go to Seaside Heights (where the show was filmed) in high school, but we all knew it was a trashy good time. I spent my summers on LBI though.   According to documentaries and articles I've viewed, the early 80's is when the US obesity population began to blow up.  Combine this image with the recent presence of meth use just inland along the jersey shore and you'll have a more current view of the boardwalk. It's pretty sad.   I'm a late bloomer. I didn't finish developing physically until I was ~25yo. [31M now] It was around 29 that I realized I was hot. It just sort of hit me. Like I have had girls telling me this (sometimes guys too) but it didn't really sink in for a while. It's one thing to know you're good looking, being called "pretty boy" growing up, but all the sudden you're a 6'4" blonde male with the body of a stripper and it hits you.  I don't think it effects my personality too much because I don't view myself in terms of beauty but I am cognizant about certain things that are effected by how I look. I'm more aware that people will try to take advantage of me sexually and vie for my attention. I'm also more aware of the effect I have on women (some men I suppose too) as they can tend to become nervous when I approach them or talk to them. I also notice that some things in life are just handed to me and I'm attributing this to looks. Also, access to parties/clubs is much easier for me I'm noticing.  The one notable change in personality for me is that my standards for girlfriends has increased a lot. Now, I won't even have a drunken one night stand with a girl who's even a bit chubby.  In general they have to be tall, beautiful, smart and educated.  My standards were not that high when I was 21.   TIL Gerd wrote der bible   You'd think this answer could be found with a quick googling.      tis a magical place   I wonder what study it's citing. I'm sure it's true if you count overeating as an eating disorder.   You're hot. 8.9/10  Is that hair color natural?     It *has* fruit in it so it's healthy.   You're right, I deserve that.    So I'm at the the Jersey Shore - this place called Wild Wood.  Once a year my friends and I like to go to the boardwalk there to ride all the rides and play all the games.  I'm walking around with a friend and we see a lemonade stand selling giant (1L?) lemonades. We're thirsty but these things are huge so we decide to split one.  We walk up to the stand and order. We get our drink and each have a turn taking a sip. Both of our reactions are the same; our faces scrunch up and we're a bit overwhelmed by the amount of sugar in our drink. You could literally crunch the sugar with your teeth. But whatever, we're thirsty, we'll drink it.    As we're drinking, we're standing around near the lemonade stand and I watch this very large couple waddle up to the stand. They're pretty big, even relative to the population found in Wildwood, which is on the larger side to begin with. They each order a lemonade as I'm watching them. They start to walk away and take a sip. They each made the same disgusted face my friend and I made when we had our first sip!  Plot Twist! This couple, after taking a sip and realizing it is not to their liking, turn around and walk back to the stand. I'm out of earshot but I can see clearly what happens. They ask the kid for more sugar. They open the lid and he pours a full scoop (probably a tablespoon) of sugar into their giant cups. They look at him like, "come on, really?" and he pours two more scoops of sugar into each of their cups! That's some sweet ass lemonade + 3 additional scoops of sugaz! Wtf did I just witness!?!  They walked away, pleased with their purchase, and at that moment, I realized that that lemonade stand in Wildwood, New Jersey was where diabetes came from.  [edit] spelling of "lemonade"   You know what your mission is right? You MUST hide its chair for every class.  Better yet; loosen up some of the bolts so that it falls apart under her weight.   8.6/10   You know your breeds!   Haha, I agree.   The white one in the middle is full loaf and the one in the back is at least half loaf.   Perfect/ Thanks   Costco baby!   What you have to eat today?    "Oh, a salad, I went for a walk and treated myself with a cookie. I'm SO bad!"   Thanks!   The floof is strong in this group.  	34
 Me too   Sigh.  I wish. Madigan is the most accountable for Illinois' mess of any politician, more so than any governor. Sadly, he isn't going anywhere.   Wow I thought this was /r/politics. No wonder I didn't get down voted for mentioning that they returned the $$$.   Ha. That's a good point. I think legally you can't do that with campaign funds. Campaign funds are for campaigning only.   Love it. I'll always have a soft spot for those WRXs   Thanks, John Stewart.   Well yes, corporations are surely larger. But in regards to their political influence via donations, they are actually quite close to corporations. Look up how much unions contributed in 2012 to the general election (presidential and others). Were talking about hundreds of millions. Corporations didn't spend much more than that (recall that both Obama and Romney spent around $1 billion)   Can we stop posting anything from Vox or Salon?   Have you heard of the 'queen bee' syndrome? Once women get into power, they are less likely to allow their female peers to move up - because they want to be the woman at the top - the queen bee.  Wiki - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_bee_syndrome   Ok then - anyone who has been serving for more than 10 years. Period. They all need to go.    but rather when that group becomes too big and powerful  And unions *are* powerful. The swing elections, put politicians in office, influence financial policies, even to the detriment of the city/state. Unions in their current form are dangerous, and running amok. Again, look at Chicago Teachers Unions now, and Illinois as a whole.    You asked, 'how do you see yourself dying'. I am telling you how to do it. In order to see yourself dying, you would need to be looking at a mirror while dying.  Or you can use timetravel or something, that's not real.   I will vote for Bernie   My comment got some upvotes. That should make you feel better.  http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3aq8ii/the_white_supremacist_who_influenced_the/csf041g   By looking in the mirror as you die.    Get a drink, walk near the dance floor, go to the bathroom for 25 minutes, repeat.   No, they serve themselves. And they use workers' contributions to donate to politicians to promise not to diminish their power. And they use the workers' collective rights as a bargaining chip to obtain higher wages/benefits that are more than unreasonable. See the Chicago Teacher's Unions pension fund in /r/chicago.   It's not called 'free-range' parenting. It's just called "parenting".    I thought he was in prison?    but coming back into the emotional section of the movie as Cooper watches his family's messages right after a break might soften the impact.  This.   People who complain about Gohan don't understand his character. He is not a fighter. He is not like Goku and Vegeta who love fighting and always want to become stronger. After Cell, Gohan was forced to study - yes, but he didn't miss fighting like Goku would miss it. He is motivated to fight when he has to. Otherwise, he is a peaceful character.   Yea some are more obvious than others, that for sure. But thanks for the info!   I think at this point, we need to stop trying to figure out who to blame. It's irrelevant. This is the same in regards to Illinois' financial situation. Just freaking get it done, figure it out. Tax raises and spending cuts put together. Just freaking do it.  Linkme: Shia saying "JUST DO IT"   No. No it's not.    That's what you get for owning a Suzuki.   This. And strong depreciation value is indicative of poor quality and reliability in the long run.   They are returning the money from these groups:  http://news.yahoo.com/republican-presidential-candidates-return-donate-contributions-called-white-163504441.html   Anytime I hear the sound of a WRX, I always know. I'll be sitting with my wife, and I'll hear the faint sound and I'll say, "Hey honey there is a WRX somewhere".  But to be fair, I'm not always certain if it is an STI or not. But I also can tell when there is an Impreza. I don't know that much about cars, but I can just *hear* the Subaru. I just *know* when it's around.  Am I special, or is there something actually distinct in Subaru engines that everyone notices besides me?  EDIT: this could also be because my Dad had an old Forester, then a Saabaru (Saab 92x), my brother had a 2004 WRX (maybe it was 2006, don't remember), and I had a 2008 Subaru Impreza. Now I drive a stupid Ford Focus (darn you wife for not being able to drive stick!)   This is really an emotional ploy to grab our attention and get us riled up. But really, who cares?   Walmart has what, almost 2 million US employees? And the CEO makes $20 million. Who freaking cares. That's $10 *per employee per year* if we spread that around all other empoyees. That would end up being **less than half a cent per hour**. I mean really, when you are talking about a CEO, that is one employee in a company of hundreds of thousands.   I understand how it bothers people, but practically speaking, it doesn't make a bit of a difference. It really seems more like an argument based on envy/anger/resentment than actual logic.   Not sure if unions are much better than corporations. They are self-serving, and only interested in their self-preservation   Interesting, I would have suspected the opposite order. I guess kids are different nowadays.      What city you from? We can help you get involved with your roots.   Nope   It would probably be better if we encouraged people to not cover up their racism. Then we would have a better idea of how people actually feel, and where we stand as a country. Instead, there is delusion because everyone is so politically correct in public - but in private are still as racist as they were 30 years ago.   I am usually on the fence of F*** Obama and every word that comes out of his mouth. But honestly, here he makes sense. It's the most sense he has made in quite some time. I think it's about time that we realize that all this fake political correctness is not what eradicates racism.     tbh if that's Gohan during the buu saga he would wipe the floor with Vegeta.  Very true. Can't argue that.    Wait, you mean forcing everyone to be politically correct doesn't eradicate racism? Shocker.  /s   Yes because taking down this flag will end racism and mass-murders.  /s   Where the hell do my black socks keep going?   Unbelievably true   Yea except Christianity itself does not follow the bible 100%. I'm sure any Redditor would do much better in a bible run society than a sharia-law society. At least women would be able to walk in public.   Because that's the question.   Gosh you must have been the kid who complained about why you had to do math homework.  We know you are just pretending to be clever, but really you're just an idiot who couldn't do algebra.   ? Florida as the worst reputation in America?   Mississippi? Georgia? C'mon now.   I wasn't taking your comment seriously. Yea of course some children are mentally disabled and handicapped. Some children also die before the age of 10 - but at least children generally grow up out of the 'child' phase - whereas dogs chase sticks for 5,10, 15 years, sniff buts, wag their tails, and do anything for a treat.   If you make them laugh so hard they cry, that counts.   EDIT: Please put the link for the video in your comment.      A quota on a prison? So...  "Hey, our prison is kind of empty"  "Yea, well actually crime has been down recently"  "Well I need you lock up some 'mates"  "Uh, well, I guess we can invent some new law or make going to prison easier for existing crimes"  "That's a good start, but I'll need you to place some coke and pot on the people you pull over. Then we can bring em in here"  "Ok, but where do I get the coke and pot?"  "In my desk. Second drawer from the top. Right next to my gun"   ...   Lets give each other gold.  You go first.   I prefer gold.   Are you comparing a down syndrom child to a dog? Shame on you.      Ok so let's break this down for those who can't do fucking rocket science.  1. Your best friend. 2. His parents 3. Their best friends - meaning, best friends of the parents 4. *Their parents*  Realize that this is now 2 generations older than you, likely a grandmother/grandfather.  Oh and you have to have sex with *both of them*, because that's the question.  SO the question is:  Who has had sex with their: best friends' parents'  best friends' parents?  **Wtf OP?**   This is an oddly specific question. I have a feeling OP could answer this question.   If you aren't cheating. Like wtf kind of nonsense is that? Cheating is cheating, unless you aren't together.  Period.   He's in Paris, on vacation. Rich fucker.   "I have x karma on Reddit"   Eating an entire box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch in one sitting.   I see what u did there   Oh thank god. I saw the title and I though, "Please please may this post be from /r/shittyprogramming" - and not real.   You know what you stated is not a logical equivelant to what I said, right?  First of all, the difference is that mass murders is a **tiny percentage of murders**. Forget that murders is a small percentage of all deaths. That's not even the point - and that's what you dwelled on.  If there was something that accounted for .2% of all car deaths - it would be quite silly to spend all our time focusing on how to fix that problem - when there are much larger contributions to car deaths - like drunk driving and distracted driving.     The percentage of car fatalities compared to the amount of miles traveled safely is equally small  That statement is not really applicable to what we are talking about here. You have made some strange false equivalency using some bad logic.   Your dog will also forever stay in the state of a 'child'. At least children one day grow up, get jobs, grow as people, and have families of their own. Your stupid ass dog will still be chasing its dam tail and running after sticks 10 years from now.   It means maybe deciding public policy about gun violence over an act that accounts for .2% of all murders, seems to be out of whack.   It's freaking bgr.com, what do you expect?   Not only is this post 4 months old, but I already said I know about Stack Exchange's code review...   Minimum wage is irrelevant when we are talking about CS jobs.   /u/way_fairer because I want to see how the hell he/she gets all that karma.   and why?  EDIT: Oh...       Politicians will not admit mistakes. They believe it is a sign of weakness and any bad things in the past need to be swept under the rug so we can pretend they never happened.  I have corrected your statement for you.   I live in the Orthodox Jewish community in Chicago, and there is kind of a debate of whether or not we should have members of our synagogues be armed. Now, we would only want a few people in each synagogue to have a gun - we don't need 20x people to carry. It seems pretty split. Some thing it won't help, some do.  Considering where gunmen have to enter to start shooting (they have to enter from one side - the back, or the front), it is quite easy to kill them without killing others. You can keep 2x armed members by each door. I think having all of us completely unarmed is quite stupid, and asking for trouble. It's not hard to get into these places and kill a lot of people if no one is armed.   And the people who have the guns would be people who know what they are doing. Like I said, I don't think anyone who wants to should bring their gun, but designating a few people by the doors I think is necessary at this point.   A Republican tax-cut strategy backfires? Shocker.  /s   The First Samurai. It's about the person who started the 'Samurai' way.    Outerstellar. It's about an alien race that that refuses to travel between stars.   This deserves to be the top comment.    1. Property, auto, and casualty fraud - 45% 2. Medical fraud - 15% 3. Workers comp and disability - 40%  EDIT: renter's insurance can cover expensive personal items, like diamond rings. Easy fraud there. People also intentionally get their cars stolen (or simply give them to someone who will dismantle the car), so that's why I say auto/property is so high. It's easy for anyone to do. And since you said you spend most of your time with workers comp, I've bumped up that number.    I looked at documentation and examples, but I can't seem to find out what is the behavior when you declare a VARACHAR2 like this:      VARCHAR(10);  Is that declared like:      VARCHAR(char 10);  or      VARCHAR(byte 10);    It's almost like someone didn't read the headline, and then someone called him out on it, and then you thought it was a joke, but it wasn't. He actually didn't read the headline    What if the armed individual is shot first by the gunman?  Who says there is one? And what are the odds that even happens if there are 100 people in the room? If guns were allowed in the church, there would be multiple people with guns. Not 1.   What if he misses?  Then he shoots again.   What if he shoots another innocent church goer on accident?  1. The attacker comes in through the *back* of the church. He isn't standing in front of a bunch of church goers. He is likely standing in front of the main door. No people behind him - no chance for hitting an innocent.  2. Even with the risk, the church goer now has the attacker focused on him. And with multiple people trying to shoot the gunman, he is down in seconds. **The odds that at least 9 people are killed - basically 0**  The evidence is on you to prove that this is not logical. I would be shocked if you could find evidence that suggested having armed civilians when there is a crazed gunman *would yield to more deaths*. Here are some examples:    Mayan Palace Theater, San Antonio, Texas, Dec 2012: Jesus Manuel Garcia shoots at a movie theater, a police car and bystanders from the nearby China Garden restaurant; as he enters the movie theater, guns blazing, an armed off-duty cop shoots Garcia four times, stopping the attack. Total dead: Zero.    Winnemucca, Nev., 2008: Ernesto Villagomez opens fire in a crowded restaurant; concealed carry permit-holder shoots him dead. Total dead: Two. (Im excluding the shooters deaths in these examples.)    Appalachian School of Law, 2002: Crazed immigrant shoots the dean and a professor, then begins shooting students; as he goes for more ammunition, two armed students point their guns at him, allowing a third to tackle him. Total dead: Three.    Santee, Calif., 2001: Student begins shooting his classmates  as well as the trained campus supervisor; an off-duty cop who happened to be bringing his daughter to school that day points his gun at the shooter, holding him until more police arrive. Total dead: Two.    Pearl High School, Mississippi, 1997: After shooting several people at his high school, student heads for the junior high school; assistant principal Joel Myrick retrieves a .45 pistol from his car and points it at the gunmans head, ending the murder spree. Total dead: Two.    Edinboro, Pa., 1998: A student shoots up a junior high school dance being held at a restaurant; restaurant owner pulls out his shotgun and stops the gunman. Total dead: One.  These are just some examples. *There is, in fact, absolutely no evidence in existence that suggests armed civilians leads to more casualties in these situations*. Of course, armed civilians can't prevent everything, and of course, there can still be casualties.   There seems to be a logical disconnect when it comes to evaluating the usefulness of guns. If you want gun control, then you cannot admit that a civilian owning a gun could ever be useful. That would hurt your argument. For some reason, people believe you can't be anti-gun rights, and admit guns can sometimes be useful - at the same time.  What you claim, is not only non-verifiable, but it goes against logic - and no amount of anger or name calling can change that.   Well I wouldn't say you can 'blame' the pastor.   Where's the logic in that  Logic says that if you have armed people in a church, vs. unarmed people in a church - less people will die. This is true, and quite difficult to prove otherwise. However 'blaming' the pastor is not what we need to be doing now.    Vote for one thing that's against the party line and you're suddenly a RINO (Republican In Name Only.)  Vote for one thing that's against the party line and you're suddenly a DINO (Democrat In Name Only.)  It's not a problem with Republicans. It's both of them.    When you create the illusion that Judaism is fun or easy, you are lying.  I never got that impression when becoming religious. Is this a common experience? I never in my mind thought it would be easy. Fun yes - but certainly not all the time. That's unrealistic.   "In Hebrew with Russian subtitles"  Of the three languages I know, you picked the two that I'm not fluent in. Bah!    I'm really confused. What does it matter if you are niddah or not? Jewish or not?    Meaning, the air would be very thin, and you would be absolutely freezing. He probably became unconscious within an hour or two of being in there.   The ABB hate is strong here...  Edit: Anybody But Bernie (ABB)   Must be cold out.    We systematically oppress them by refusing to make their obligation to wear tefillin mandatory.  You Fascist.   Why do you want to write your own hashing function? You know Java has many Hashing data structures you can use. Just want to make sure you know there is already such a thing in existence.   1. This happens to everyone. IDEs (especially Eclipse) can really be a pain when doing something really simple.  2. **Naming convention** - Your class names *should always start with a capital letter*  3. Class name should be the same as the filename  3. So what is the error? Mouse over the red squiggly and let me know what it says.      This.   Just prodding you to respond normally to my comments from yesterday.   Wait what, Bernie is Jewish?    The $7.8 billion includes an estimated $6.2 billion in public assistance for low-wage Walmart employees, including programs like food stamps, subsidized housing, and Medicaid.  Which is an indirect subsidy, which is not what we were talking about.  Response [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2014/04/14/phantastical-nonsense-about-walmart-the-waltons-and-7-8-billion-in-tax-breaks/)   The website you linked me describes many instances where Walmart was given tax breaks. That's included in the $1.2 billion. You're not winning me over here. It seems like you've proven my point.   No no and no. I can tell the difference between the real stuff, and the generic stuff. **Nothing can replace real Cheeze-Its**, or many other snacks.   Generic cleaning supplies are also often crap. I tried 5 different dish washing soaps, and they were all garbage.   But that's not an explanation for *why* you do it.   So it looks like it's $1.2 billion, **over the past 20 years**.   That's chump change. Seriously. That's $60 million a year in subsidies. Based on number of employees, if we gave all that money to employees instead of Walmart - that would be less than $1 per week for each employee. About *two cents an hour*.   Not to mention many of these subsidies disappear over time and are not renewed.  **For a company that has revenue of over $100 billion per quarter, $1.2 billion over 20 years is a drop in the bucket.    Billions? Where do you see that? I see $1.2 billion - and that's not every year, that seems like from a certain time.   Finally something! A lot of these subsidies are like, "Here, take a small bonus for building your store in our town. Please please build it here. We will give you $1,000,000".  That is a subsidy indeed. Although almost all of these are relatively small and temporary, or one time. I picked a few stores and they were either 1 time bonuses, or limited time tax breaks.   Shame   (Deleted)   Some things I agree with, some I don't.   Many of these smaller grocery/specialty/department stores pay their employees (50-60% of which are full-time) a livable wage, including benefits  Isn't that more of a factor of the time? Back then 'minimum wage' was much closer to a 'livable 'wage'. Not sure about that benefits part. I think you are kind of reaching. Small mom n pop stores didn't provide benefits.   The Walmart employs somewhere between 200-350 people with 15-25% of those employees working full time. Each of the 10 businesses that were pushed out of the market employed 50-150 people, with 50-60% of those employees working full time.  Ok seems like you fudged the math a little bit, although your point is not completely off. Many stores that Walmart knocked out were very small (10 employees) shops, whose employees may have ended up at Walmart, and some not.    The Walmart employs somewhere between 200-350 people with 15-25% of those employees working full time.   I'm not sure why you decided to pick numbers out of a hat. It is very unlikely for only 20% of employees to be part time. It is closer to 60-70% [source](http://www.pbs.org/itvs/storewars/stores3.html)  Is there a net job loss due to Walmart's pushing out of smaller stores? I think that's the question we are trying to answer here. The answer is probably yes, but it's not so clear by how much or how little.  You also forget to mention that prices for virtually all consumer goods drop tremendously because of Walmart, and both the middle/lower class benefit tremendously from Walmart's low prices.   Also, those people who had experience in those small stores (that are now gone), probably aren't all making the lowest wages at Walmart. They either moved onto to something better, or might be managers at Walmart, or at least making more than new employees due to their previous experience.     Dude seriously wtf are you trying to get at? Don't like my logic? Tell me why I'm wrong. You want a life story of why I decided to use the logic I used?   I think it's logical to ask the question, "How much would it cost taxpayers if Walmart employees were not employed by Walmart?". It's a legitimate question. It can have a simple answer, but it is a question that should be answered, instead of condescendingly disregarded.   Think I'm an idiot? Great. Tell me why. Leave the petty shit at the door.   No. You are backpedaling from making a stupid claim. That's what is happening. Changing the topic when you've been found to be incoherent.     While this is an example of tortured conservative logic used to defend WelfareMart, it's not an explanation for why you do it.  Why I do what? Defend Walmart?   I don't defend anyone. I am using the logic of 'welfarMart' against itself. I don't really care what half-brained Republicans say. I think for myself. You can have a normal debate with me, or you can make this a political mud-slinging contest. The latter doesn't interest me.   So we can agree that the initial premise that 'Walmart gets subsidies let us grab our pitchforks' was complete nonsense.   You can sling mud, or explain why you think I'm wrong. Up to you.   So then every company in the United States receives a subsidy.  So then what's your point? Now the statement, "Walmart receives subsidies" has absolutely no meaning.   No. That's not a subsidy. That is welfare, for employees. A subsidy would be if Walmart gets $10,000,000 for every store they open.  We hear this all the time about paying for Walmart's workers. Tell me, how much would we be paying those people if they were unemployed? The answer: **a hell of a lot more**. If anything, Walmart saves the taxpayer money by providing jobs - even if those jobs still require welfare, those employees **require less welfare than if they were unemployed**.    Because people like Apple because they make neat phones - and doesn't employ millions of Americans at minimum wage.   Apple employs them overseas, in factories that no one in America cares about. Except when once in a while someone dies from over-exhaustion. Then people care for a week.   What subsidies? You are the second person here to say that, without telling us what subsidies Walmart receives.   	113
 Thanks.      As a former digg user who left and came to reddit for exactly the reasons you mention, I agree with you 100% about the likely sad end of this whole fiasco.   @crabnuts--sadly, I think you've hit it exactly, both the methods and the results of these political forums being destroyed by vocal minorities and easily cowed moderators. It's a shame the redditors are so naive. Just let the rest of us know where the good guys are headed, okay?   I do agree that eliminating all sources that build on other sources sacrifices analysis and additional insight from the secondary source, but with that caveat, I like your other suggestions. These mods should be acting as mods driven by a transparent policy, not wholesale censors of sources.   I wonder if the mods understand what journalism is. Mother Jones is a model of it.   I agree, it has crossed from moderation into censorship. A political site that censors sources is worse than useless.   Agree 100%--how can these mods not see that they are absolutely killing the credibility of r/politics?   @synobal--If the censorship of legit sites doesn't end I'll be looking for a new political sub. How is USPOLITICS?   Strongly agree that opinion should be included along with news.    The point is that Obama needs to fight for his judicial nominees because these nominations have real-world consequences.   Thanks for the kind words. I came to reddit after the demise of digg, where, for awhile, substantive discussion did seem possible. I can understand reddit moderators' efforts to prevent flame wars and self-promotion, but I think you need to be careful about banning news and commentary sources. It certainly makes you look biased, even if that is not your intent.  At the very least, the process of determining which sources are legit, and why, should be transparent. What are your criteria for inclusion as a source, and why? Anything short of that looks like prejudice or a hidden agenda.    Agreed.                  Honestly, i use reddit to try to disseminate information I find valuable, in the areas of politics, health, tech, and women's issues. I don't think reddit should block access to any news source, frankly. It's members should decide the source's value, via upvotes or downvotes. I thought that was the whole idea of reddit -- largely unmediated access to information by its members. I don't want some redditor, whose agenda I have no clue about, making decisions about what I can see on reddit or what I can post from legitimate news sources.   You may quibble about Huffpo --I'd disagree with you on excluding it -- but Salon and especially Mother Jones? Really? That looks to me like a conservative or libertarian bias -- and again, bias is just the opposite of what reddit should be.   @Burkey -- Now it's starting to make sense. Thanks.   @asdjrocky-- Very well put. Agree 100%.   @catmoon-- How does banning legitimate, award-winning political journalism sites improve quality standards? Seems to me to harm the quality of the subreddit.   @montreal01--Not an open system with this type of censorship going on.   To quote the article, "Its the /r/politics moderators who dont understand Reddit or comprehend their role."  WTF is going on here?   @Turicus--But the boots helped, as the other anecdote about the silk shell demonstrates.   "One thing I've learned is that one person's illogical belief is another person's survival skill. And nothing is more logical than trying to survive."  Great insights in this piece, which deserves a wider audience.                                    @brotherwayne-- I agree. I just wanted to hear how he articulated it.      @EducatedHottentot--Why?                                    Great piece on the government's counterproductive Enterprise IT practices.   Great article that puts the messed-up launch in its bureaucratic context.      A great article, and scary, in that there doesn't seem to be a readily apparent route to thwart the combo of Tea Partiers and big money guys.                                    "The stand by conservatives that led to the current crisis was the outgrowth of a long-running effort, waged by a galaxy of well-funded groups, to undo President Obamas health care law."            From the article:  "Ive seen no conservatives, anywhere, actually question the morality of debt-limit extortion."                                          This is a great read. It is written in the style a reporter would use if the shutdown were happening in another country--no euphemisms or false equivalencies==the Tea Party Republicans are an "extremist rump."   Hypocrisy, thy name is Republicans.      @infinitejest -- You are either very naive or very dishonest. The same bill that the Republicans stripped the food stamps from contained huge subsidies to agribusiness, which they had no trouble spending money on.                                                                                                                                                  	136
 Final destination   I think most celebrities have acted in films as unnoticeable roles before they are famous. So go check the films years before, you may find the famous actor today playing the unnoticeable role there.    Urban Legend    I agree with your idea. People nowadays always feel helpless with something in their life. So they are expecting power to solve the problems or expecting people with super power to save them. that may be the psychological reason of why people will buy this kind of films.    Yeah, that may be the main reason.    Why people always think alien to be so strange and horrible thing? Although we haven't found out aliens in other planet yet, we can also regard them as friends, not always our enemy.    But women often prefer older men in rel life too. Why? I don't think so. My friends sometimes talk about this and they all want to find boys just one or two years alder than them to be their boyfriends.    then why they can be so popular?    but the reason that these films can help the film maker make money is that people buy it, which means people like to watch this kind of film. why?   I love this movie. And I sometimes really want this time machine to be the real thing in our life so that we can have more choice to choose the life we like and change something we don't like.    I find that most of American movies are about adventures, disasters happen to our earth or something bad in our life so that they can create a super hero to solve all these problems. These super heroes are sometimes imagined like the Superman and the Spider-man and sometimes it is a real man. Is this the rule of making popular movies? Or there are some other reasons?    But we can realize what destruction natural disasters will make. According to the development of technology now, some machines used for predict the earthquake works now. Therefore, human beings can predict natural disasters and take actions to reduce our lost. it is the development of the world. If Pompeians knew it in advance, then they could leave Pompeii to avoid being killed by this disaster.    Our teacher show us the documentary of Pompeii and I have watched the movie Pompeii myself last month. I was shocked by them because all the things happened at that time were something we can never imagined. I think it worth seeing because it can arouse our awareness of protecting our environment and keep developing our technology of observing the natural disasters.    Pompeii, although it was not actually a documentary but something directed according to what we've seen in Pompei today. I do think we should watch this.    Make everyone hate you is easy while make everyone like you is not. You can just do the same thing to everyone like smoke in the public or talk about someone's privacy loud to others to make everyone hate you. But you should do different things to different people to make them like you. And this is not easy at all.   	15

 Shit I shit   he's draining everyone of their powers to math   hmmm so how far does a ship have to go under to, by your simplified, one definitive definition of sink for a ship to be considered to have "sunk"?  Completely submersed? to a certain depth? To the bottom?  Now what if that "sunk" ship resurfaces? I mean youre obviously a troll or very irrational of a person to not be able to understand that a word may have multiple meanings...   But sure. you're right. I think you probably need this win anyways kiddo. Good luck!   |Olympic's first major mishap occurred on her fifth voyage on 20 September 1911, when she collided with the British cruiser HMS Hawke off the Isle of Wight. The collision took place as Olympic and Hawke were running parallel to each other through the Solent. As Olympic turned to starboard, the wide radius of her turn took the commander of the Hawke by surprise, and he was unable to take sufficient avoiding action.[29] The Hawke's bow, which had been designed to sink ships by ramming them, collided with Olympic's starboard side near the stern, tearing two large holes in Olympic's hull, above and below the waterline, resulting in the flooding of two of her watertight compartments and a twisted propeller shaft|  See definition of sinking,  The compartments flooded, so therefore it sunk. Not completely, but it did sink. Like when you "sink" down into your seat.  Now can you just admit loss and move on?   Ah, you are correct. Well to an extent. The article just says she survived the sinkage of the three ships. never says she was on them at the time of sinkages.  Rebuttal?   Sank as in to sink correct. Well let's see what the definition of sink is.   Sink 1 go down below the surface of something, especially of a liquid; become submerged. 2 descend; drop.  discussion over    Uh, I'm pretty sure It sank a little if it collided with another vessel. The headline doesn't say completely sank or submersed. If we wanna be technical assholes here   Username checks out, does go to Hampshire       I dont get this at all. Why take this picture and post it to reddit? And sure im gonna get a shit ton of hate because its such an "emotional picture" but I dont care.  1. Why would you take a picture of a person in this predicament that you work with? As a medical provider, ive been in these situations and If i saw you taking a picture of me like this or of one of my colleagues I'd come knock your teeth out.  2. Reminds me of photographers that flock to tragedy for the "perfect shot." They have photographers that will delay a persons care for their shot, one particular case where a photographer climbed on top of an ambulance that my team and I were trying to load a 2 month old in septic shock into evac to a USN ship. Real piece of shit, but point being this is a pretty shitty picture.  3. What did you plan on doing with the picture? Are you going to go give it to that young provider, so he can remember that time he lost a 19 year old?   But whatever, im an asshole i guess. The asshole still inside working feeling my heart out for this new young doc while i watch some toolbag emt take a picture of him.

 OK; good.    Well in my opinion if Olmert had been PM for 1 more year we would have definitely had a peace deal.  Agreed.  If Peres had been president instead of netanyahu in 1996 or in 2009 we would have had a peace deal.  Agreed about 2009, but I'm still not sure about 2006.  If Israeli public opinion swings to the left again then the likelihood will go up, but I don't know when that would happen.  Perhaps sometime in the 2020s?   Ideally the two sides could come to some arrangement where if the settlers cannot be removed, then at least the borders are not very strict, where Jews and Palestinians can use the same roads and live near the same areas in a middle strip of territory between Israel proper and Palestine proper. Jerusalem may also need to be shared somehow, because there are simply too many settlers in East Jerusalem. Its a shitty situation, but if both sides actually wanted to make peace then it could definitely happen.  Yes, I agree with this. Of course, I honestly wonder if the Arabs in East Jerusalem prefer Israeli rule or Palestinian rule. Any thoughts on this?  Hopefully Netanyahu will be replaced in the next 5 years by a genuine two state solution supporter,  Agreed.  and if Abbas dies he will be replaced by someone like Barghouti or Fayyad who would be as willing or more willing to make a deal with Israel.  I don't think that Barghouti will replace Abbas after Abbas dies or retires due to the fact that I don't think that Israel will release Barghouti, at least not anytime soon. Fayyad might be a possible Palestinian Presidential candidate, though, as might someone such as Jibril Rajoub (sp?).  Also, out of curiosity, do you think that we would have already had a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty if Shaul Mofaz would have won the 2008 Kadima leadership election? Serious question, for the record.  Also, three additional questions:  1. What exactly do you think the future of the Golan Heights will be?  2. What exactly do you think that Hillary Clinton's policy towards Israel will be if she will win the U.S. Presidency in 2016?  3. Out of pure curiosity, exactly which party did you vote for in the 2015 Israeli Knesset elections?   Done. :)   OK, but could I just call him from a therapist's office if necessary?   Any thoughts on this?   What exactly are your thoughts on Ellen Pao?   Thank you very much for this info. :)  Also, calcium chloride is table salt, correct?   Tom Monaghan is such a lucky bastard! ;)   Maybe, or maybe it would have been even more successful.   Yep. :)   Martians are aliens, though.   It is.   Nostradamus = The Great Illusionist. ;)    True, but I still think that a deal could have been made. Arafat despite his many faults in my opinion did ultimately want to make a deal. I think that if the deal that Peres agreed to in 2011 was offered to Arafat in the late 90's then we would have had a peace deal.  OK; fair enough, I suppose.  The president has no actual political power, which is why we don't have peace with the PA right now, but my understanding is that Netanyahu let Peres negotiate with Abbas in secret talks to see if a deal could be reached. Peres came to an understanding with Abbas on a fairly comprehensive deal, but Netanyahu was not satisfied with the details and then unilaterally ended the talks, as he has the power to do since he is the PM, not Peres.  OK; this appears to make sense.  Also, out of curiosity, when exactly do you think that we will have a final Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty (as in, in real life)?   Couldn't Clinton feel free to negotiate starting from 1997, though? After all, he wouldn't have had much to worry about politically after getting re-elected in 1996.   OK; for the record, you might very well be correct in regards to this.  Also, though, I wonder if having Peres win in 1996 could have caused the Second Intifada to break out earlier in the event that Israeli-Palestinian peace talks would have failed. Any thoughts on this?   Two things:  1. Abbas isn't Arafat.  2. Did Peres even have the authority to negotiate a deal with Abbas? After all, isn't the Israeli Presidency supposed to be a purely ceremonial position?   That would be rather risky to do from my house since I don't want my parents to know about this, though. While I told my parents that I want to be a eunuch and to feminize my face and body (and was crystal-clear so that they will know that I am not joking), I don't want them to know the extent of the preparations that I am making for this yet.        So you think that Peres would have actually succeeded in creating a mutually agreeable peace treaty between him and Arafat?    Just tell your doctor about this. Tell him that by preventing you from getting one, he is directly responsible for endangering your life. I don't think he will be willing to do that anymore if you present the case this way. But I might be wrong. Any doctors can give some advice on this?  Believe me--I will make sure to tell this to all of my therapists and doctors.   Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this.   Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this.   That's too far away, though.   Believe me--I strongly do not want to do this and thus would strongly prefer not to do this.   I previously tried contacting Dr. Arknoff using his website and put in my e-mail. I don't think that I ever got any response from his office. Thus, should I try to do this again?   Care to please elaborate on this?   What do you mean by "No," though?   Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?         Their last common ancestor in the male line was French King Louis IX, who died in 1270, 319 years earlier!       You only have one chance at this, and there is too much that can go wrong. I obviously get dysphoria and gate-keeping, but one can navigate the medical system.  Not all aspiring eunuchs succeed in doing this, though. Else, self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts would never occur.  It's great that you're really trying hard to go with the safe route, but please don't let potential failure of that to drive you to do something possibly harmful to yourself.  Understood; I just really hope that at least one doctor in the U.S. is going to be willing to perform this procedure on me.  Basically, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:  1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.  2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.  3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.  Also, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done.   Who exactly told you that, though?  Also, for the record, I myself have also previously heard something like that.   Again--I'm not worried about money; rather, I'm worried about excessive gate-keeping.    My mother used to use fire to sterilize needles when we had splinters and this method of sterilization is also used in labs. So I would suggest dipping it in rubbing alcohol (make sure it's not soaked so let it drip until it stops dripping) and then put it in the fire for about 5 seconds (really until the rubbing alcohol is burned off). And this tool should be metal.  I don't have any fire at my house, though.  If you can do that even better, they could help you faster I would think.  OK; good.  I suggest learning how stitch pieces of fabric and learning the stitch used to close skin. Also for the stitches if you can somehow use the ones surgeons use.  OK, I suppose.  What would you use these to do?  Rubber bands: Put them around my testicles, thus cutting off blood flow to my testicles. After a certain amount of time, my testicles will die due to the lack of blood flow. Afterwards, with the rubber bands still attached to my dead testicles, go to the emergency room and have my dead testicles get removed.  A burdizzo: Cut the spermatic cord and thus kill the testicles, no? Also, afterwards, go to the emergency room and get my dead testicles removed.  Alcohol injections: Use them to kill my testicles and then go to the emergency room afterwards in order to get my testicles removed.    Honestly, in a rational way of thinking, if the safe route doesn't work then a DIY orchi shouldn't really be an option.  Unfortunately, though, there is still excessive gate-keeping in regards to orchiectomies. After all, why exactly do you think that self-castration attempts and "back-alley" castration attempts still occur nowadays?  An orchi isn't exactly a ton of money. Maybe work, safe, and be patient. You'll probably get there.  No, but it does involve excessive gate-keeping for aspiring eunuchs.   Thanks for this info, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable with these questions of mine.    First of all I just really hope you'll try your hardest to do it the safe and legal way, please, please, please try hard to do it that way!  Yes, I will certainly make sure to try extremely hard to get it done the legal and safe way. In fact, I will make it crystal-clear to the therapist at my university (once I will talk with him or her about this issue) that the alternative to safe, legal castration is self-castration or a "back-alley" castration on my part and that thus I extremely strongly prefer that I be given some safe, legal pathway to a safe, legal castration regardless of just how many roadblocks this pathway will have.  Basic tips: make sure all tools are sterilized and sharp (dull blades can lead to more injury).  What exactly should I use to sterilize these tools, though?  I suggest researching where your major blood vessels are to make sure you don't hit one of them.  Completely agreed.  Have 9-1-1 on speed dial and a phone right next to you in case anything goes wrong.  Yes, that certainly makes sense; that said, though, what about doing all of this in, say,a  private stall in a hospital bathroom? That way, I will be able to run to the emergency room shortly afterwards.  Make sure to leave skin to stitch the skin up so you don't have anything exposed.  I am not very good with stitching, though.  Have something like Bactine to put on the open wound to prevent infection  OK.  If anything goes wrong, get professional help, do not hesitate to go to the ER or call 9-1-1.  Completely agreed.  Also, though, what about using rubber bands, a burdizzo, and/or alcohol injections?  I really hope you can do it the safe route though, where professionals can do it and you have access to anesthetics.  Completely agreed; however, I am just not fond of the gate-keeping in regards to this and thus unfortunately have to be prepared for the tragic situation where the worst comes to pass. After all, I have already heard of some aspiring eunuchs who previously went down the self-castration and/or the "back-alley" castration route due to the fact that they could not get this done in a safe, medical setting. :( What a tragedy. :( Also, if you are curious, I identify as genderqueer. :)   What about using a burdizzo or rubber bands instead, though?   Thanks for this info. I just looked up what a scalpel is and it scared the Hell out of me! :(   Also, though, exactly what tool did this "surgeon" use to perform your orchiectomy?   Understood.  Anyway, if I will have any more questions about this, then I will make sure to ask you. :)   Wow! On exactly which websites did you get this information, though?   I am surprised that people advertise illegal surgeries such as this over the Internet, though. (After all, this surgery is illegal, correct?)      OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.  Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated? Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is). Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me. Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing. The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.  Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.  Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.  Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary. Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.  Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards. I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way. Indeed, whenever I shave my face, I am always reminded of just how incredibly beautiful of a (trans-)woman I would make. :) However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).  Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general. In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me. Also, if anyone has any additional information which I might be interested in, then please don't hesitate to share this information with me!  Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?  And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post.    It's not hard to remove your testicles; the hard part is avoiding death, infection, and mangling the area.  In that case, do you have any advice on how exactly to reduce these risks? After all, I myself am personally curious about this in the tragic event that the worst will come to pass.    If you are ever so ready to go down the self route look at alcohol castration.  Please elaborate on this; after all, I myself am personally curious about this in the tragic event that the worst comes to pass.    If you don't bleed to death in the first few minutes  Holy shit! One can bleed to death *that* quickly from doing this?    I got an orchi from effectively a back alley 'surgeon' when I was 21 and I almost died of a massive infection.  Apologies for asking, but how exactly did you find such a surgeon in the first place?    What do you mean by that? Remember, unlike the US, Mexico has always been a very centralized country, more so in that era.  What I mean is that Mexico could have "thrown in the towel" and saved some, if not a lot of lives, by ending the war earlier. After all, Germany stopped fighting in World War I way before Allied troops would have been in Berlin.  The northern territories were vastly deserted, and few people lived there, so the Mexican army had little to think that losing those battles would lose them the war.  How exactly did Mexico plan to expel the U.S. from these northern territories, though?  If someone attacked Canada, and they occupy the northern territories, no one would say the war is decided. Now, the distances between Puebla, Veracruz, and Mexico City are not that large, and the bulk of the army was in Mexico City anyway, so it made sense to make the final stand there.  Was there ever any doubt that the U.S. would end up defeating Mexico in the end (including capturing Mexico City), though?   I personally strongly like them, but I have also heard some other people dismiss them and say that their music is "elevator music" and/or something along those lines.  Thus, what exactly are your own thoughts on the band Air Supply?   Why did Mexico fight on until the very end in the Mexican-American War? Did it seek to bleed the U.S. sufficiently dry in order to make the U.S. seek a compromise peace and in order to have the U.S. reduce at least some of its demands for Mexican territory? Or was there another reason for this?  Any thoughts on this? After all, in the Mexican-American War, the Mexican military was willing to do what the German military refused to do in World War I--specifically continue to fight a losing war all the way up to the very end, up to the point when enemy troops have already captured the Mexican capital.   Well, Ukraine gets some territory in exchange for losing some other territory.   What if Ukraine will get Transnistria (from Moldova) as territorial compensation for its loss of Crimea, though?   At least an East Pakistani could reach West Pakistan purely by sea, though. In contrast, a Muslim from Hyderabad certainly wouldn't have been able to do that.   But if I was a Russian nationalist, then I would never agree to that. After all, Kaliningrad represents the massively enormous bleeding that the Soviet Union endured during World War II in order to defeat and destroy the Nazi German regime.   Actually, that was the popular vote in New York state, whose electoral votes decided the outcome of this election.    Also, since we can't assume that British people in 1947 could see the future, does your plan include a partition of Hyderabad as well?  No, because Hyderabad does not have a common border with Pakistan.      By "Bundu," did you mean "Hindu"?  Also, though, wasn't there large-scale support in favor of partition among Indian Muslims (or at least in some/many/most Muslim-majority parts of British India)?   Completely agreed, which is why I intend to take hormone replacement therapy (specifically, estrogen).   Any thoughts on this?   Oh! Anyway, thanks for this info, and goof luck with your future plans in regards to this. :)      Can Trump's outrageousness win him a new reality show, though?   Clickbait?   Donald Trump--once an ass, always an ass. ;)   Correlation does not necessarily equal causation, though.   Indeed, I think that the 1884 U.S. Presidential election was the closest one (percentage-wise) up to the 2000 U.S. Presidential election.      Being excessively lazy?      Good. :)   OK; good. :)    I lived in Korea and Germany and enjoyed both. I would never have fit in long term in Korea but I had a lot of German friends and could have easily and happily stayed there long term.  Thanks for this info. :) Also, out of curiosity, do you speak Korean and/or German fluently?  The problem with holding a vote is some people will vote one way and some the other.  And yet Britain managed to deal with this in Scotland, as did Canada in Quebec.  I would never tell a large group of Americans that they have to forcibly relocate or they are no longer American citizens.  You won't have to do either of these two things, though.  Also the federal govenrment has built infrastructure in every state and every state in effect has a share of the national debt I would not let a group vote to simply not pay their share of the debt.  What about if a U.S. state agrees to pay its share of the U.S. national debt before seceding, though?   I've really developed a soft spot for Pope Francis in spite of the fact that I am a Pastafarian. :) Seriously. :)   OK; fair enough, and for that, I apologize.   It states this on his website, though:  "Some doctors require letters from other physicians in order to have this surgery done.  This may or may not be required in your case."  The "may or maybe not be required in your case" part raises some questions in regards to this.      Where exactly outside of the U.S. did you live, though?  Also, for the record, the U.S. Civil War actually appears to be a poor example to use in regards to this. After all, I myself ideally support allowing a U.S. state to secede and yet would have still supported the Union in the U.S. Civil War due to the fact that the Confederacy was pro-slavery.   Also, out of curiosity--are you still able to get an erection using your penis right now (if/when you actually want to do this, that is)?  I apologize about asking this, but I am extremely curious about this due to the fact that this question is of personal interest to me.   I've got a question for you, though--would you support allowing any U.S. state to voluntarily secede from the U.S. if a majority of that state's voters wanted to secede from the U.S.?   From this article itself:  "  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Mr. Azoulays remarks. In a statement, he described them as hurtful and said they do not reflect the position of the government. Mr. Netanyahu said he had spoken with Mr. Azoulay to remind him that Israel is a home for all Jews and that as minister of religious affairs, he serves all of Israels citizens.  "   I just want to test out the impact of testosterone on me in the event that I will be a eunuch (just to make sure that I would still be able to get erections and whatnot). After all, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to this just to be safe.    Actually the eunuch.org website recommends chemical castration using a T-blocker first to see how it is before getting an orchiectomy, just as /u/dnanyu suggested.  Yes, that certainly makes sense.   Also not having either T or E can result in your bones becoming brittle.  Yes--due to osteoporosis, correct?    You are making a lot of hypothetical assumptions here. No one knows how things would have turned out. East Pakistan went to the Pakistan to match religious lines, but that eventually resulted in war and the creation of Bangladesh. No one saw that coming. Who's to say that Kashmir wouldn't have gone the same way?  Please pardon my ignorance in regards to this, but didn't East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) try seceding from Pakistan due to the fact that Bengali parties won a majority of the seats in the Pakistani government and yet were not allowed to form a governing coalition? If so, then this wouldn't work for Kashmir due to the fact that Kashmir has much less people than East Pakistan had.   Hindu princes were willing to give up their territory to India, but if one of them was forced to give up his land to Pakistan, then all of them might have balked.  Which in turn is why I am advocating having Britain always make this decision in place of the princes. Yes, the princes were nominally sovereign, but this didn't really mean that much and Britain could have thus probably easily overrode the princes' will in regards to this.   The Kashmiri people were split on religious grounds (although they were mostly Muslim,)  That's why I proposed partitioning Kashmir.  but the royal family was Hindu.  Yes; correct.   Britain didn't want to upset the arrangement any more than they already had.  And that was a mistaken on Britain's part.   There was already a lot of ill will between Pakistan and India.  Agreed, but that was due to the 1947 Indian partition and due to the previous Muslim-Hindu tensions. With Indian Muslims having their own state in Pakistan and thus allowed to determine their own destiny, Indo-Pakistani relations might have gradually become better over time.  Kashmir hasn't helped, but it certainly isn't the main motivating factor.  What exactly is your basis for this statement, though?  There are hundreds of years of bad blood between those countries, and it's hard to say that things would be different with just one change.  It is worth noting, though, that as far as I know, Hindu-Muslim relations in South Asia were previously never as strained as they became in the 1930s or 1940s and beyond.   So should I post this thought as my own Shower Thought here? Serious question, for the record.   Exactly what country are you from, though?   Any thoughts on this?   Nobody? ;) As in, not even one person? ;)   Great to hear! :) Hopefully this will provide additional "ammunition" for the pro-marijuana legalization side to use against our opponents! :)   Agreed; that said, though, I wonder if I can try out testosterone blockers with estrogen and then with testosterone just in case. I mean, I might very well prefer to use estrogen (at least most of the time), but I do want to keep all of my post-orchiectomy options available just in case.   Hopefully this is a new thread topic here.  Anyway, my argument here is this:  If the British would have partitioned Kashmir along religious lines in 1947 (with the Muslim-majority areas going to Pakistan and the Hindu-majority and Buddhist-majority areas going to India), then there would have been no decades-long Kashmir dispute and conflict. In turn, this would have meant that several tens of thousands of people who got killed in real life would not have gotten killed (as a result of the warfare over Kashmir).  In addition to this, Pakistan might not have went nuclear without the Kashmir dispute, which in turn might have meant that there would not have been a risk of a nuclear war in South Asia in the 1990s and beyond. Likewise, without the Kashmir dispute, Pakistan's military and intelligence service might not be as pampered and might not have as much influence as they actually have in real life.  Also, with less Indo-Pakistani tensions, both India and Pakistan would have been able to spend more money on things such as economic development and mutual cooperation instead of spending that money on their militaries (armed forces).  In addition to this, while  the war over Bangladesh might have still happened (whether in 1971 or in a different year) without the Kashmir dispute, this war in itself might not have derailed Indo-Pakistani relations in the long(er)-run. After all, Pakistan only lost Bangladesh due to the fact that it was committing genocide there and thus indirectly caused a humanitarian crisis to occur next door in India (as a result of millions of Bangladeshi refugees fleeing to India).  Anyway, does anyone here have any thoughts on this?   Actually, California first needs to successfully secede from the Union in order to become a Great Power in its own right. ;)   California, here we come! Right back where we started from! California! ;)   Yes, I certainly understand all of that. :)  Also, for what it's worth, I'd like to try out testosterone blockers and estrogen as soon as possible (say, within one year or so). If I will like them (especially estrogen), then I will continue using them (and some of the effects of estrogen, such as the increased emotions, actually sound very appealing to me). In addition, it is worth noting that perhaps these testosterone blockers and estrogen will allow me to get a better picture of my own gender identity (as appears to have previously been the case for some other male-to-female cross-dreamers).  In addition to this, though, an orchiectomy also has sterilization value for me considering that all other contraceptives and sterilizations, including vasectomies, can fail. Frankly, I myself certainly need to be sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after freezing some of my sperm, of course).   Would France have tolerated the existence of a Communist government in Spain, though?   Thanks for this info; thus, I wonder if this might depend on the person.   OK, but wouldn't one need to take hormone replacement therapy in addition to testosterone blockers in order to eliminate the risk of depression?      The Saudis would beg to differ with him on that.   Ah Yes--I still remember when I myself played Yu-Gi-Oh 10+ years ago. :)   I don't think that the Western Allies would have been interested in a separate peace with Germany with or without the Nazis. After all, as far as I know, FDR viewed all of Germany, rather than only the Nazis, as being the problem. Plus, Churchill wouldn't have went against FDR on this considering that the U.S. was essentially Britain's "sugar daddy" during this time.   Thank you very much! :)    Ah. TIL something new.  Yeah, take a look at the pre-Operation Barbarossa front lines:  http://omniatlas.com/maps/europe/19410621/  True, but the Soviets are prepared to go full scorched earth on the Germans. Had they (the Germans) fortified their positions, they may have to fight a bigger Red Army, but they themselves would also be better supplied, would have higher morale, can have better air support and would not have to engage in so much street fighting.  Sure, but it still wouldn't have been enough for the Germans to win. In fact, I am unsure if the Germans could have even bled the Soviet Union sufficiently dry in order to make it a draw--after all, if the Soviet Union becomes visibly weakened, then the Western Allies might be compelled to send some of their own troops to the Eastern Front in order to help the Soviet Union out.       Didn't he went through Ukraine to get to Russia?  Yes, he did, but that was only *after* he invaded the Soviet Union.  I think he should've just taken control of Ukraine, strengthen the supply lines and position there first, then strike Russia proper.  Yes, Hitler could have done that, but that would have also given the Red Army more time to prepare and to recover.   Yep. *Shudders* :(   This is certainly extremely great news! :)   Unless they have or previously had a penis, that is.   Unless they are trans-women and have or had a penis, that is.   Ukraine and the Baltic states take Putin pretty seriously, though.   Yes, very possibly. :)   Hitler didn't control Ukraine before the invaded the Soviet Union, though.   Yep.    Wow. In hindsight, the reliance on horses is probably a mistake.  Agreed; after all, it's 1941, not 1841.   ... 'course, in hindsight, the invasion of the Soviet Union is probably a bigger mistake.  Actually, I am not so sure about that. After all, if a Nazi-Soviet war was inevitable, then couldn't it have been better for Hitler to strike sooner rather than later?      It was still Constantinople back then, though.    From this very same article:  " Sukhomlinovs opinion piece sent a clear message to friend and foe alike, including Germany, where its inflammatory rhetoric only stoked paranoia about encirclement. When Kaiser Wilhelm received a translated version he scribbled angry notes in the margins, noting that Russias strategic railroads were All against Germany! and concluding Well! Finally the Russians have shown their hand. Any person in Germany who does not now believe that the Russo-Gauls are not working together at high tension for a war with us very soon and that we should take corresponding counter-measures deserves to be sent to the lunatic asylum   A few days alter Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg passed the article along to the German ambassador to London, Prince Lichnowsky, with this gloomy note: The reaction on German public opinion has been unmistakable and serious. Whereas formerly, it was only the extremists among the Pan-Germans and militarists who urged that Russia was making systematic preparation for a war of aggression upon us very soon, even moderate public men are now inclined to this view "  For the record, Franz Ferdinand was assassinated just 15 days after Sukhomlinovs opinion piece was written.         What is nobody's business but the Turks'?   May he RIP. :( While I have never watched any of his movies, I have heard that he was a good actor. :(      I think that almost all of the Sudeten Germans were expelled regardless of whether or not they actively supported Nazi Germany. In fact, I think that the only Sudeten Germans (5% or so of the total Sudeten German population) who were allowed to stay were those who either had crucial skills which could not be replaced or those who were married to ethnic Czechs.      What about if you're a Black guy in Central Africa, though?   I am still a college student, but I might as well put my dad's profession here (since I'm pretty sure that he qualifies for this):  Computer programmer and a manager of several people at his job.       Yup, and kicking a particular ethnicity out of a country is still a form of genocide.  So the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans was a form of genocide?   Yeah man! Completely agreed, unfortunately. :(   And events such as this are why some/many Israelis are concerned by the idea of an Iran with nuclear weapons.   And the Alaouite (sp?) Dynasty couldn't have modernized Morocco without French (and Spanish) help? After all, starting from the late 19th century, Japan was able to modernize by itself, no?   I apologize for asking, but did it hurt (for your girlfriend, that is)?   OK--as a genderqueer person who wants to become a (physical) eunuch, here is my question: Can getting an orchiectomy before one begins hormone replacement therapy result in depression? After all, I have heard that the effect that an orchiectomy has on one's hormone levels can result in depression.  Any thoughts on this? Also, Yes, this is a completely serious question, for the record.   It's great that the Roman Catholic Church has finally apologized for the previous sins of Catholics in the New World. :) After all, an extremely late apology is certainly better than no apology at all. :)   Except by us Pastafarians, that is. :)   Yep. :)   Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?  Also, having World War I break out a couple of years sooner might accomplish this.   In spite of this, though, Trump is still a joke candidate.   You forgot hot Korean women and the best food anywhere in North Korea. ;)   And how exactly is this meaningfully different from making Hitler jokes? After all, Lil' Kim probably still had a long way before he will catch up to Hitler in terms of brutality.   Well, wasn't Kim's grandfather hand-picked by Stalin to lead North Korea? If so, then this might explain a lot.    I would rather have him deposed, and tried for crimes against the North Korean people in an international court, facing life in prison.  Life is prison? Why not death instead?   Well, Lil' Kim *could* try organizing a Night of the Long Knives-style event in North Korea if he really wanted to. ;)    They are not, which is why they've tried to assassinate him (thwarted by a traffic lady)  Source, please?     	152
 It was always $550 here   Huh... I would totally watch that    I think it was Raiju   No he didn't. He took several hits from fists and swords, followed by a direct hit by a nuclear bomb, before Gispsy's super powerful nuclear powered vortex turbine being fired full blast into his chest at point blank range finally killed him.   605 feet?  The new 2014 Godzilla is the biggest Godzilla has ever been and he's 350 feet. He was originally about 160 feet.  Godzilla certainly is more durable, and his radioactive breath and seemingly supernatural strength and healing abilities make him insanely powerful, but Slattern would still be a pretty worthy opponent for him. Plus we never really get a clear description of what exactly Slattern is capable of.  Due to Godzilla's radioactive breath and his ability to seemingly gain strength and power and heal himself whenever the plot requires, he'd probably be a Cat 6, but Cat 7 seems a little crazy and is downplaying the size of strength of Slattern a considerable amount.  Although it's really hard to put Godzilla and other Kaiju into the Pacific Rim class system because of how much their size and strength and abilities change from movie to movie.    Slattern took a nuclear blast at close range and was pretty much fine afterwards    Jeez what movie is this from? That's pretty graphic   This is fake   Tell it to the judge, buddy   No one said anything was wrong with it   Leo didn't win because he isn't good enough. He makes solid enjoyable movies and always gives a good performance, but he is rarely ever in the same league as the nominees he is up against. Just because he's cool and hip and his moves are usually the most widely accessible and fun among the usual darker, more serious (or 'challenging' or however you'd like to describe it) competition doesn't mean he deserves to win anything.    That sounds horrendously depressing    Huh, I guess it's just because of the size of the buildings in New York, but I would have thought the Millenium Godzilla was larger than Zilla.   Although it's hard to tell since Zilla's size changed so much in that movie anyway   How big is Zilla 98 compared to these guys?   Also that is clearly Tom Wilkinson as Andrew Johnson, not 'Dennis Clark'   You got the touch...   No King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan or Mechagodzilla? Not even Biollante? But Megalon makes the list? Above Destroyah? Booo, sir.   I have no idea who that is    It's just a poster    Is that all he said about it?   Maybe Gareth Edwards is just a Slash fan   According to IMDb that scene was only put in the movie for the sole purpose that it could be cut out to appease the ratings board, so that Scorsese could get away with the more important violent scenes throughout the rest of the film that he didn't want to cut out.   Oh man, all the rumors were true   I think he's talking about the brony with short hair   It's a very common saying here in Australia unfortunately    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkDFBVczcGY   This makes Drive Angry and Getaway look like big budget summer blockbusters. How can this look so bad   Something about pick up lines referencing God just creeps me out so much   Subtly? Really?    I was hoping that too, but I think we all knew this was going to happen. CGI is just so much easier and cheaper these days, and having actual animatronics on location could result in too many problems to be worth it to them. It's a real shame and I'm gonna miss the awesome practical effects.   I think that actually looks much better. Indy 4 had a really 'fake' look to it. Yours looks much nicer.   Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite movies, and when I was a kid I absolutely loved all 3 movies. So I'll try to explain why, to me, the second two don't hold up anymore like the first one does.  Really boring stories, with no sense of wonder and discovery and science and wondering 'could this happen in real life?" Just generic stranded on an island with monsters plotlines. The Lost World has some potentially interesting ideas but didn't go anywhere with them.  Really dull and dreary tone. Jurassic Park was 50% fun and joy and childlike wonder, and then 50% terror and fear and tension. 2 and 3 were just bland, not very engaging, leaving us waiting for something exciting to happen.  Boring characters. Jurassic Park had fun lovable realistic characters, 2 and 3 were filled with pretty generic two dimensional dinosaur-meals. Even Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill didn't seem like they were acting like their characters from the first. Pete Postlethwaite in The Lost World is an exception.  Didn't do anything new or interesting with the dinosaurs. Jurassic Park made the dinosaurs seem real and amazing, like we had never seen before. It was new and exciting and made them feel like real living animals, and brought on all the emotions of wonder and amazement, and then fear, that comes with that. In 2 and 3, sure all our favorites came back, and there were some new ones, but they just felt like monsters.  Frankly 2 and 3 just felt lazy and boring and uninspired. None of the cast or crew seemed very enthusiastic about churning out more cash-in installments. Acting was meh. Direction was meh. Story was meh. No emotions or excitement or fun or discovery or wonder. Just dinosaurs killing generic characters. The Lost World had a potentially interesting premise, and some of the action set pieces were alright, but as a whole it was flat and dull and pointless. And then Jurassic Park 3 felt like a lame cheap sci-fi tv movie.  Jurassic Park made you feel like you were there and captured your imagination. It was a new and exciting experience like never before. 2 and 3 were just excuses to watch more people get eaten by monsters for 90 minutes.  That's just my opinion anyway.    That's creepy as shit   If I owned a museum I would totally hire this guy to make dinosaurs. These are insanely cool   [oh my god I can't waaaaiit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwamV1fbYQk)   Dude. It is your duty to be our secret inside man. Do it for all of us Jurassic Park geeks.   Godammit Ennis   I haven't seen it, but I believe so.   Dark Knight had the same thing where the 65mm IMAX shots and scenes were a different aspect ratio than the rest of the scenes. Most of the movie was normal widescreen, whereas the action sequences and shots of the city were more 'full screen' or 'square'.  MI4 had IMAX shots as well, but the aspect ratio was made to be the same as the rest of the movie. I guess it depends on whether or not the director wants that fluctuating widescreen effect.       35mm is the normal film size. 65mm is double size and is not so normal. Gives a much better quality, larger, richer, grander picture. Basically like bigger better resolution on your screen.  Sound of Music, Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, 2001, Samsara and recently The Master were filmed on 65mm. Chris Nolan uses it sometimes for special shots or sequences. It's a pretty big difference if you look at them side by side.  IMAX uses 65mm film as well, but I think you get a larger image due to aspect ratio... Or something... I don't actually know much about IMAX at all.  I'm guessing Colin will be doing this film Nolan style. Most of the scenes will probably be 35mm like a normal film, and then probably the big sweeping scenery shots of beautiful Hawaii will be 65mm, if not some of the actions sequences as well. (Hopefully)  Frankly it's great to see that it's being shot on film at all as opposed to digital.      What every fuck is that   I feel like the mountainous regions are a bit too big, making the city a little too small    Octodaaaaaaaad  Nobody suspects a thing    I used to have a horse that was best friends with another horse at the local stables. They used to freak out whenever they were separated.    Looks like they're melting   Doesn't this movie come out in May? Whether or not this particular source is bullshit or not, surely we're gonna start getting new trailers or posters or details or whatever in the next month or so   Cundy or Kaminski. Jurassic Park 3 was shot and lit like a cheap sci fi tv show.   But it'll probably be a completely new guy.

Whatever the dude's name is. Get him.   eeewww   Anyone know when the PS4 version is coming out?   I only like Quentin Tarantino's first three films. All the characters in his movies tend to be one dimensional cartoon characters and his movies never have any interesting depth or character development. It's just silly unrealistic dialogue, references and homages, and everyone trying way too hard to be cool. Django was alright as a fun silly bloody action movie but that's about it. Nothing special.  I don't like Jennifer Lawrence or Bradley Cooper or Ryan Gosling. Leo DiCaprio is alright sometimes I guess. The Departed was his last 'believable' performance.  The Dark Knight was great, but Inception was just okay, and Dark Knight Rises sucked. Unless he stops with the big budget action crap and goes back to smaller more personal thrillers I don't really care about Chris Nolan anymore.  I really don't like Marvel films. Or Wes Anderson films. They always both have great casts though I keep seeing them. I guess that's my bad.

Watching this little clip instantly gave me an insane jolt of recollection. I remembered this cartoon so incredibly clearly despite not ever thinking about it in years. I remember watching this as a kid and loving it.   Boogie Nights has always felt like the third in a trilogy along with Goodfellas and Casino.  Both Goodfellas and Casino, and now Wolf of Wall Street, show off what I think Scorsese is best at, showing us a crazy stylized alluring at first, but ultimately corrupt and doomed, fast paced get-rich-quick type scenario, that gradually falls apart as we see more of the horrible things that happen as a consequence, and how money and power corrupt the characters.  Scorsese is great at taking the classic rise and fall, American dream type movie, showing it in a twisted and corrupt light, and cranking everything up to eleven. Boogie Nights is so clearly aiming for the exact same motif, just in the porn world instead of the gangster world. PTA totally understood and reinterpreted and nailed everything Scorsese was going for.  American Hustle felt like it was trying for a similar vibe but just did not hit the mark.  Everything in Boogie Nights, the shots, the scenes, the characters, the cinematography, the pacing, the music, even the way the camera moves, is all dripping with Scorsese's influence. It totally feels like a twisted alternate-porn version of Goodfellas and I love the hell out of it.   A lot of hate for Aussies? How so?   Sorry things didn't work out between you and your sister, bro    What an honor to be murdered by that man. I'm sure your family will understand.   It's not out here in Australia yet    Keitel has been in just as many Scorsese movies as Leo has.  And it's really weird that there's randomnly Cinematographers/editors/whatever for some and not for others. Most of these filmmakers tend to use the same cinematographers and editors for most of their movies, most famously the Coens and Roger Deakins, but instead there's a sound department guy.  But most importantly this is not what muse means.   I choose to believe it was a martial arts induced seizure   Can you tell us anything else interesting? No spoilers of course.   Wow the hypetrain for this movie is insane!  http://www.slashfilm.com/early-buzz-gareth-evans-the-raid-2-sundance-2014/  There are some awesome twitter quotes there.  Also, apparently the movie had the be paused half way through because a dude passed out. Several other viewers took this opportunity to leave because the movie was too "intense" and "violent"     I feel like that whole whymsical non sensical fairy tale-esque world was an intentional reference to Adventure Time. Just a much darker version.   Call me crazy, but I thought that the dude that H Macy talks to on the phone about car registration numbers or whatever was also played by Bruce Campbell.   It's a shame that they don't do anything together anymore. They were clearly great friends in the 80s and 90s and loved working together. Although their careers have certainly gone in very different directions.  Joel was an assistant editor on Evil Dead. Joel and Ethan both wrote Crimewave, which Raimi directed. Sam Raimi had a cameo in Miller's Crossing. Joel and Ethan were credited as  'developers' for Darkman  Bruce Campbell was also in the Hudsucker Proxy, which Raimi co-wrote, had a small cameo in, and was the second unit director on.  Plus Raimi's A Simple Plan feels a lot like a Coen Brothers film.  And Sam Raimi and Joel Coen also both had cameos together in the 1985 Dan Akroyd and Chevy Chase comedy Spies Like Us for some reason.   Nice work man, congratulations!

This scene was so so awesome, and everything that a movie like this should be, I just wish it were longer.   I feel like the whole movie was steadily building up to this big epic finale, and then this scene was over within ten minutes to make room for a much more bland and disappointing final fight under the ocean.  Also I did not realize that part with the office building was done with a miniature. That's insanely cool.  How did this movie not get nominated for best special effects?   Turns out they were all hiding waiting to jump out, but then he pulled out his camera and started whining and saying how shitty everything and everyone was so they just waited for him to leave   One thing that seems to be different is I haven't seen any sort of vehicles or vehicular combat, which a huge part of what made Halo multiplayer so much fun for me   I really hope Jake Johnson isn't in it    This design probably has the slimmest thighs of all the Godzillas.

Where do all these crazy exotic super car show things keep happening?   Whoop, I misread your post and thought it said Asylum, not Origins   I was just wondering how do developers get the rights to use version cars and how complicated is the actual process?  It seems pretty simple, but then you have games that hardly feature any cars vs games with hundreds of cars, then a huge franchise like Forza not being able to use Porsches, then Need for Speed not having Ferraris for like a decade, but now their new game has them. Do developers pay to use a certain brand of car, and then use whatever they want, or do they have to pay by each car?    Long Halloween is an absolute must. Read it right away.   Arkham City is actually a phenomenal Batman story, a super fun game, and a great expansion and compliment to Arkham Asylum, so definitely get right into that as soon as possible. Don't bother with Arkham Origins.  Then just go through the recommended reading on this sub teddies sidebar    Home is run no more    More like Thirst    Me and my friends watch this movie together at least once a year. So much fun.   This whole trailer is definitely a lot 'softer' and less brutal than the red band trailer.   Neil deGrasse Tyson and Kevin Smith are the best ones   Whoa this looks insane and huge!  The first one worked so well because of the simple, no bullshit, real time plot and structure, so I was a little worried that this one would have too many characters and subplots and just end up being silly.   But this looks just as action packed and awesome as the first. One of my most anticipated movies of next year for sure. These guys know how to take what could be a relatively generic and boring martial arts action movie idea and make it insane and fresh and unique.

 Taking someone else's photo and simply blowing it up is about the pinnacle of work-stealing.    But that wasn't what he did.     I take it you're not an artist.    What makes someone an artist?    I'm curious, what makes this art a disgrace and an embarrassment?    Because creating art means being original in some way.    How isn't what Richard Prince doing original? How many others have done this? And why is doing something original a prerequisite for it being art? Is painting a sunset or a bowl of fruit art? As neither is truly an original idea.    All this guy does is rip off actually creative people.    I would say that Prince's transformation of these photos is way more creative and interesting then the originals.    This work would most likely fall under transformative art and thus be protected under fair use.    Slightly altering and blowing up someone else's photo doesn't make you an artist.

Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.     [Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)           [And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)   The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.        Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

[From a study which analyzed available data form the Philippines.](http://i.imgur.com/KXcsl0T.png)    Form their conclusion.      [Using farm-level survey data from the Philippines and quantile regression techniques that control for selection problems, we find that the effect Bt corn on yields is generally more strongly felt by producers at the lower end of the yield distribution. If we subscribe to the typical belief that lower-yielding producers are mostly poor smallholders (i.e., subsistence farmers), then the results from our analysis provides some evidence that Bt corn technology has benefited poor corn farmers in the Philippines through higher relative yield effects as compared to the more commercial producers at the upper end of the yield distribution. It is likely that the proportionately higher yield effect observed for poor smallholders is made possible by the damage abating property being embedded within the Bt technology. This suggests that Bt technology does not require substantial levels of technical skills and learning for it to be an effective insect control technology (i.e., as compared to, say, some Integrated Pest Management control practices that require season-long Farmer Field School training to effectively implement).](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919213001395)         Also the net effect of Bt-cotton has mostly been favorable to farmers in India. . .         The role of genetically modified (GM) crops for food security is the subject of public controversy. GM crops could contribute to food production increases and higher food availability. There may also be impacts on food quality and nutrient composition. Finally, growing GM crops may influence farmers income and thus their economic access to food. Smallholder farmers make up a large proportion of the undernourished people worldwide. Our study focuses on this latter aspect and provides the first ex post analysis of food security impacts of GM crops at the micro level. We use comprehensive panel data collected over several years from farm households in India, where insect-resistant GM cotton has been widely adopted. Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 1520% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.    -[Source](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0064879)     Bt cotton has reduced pesticide applications by 50%, with the largest reductions of 70% occurring in the most toxic types of chemicals. Results of fixed-effects Poisson models confirm that Bt has notably reduced the incidence of acute pesticide poisoning among cotton growers. These effects have become more pronounced with increasing technology adoption rates. Bt cotton now helps to avoid several million cases of pesticide poisoning in India every year, which also entails sizeable health cost savings.    -[Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911002400)       We address this shortcoming by analyzing economic impacts and impact dynamics of Bt cotton in India. Building on unique panel data collected between 2002 and 2008, and controlling for nonrandom selection bias in technology adoption, we show that Bt has caused a 24% increase in cotton yield per acre through reduced pest damage and a 50% gain in cotton pro fi t among smallholders. These bene fi ts are stable; there are even indications that they have increased over time. We further show that Bt cotton adoption has raised consumption expenditures, a common measure of household living standard, by 18% during the 2006  2008 period. We conclude that Bt cotton has created large and sustainable bene fi ts, which contribute to posi- tive economic and social development in India.     -[Source](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/25/1203647109.full.pdf)       Accounting for possible selection bias, we show that the Bt pesticide reducing effect has been sustainable. In spite of an increase in pesticide sprays against secondary pests, total pesticide use has decreased significantly over time. Bt has also reduced pesticide applications by non-Bt farmers. These results mitigate the concern that Bt technology would soon become obsolete in small farmer environments. The survey data on actual pesticide use in farmers fields complement previous entomological research.       -[Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X11001764)       There is a broad literature on the impact of Bt cotton adoption in different countries, but few studies have explicitly looked at environmental and health effects from an economic perspective. We analyse the impact of Bt cotton on environmental efficiency in Pakistan, using farm survey data and a doubly heteroskedastic stochastic production function framework. Negative environmental and health effects of chemical pesticide use are quantified with the environmental impact quotient. Bt-adopting farms have higher cotton yields, while using lower pesticide quantities and causing less environmental damage. Bt farms are both technically and environmentally more efficient than non-Bt farms. Bt adoption increases environmental efficiency by 37%. Achieving the same reduction in negative environmental and health impact without Bt would cost conventional cotton farmers US$ 54 per acre in terms of foregone yields and revenues (7% of total revenues). Extrapolating this shadow price of the technology's health and environmental benefits to the total Bt cotton area in Pakistan results in an aggregate value of US$ 370 million. These benefits are in addition to the profit gains for Bt-adopting farmers. Our results suggest that Bt technology can contribute to sustainable agricultural development.       -[Source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1477-9552.12072/full)         Which is why they don't make them anymore.

Percy Schmeiser was.    Though Schmeiser also wasn't sued over cross pollination.      I'll quote the actual court case.    [In late June or early July of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser and his employee Carlyle Moritz hand sprayed Roundup around power poles and in the ditches along the Bruno road where it bordered fields 1, 2, 3 and 4. This was part of his normal weed control practice. Several days after the spraying, he noticed that a large number of canola plants had survived the spraying. To determine why the canola plants had survived the Roundup spraying, Mr. Schmeiser conducted a test in field 2. Using a machine sprayer set to spray 40 feet, he sprayed Roundup on a section of field 2 in a strip along the road. He made two passes, the first weaving between and around the power poles and the second adjacent to the first pass, parallel to the power poles. He testified that by this means he sprayed a good three acres of field 2. According to Mr. Schmeiser's evidence, after some days, approximately 60% of the canola plants sprayed were still alive, growing in clumps that were thickest near the road and thinner as one moved into the field.[23]At harvest time in 1997 Mr. Schmeiser, who was then recovering from a leg injury, instructed Mr. Moritz to swath and combine field 2. Mr. Moritz did so, harvesting the canola in the field as well as the surviving canola along the roadside. The harvested seed was put into the box of a 1962 Ford pickup truck. The box was covered with a tarp and the truck with its tarped load of canola seed was stored in one of Mr. Schmeiser's buildings over the winter.[24]Mr. Schmeiser testified that in the spring of 1998 the seed from the Ford truck was transferred to another truck and taken to the Humboldt Flour Mill for treatment, a normal process to rid the seeds of disease before planting. The treated seed, mixed with untreated seed from his granary ("bin-run seed"), was planted in all or part of each of his nine fields, for a total of 1,030 acres.](http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2002/2002fca309/2002fca309.html)         His crop did not magically become 95-98% RR canola purity overnight and the court realized this. Schmeiser was not sued over accidental cross pollination, but over intentionally isolating RR canola plants and planting the seed the following year.           Tell that to my '98 Outback.

It details his faults, from failing to file his expense reports to a lack of teamwork. The highlights, below:  Does not work well with others: "Abu Abbas is not willing to follow anyone," AQIM wrote, referring to Belmoktar by his nom de guerre, Khaled Abu Abbas. "He is only willing to be followed and obeyed."  Failed to meet fund-raising targets: Belmoktar's men held Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler and his colleague hostage for four months in 2008. Fowler wrote a book about it. AQIM "referred the case to al-Qaeda central to force concessions in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan," but Belmoktar made his own deal, releasing both hostages for 700,000 euros, well below the going $3 million rate.  Poor allocation of resources: AQIM's Osama bin Ladenapproved business model was to kidnap tourists and aid workers, hold them for ransom, then use the money to buy arms and carry out attacks. But Belmoktar didn't manage his resources to their satisfaction, per the letter: "(The chapter) gave Abu Abbas a considerable amount of money to buy military material, despite its own great need for money at the time. ... Abu Abbas didn't participate in stepping up to buy weapons," it says. "So whose performance deserves to be called poor in this case, I wonder?"  Insubordination: "He ignored a meeting in Timbuktu, calling it 'useless.' He even ordered his men to refuse to meet with al-Qaida emissaries. And he aired the organization's dirty laundry in online jihadist forums, even while refusing to communicate with the chapter via the Internet, claiming it was insecure."  Failure to achieve performance goals: "Any observer of the armed actions (carried out) in the Sahara will clearly notice the failure of The Masked Brigade to carry out spectacular operations, despite the region's vast possibilities  there are plenty of mujahedeen, funding is available, weapons are widespread and strategic targets are within reach," AP quotes from the letter. "Your brigade did not achieve a single spectacular operation targeting the crusader alliance."            al-qaeda is a multinational operation, they need a fair amount of middle management to operate the logistic and HR.                      you need to wait till Bowser become CEO and launch a hostile take over bid.                they pay the iron price         If the gang want a war with the police they will be all dead  Have you seen those military firepower police now have?            what US police forces?

 I have been a prof in both the US and Canada, and as you know, academics are mobile, and so we are always doing this comparison.  Research in both countries is similar in many ways - funding is tight, but I have found in Alberta that having a local funding agency that offers full graduate student scholarships to be extremely valuable.  If I am lucky enough to have several graduate students with salaries on the order of $35k/year (tax free, for 4 years), then that is direct research support that pushes research forward.  In Canada, it's all about industry matching, so if you can find a good company to work with, you can have sufficient funds to work on that program, and have enough flexible money to work on fundamental projects (which helps support the industry collaboration).  It's hard to find the right company, and I liken it to dating, but if you find a good situation, you can make it work.    I agree that it is not easy, and I wish that I had a shining future to describe.  Some of my best graduates have stayed in Canada, but others went to US companies, and to start labs in China. That said, there is a realization that pushing fossil fuels, climate-be-damned, is not a viable business approach in the long run, and thus even big oil companies are launching renewable energy divisions that actually seem serious (as many are in the US, Europe). I have my fingers crossed that things are changing - certainly the political landscape is changing, which bodes well.     Hi - Kyoung-Shin is a friend of mine, and when I become the editor-in-chief of Chemistry of the Materials, the first new person I recruited to join as an editor was her.  Could I suggest emailing her?  You can tell her that I suggested you do so. She is ultra-busy, but is incredibly thoughtful and thorough.    And I do believe that PECs have huge potential.     Interesting - I have listened to a lot of talks about thorium, and how the cycles are much cleaner with respect to recycling the by-products and waste.    I am not a huge fan of traditional fission nuclear because of the staggering costs to build a 1 GW plant, not to mention the spent fuel storage problems, and the fact that we would have to start the building of a new nuclear power every 1.5 days until 2050 to generate 7 TW of electricity (humanity currently burns about 15 TW, and that number will at least double by 2050) - these numbers come from Dan Nocera's publications if you want to look them up.  So, if thorium is cheaper with respect to infrastructure and operation, and avoids nasty radioactive waste that requires long-term storage, then I would like to know more.      	4

This bothered me, but what also shocked me was the gullibility of those in the class. They ate up that shit. Claiming they could see their energy balls or discussing how AIDS just couldn't be real. It was disturbing. I can see how some people might change in ways that might not seem normal after such a class. It's indoctrination in a sense.

Thank you Therealkinghomer! You've made my experience with Tapped Out even MORE enjoyable than ever :) Also, Happy Whacking Day!!!   I saw a documentary a long time ago about her and the catacombs. Apparently the man who embalmed her wouldn't give up his secret how he performed it. Her body is amazingly preserved. She DOES look as tho she is only sleeping.   I saw that first and thought that was it, turns out it was just Hepatitis.    got a link? that IS more interesting. coughfrackingcough   Thank you! I can't wait to find out how it all goes! I hope they let her finish.   They could. Sounds like a stargate sort of idea. Who knows what they could have tagging along for their ride!     ...tick, tick, tick... =)   Always wondered if they had something to do with other types of reported phenomena...   I'd actually like to hear your story. Pm me if you like. I saw something(s) that defy logic. And I've always known they exist and are very much aware of us and that they actively visit earth. =)    I don't know what got me into ufo's exactly. For me the best way to put it is I've always just had a internal personal knowledge that the Universe is teeming with life. I've always struggled to understand how it is that others simply do not feel the same way. I remember just learning to read and checking out all the ufo themed books in my school and library. I started listening to C2C with Art Bell while in 6th or 7th grade. Just anything I could get my hands on about the subject I actively seeked out.   I have had sightings both personal and with others. I am not afraid of it and I don't see any reason to be. They exist. It isn't a belief, it's just something I've always known. I do not believe I have ever been abducted, so I couldn't make a comment about that.  As for what I feel about ufo's now? I feel that the whole phenomena is seriously being misrepresented and mishandled. The cheap shows about ufos on tv as of late is laughable. Who in their right mind  eats this stuff up? I can't stand a new show that claims to be all new present rehashed stories. It is a slap in the face to those paying attention.  I am sick of faked videos of ufos making it onto the screen as if they are real. Ugh. I'm not going to even get into ancient aliens. Not worth my typing. But I will say I had always hoped for the populace to get their heads out of their assets and recognize the vastness of everything that is around them. The space in which you and I live is great and we can't see it all. But! If we are here, then it only stands to reason that something else may be waaayyyy over there. And that something else could be anything, even a planet. And, if that planet is lucky enough to have had the right chain of events to spark life, as we were so lucky to have on earth, then maybe, just maybe, there's someone over there, too.   Ahhh ufology, you have so much restructuring and building to do before I can take you seriously again. Til then, the truth actually IS out there.    I don't have a question...just wanted to formally tell you that I've always thought of you as sexy. That is all.   Maybe one day they will come close enough so you can actually see them. The orbs are definitely different from ball lightning(as so many have suggested they are).    It's some kind of liquified light washing around in kind of a washing machine-like motion. The most intense part of it is in its center.   Curious, isn't it?   Bics are just great lighters. They're not too expensive, costing only a bit more than other lighters of lesser caliber. They are in American lore, reliable, just a really nice lighter. Maybe you should buy a small pack off the internet? Or maybe someone stateside could send you one.  Best of luck. Enjoy your smoke :)   Indeed. Noticed it in some red ones, and blue ones...   I know this will be very unpopular, but...  Time Warner Cable is my provider and my boyfriend had been paying the bill with his phone monthly. For some reason, they stopped processing the payments thru his phone to a non-existing account. We kept a record of the confirmation numbers given at the end of those payments. We didn't know they weren't going thru because when he'd call they would say we owed the same amount as the month before. It wasn't until I received a phone call stating I owed well over $350 to TWC that we realized something was wrong. I spoke to 3 different departments before they got me to the right one, but when they did they took down all the information, including the Verification Codes we had. Today I received my bill and owe only $35! They reinstated not only all the money but they took off a portion of this month's bill. I'm not saying "I 3 TWC!", no. But I do appreciate they did look into the issue and found the missing money and really helped me and my boyfriend in the pocketbook.   I have no comment on AT T.      Sort of. I heard about these booms that are heard off of Myrtle Beach, and they are said to happen when these balls of light appear over the ocean.  I looked but I can't seem to find the video :/ Did find this tho. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlSC.html   Kinda does. Ugly little fucker.   Me too :)      I would post it over there but someone beat me to the punch. It's alright, I'm not gonna hate, the dialogue needs to begin with insightful pieces on Mormon History. :)   I actually never got the Caravan Deck in my most recent Fallout NV game. I wonder what went wrong?   I enjoyed the calm way in which they explained the differences between Joseph Smith's translation vs. what it really says. They were in no way ugly, instead they just brought in fact after fact. It's pretty intense. I was considering posting it over on r/mormon to see what they think.  I want to see if they can watch it and stay rational enough to have a good back and forth dialogue about it.      It would absolutely add credence to such an extraordinary claim.   I think it might be legit. Also, I'd like more experiments to be performed. They really seemed to be onto something here. The sealed film part was very intriguing to me, too. Insanely hard to fake, they'd have to have someone at Kodak in on it. Yeah, I think, given what we know right now, I think it's real.   http://phenomenallife.blogspot.com/2012/08/the-scole-experiments-fact-or-faked.html         Way back when he was only on AM, I'd hear this music come in thru the static and I knew instantly who was on. Ahh, nostalgia :)   Meh, his sexual preference has nothing to do with the quality of his programming.   I know!! I'm so freaking excited :D   Yes, Art, yes we do. We've been waiting patiently, catching you on Ham and ssb, hoping for a return. I have been a C2C listener since the mid 90's and definitely miss Art's distinctive voice. So, welcome back. I can't wait to see what topics and guests you bring in.   It definitely is a fantastic show! I'm also very excited for Art Bell's new Sirius show! It's an exciting time for the listener!!    I stopped believing. But stuff continues to happen. Weird, scary, and strange. I wish I had had your luck. Oh well,...   Right. But simply stating that they saw a light in the sky is not lying. For instance, two weekends ago my boyfriend spotted a red light race across the skyline, north to south, over the ocean at Myrtle Beach. I also saw it as did his sister and a mutual friend. When people ask us what we think it was, we say we don't know. I think using the term UFO is alright, however we do not mean to say Extraterrestrial, we simply mean its literal term. Lots of sightings have been reported recently over that area, if I were to speculate I'd say military. But I don't really know. I wish more people would be honest and say they don't know instead of making up a fantastical story. In any case, that light, man, it sped across the sky so fast. Incredible.   Guess that goes to show people who report unknowns may have seen something, they just dunno what it is. I wish people would keep that in mind before they scoff and say that people are delusional or lying.   I never said we were at big bro status yet, just that it seems we are on the way. I hope we do not allow that to occur.    I know my idea is not very feasible, but I just can't fathom THAT MANY people misidentified flares. Maybe the real footage was suppressed or maybe THAT MANY people really don't know flares from a giant V shaped low flying object. To be totally honest something about that whole event never sat well with me.   No   Baby tigers are soooooo cute and non threatening, they can't really hurt you, not enough power. But as you feed, nurture, and allow them to grow up into adults they are very threatening indeed. Watch out for those claws!   The 1940s Battle of L.A. used powerful searchlights on it, they also shot at it. Look it up! There are pictures! And newspaper reports! Definitely worth checking out.   This. I bet there is footage but I bet it got confiscated.   We will get there, baby steps.   Thank you for that. It's going to be tough, but I'm working on it. :) It is good to know I'm not the only one going thru this.   I can do that, but the initial way I feel (even if I know the situation is not bad), I still have that pang. It is very hard to not feel that emotion of "oh this is bad" even tho I know it is no big deal. Like the first time I wore a tank top, I felt bad even tho mentally it is not.   Thank you. I do think it will take a long time, some days are definitely harder than others with this.   I have been out of the church for a long time, but, sometimes I still fall back into my old way of thinking. I get offended by things I have been taught to be offended by. I am so frustrated as I am acutely aware I shouldn't be offended. It is difficult and I don't know how to stop it. I mean its been almost 10yrs since I've been to church actively. Anyone else deal with that? Also I was seriously sheltered, so being an adult and being around other adults, it is a marked difference. My boyfriend doesn't want to shelter his son, but sheltering is all I know and a knee jerk reaction, and really quite natural for me. I know sheltering hurt me in certain ways so I don't want to do it, but I don't know then what is normal? This is all so foreign for me...   I'm not okay with Monsanto or their practices towards farmers and farming. I distrust their "scientific" testing of their food as they say its safe, but independent studies show vastly differing results.    Speculation is fine so as long as attempts are made to understand. Also, people tend to believe speculation, but it's simply uninformed hypothesis. Who knows what's in that photo, honestly. Could be space junk, reflection of internal components, or something unknown to us. Too bad we are unable to simply jettison out there for a peak.   It does!   Da fuq?   Can mods remove this obvious trickery and not ufo-related post??   Starving, growing, learning children are not worth 40. This is what I learned today. When I was in school if you didn't have money for lunch they made a mark by your name and sent a bill to your folks. Bam. Problem fucking solved.   Yessss!!!   Omg that would so kick ass   Even if it was, I think those locations would be so cool   Indeed. I know it wouldn't be canon, tho. But it'd be wicked!   I always thought Chicago or Orlando. Chicago because of the great lakes and skyscrapers. Orlando because bombed out theme Parks and mutant alligators would be incredible to experience. : )  	98
 Hopefully your friend doesn't work in a hospital.             I think he's the Tigers pet and they put him in a giant ball to play around.

    I am average height (5'6 female). My arms are super long and skinny, I've never been able to do correct push-ups or pull ups. To make it worse, I have incredibly tiny hands. An eight year olds hands can span mine almost perfectly. That itself doesn't bother me, but my nails grow square like a kids too, which makes my hands look ridiculous when the nails are painted :(   Best friend of three years continually used me to make herself feel prettier, smarter, and richer (we were in high school, love those awkward times). She ended up dating my ex just to get at me, and started picking fights with me because I ended up with a wonderful relationship and she couldn't keep a boyfriend. Last words that came out of her mouth to me were "wow, you actually look pretty today!"   	3
 It's a new defense called *The Firing Squad* defense.   If you have 13 people shooting at someone - make sure the other 12 get off on lesser charges (or no charges) and throw the book at the 13th (to calm the mob).   Then when the 13th person goes to trial the prosecutor can shrug and say 'We don't know beyond reasonable doubt if *this* guys bullet is the one that killed the victim".  So make sure if you ever go to commit murder to bring at least 12 friends along. Apparently in America it's a "Get out of Jail Free' card now, seeing as it is enshrined in precedence.    I stated:   If you think that running from the police should automatically mean a public execution, on the spot, maybe you are in the wrong country.  The Bill of Rights, state laws and the oaths that police officers take do not hinge on personal opinion.

Of growing concern to physicians and psychologists is the mounting evidence that anabolic /androgenic steroids cause severe and sometimes permanent mental disorders. The addictive nature of steroids often leads users to administer progressively higher doses and more exotic combinations of the drugs to maintain and increase the initial muscle building effects.  ***Abundant clinical and anecdotal evidence suggests that steroids often lead to unusually aggressive and irrational behavior.***  And using steroids isn't a problem for a guy who straps on a gun every day and goes out to deal with the public?  Just using a little common sense here.  http://www.afpafitness.com/research-articles/anabolic-steroids-and-the-depression-connection   Wondering where all this water is coming from?   Short vid from a 2012 Rutgers study: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU      The Jet Stream has shifted - finally. Have you seen this?   https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU  It is the very best explanation of 'weather weirding' that we have seen lately.  I first found her study when i noticed the Jet Stream doing very anomalous things in 2013.      I think that is why this web group is collating officer involved civilian deaths by collecting media stories. Right now that is the only way to get a real number.    When the car backfired, the plainclothes reported that it was a gunshot. That brought in the Rambos.   The really sickening thing about this case is this. I have relatives in medicine- one is a coroner. He has autopsied 2 'hero' police officers killed in the line of duty. Both of them had cocaine in their systems. One exhibited long term steroid use.   You forgot a 0.  By the narrowest measure possible  in which we give police every benefit of the cause of death doubt in incidents where they Tasered or restrained suspects  85 percent of the sampled incidents were the sort of police killings the government might be expected to keep track of. If we include other arrest-related deaths (and theyre included in Bureau of Justice figures), then 93 percent of incidents qualified as police killings.  Applying these percentages to the total count at Killed By Police would imply that officers acting in the line of duty have killed in the neighborhood of 1,250 to 1,350 people since May 1, 2013. Thats about 1,000 deaths per year.  http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/   113?   Applying these percentages to the total count at Killed By Police would imply that officers acting in the line of duty have killed in the neighborhood of 1,250 to 1,350 people since May 1, 2013. Thats about 1,000 deaths per year.  http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/another-much-higher-count-of-police-homicides/    It is *exactly* like saying "it's ok". It sets court precedent that automatically justifies future shootings, chokings, beatings, etc by the police.    One thing that everyone seems to overlook here. Every single one of these cases in which a cop is found not guilty of killing a civilian stacks the deck on precedence in a court of law.   If this keeps up, police will be able to show justification in any court of law for killing anyone for any reason- due to precedence of prior case law.   And it won't matter what color you are.   I have one issue with the mannequin element.

That's what started them running.   If some stranger in street clothes tried to get you to pull over, would you?    Officer at 10:47 p.m. radioed: Passenger just put his hands out asking us to stop.

This is why old people look like hell. All the hugs.   Obviously the point of the matter isn't the deed, but the *justice* or *injustice* of the deed combined with viewers personal immersion with the character.  You are trying to shift the point of the matter to fit some pre-defined political stance.  People *did* go out of their minds at the Red Wedding - because of perceived injustice toward innocent people.   People *didn't* go out of their minds with the golden crown scene, because the brother was a violent, stupid dick who sold his little sister to barbarians.  People *did* go out of their minds when Ned was beheaded, because it was unjust.   People *didn't* go out of their minds when Ramsey (justly, give or take) tortured Theon, because Theon killed or had killed hundreds of innocent people who were nearly family, including 2 little boys.  Sansa? It wouldn't matter if she were raped or had her hand cut off or was flayed or poked in the eye with a pin.   It wasn't the *details* of the act that mattered. It was the *unjust* violence against this wholly innocent girl who has been with viewers since the beginning- and who has already been through total hell.   Capiche?   Of course we didn't. Point being that nature has managed to generate an exquisitely balanced series of symbiotic relationships within biological and geographical systems that functioned pretty damn well before humans came along. And will continue to do so long after we are gone- if we don't succeed in utterly wiping it out.  To imagine that nature 'needs' us to keep things straightened out is the height of arrogance.   Santa Barbara did a study on coyotes killed because they had become urbanized  - autopsies to check their dietary habits. Out of 200 coyotes they found that 80% of their diet was rodents. Rats, wild rabbits, mice and shrews. The rest was mainly garbage. No cats. No dogs.    Coyotes only expanded to most of the United States relatively recently, and as a result of us killing off wolves.   You just made my point. You kill off an apex predator- another will come along and fill its place. "Nature balancing itself out." And the prey animals, rodents to deer, will overpopulate until that occurs.     Ok I'll make this clearer.  Bob kills 100 people, including 2 little kids. He gets the death penalty.   Everyone shrugs.  An innocent, 15 year old girl does nothing wrong. She gets the death penalty.  Everyone raises hell.  Obviously the point of the matter isn't the *death penalty*, but the *injustice*.

She lost her entire family in horrible ways and has been used as a pawn for 3 years.  The man Ramsey mutilated and tortured killed most of the people of Winterfell, men, women and children that he grew up with, including his teacher and weapons master - then had two innocent children killed and bodies burned to hang on the wall - in front of people who loved them (they didn't know they were farmers boys)  So of course peoples sympathies are with Sansa.

One year the good ole boys had a 3 day coyote hunt. For 3 years afterwards they lost tons of hay to Jackrabbits.  Coyotes are native to every state in the US. Best to leave shit the hell alone. It will balance itself out. That's what nature does.    I saw what someone else posted to the wow forum and it was right on. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17346427864   I would flawlessly recreate the Vanilla servers. The only elements of new content I would add is reforging and transmogging. Besides these, this game would follow the original game, right through WotLK. No LFR or LFD. No player/server phasing. Recreating the sense of community is a goal here.    Other content that was hinted at, but not followed through with, would be added; like the Emerald Dream. This would extend the time frame of events and add new content within the old framework.     It would be available to all players for a one time fee of $10, same for returning players. And I can guarantee there will be returning players, millions of them. So many would come just to see the Emerald Dream fulfilled.    Upon log-in players would have the normal choices of servers and characters- but with an added choice upon making a new character- in Vanilla. This would be the fork in the road that players who paid the $10 fee could choose.    This would not eliminate the new game, it would still be available for ez mode players.   This would make me so goddam happy.   I saw this yesterday and posted it to reddit.  I would immediately drop $10 make a new toon on this and never look back.  http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17346427864   Blackrock chain running- actually sparked my fear of heights. I would hold my breath all the way.  I just realized how badly lfr/lfg impacts immersion.    These weren't created when we started. It was full on guild run to the dungeon. Damn those were fun times- killing shit along the way.   I noticed [this chart of subscriber stats](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/) just yesterday and noticed that the downward turn started in '10. Right about the time lfr/lfg started. I wondered about a connection, seeing as lfr lfg had such a huge impact on player experience.   I loved ST. Hate what they did to it.    Traveling to get to the dungeon was the first half of the adventure.    But they were pretty much color coded shortly after release.   Is there such a thing as power leveling any more? You can sleepwalk through it and it happens so fast you barely see half of the world.   Is this even legal?  Not in Europe.   Followed by "What Musak would be playing in the Elevator to Hell?"   Funny story about LBJ.  A very good friend of my mothers was the (young, pretty) widow of a gentlemen who had been in French politics. She and her dead husbands brother were invited to a dinner party at a major hotel after a diplomatic meeting in France and LBJ and his retinue was there. Things got drunkenly boisterous and flirtatious as the evening went on and she eventually retired to her suite.  An hour later she answered a knock at her door and there stood LBJ, in a silk bathrobe with a bottle of champagne, a bouquet of flowers and a huge cigar- with two secret service men flanking him.  He said "Madame, your President has come to pay you a call."  And she let him in.  When he left in the wee hours the secret service men were still standing there outside of the room.  She said he "was not pretty, but he was very persuasive".   Early 40's through late 70's. They raised 4 children. They bought one home and then they had a large home built in the mid '50s on 10 acres. They took two week (or longer) vacations every year. They could have been the poster children for "The American Dream"  It had a strong union. I remember my grandfather going out the door to a strike with a lead-filled baseball bat. And he was white collar system designer.  My grandfather had briefly played for the Pittsburgh Steelers (back injury) and my grandmother was a Rosie the Riveter who got her degree between having babies.  They retired before NAFTA - after which the plant moved manufacturing overseas.   "**The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them..**  Making threats of physical violence against another redditor and/or redditors family and friends is pretty fucked up.   In some situations, speech can even constitute a crime, such as in the case of criminal threats. [A criminal threat,](http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/crime-penalties/federal/criminal-threats.htm) sometimes known as the terrorist threat, malicious harassment, or by other terms, occurs when someone threatens to kill or physically harm someone else.     Sure people need electricians, etc. But who is going to design the systems in the first place?   The only reason we won WW2 was because of our massive and innovative manufacturing base. We needed a large number of educated people to design, innovate and create for those manufacturers.   Now we cannot even make umbrellas.   WW3 is not going to be won by ranks of baristas and we cannot maintain superpower status with herds of burger flippers.  The US produced large quantities of military equipment into late 1945, including nuclear weapons, and became one of the strongest, most technically advanced military forces in the world. In addition to out-producing the Axis, the Allies produced technological innovations including radar (instrumental in winning the Battle of Britain), sonar (improving their ability to sink U-boats), the atomic bomb (eliminated the need to invade Japan) and the proximity fuze. Five times as effective as contact or timed fuzes, the latter was devastating in naval use against Japanese aircraft and so effective against German ground troops that General George S. Patton said it "won the Battle of the Bulge for us."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II   My grandparents worked for a major appliance manufacturer here in the states. They both had degrees and would not have had their positions without them.   It's not that we have too many people with college degrees, we no longer have an innovative, massive manufacturing base to support them. This is what needs to change.   I know someone who works for them- this melt is exactly what they have been waiting and planning for so they can move in to drill.  Thing is, it's happening 4-6 years earlier than they had expected. Some of the people, upper mid-level, have a lot of concern. The guys at the top do not give a shit.   How about the best Pranks Blizzard ever played?   Corrupted Blood Plague (actually a glitch- but funnier than hell, regardless). https://youtu.be/RxDvxKeLWlA  We would actually go fight Hakkar just to port hunters back to main cities to spread this.   DK Plague: https://youtu.be/7DUzJklzJ0Y?t=13s  And the Zombie Plague (actually part of the scourge invasion): https://youtu.be/zdT3Tert6DQ   Under a 14 yr old boys bed.   One of the main ones was kiting dragons and mini bosses to main cities.   Blizzard ended up tethering them. But the fun and excitement of doing it- or other people doing it and the spontaneous mini raids that would form to kill it were part of the excitement of 'whats going to happen today?' when you logged on.   The last one I was able to kite was Shan Bu to the Emperors Step. Someone forgot to tether him or they thought it couldn't be done. He stayed there through the weekend until re-set.   Album: http://imgur.com/a/4vqEV  The other prank, also removed, was snowballs.   [This was hysterically funny.](http://i.imgur.com/eA2QeC0.jpg)  When they first made snowballs in the game the victim would flip over onto it's back. Everyone loved them.   Also, as I discovered when my friends and I went to have a snowball fight on the SW/IF Tram, snowballs travelled at exactly the same speed as the tram. So the result was that once they got off the tram they would be hit by every snowball thrown at them during the ride.   BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM - the target would be doing flips in the air, totally stun-locked.  So we would lurk around the station, wait till some poor, unsuspecting player got on, get on the last tram car and start pelting snowballs at them. I'm laughing right now thinking about it. They would fly through the air- same speed as the tram - and all catch up once the victim got off the tram.  Also we discovered that if you threw a snowball at a target at the *moment* they mounted a taxi bird, the snowballs would hit them as soon as they landed - anywhere. Took exquisite timing. Best was when you and a friend were going to taxi somewhere- let them mount while you pelt them. The cursing in pm when they landed .. freaking hilarious.   And blizzard stopped it.. such a bummer.   Holy shit you don't know what you are talking about.  'talking about'? I am looking at a graph that is basically in a constant state of plummet, besides a few bumps, since end of WotLK.   Interesting, LFR and LFD were rolled out between 2009 (lfd) and 2011 (lfr) - about the time that blizz had 11-12 million subscribers.   By Q2, 2012 they had dropped to 9 million subscribers. So that's pretty damn interesting. The only times it has come up above that number is briefly during expac releases before going down again.  Hell, maybe it did kill the game.    So basically it is losing a million subscribers a month. Unless they do something drastically imaginative, the game is dead by fall.    the biggest rise of subscribers ever?  Do you have a link for this? I don't know of any 'rise'.  If it were different, you would not have stated this:  normal servers are already struggling.  I know of a lot of players who came back, hopeful, then left again.  Here's the numbers: https://youtu.be/8dOsT8x6iy8    From your post of 6 days ago:  Yeah, but Lich King dropped a weapon for every spec and class. Therefore, all players had access to slightly higher item level weapons and no specific classes were left out. Same with Spine/Madness in Dragon Soul - between the two bosses, all classes had access to a weapon/trinket of the same ilevel to their peers.   Normal servers are struggling to maintain a player base after losing millions of players due to WoD. This could refresh that player base.   If you didn't like Vanilla, that's fine. You don't need to play it. A lot of people did and still do love it. I know a lot of old school players- all but two of us are on WotLK servers. As one of them put it "If Blizzard won't do it, someone will (and has)."  ps How did you get from Vanilla to WoD unless you played it through? If so- it obviously wasn't 'bad'. If you never played it- how would you know?   Thank god people blinded by nostalgia can't decide what Blizzard does or doesnt do.  If you enjoy WoD, how would this impact your game?   I think the post is brilliant. It takes nothing away from the current game, while giving a lot of people what they want. You have a personal problem with that?  I have watched players unsub for months now and know more old player friends who are now on WotLK rogue servers than in the official game.       I like how you put that; 'chupacabra'.   It was while studying the Jarrell that I first discovered Gravity Waves in relation to amping up storms. I have a fascination with resonant waves and effects so it is very interesting.  I had heard of Jarrell, but had not really studied it until during the 2011 outbreak one of the tornados took a 'backward' track and I went into research mode. I cannot recall which tornado that was now.   Thank you for your info. I did not know the other tornados you mentioned were also linked to gravity waves.   Except for the Republican crabs, who all sit around and chant 'DOWN WITH SOCIALISM!' as they slowly strangulate.   Unbelievable that we have gotten to the point of nearly killing off our prime pollinator. Sometimes I feel like I have stepped into a different dimension. A bad one.    In Ohio my mother was married to a top end blacksmith. He did ortho horse shoeing with a veterinarian. He had an aussie named Sassy and Sassy would sit on a stool in front of the horses, literally calming them to the point that they looked hypnotized.    This was good because he would have to work on them for longer than standard shoeing would take.   Very smart dogs.   ..potential to be really, really bad had there been any sort of population center in the way.  Like Philadelphia, MS.  I am very sorry to hear about your illness. I hope you get through it quickly and come out the other side better than ever. When you are feeling up to finishing your posts, I'll be here if you want to chat. Meanwhile, lovely to meet you and welcome to StormComing :) Message me any time.   Thank you for this information. I will look into this event, it seems extraordinary.   I have had a serious love/hate relationship with tornados since 1974. I was 14 and lived just outside of Xenia.   I had just asked on /r/stormchaser if you were *the* stormstalker of the blog. I am so glad you are. I am a big fan of your blog. It's extremely well written. If you ever have any questions about Xenia,  I'm available. I remember it very well and possibly remember a few things that haven't been written about. Like the 're-planted tree' in a neighbors field.    Are you StormStalker from https://stormstalker.wordpress.com?   Possibly more like the Mussolini style of Fascism. Where certain corporations ruled the government- and quietly kept competitors subdued.   Pleases me and my druid, greatly :)   What is it called when corporations have to get permission from the government to sell something? Let's see.. it's not capitalist.. must be a word for it.  Whatever it is- that's what we are now.    Someone call Spielberg immediately.    He is [watching this](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/676/205/57b.gif).   And reddit's the perfect location for this story.   Besides, Japan hates those fascist bastards.   schooling skooliNG/ noun education or training received, especially at school. "his parents paid for his schooling" synonyms: education, teaching, tuition, instruction, tutoring, tutelage;   In the late 18th century, Thomas Paine was amongst the earliest proponents of universal, free public education, which was considered to be a radical idea at the time.  Apparently, for some who want us to go back to those days of uneducated masses and slavery, it's still a radical idea.    Of course you know that a tornado can double back when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core. In this case I believe it had to do with the massive gravity wave to the south east -that generated a strong pocket of localized shear as well.   If I seem wrong on any of this, please correct me. I am always learning.   That's another option- trees or bushes ripped out of the ground, leaving holes. Pretty brilliant actually.    Report to whom? The priest was a priest for a corrupt police dept.    Yes, I suppose we don't need all of this silly edumacation, seeing as it has done nothing for U.S. advancement in the world. Yep. Education, business development, scientific research leading to technology breakthroughs, maintaining a lead on other countries, etc. is all just something we should be cutting costs on.    Did you ever go up into Jarrell?   Have you seen the video of the Philadelphia MS ground scouring?   https://youtu.be/AcIqU6w-_04   This was thought to be created by sub vortices within the main.   I will revisit a map and images to see the orientation.    They deserve the "college experience" right?  Actually our country deserves to have the brightest kids with the best education moving out into business creation and the workforce. Our former high levels of affordable education is what grew this country in the first place. As it fails- so does the country.     Yes, apparently it was at 2mph when it hit Double Creek. I was thinking that possibly those divots were from surface removal - apparently they also had to remove top layers for recovery purposes in some areas. The clearly circular patterns, though, seem odd for this.  Also, the [gravity wave effect study](http://homepages.vvm.com/%7Ecurtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm) is fascinating in regards to 'backward motion' and the low shear, high CAPE of that day. I had just posted a story on /r/StormComing on this http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/36azjw/the_incredible_jarrell_tx_tornado_probably_one_of/      That's a possibility. I am going to scan more aerial tornado damage images to see if I can find anything similar.     no one (read: employers) in America will recognize your school.  And why would anyone want to go back to work in America?  Germany: The law requires a minimum of 20 paid days of vacation annually, but some companies give much more than that, sometimes as much as 30 paid days.  Paid sick leave is six weeks, during which you will continue to receive your full salary. After that time, health insurance pays 70% of your last salary until you either return to work or have to retire because of your health.  Mothers are allowed six weeks leave at full pay prior to the childs birth and eight weeks at full pay afterward. The mother or father is then allowed up to three years of unpaid leave to stay at home with the child.    We adopted 2 young sister cats - both preggers. They gave birth within 6 hours of each other. We had set up a long clothes closet for them to do this and have privacy- one cat at each end. Within a day one of the cats had moved to the other end with the sister and sisters kittens. 11 total. Thereafter it was just one big nursing cat/kitten pile. I don't even think they knew whose was whose after a while.   Thanks. I was thinking the same- about the spacing and regularity. They just look very odd.   I know 4 'top tier' Americans currently studying abroad, and one more getting ready to go to Germany.. Americans studying abroad has become, once more, the thing. Mostly because of the high cost of native universities.  And once there - a lot of them decide they want to stay. One of my friends ended up with the Berlin Orchestra and married. Another is currently at Oxford, teaching.  Do you happen to have statistics of what you claimed? Europeans coming to American Universities in droves? And students from third world countries do not count. They are escaping a bad situation as much as anything.   I have noticed in several ground 'after' pictures of the Jarrell TX May 27 - 1997 there are these odd round circles on the ground. I am familiar with cycloidal arcing, drag marks, etc. but don't recall seeing these before in tornado damage images until Jarrell.   https://extremeplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/jt-dc-1.png  Is it possible, since Jarrell was a multi-vortex, that these are touchdown 'suction' marks from small vortices within the larger body? They seem very tightly clustered. I just can't figure out what else they could be.   Ok if american tax payers are so fucking tight fisted- the smart kids will go to other countries and they will benefit.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/29/7-countries-where-americans-can-study-at-universities-in-english-for-free-or-almost-free/   Better than watching them go to other countries that will educate them for free.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/29/7-countries-where-americans-can-study-at-universities-in-english-for-free-or-almost-free/   The class capable of chipping in is a ten ton elephant at this point - and since it is the 'job creating' class it will benefit the most.    You know what? Fuck Chase Bank   Wells Fargo, fuck the brain drain they have created, fuck high college tuition rates.   "...the German government fully funds the education of its citizens -- and even of foreigners."  "..Finland charges no tuition fees, and it offers a large number of university programs in English.  "French University programs charge only a small tuition fee of about 200 dollars for most programs (covers everything but off campus living situations).  "Norwegian universities do not charge tuition fees for international students.   So fuck the banks and any kind of possible excuse you can come up with for them.    College finance loans were originally designed to be non-crippling- at 1-2% interest when I was in college.    Thank god maybe we can start catching up with the rest of the civilized world.   The Jarrell Tornado has also been called the Dead Man Walking tornado from [this image.](http://lssn.us/image/JARREL~1.png)  By the time it passed through Jarrell, Tx. it had cleanly removed yards of asphalt from the road. Fragments of human victims were mixed with bits of formerly living livestock. Human chains of recovery personnel slowly moved across the landscape, combing through mud and debris for every trace of remains that could be retrieved for identification and burial.  The Jarrell tornado had another unique identifier, [it actually reversed course at one time- moving 'backward'.](http://homepages.vvm.com/~curtis/Jarrell/Jarrell.htm)   In my years of experience in studying storms the Jarrell tornado is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, of tornados spawned in the United States.  Video clips: https://youtu.be/EQxhpcMc33I  StormStalker coverage site- an amazingly comprehensive site with images you won't find anywhere else in one place, including search and damage images as well as radar, atmospheric and synoptic information on this incredible tornado.   https://stormstalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/jarrell/#more-249      That's a very crafty bird right there.   Don't get too relieved. We had laying hens and I had a few that I raised from the egg. When I would come out and sit on the porch they would come running up and compete for lap room, just like small dogs. One would lay her head up on my chest for a cuddle. No food involved. Just feathery cuddles and low cooing noises.   Did that with my Warcraft account 10 yrs ago.   So this year they sent an ugly Orc statue to some poor asshole at a pizza place in downtown Detroit.

He navigated his car past the Catholic hospital and industrial buildings that surrounded Keoughs campus and drove toward the outskirts of the city. Eventually, he stopped at a garbage dump, far from any homes or businesses. Maskell stepped out of the car, and the blonde, freckled teenager followed him across a vast expanse of dirt toward a dark green dumpster.    It was then that she saw the body crumpled on the ground.

Unlike the American Consumer model where everyone is expected to buy their own 'thing'.  Wealthy people and corporations practice this type of socialism on a daily basis. If you ever spent time in a wealthy neighborhood you will soon see that none of them own a lawnmower. They all use mower services. And most corporations have a fleet of cars that are used by mid-level management on up.   It's only the lower classes who are discouraged from this by accusations of 'socialism'.    Another part that they missed- the part after they are 'raptured'.  The Apostles ask Jesus where they will all go and he answers:   Where, Lord?" they asked Him. He said to them, "Where the corpse is, there also the vultures will be gathered."   Luke 17:37   We should have left Saddam and his wood chipper the hell alone.      Thing is, Saddam was a Secularist and a lot of the folks that were in his 'torture prisons' were hard core islamists who wanted Iraq to toe the line with the rest of the Islamic fundamentalist nations. Some of the IS that were captured had spent time there.   in 25-50 years, they'll just say "Who could have known? The science wasn't in."

You had me second guessing myself for a minute there.   [Prey Animals](http://digital-desert.com/wildlife/prey.html)  The term prey refers to an animal that is sought, captured, and eaten by a predator. A predator is an animal that hunts and kills other animals for food in an act called predation. Smaller predators, such as mice and lizards can be, and often are, prey for larger predators.

I had the time and something about it just seemed appealing. I figured if I didn't like it I would get off in a major city and hop a plane.   I got a cute little sleeper (came with three great meals a day) and I loved every second of it. It was like a mini vacation and was almost the same price as flying. That decided me.   I had a friend who lived near a private area used as a shooting/training range for the Michigan Militia.  If they started shooting before 6 am he used to aim his speakers out the upstairs window and blast the Barney Song.   I live in a resort area and have to go to san fran regularly. I used to drive it- utter nightmare. Now I take a nice bus to the train, have breakfast on the train, catch up on emails, Skype, prep for meetings. Get off refreshed and ready to go. It's wonderful; and cheaper than supporting a car.    Mussolini, who is credited with creating fascism, often said that fascist governments should be "corporatist" regimes, essentially ones that were run entirely by companies and the elites of society.

According to Ibach, the farm has been quarantined and the birds on the property will be killed.

The National Weather Service says a 9-inch rainfall over a three-hour period may happen only once every 500 years; meteorologist Melissa Huffman said Clear Lake received 11 inches over three hours Tuesday evening.  	198
 Go on then mate, you have a go.    Fray Bentos   My bus journey to work was 1 hour so I always had the best naps before and after work. I remember waking up one time with dribble hanging out my mouth and a big wet patch on my t-shirt and the old lady next to me just staring like I was the filthiest pig she'd ever seen.   Also I jerked awake and kick the chair in front and cut my shin.    Or stab their tongue with a rusty screwdriver, BLEYOW!!!!      The match tracker in the bottom right-hand corner knew he'd scored before the ball went in.    I think my friend had this. He would often poo in strange places like round the back of the bike sheds and in a cow field and that, and he liked showing off his arsehole with cheeks spread.    That's the assumption I worked on   I used to work in a busy store and once overheard some coworkers saying that they hate it when I fart next to them when they're with a customer and walk away.   Also my friends' impression of me involves a lot of pointing but I had no clue that I did that.    Are you talking to Phil Neville?      He knew he was getting a blowie from his missus that night   No nets is the worst   Dude from my village reckons he knocked out a horse with one punch   The USA are only one of the G8   Right that's it ban this guy   There's 11 on a team though.   Cool, thanks for the info. It's interesting that he's the pillar of Bayern's back line, I like a no-nonsense CB that doesn't push forward.    This is a bit cheeky, I don't watch the Bundesliga so can anyone some up for me: his role at Bayern, what he does well defensively, and what he does during the attacking phase. Please and thanks.   A slug is as evolved as we are   Chiellini would sky that.   Not 90's at all but she is a bit black   Found it: Jessica Mauboy   This song was the hold music when I was on the phone yesterday. Sang by a female, it had a 90's feel to it, like TLC or something. It sounded like a black girl, all up and down.   Google doesn't return anything with those lyrics apart from Macy Gray and some rap songs. It's driving me crazy.   Please help me!   nah    Choosing not to watch a film because you're too lazy to rewind it.   Bazzing round the village on your bikes going, "who else can we call for?"    Hot Britney leaked over into the 2000's with 'Toxic'.   I remember going to my friends house to play Mario Party and being blown away that he had a computer in his room and being so impressed that he could go on the internet and be on the phone at the same time.   Why does the credit card company do this?   Got it, cheers!   Please what's the answer, I can't imagine how to even begin working this out.   You need to get out more      You've got dough      got it, cheers    This is it! Thank you!   Can I mark it solved on mobile?  	38
              The result was a culture within the tech industry often derided as  patch and pray. In other words, keep building, keep selling and send out fixes as necessary. If a system failed  causing lost data, stolen credit card numbers or time-consuming computer crashes  the burden fell not on giant, rich tech companies but on their customers.           For me the world we live in is a fusion of Brave New World, 1984, and Walden Two by Skinner. And I have an idea that Walden Two is even more determinant in shaping this present reality. The idea that people can be declared mentally ill because they fail to fit in. Ultimately everything ends up looking like Naked Lunch.      This story hits home for me because I grew up there and used to walk all over the place from age 8 onwards. It really freaks me out how lame Americans have become towards overprotecting their children, and these parents should be applauded. They seem really sane.         In WW1, African troops were considered to be more resistant to mustard gas and forced to march through it in front of other troops. I don't know if there was any truth to their resistance or whether it was some myth based on racial assumptions of the day, but I do know that troops were brought in from West Africa to fight in France specifically for this reason.                     I'm not really a fan of her music but she seems to have a bit more going on upstairs than the average pop star today.                               Oh I get it. Because we're all drunks.                Very compelling. She is an extremely lucid and articulate speaker.   [Angels Don't Play This HAARP](http://www.westcoasttruth.com/uploads/7/0/4/9/7049688/adpthaarp.pdf)   HAARP is a very controversial subject to say the least. My simple understanding of it is that the ionosphere is heated by antenna arrays and the energy thus created is then directed downwards towards a target on earth. I posted a link to a PDF of Angels Don't Play This HAARP above. Here is a short video if you can deal with the Moog in the background: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTpYwf7lBCA  Tesla pioneered this technology and nearly destroyed a town in Colorado. If I'm remembering right, he used a similar principle but instead of using the ionosphere, he obtained an accumulation of energy by bouncing electricity off the earth's crust on the other side of the earth... ie using the earth itself as an amplifier.   A lot has been played down by the authorities especially the danger posed by the central core. I see a number of directions where cover ups seem to be occurring. Fish stocks in the Pacific are badly effected. Children in many parts of Japan outside of Fukushima are showing higher than normal rates of cancer. US naval personnel who assisted post tsunami have had some very unusual occurrences of leukemia and other illnesses.   I know, I was just laughing at that. I e-mailed the article to my wife and now I'm probably on some fucking list.   This wasn't a cumulative assessment. This was a year by year measure. The depressed economy has no bearing on the numbers. Take a look at 23 Thing they Don't Teach You About Capitalism for more info. It's not anti-capitalism per se, but challenges a few claims that are usually not addressed. As for IT or Bill Gates, no one is arguing that hasn't had a positive impact on the economy, but taken as a part of the larger economy, it hasn't been enough to lift productivity, real per capita income etc across the board. Zimbabwe is a terrible example. I used to live there and know a great deal about it. The land was ripped from the few and given to even fewer. It had nothing to do with helping the poor.   Just came across this. I don't know if I buy it, but it is interesting.      "Not always" is the negation. The negation isn't the same as the opposite.   Article about radiation contamination in Tokyo from Fukushima fallout:   http://www.i-sis.org.uk/Tokyo_contaminated_and_not_fit_for_habitation.php   Economic growth during the period from 1950 to 1980 in the United States was, by almost every measure, double what it was in the following period from 1980 to 2010. This happened despite high end tax rates during the earlier period that targeted the wealthiest Americans. We are way less productive as a society when these brainless elites are allowed to make all the decisions about what to do with our economy. Most of them are not producers but horders. They put their capital into government bonds at best (facilitating the endless expansion of enormous, enslaving debt) or else into off shore accounts where the money just sits doing literally NOTHING for anyone, serving as some kind of bullshit trophy/bragging right about how rich they are. A good book on the subject is Ha Joon Chang's 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism:  (https://mafhom.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/23-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-capitalism.pdf)       (http://www.dailybuddhism.com/archives/670)      I've done that before. Didn't say sorry though.   If you see Buddha on a smartphone, kill him. Or at least kick his ass.      That's my problem. I can't believe this will not be turned against average citizens given enough time for the cops to learn how to game the technology.      If you see Buddha on the road, kill him.       How about [Love Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal)?               I'm pretty sure none of these assholes give a shit about real issues. They're too brainwashed to wake up. Fucking lemmings.      My problem with full legalization is only that corporations would then be able to advertise. I want to see bans on advertising and some kind of quality control regulation. I do think legalization is coming sooner than people think.      I definitely see drugs as a health care rather than a criminal issue. I also like the idea of decriminalization instead of legalization because that way corporations can't have the ability to market drugs. People need to be free to make their own mistakes.         Nice, I've actually been looking for some Situationist reading. And feel free to use the M word. Groucho is God.      Work stoppages seem to have helped folks in the fast food industry. Maybe we should all do our best to kill the Protestant work ethic.   [May 1968 events in France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France)      I guess the problem is who is fixing the issues? If the same system that created these global problems in the first place is in charge of the fixes, then I can't see how that will turn out too well. I'm not 100% against GMOs, but I am against a system where Monsanto is in charge of them for example.   The first paragraph of the Unabomber Manifesto:  The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the si- tuation. It will certainly subject human being to greater in dignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psy- chological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in advanced countries.      Try this: [The New Atlantis - Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMhkf5mAGgA)  Also this: [The Secret Destiny of America by Manly P. Hall](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/secret_destinyamerica/secret_destinyamerica.htm)   I've read all his books. Now actually read the article.            Why the fuck are you posting a link to a video that describes a sexually abused minor as a "sexy teen"? Seriously what the fuck?      That would be fun for sure.   There's so much stuff like this. The Belgians used to have safari parks with humans in them. In Spain, outside Barcelona, there was a stuffed African - I think he was a Koi bushman - up until the late 90's.               You're right. It does sound harsh. And no, it couldn't.    Was aware of that. The point is it isn't so well known now and articles discussing it should be passed around. Also people are more willing to let such a figure slip into oblivion if the victims were African because people in the West assume this is normal for Africa.    I forgot to mention her cousin was working inside the Bush White House throughout the period and she had frequent contact with the White House.   I don't think he's one of the most hated people around because I don't think the average person could tell you who he was. Also, I'm posting an article written by someone else. It's interesting and worth looking at. Doesn't mean all the words or thoughts are mine.  	92

That they're blessed by CM rather than being produced by individual maintainers now (though generally the same folks are doing much of the active coding work).  First official builds were on the 5th of Jan.   What sort of issues?  Wired or wireless, with or without mic?   http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-lg-g3/orig-development/rom-cyanogenmod-12-0-t2945461   http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-lg-g3/orig-development/rom-cyanogenmod-12-0-t2945461   You're still running the old unofficial build?  That's waaay out of date.  Head here and grab the official latest nightly (pro tip: clean flash the first official one you flash; after that, dirty flash is OK)  http://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=vs985  NOTE: Link is for VERIZON only folks   I've never encountered Mr Oakley before but I have to say, he's fucking adorable.   Poison, poison, tasty fish!   That depends on where they work.   Yes way. :D  "One thing you won't find on the Aquos Crystal is an earpiece. For phone calls, the entire screen vibrates to produce sound. Sharp calls it a "Direct Wave Receiver," but to us it seems exactly like the bone conduction speaker technology we've seen pop up in Google Glass and a few other out-there devices. Just press it up against your head and you'll hear sound. Like a bone conduction speaker, the sound gets louder when you plug your ears, or if you press the Aquos against a pair of headphones, the sound will go right through them."  http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/sharp-aquos-crystal-a-240-smartphone-that-out-designs-most-flagships/   I didn't say you did, was pointing this out for the benefit of the OP and other less knowledgeable folks.  It was changed because they're become more mainstream and don't want users getting into trouble having root enabled by default.  It just means those of us who have a clue have to do more work now.   Tapping the build number seven times is not unique to CM.  It's Android.  Though on CM it's where the root enable setting is now hidden.   This is called parking lights FYI.  In some places driving like that is illegal.  Just something to be aware of.   It's not a conspiracy, nor is it a theory.  It's a fact of how Facebook operates.  There is a ton of information online about how their algorithms work.  It's hardly a secret.  It kills your credibility to doubt they do it when it's full acknowledged by Facebook themselves.  I'm perfectly happy for folks who want to put themselves out there but I don't feel like putting up with ads and having my likeness used to convince my friends and family to buy things.  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/how-much-should-you-know-about-how-facebook-works/378812/  http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-facebook-news-feed-works-2014-2  http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/11/facebook-works-motivate-election-turnout-results/  ...   I'll add, Facebook is turning the internet into a curated experience much like AOL back in the early 90s when it controlled a large portion of the experience; back then the internet was still a new thing for most consumers.  It's damaging how one entity has so much control over what people see.   Because I don't use Facebook; I don't have an account.  That's all.  Not a big deal...  you can make a forum thread as organized or disorganized as you want.  Facebook gets organized however Facebook wants to organize it to ensure they get paid.   Funnily enough the side mirrors are probably the most functional mod on this vehicle.

Not scrape hard parts because they hit an ant.   There's a plastidipped metallic purple one in Southern Maryland I've seen a few times.   No worries, I was just curious ;)   Do you plan to make a version of this build log that isn't dependent on suckbook, out of curiosity?  Say on ft86club?  I'd like to follow along...   As a motorcyclist and FR-S owner I just have to ask - what is considered a tank slapper in a car?  I've never encountered that language in reference to a four wheeled vehicle before.   If you live somewhere a visual inspection is required (varies by county) then you better have a stock header and stock catted front pipe.  And yes, they do provide pictures to inspection stations of stock vehicles.  Source: lived in CA for 28 years.?  EDIT - You also can't change your intake FYI   Two other ppl on XDA reported this but we don't seem to have a common denominator yet.   When I was a kid I had a tape recorder (the one in the link) that I would run around with playing Wham (Make It Big, duh) and singing along.  Ah, the joys of a free spirit unfettered by social moires.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1xiSshmYM   Yes.  Probably somewhere during 19 or 20 is when it ended.  And now I'm a well adjusted (lol) 34.5 year old.  Family and other folks passing away, last year of HS was a rollercoaster, and I too was dealing with being bi (tho at that time I was convinced I was gay).   Good on ya.

I do not think it means what you think it means.   One of my coworkers called him Mister Who...I about died.   Didn't mean to imply a gender connection with this feature outside of my family specifically. :)   To some people a car is a means of getting from Point A to Point B.  For others, it is an expression of who they are (for better or worse).  All *I'll* ever need in a car?  No.   The story of a former high school football star on an around the world yachting journey.

Full gear saved my ass.   06 January 2009, black ice on a motorcycle.  Honestly, I didn't even have a chance to go "Oh, shit!"   FFDP - House of the Rising Sun   All the men in my family have this, including me.   I lost 82 pounds over 2008-2009 and let me tell you...That muscle your doc told you about in your buttocks, I'm still missing it.  It really only bothers me flying, so I took two of those stadium seat cushions and made a seat with a gap at the back so the seat puts no pressure there on my tailbone.   Good lord, 5 and 6 kids.  Where do these people live and how can I make sure I never find myself there?   In my experience, being friends or in regular communication with an ex is never a good thing for either party.  Move on.  You'll be better off.   I don't see there being another phone with this feature.  There's just no usage case that makes it worthwhile.  How do you know when a company is making profit hand over fist?  They come out with silly niche products like Samsung has here.   http://www.engadget.com/2014/06/25/google-io-2014-by-the-numbers/  To make the numbers easy, let's just use 1 billion total Android devices.  The OP says builds with less than 0.1% penetration are excluded.  That means, less than a million devices.  Given how the largest markets and most popular devices don't have released L builds yet...It's hardly unreasonable.    The point is there are more frequent accidents per capita.  One can draw the conclusion that quality here is not as good as elsewhere.  I linked the weather.com article but there were 10 more just like it referencing the same data.   Something seems to be keeping your phone awake a lot when you're not using it.  Do you have a bunch of apps set to auto update your feeds all the time like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, News Plus, etc.?   Ad blocking, yes, need root to be effective.  Ad-Away from F-Droid market (not Play store).  Can Fb/Twitter be uninstalled/disabled in Settimgs  Apps  All?  You might want to check out /r/Android since you seem to be a new user.   You will always need to flash a GApps package if you're doing a clean install.  GApps is not now, has never been nor will it ever be included in CM.   Not so far.  Less than 2% battery drop overnight (6 hrs 45 minutes) as well.   GG4 was announced in mid-November.  This phone was in development since early summer at the latest, so that's why.  They're not trying to screw you, don't worry.  It takes more than a month to design, prototype, test and productionize a new item for sale on the consumer market.   I haven't seen either of my cousins in any way other than a Twitter profile pic in 25 years.  So it's entirely possible to not be aware of these things.   Well, the entire DC area has statistically speaking more of the worst drivers than anywhere else in the US (not the absolute worst but the greatest quantity of pretty crappy when all the cities are considered):  http://www.weather.com/travel/commuter-conditions/news/10-cities-worst-drivers-america-20140827   Over on the other side of the Potomac we had 142 accidents in one county (Anne Arundel) alone.  I only saw a few flakes as I went through the base gate this morning down here in St. Mary's.  Stay safe out there fellow Mid-Atlanteans.   So I'm not sure that the slidey ruler is the best way to determine how much one prefers a particular gender relative to one's own gender.  Also, it might be useful to ask how recently one had sex with same/opposite gender in addition to how often typically.  Also if one is in an LTR...   Up until the last few weeks it was black with a few Splendas.  Lately I've taken to adding some milk (say 3 oz in my 24 oz Contigo), which cuts the bitterness more efficiently for me.   No.   Changing a few suspension bolts and updated engine software do not make a new generation.  Every manufacturer does things like this every year.  When they redesign the HPFP so it doesn't chirp on non-Japanese fuel, THAT will be a generational change.   *Shaun   First off, take a deep breath.  Second thing, go get a pregnancy test.  If she's missed a cycle then you probably know the result; HOWEVER, stress, diet, etc. can play havoc with women so it doesn't mean she is pregnant necessarily.

Rear fog lights are a luxury only feature in the US, typically only on Mercedes/BMW etc.  My C350 had it.  If you ever see folks driving at night and one taillight is brighter, it's because they're running the rear fog and don't realize it (on my C350 the headlight switch pulled out to turn on fogs - first detent was front and second was front and rear together).   http://i.imgur.com/10D2LQa.jpg   Cersei looking like Jem and Daenerys with the ferrets.

Modulate that throttle pedal, it's not an on/off switch.   OFT can do anything ECUTek can, short of auto rev match (so far).  It can be used to do dyno tuning, just like ECUTek can be used to create off the shelf tunes, which many people seem to think is the only thing an OFT can do.  And unlike ECUTek, OFT doesn't permanently modify your ECU at memory locations that can't otherwise be accessed.

Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

 but theyll take out the SWEARING!!!!!!!! dont you get it, itll be just another bsg without it, the characters will be turned into wimps, the expanse wont have its EDGE!!! why doesnt anybody get that!?   thats right!   just look at the following links people:  http://imgur.com/gallery/h8A09QY  http://youtu.be/qMVJnWd4idE  and heres an image of mewtwo to show why i choose him  https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQGMZ9l1Dx0xxVv-6nfE3BcKmHyxOlwm365MaDUt0anpd2DAF1G  any questions or responses?   tell me how i make mountain dew frosting, I MUST KNOW!!!   youll thank me later   thats part of what gives 'the expanse' its EDGE! without it itll just be another bsg or defiance, which is why I believe it should've been on HBO, heed my words theyll replace fuck with fnaq, and shit with skerb or something like that   but theyll take out the swearing and make it appeal to teens regardless, thanks to 'artistic liscence'   i mean im warning people saying "THEY WILL CHANGE STUFF FROM THE BOOKS!!!" and people just brush it off like, "hey guy, people change stuff from the books all the time!" but how do you know it'll be faithful!! god, i wish it were a movie instead, it could've been the next star wars for fucks sake!! whoever the names of the two guys with the pen name james S.A. corey, YOU FUCKED UP!!! do you know what SYFY will do to your own story!? they will take out the swearing and sex and add twilight-esque relationships, they will change what the characters were described in the books, order of events, designs of the ships! EVERYTHING!! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?!?!!?    he looks like some schlub they found in a college parking lot smoking pot and drunk, and asked him "do you wanna star in a sci-fi epic?" and he said 'yes' without paying closer attention to the question at hand. and after his supposed 'audition' hes wondering "how the hell did i get THAT role!? i must've been high.''   You may not be aware, but the authors are heavily involved in the scripting process.   Robert kirkman is invoked in the writing in the walking dead tv show, and that show is like 'Loose Adaptation: The Series!'   None taken   Fuck you!! They're great! you probably just have dyslexia,   I told you not to give any names!! Luckily I'm only on the first book so I'll forget his name by book 2 probably   theyre both always BACK   if so dont tell me their names, a simple yes or no will do   im like 140 pages into the first book   thats a bad sign if my 'aggressive geeking' as you call it, has a 'style'    btw howd you find out i was that same person, am i a celebrity in the star trek subreddit?   i could do that,    theyre adding a character i havnt even heard of oh great! first they cast a babyfce guy as jim holden now they add a character who im not even at in the books!? they shouldve gotten influence from han solo for jim holden   sadly yes i am, but i promise im working on it   they are going to RAPE the expanse!!!! dont you get it!?   theyll change a bunch of stuff to appeal to teenagers and preteens, theyll t6ake out the swearing and theyll leave stuff out of the books! i feel like the mary poppins broad when she heard the songs for the first time!, they will literally CHANGE the books! whoevers developing the show right now if youre reading this, put it on hbo that way itll have the swearing and shit. because chances are the book series will run longer than the show. if i ever as much as see ONE thing out of place from the books youll have one less viewer, and ill wait until they get turned into MOVIES!! it couldve been the next star wars or alien franchise but instead you make it into a tv show on a cheap cable network!? BOTTOM LINE: MAKE A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION DAMMIT!!! IF THIS ONE ISN'T, thank you for reading   i started reading the first book a week 1/2 ago, and im already worried theyll change stuff, i DO care   looks better than the sly cooper movie redesign   Look at the 2009 watchmen movie, to me that is how you adapt something, not changing too much stuff or taking stuff out, it's made just how the graphic novel is, and look at the walking dead that was faithful to the comics from the first episode until the y went to the city and rode in a tank. THEY NEVER RODE IN A TANK IN ANY OF THE COMICS!!! And THATS what makes me worried, that and they'll throw in an obligatory love triangle (thanks TWILIGHT!!) and they'll probably change the ages too of the characters to appeal to teens and preteens.   c'mon people!!! they're going to CHANGE STUFF FROM THE BOOKS!!!!   because  1. theyll not have any of the swearing   2. they may create new future slang in lieu of the aforementioned swearing   3. theyll change god knows what else,  4. and theyll take stuff OUT from the books   if i see even ONE thing not in the books im not watching, and ill wait until they make a movie out of it, which i beleive is the proper way to adapt them, or if not that remake it for HBO     one art please!   not something i would've made myself, but neat   looks like dr seuss drew the death star   You have no soul!   no hes asking if the avengers was made in 1980, who would be cast   i got carried away and it got downvoted   what you just typed goes beyond my comprehension as a user   debatable    ive read enough imdb message boards, disqus comments, and youtube comments to the point where i ask if its ok if i like something, and other times i really flip a shit like in this discussion:  http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2l48r1/is_it_ok_if_i_like_jj_abrams_as_a_director/  anyway how can i be more comfortable with my opinions?   ah dammit! that explains why i only got random images on google   thanks!      Who you calling nerdy!?!   Why won't you leave me alone!!! Ive reported you many times I hoped you'd get the message by now I don't like you and I can report you for harassment    You know what fuck you!! I hope all reboot haters get blasted off into space and the world would be a better place!!, I and other people like the new movies, DEAL WITH IT!!! You can't change the way people think!!!! God do I hate reboot haters with a passion!! I wish they were all dead!    But the downside of the expanse being on syfy means they'll take out the swearing, and change God knows what else   I'm so fucking sick of comparisons to transformers  telling you Trekkers are the skinheads of sci-fi fandoms, they never appreciate anything. Am I gonna be forced to live in a world where fandoms hate what they're fans of?   defiance, revolution, the upcoming 12 monkeys, znation, theres enough of those just like theres too many "your favorite fairie tales but gritty" shows   The new movies got 95% and 86% on rottentomatoes christ do you think they get those reviews magically?! Christ I'm sick of people like you giving me a hard time, it's like I say something positive about the new star treks and so called "fans" want me hunted. It's like Trekkers are the skinheads of sci fi fandoms! It's not fair!   I think the new movies are great!    that could be funny  	49
    Well 2 are so obvious anyone with a passing interest in movies or general knowledge would know. Getty and Blake obviously.  The other too less so. Henry Rollins friend and Epolito, the corrupt NY Cop.  And two more brought to my attention in this thread.   woah   It was useless information completely unconnected to the post about people having committed violence or being close to victims of noted acts.   What a weird angry response from a little man. LOL.   So why did you mention him?  Yes it would.     nice            Was Manson the victim of a violent crime?

You should ask in /r/screenwriting                     This is insane, what the hell. Wouldn't that kill soeone?            Any male actors like to chime in?

This happened to me before went I went in to see Casper but ended up in Scent of a Woman but it was okay as it was a country town cinema that only opened in the summer and they never had new movies just what the owner wanted to watch himself he apparently had loads of money so it didn't bother him that it closed in the end but while he ran it no one knew what movie would play at what time, you bought the ticket for the start time and people said he would laugh at the cries and screams from the audience as they were forced once again to watch Al Pacino dancing blind for the tenth time.

 Yeah. The article is exciting, but also kind of sad that we have such big potential, but the government just doesn't care. Hopefully, next election we'll have another Prime Minister that will take action.     	2
 Progress my ass. Janice's father had just received a pretty sizable bonus and was front runner for the General Manager of the Furniture and Pie Emporium, which would've included a hefty pay raise as well. Why would he leave that position, especially considering the entire family's deep rooted ties to the community. THEY started the Neighborhood Watch (which ended up a big hit and reducing teen smoking), but, as we all know, Rawlins despised it as he was known to smoke cigarettes and they would always hassle him for curfew. Two big no no's for Neighborhood Watch. If these sheeple would open their eyes they would see that Rawlins has already been on-record saying Neighborhood Watch is "stupid," and they "don't need it." Don't need it? Teen smoking down 15%, Dad's are happier as they feel cool at night, Mom's can drink wine in peace while Dad is gone, it makes everyone happier. Don't need it Rawlins? Maybe we don't need you.  Mark's gold digging for voters and we all know it. Why have they never kissed in public? Can we talk about Karen's brand new Audi she came to school in? Her parents drive Chevy's because they are a middle class family. You think she got that all by herself? Part time host at Applebee's isn't buying you a new Audi sweetheart.   Let's not start with the whole Janice scandal that Rawlins was involved in 2 years ago. Is it a coincidence it was swept under the rug RIGHT BEFORE this campaign began? Where is Janice these days, did she really "move," out of state? I think this whole thing goes deeper than we can fathom, nobody2000.    it's a ~~repost~~  Remix.

                         Damn you're right... Had to look at it a few times... And here I was thinking it was real...                I had this in San Diego at one of the bars in Hillcrest, the guy will make it for free if you mention it to him because he's so proud of his creation. also /r/EAF   it's actually from an episode of my strange addiction where her addiction was snorting baby powder. she would snort it all day and her house was covered in baby powder... unexpectedly they took her to a doctor who found she was totally healthy... it's also the same episode about the guy who was in a committed relationship with his car. it's one of the funniest 22minutes of television i've ever seen.    /r/eaf   /r/EAF   /r/EAF   /r/EAF   i mean... ponies exist.. he could fulfill his dream.    *confused*      Love this post.

 I live in the south and I'm not originally from here either. The only thing I can say is that you can see the difference very clearly. In the south they naturally segregate each other blacks with blacks, whites with whites, hispanics with hispanic, etc.. Now for the hispanics  I can say they tend to stay with each other because of the language barrier but if you meet one that's fully bilingual they would interact with everyone regardless of the race. In the northeaste is completely different you can go to the mall and you see groups of teenagers mingling (whites, blacks, hispanics, mixed, etc.). Trust me there's a big difference.    Oh my God! I didn't even know they made postcards about this.    That would be great if an AMA could be done.    I wonder if any of them are still alive and if they still feel the same way.      	5

 *Sigh* Some people just don't know how to read. That's exactly why I said make it server sided, so the aimbot can't fetch whether it's real player or not. There's no way to know if it's a real player if it's server sided.  Here, I'll quote it for you -  Just make it server sided  Please read next time, ty.   Like HLTV models in Cs 1.6. Just an option to disable animations in general.   Oh man if they did HLTV animation mode for CS:GO I would be so happy. I don't know why..   Airstuck, spinbot, bhop.   Don't get it? That's the same as adding additional players that aimbot could lock onto.  Just make it server sided, it's gonna eat some ping, but the results would be way less cheaters.  It would also make it obvious for Overwatch when someone randomly peeks at sky. (Where hitboxes would most likely be.) There are ways to improve this method, I'm just saying it "technically".    It's about time they add random hitboxes around the map to screw over aimbots. Slowly.. We are regaining control.   Developers HATE him!   Well I'm stupid. Sorry then.  Although at this point I'd say that all of these techniques require skill, surf, rocket-jumping, bhoping.   By surfing you go for a goal. From what I saw in that video it's just circling around a map to gain speed.    Lucky Silver account smurf ace KappA   I'd suggest we get these cases based on accuracy of verdicts, the more accurate - The higher % of drops if any.    Inb4 Griffins are not contraband and the Train changes are minor :(   I got scared at first, they told me everything. Now I'm happy to know that there is someone out there.  The difference is, a lot of people's encounters are either painful or emotional;  What I went through seemed more like an education.   I know that some alien races are known as shape-shifters, and they choose their visual form to make a minimal "scare" impact on abducted person. They told me that there are more than one race visiting Earth, however, they personally make the contacts different each time to research abductee's activity. Basically, they are looking for optimal way to start a contact with humans, and this can take ages. Their concept of introducing us to alien life is gradual. To put it short, through mass media consumption we get more and more "aware" of concept of aliens each day. Again, minimal impact. If they tried to go for direct contact without helping at least bigger part of population understand the situation it would cause mass panic, which is not a good way to go.  When I came into the ship, like I said, there were a few displays. They know about us a lot. They even told me they have these very small "drone" swarms in our ionosphere, they are super small and undetectable to radars. They usually stay at altitude where human technology is not orbiting. They told me those "drones" are usually what you see in the sky during UFO sightings, it's not a triangle or a disk ship, it's the drone "swarms" that change form. They reflect sun light and gather energy from it, thus why they look white. Some sightings show where one disk becomes two, it's the drones separating. They even showed me the capabilities - They can cause natural events like artificial rain/clouds and even disrupt communications (they cause artificial clouds/rain if they are in large numbers). Also, they are very small and they work like cameras that can produce live feed. It's creepy, I know.  What's even scarier is that they shown me one of those, and they are about a size of a penny or a coin.   I'm always open for skepticism, however, I'm not sure what mental state and psychology has to do with a hobby.   I don't mind graphics as long as they don't interrupt the game-play. EDIT: Wow, getting disliked because GRAPHICSGAMEPLAY AMIRITE???   Directly from video description - Found this while working on my new map. I could just add a clip brush, but the same thing happens in all Valve maps, it's a collision related issue.  Basically, when you get stuck, the game registers you as if you are falling, and when you unstuck it registers as if you touched the ground, thus making you die.      So... This was my first encounter in my life. I was always skeptical about other encounters until I experienced myself. I would like to not jump into conclusions as it could have just been a state of sleep paralysis. I have no proof whatsoever, so it makes up for a good reading story. So here we go. I'm laying in my bed at 2 AM (Eastern European Time GMT+2) with my smartphone out, watching Youtube with headphones on me as usual. Suddenly, I hear this ticking noise. My Wi-Fi connection started to go crazy, so I wen't to check it out (my router was in my main room, I don't know how you call it). By the time I come back I realize 2 hours passed by. I thought my clocks are going crazy, so I checked my smartphone settings and apparently even the clock on the wall showed the same.   The next night I decided to put a cardboard full of metal scraps on the doorstep so that if the door opens it would make a loud noise. I did not have a camera at the time besides the one on my smartphone, which is not always easy to set up somewhere without having a dock. Few hours in, I hear the door open. I jumped out of fear but I was unable to open my eyes, which was weird, because I was completely conscious and not asleep anymore. I then woke up in a field not so far away from my house where I usually drive by, not much cars go through that route. It's foggy and dark. I see a dim light in a distance and a weird noise coming from something that appeared like an aircraft. Note that I'm saying aircraft instead of spaceship, as I was unaware at the time and I cant say for sure if it wasn't just something related to "goverment", which would still be stupid to think of. I see these creatures walk out. They look transparent with blue-ish color, I could see through their organs. They had very thin legs and arms, but they had one huge organ inside them which looked like a ball inside a ball, something like an stabilization engine you would see in NASA navigation systems or smartphone cameras. When the creatures moved the ball organ stayed stationary and relative to the height level they were in. I don't have a masters degree in biological science, but I immediately knew the organ served a purpose of helping sustain their body stationary and not make them fall down. The creatures had eyes, but both of them looked connected and had no pupils. They were absolutely black and even reflective like a camera lens.  The creatures came up to me and helped me stand up. I was afraid at the time, but somehow telepathically they gave me a thought of "being calm". It's really extreme to explain something like that. As we get closer to the spaceship I start to make out important details of it. (I call it spaceship by now cause it's too unreal to be something human made). It looked something like a stealth jet but a little bit rounder, nothing close to the common "disk" shape encounters though. It was black. It did not have thrusting engines, however it had these very small holes around it. As I came into the entrance part of the ship, a small port opened and the creatures told me to put up gloves to prevent cross-contamination in the ship. Two small transparent plastic bags fell down. It had one button on each. The creatures then "explained" to me how it works. I put on plastic bags on my both hands and press one of the buttons. The plastic bag suddenly started shrinking and getting tighter as it wrapped around my hand and formed into a human hand shaped glove. They explained to me that this method works for a lot of alien races who have different developed arms compared to humans. The place itself did not smell like anything at all. It was super sterile. I had to put those bags on my shoes too, they were worried for me not to leave any traces. It almost felt like a tour through a billion worth craft. One of the doors in front of me opened. The doors were made out of material that looks like cloth, however, a little bit thicker. When the door opens the material rolls up. They explained to me telepathically that if there's no potential danger of an creature "breaching" certain sectors, there's also no need for armored doors. They told me that the doors humans use are inconvenient.  When the door closed behind me I saw this one central panel, and a lot of "creature shaped" ports around me. They told me it's where they have to "connect" when they travel for longer distances.  Around the central panel I could see a few more creatures. There weren't a lot of them though. They did not have any chairs, the display on control panel they used was holographic. They explained to me that it works very similar to the ones we have today where you spray water particles into air and then project onto them. They told me that instead of using water particles they shoot micro-particles into air (which are very invisible to our eye) and that the projection is much more complex. It was a process of micro scale. They walked me through the spaceship and showed me how much of our galaxy they mapped through. They told me that Milky Way is one the galaxies they recently discovered. They explained to me that they do not give names to anything. They did not even call our galaxy Milky Way before I thought of it. They understood what is what in "context".  They then told me that they do not use electricity wires as a method of conducting energy at small scale, their "wires" had a small round bubble at each corner. They told me that very small magnets shoot other magnets at a very small scale, then speeding up and producing energy which required no recharge. They told me though that they weren't exactly magnets like we have in our Earth, they were super-conducted magnets that could last for ages shooting back and forth. They also told me that it was done on a very small scale otherwise it would not produce energy. They showed me how their propulsion systems work. They explained to me that they use "rocket" engines similar to ours too, but that they used plasma that they produced from matter. The plasma was invisible to my eye. The plasma was being shot from those small holes I saw before, and it was done on every angle to stabilize the flight. They told me that it's "primitive but it works".  I asked them about anti-gravity, and they told me that they were impressed how race like ours know a concept of such propulsion. However, they told me that what we call "gravity" is limited to our own concepts and knowledge of physics. They told me that they did not acquire such propulsion yet because the more advanced alien races do not share this technology. They told me that there are alien races far beyond theirs, but they do not give technology to developing races as they could destroy themselves. They think that a race should rather advance long enough to create such technology themselves and become mature and sentient, instead of sharing the technology just to cause internal self-destruction in civilizations that are still developing. They explained to me that very advanced civilizations are staying out of smaller civilization concerns to let them develop, however, smaller civilizations can grow contacts and bonds to develop and advance together and become one huge civilization. It is what most civilizations do, and it is one of the reasons I was invited to the spaceship.  They told me that there are races who harness power but are still developing, which makes them dangerous to other races. That's why It's important for humans to become partnered on galactic-scale. As they wrapped up our telepathic conversation, they told me they have to transport me to my house, however, they can't do that if I'm awake. They told me not to be scared and laid me flat on a desk. The desk looked like a display and suddenly I felt a needle inject into my neck. It was behind me so I had no way of knowing when or how the process was gonna happen. The next thing I know I'm wide awake in the morning with a little trace where the needle was supposed to be. It is gone now, but I can still feel some "ticklish-pain" there from time to time.   Anyways, let me know what you think in the comments. Please be;  Respectful  Open minded  And of course - Stay to the topic.    Came in 100 hp. Came out 5 hp.     You don't have a terrible taste, you have a *different* taste.   See, the problem is that it's the community who's going to bring itself down, not the pro teams.  Think of the effect of seeing something on the news feed regarding "A pro team disbands due to the pressure from the community"  Now THAT is what would do the most harm.   Gotta love that CSGO sale.   Because knife makes you an instant-pro KappA.   That's not the thing, I grabbed a kill or two way before them and I was pushing way ahead. The problem was, they got flanked from the back and I happened to be just around the corner. (Like you'd say)   They started shit-talking when they all rushed and died and I was the last guy in the team.  Started team killing me and on the first round of second half they just said "Good bye" and kicked me.    Good for you, I usually get them every 2nd match or so.      Shadowban incomming?   That's exactly what I said. I said that ticks won't matter if it's a cheap server (and it would be). I suggest you go check your eyes and read again.  I find your "jump the gun" comments even more hilarious.   It would split the community into half, because a majority of people would NOT be able to or would not wan't to pay. Simple as that. Regarding the second statement, there's a LOADS of videos where 128 tick does not register shots. 128 is better than 64 tick, but it's not the best. It also goes down to how the servers themselves work, not just the TICKS. (Quality over quantity, if that's the right term here)   And that would split the community into half and the majority of people would stay on 64 tick, and the ones on 128 tick would sooner or later start whining.   And it's not only the FPS we are talking about here. It's the packet rates, yadda yadda. Basically, not everyone have a beast computer and a beast internet. I have internet good enough to play the game without rubber banding, and I have good enough PC to play it without any lag. Unfortunately, I'm not someone who would spend money on virtual skins and better equipment rather than spending money on studying.     Terrorists forgot how to plant.   1. Intros in CS:GO videos 2. Vanguard has just started, wtf chu sayin?   Stand in their molly's so that they can get banned kappa   1. Not transparent. Not solid is what you mean. 2. They are supposed to be like that so that the railing don't absorb bullets and grenades don't mess up. 3. It's a sign of good mapping. 4. Heck, it makes it better! I don't see any problem here?   Plenty of reasons here I could think of; 64 tick, obviously. Call me blind but I think I saw the scope being an itsy bit blurry before you shot. Maybe it has to do with the inaccuracy after scoping in quickly.  There's some randomness in AWP bullets, but it's like 0,001 percent so whatever (just like with every other gun).  Internet connection/Server lag.  All these reasons, maybe it's something different.  Just saying that for the past few weeks Valve servers have been trash.   riding de_train hype (I wish)   OP got demolished    MORDA   cyka gamburger   Cyka, davai idy na B blyat!   It's like Candy Crush, after some time you gotta wait to play again. It's a marketing strategy so that players don't get bored fast. I could go into more scientific stuff but that should explain it.   So I found out something interesting on a website called Above Top Secret, I'm not sure how much of you guys are aware of this but it sounds pretty credible and scary.  Fyi - Dyson sphere is a theorical structure that surrounds a star to collect all it's energy, built by super advanced civilization. (Possibly on Kardashev 2 scale and up)  The guy talks about data he found on craiglist about military connection with nearby Dyson Spheres.  Take a look -  http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1040809/pg1   That moment he knocked the heavens. Unfortunately, GabeN did not have any spare Dragon Lores.   Or just double press the orange fog.   POSSIBLE UPDATE!? HYPE!!?   ..Down?      Everybody hear that? Bitch got served. (Leet World reference no bannerino pls)   Darude - Sandstorm   The tree at A is a part of the gameplay.   CT's can insert the numbers into the bomb telepathically when defusing, If the terrorists change the code they're screwed.   Bitch shit            Its a problem with the model itself, not de_cache. It is one of the default models in CS:GO model library. (The same one can be seen on de_train)  Although I cannot find a real use of this issue, as it's really minor, the way to fix it would be to add a nodraw brush. Clipping brushes do not stop bullets, so nodraw could possibly act as a "penetrator"   Then again, I'm not an expert.      If you get kicked from a match, wait a while and go to your recent matches, it will show if the team that kicked you lost or won.  I once top- fragged carrying some 4 guy premades till 10-4, then they started taking advantage of me and decided to kick me. I told them that if they kick me they will loose the match (cause they were noobs). They started laughing and kicked me. About half an hour later I wen't to check my recent matches, and that team who kicked me lost. (They said they can win without me, what a sweet taste of karma)   This exact same topic was discussed a few weeks ago. It's called chargeback.  It sucks that things like that exist, but it all goes down to the person if he's being careful about his valuables or not. There's no need for a sticky.   Meanwhile; server crashes, buggy menu, OP-75, glitchy hitboxes, 64 tick   So he doesn't scare you.   But it's Pasha man   Actually, neither of you guys are right. One of Valve employees said that they were actually testing with importing old Source games to Source 2, and that they were messing around. There might have been Counter Strike 2, but it was just Valve employees playing around and the concept never got out of Valve's office. It JUST won't be released.  Also, thinking in long term i wouldn't mind playing CS:GO for another 5 years as long as they keep updating it and listening to community feedback.   Don't feed him guys... Don't feed him, or we will wait another 33 months!    bind mwheelup +attack  bind mwheeldown +attack  'nuff said   And what about that "human eye can only see 25 fps" bullshit console peasants keep talking about?   Sorry to break your dreams guys, but it looks like all the Source engine games got updated 2 hours ago. (Including CS:GO, that we are talking about.) It MIGHT be just a regular maintenance update.  Just saying; don't frown if that happens to be it.  	70

I guarantee: you, the manager, and the employee will all have a better day because you took the time.   Edit: I thought about it, and I agree that an email, if you really will take the time, is even better since it creates a permanent record. I will now do both.    why you do bank on the hypothesis of a successful uprising  Did you even read my posts? I clearly stated:  "And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government."  Attempting to converse with you is pointless. I'm out.    Thank you for the correction and additional info.   I heard about this on a radio program and it was absolutely frightening.   To be dismissed as dead, as you hear everything around you, with no way to break through, and to live that way for years, that would be crazy making.    As a matter of pure statistics, it would be highly improbable that Trump would not present some positions now and then that actually make sense.     Go check yourself  I checked. Can confirm.

The man was working on the robot inside the cage when he was grabbed."   I skimmed the article, and here are some snippets:   **Operation Uranus**: encirclement of the German Sixth Army to envelop German Army and Romanian headlong. Soviet troops were not without problems, due to commonly arriving late. Soviet forces on Axis forces, German reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet spearheads, did not react quickly enough to disengage. Soviet forces linked up encircling some men instead of attempting to break out of the encirclement.   You are more fired than a Mexican, drug-dealing, rapist, criminal.   It, and he, are an **Ass-Hat**.   Yah - but just in case ...   This guy is a walking **ass hat** - - in more ways than one.   **Being "boxed"**.

The woman police said Coleman shot and injured was Coleman's grandmother.  The sentence The Charlotte Observer printed Marusak wrote and butchered was Marusaks work product.   Very timely. A group of a-holes have have been *"causing emotional distress" on the Internet* to me. I've been pretty well traumatized.

LIBERALS are thankfully preventing that  No, capitalists are preventing that. The wealthy and the corporations are in charge and have the most influence on who gets elected and on what policies are enacted.   U.S. Politicians are much more like puppets than dictators.    My library even has a flier describing how to copy the file so it never expires . . . AKA piracy.    "The airline purchased an additional 23 safety lanyards following the accident and reinforced procedures for their optional use."  What are these "safety lanyards" and how would they prevent this?    Military intervention? Covert ops? Peaceful dialogue between the two Koreas?  Do you really think any country is going to invade NK? And if they did, that NK wouldn't detonate nuclear bombs before facing defeat? In reality it wouldn't get that far since China would step in immediately.   Covert ops? You don't think that was tried as NK was developing their nuclear program? It was. It failed.  "Peaceful ..." NK is still at war. There is no "peace" yet, and they have NO interest in pursuing peace. So, good luck there.  And, to be clear, Jang Jin-sung said the internal solution is "the forces of the market", not an overthrow of the government.   I have no solutions other than shaming China into either owning the problem, or getting out of the way of others that want to "influence" the situation.    They would never go to prison. They would simply be charged, booked, and spend a few hours in jail before being released pending a plea deal (or, very unlikely, a trial if the prosecutor really wants to make an example of them - not likely).    imprisoning people for their religious beliefs  For their beliefs - absolutely NOT.  For illegal actions ABSOLUTELY.  These clerks with convictions have 2 simple remedies: do your job, or work elsewhere.    there are alternatives for regime change  Please, do tell.   Well played, and very good point.  North Korea confounds me beyond any other country. I have no clue what the right approach might be.  I hate the regime, and my heart goes out to the people.   From what I've read, I don't think an externally imposed solution makes sense.   Given that, I see alternatives of (a) status quo, or (b) internal change.  I quoted Jang Jin-sung because I also believe that the change must come from within.    If I had to vote right now - I would hold my nose and vote Hillary.   That said, I don't trust her poll driven "convictions", and I don't think I am alone.  That is why I'm looking/hoping for viable alternatives to step up in the Dem party.   I guess I'll just let go, 'cause  . . .  Why did I have to act so mean?  Don't I know I'm human being?  Born of a mother with the love of a father  Reflections come and reflections go  I know sometimes I wanna let go  I know sometimes I want to let go   Any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name right.   Jang Jin-sung says stop funding food aid:  North Korean exiles will tell you that the international community must stop funding food aid. We say this not out of spite with regard to a nation whose leadership invests in luxuries, nuclear tests and missile launches while the welfare of its subjects remains low among its priorities. We say this for pragmatic and humanitarian reasons, because the assumptions that lie behind funding food aid have hindered economic reform in our homeland, not helped it.  Today, the fatal threat for the regime lies not in the outside world, but within the country itself. More specifically, this is the jangmadang  an underground economy arisen from the ashes of economic collapse in the 1990s, and which consist of market activities taking place beyond the remit of the regimes control mechanisms.  In todays North Korea there are two rival forces in battle: the forces of the regime and the forces of the market. The formers interests are better served by the maintenance of existing party, military and surveillance mechanisms of control. The latter are equivalent to North Koreas progressives, who believe in a future that is possible beyond the absolute, stifling and structurally inhumane confines of the regime.  An international community wishing to assist the North Korean people should recognise that funding food aid is a channel of limited efficiency. The majority of North Koreans depend not on the regimes munificence but on market forces  they have already found this a more successful alternative, despite a disproportionate lack of international support or awareness.  Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-ils favourite state poets until he defected in 2004. He founded the North Korea news website New Focus International   Hey OP - That's a lot of bull!

Judge Michael Mosman of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ruled late on Monday that the Second Circuit was wrong and that the program could resume.  "Second Circuit rulings are not binding on the F.I.S.C. and this court respectfully disagrees with that courts analysis, especially in view of the intervening enactment of the U.S.A. Freedom Act," he wrote.   Flying kites at the beach.   The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, and did not report seeing the explosion. The explosion registered at seismic stations across Eurasia. It is estimated that, in some places, the resulting shock wave was equivalent to an earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale. It also produced fluctuations in atmospheric pressure strong enough to be detected in Great Britain.   World Asteroid Day - - now that is tempting fate.

The Investor-State Dispute Settlement, or ISDS is [*The Trans-Pacific Partnership clause everyone should oppose*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kill-the-dispute-settlement-language-in-the-trans-pacific-partnership/2015/02/25/ec7705a2-bd1e-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html) (By Elizabeth Warren February 25)  ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge U.S. laws  and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers  without ever stepping foot in a U.S. court. Heres how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators. If the company won, the ruling couldnt be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions  and even billions  of dollars in damages.  	112
 I feel like we need a picture of your cat OP    I SAID BOIL THE NOODLES.  Yes food sorcerer.   There is a hidden benefit with this fad at least. Because there are more and more people who eat gluten free, this means that more and more companies are producing gluten free options. Actual celiacs should be happy with that at least lol   I thought this was a poignant statement about the real issue we face todo with the mass death of bees.  Then I read the last line and I'm not sure if you were just setting up a pun.   Have you checked the fridge? That's where mine hides.   This is why I use the metric system in my private life. Who wants to measure flour by horses?   Oh god this is hilarious, I didn't want to spell the joke out or it would lose its oompf :P  Don't worry, upvotes for you   Nah, I've sworn off Dim Sims. Thanks though.   I agree with you, it's perfectly healthy to want to play around with tasty food. What I think the OP is getting at, is for some people to distance themselves from romanticising some foods.  If you take a step back and look at sugar from a pragmatic standpoint, having a can of coke is fucking stupid lol   It took a bit for me to realise this. I initially dealt with those 10pm cravings you get by having an apple. That did the trick, but now I realise that this 'hunger' I feel isn't that big of a problem and while that apple is fucking delicious, I ask myself "Is this superficial hunger really worth the 100 calories this apple will give me?" The answer is invariably **no**.  My daily intake budget is set in stone so that those extra calories are just that, extra. Still love me some fresh apples though.   Now I'm up shit creek without a paddle and a canoe :(   20 dozen eggs isn't impressive? That's 240 eggs, that's 40 omelets. If scrambled that's 19,200 calories.  If that doesn't impress you, just picture 20 egg cartons.    why does it need your name  So that they can complete the police report in conjunction with your 'missing' dogs. They're onto you..

Using the ['I lost what?'](http://ilostwhat.com/) website, what have you lost so far?   I apparently have lost a 15 foot canoe lol   Really good post, the concept of skinny is lost on many of us.  Skinny is just an obese person sans fat.  We're not the default position.   It's all about willpower, something which all of us losers need.  You need to show to yourself that you can say no, easier said than done sadly    If you're in a rocking chair or a knitter (like me) you'll have to take it off for those because it will count them as steps.  Also when you're adjusting change in your pockets aggressively for 2-5 minutes.    Swiggity swooty, I'm coming to congratulate you on your great success towards your weight goals.  I have no idea why I find this sentence hilarious   He is better, thanks for asking.  The whole 'playing the field' thing isn't important unless you make it so. I personally couldn't care less how many people I've hooked up with as long as I've found the right chick. You may very well be the same, but that can only come from being conscious of the need, if you have it :)  Best of luck on the dating scene :)   Karma.  You'd be surprised how many people love the validation of internet points.   The 'fuck Jenny' thing was a massive TIFU post about a man who accidently discovered that his wife Jenny was cheating on him with another man, he then documented his clandestine discovery of her infidelity with the help of a private detective. It was this whole indepth thing a while back. He ended up deleting everything shortly after and people started noticing holes in his story, it was likely just some dude making shit up.  The 'F' thing is an injoke about a Call of Duty game. There is a cut scene where you're at a funeral and to progress the scene you have to press 'F' to 'Pay your respects'. This is of course the butt of  all jokes because of it being a stupid example of 'game immersion'. So when someone posts 'F', they're 'paying respects' to the poster.   If you **know** that you're about to get a job. Get a credit card. Credit cards get a bad rap, but only by those who don't know how to use them properly.  Credit cards should be used for mini loans, not for constant expenses. Using credit cards, then paying the money back also establishes a credit history which in the long run will be beneficial to yourself.   It's always been a thing for moronic dudes who have no concept of STDs.   Wear a fucking rubber with strangers people. Jesus.   I did and I feel rather crappy about it.  Many years ago I met and hooked up with this gorgeous girl who was on a 'temporary break' from a guy she was dated (he has the same exact first name as me lol). Anyway, we had a insanely strong connection and she contacted me after getting serious with her BF. So we started a platonic friendship and we had the absolute best time. We became fast friends. Would talk most days and nights.  Things with the BF had always been on the rocks, he was emotionally distant and she couldn't date him anymore. She ended up leaving him for me and we had the most incredible relationship I've ever experienced in my life to date.   I've always felt kind of responsible for it, but I've been assured that the relationship would've been over even without my existence.    Lets look at this issue in context. Let's say you meet a guy and go out for a few dates. Are you going to be talking about how many guys you've dated at this stage? Not likely, I doubt he'd ask and you'd tell.  So in essence, it's not relevant.   However.  It's important for you to know yourself. What I mean is, following the above example, let's say you guys date for a few years and get engaged and married.  Is your inexperience likely to affect your relationship with someone that you're now fully committed to? Do you think that you could settle down with someone when you've never seriously dated anyone else?  These questions are important for yourself because I could think of little worse than being married and having kids, then realising "Oh shit, I *need* to play the field". Which causes problems in the relationship.  Sorry for rambling, but I have a close friend whose girlfriend of 10 years left him because "she wanted to fuck around and didn't get to do that in her early 20s". Completely fucked him up, they were about to get married.   I'll add that these are not the two best dramas, nor are they even the two best HBO dramas.   But If I had to choose, I'd say The Sopranos. I say that with lots of reluctance though.  Oz is truly amazing but it's brutal. Like, really brutal.  That scene with the spoon? I don't want to watch that for a second time.      I've been losing weight for the past 4 months and part of that is being sober. I honestly thought the hardest part of giving up beer would be the parties.   It's easier than you think.  I drink nothing, maybe water if I'm thirsty. Our culture dictates that you need to get drunk to have fun but that's total nonsense. I'm not going to stay away from drinking for ever (I love the taste of beer still), but my view on alcohol and the obsession people in their 20s have with it has changed over the past 4 months.   I used to work manual labour (roofing) and 8 hours of work would fly by  You answered your own question, you work hard.  I work a 42.5 hour week doing software development and my week days go incredibly quick. But that only happens when I keep myself busy with work.   euphemistic treadmill  Oh, I like that   I compare any sort of past time to the most common past time.  **Seeing a movie**.  In Australia, an adult movie ticket costs $20~ AUD. That $20 provides 90-120 minutes of entertainment.  So if I spend $18 for a month of wow and get literal weeks of entertainment, I consider it worth it, by comparison.  Using a better example, I played competition 8-ball 6 months out of the year. So every week, I pay my $12 playing fee and I attend 3-4 hours of practice on Mondays and I play for 4 hours on a comp night. When you take a step back and look at it, the cost vs entertainment duration factor (for me) makes me consider a hobby as *worth it*.    I'm 5'9 1/2, I honestly couldn't care less. My latest girlfriend was a netball player who was 5'10, the people who care about something so silly are the people who are focusing on the wrong thing about a girl.  Height doesn't matter.   This happens so often, when the guy in delicately rubs the girls clit during sex and you can see the girl isnt into it.  This hurts the clit, some may be into that much pressure but it would say most dont   Not even kidding, i have never and will never fap to porn with fake boobs in it. Id rather watch porn with a girl who has small ones.    Its almost like a boycott.   Balding by 22, GG sexiness.   PERFECT, this is what the character needed in the MCU. A young and relatively unknown actor, had it have been some better known person like Miles Teller, it would've been really distracting.  I'm excited.   Obviously Im talking about your average drinker and not someone who binges on booze every single day.   My mum asked me "so they're giving my email address out, what's the big deal?"  The internet is still very much the wild west as far as privacy is concerned.   By my count, you look like you just earned a new /r/loseit flair! Well done :)  Assuming you're a man in your 20s, we have very similar stats :D   It really makes me thankful that my over eating was just due to being a lazy person who loved food more than wanting to be healthy. I can't even imagine how much harder my progress would have been if I had had the same situation as you :(  That being said, congratulations on the progress you have made I really am hopeful I'll get the flair that you have soon :)   I like that there is a real lack of shit posting. I know this subreddit cops some flak from other places due to the celebration of the little victories (Been a week since my last soda, etc), but there are so many of us for whom these small victories add real help.     OH man, how good are scrambled eggs!  Any other Aussies out there, try scrambled eggs on Vegemite toast.  Tasty as shit.   Yeah, his first kill was a 1 on 1 fight with a bandit IIRC. Or was Barristan?   It is true, but it's certainly not healthy.   My calf muscles are actually huge due to carrying around my fat arse all of these years.    I think on of the problems is equating exercise with weight loss. How many times have you heard someone say "I would like to lose weight, but I don't have enough time for the gym'. I was one of those people not that long ago, we need it to be common knowledge that weight loss is primarily done with diet. Exercise is recommended but not wholly necessary.   Also people find dieting hard because they think a diet should be excluding food instead of the better option - eat the foods you want to eat, just less and with better balance.   I love me some steak, I really do. I'm not going to give that up. So I just buy smaller and more lean cuts and make sure that I have something green in my sides. It's so easy that I'm kicking myself that I didn't start sooner.  40 lbs down and counting :)    Speaking as someone who (at their worse) was 100 lbs overweight. Do something about it now. I'm facing a probably bout with loose skin once I finally get my weight down to normal, I wish I had made these choices when I was at your weight ratio.  Best of luck, that rationalising can be dangerous for sure.   You're going to see weight problems due to drinking long before you'll see liver disease problems due to drinking.  The empty calories in booze are some of the most brutal, I'm down 40 lbs in 4 months - most of this is due to being sober.   Please tell me that the sex scene with John Cena (Sex Cena lol) is as hilarious as it is in the trailer   There are so many fucking assholes in porn.   I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the OP doesn't really care about girls wearing make up, he's just painting a picture of someone who goes to the gym to be seen, rather than going there for a workout.  I find those people annoying too, it's like those people who take endless selfies of everything they do.   Their are plenty of reasons why people do this, I'm not sure why your so upset. It's probably just you're sensitivities.   I know there are greater ones, but this one is so powerful even though it's really short.  The final scene we have with Jesse in Breaking Bad. Where he's in the car, we get that close up of Jesse doing a mix of crying, screaming and laughing. It's an incredible moment which required no words. It was all in that facial expression - amazingly well acted.  He had been in captivity for months, saw his girlfriend executed and had finally been given his freedom after confronting Walter and gotten closure against Todd. He perfectly expressed that incredible mix of emotion to the screen. It was so emotionally solid that it didn't need a follow up "X months later" scene.   In Australia - we got rid of them too. The 1 and 2 cent coins are gonzo :)   I dislike her no less than book Dany. I'm just not a fan of her story arc :(  I empathise with the character, I just don't find it interesting.   Total and complete chaos. I agree, who will side with who? Jon was the fabric which kept the peace. How will the wildlings (led by Tormund) act with such chaos? The Nights Watch may very well be exterminated. Far out, TWOW is going to be awesome.   I normally respond with "I believe in total equality between all genders". Social egalitarian I think is the more broad moniker I identify with.   Dredd was good because of this.  More recently? Kingsman - they could've easily made Roxie a love interest, but they decided to focus elsewhere.   The fondest memories I have growing up was when my brother, myself and my father spend 6 months putting 3 broken 1980s dirt bikes back together. We would spend hours **every** weekend slowing building them back up. I learned so much and loved it. They were all in such disrepair. One was launched into a river, one had caught fire and my one had broken in two.  For those interested, two of the bikes were 1981 Suzuki TS185 and the other was a 1982 Suzuki DR250. We ended up having those bikes for many years. My TS185 sadly was destroyed when our shed caught on fire and the DR250's engine finally gave out. My brothers TS185 is still kicking around though :)  I treasure those memories   holy shit, this is some real talk right here   My friends call each other douchebags all the time, if it were serious then yes, it would be an insult.    Actually yes! Same sex love is a major factor, especially between a main character and another one.  It's kind of like a Ross and Rachel thing, but with far more gay sex.   They're so fucking different. I loved Oz and I love OITNB, but they're totally apples and oranges.  With OITNB there is no where near as much tension, it's more about the characters and their back stories. It definitely leans more to the drama and comedy side.  Oz is a brutal crime drama, holy crap do they deal with some real issues. There is always a sense of doom and worry with most scenes. Oz is definitely not for the faint hearted. It is an excellent show however.  To be honest, I probably wouldn't watch OITNB if it weren't as R rated as it is. This isn't just because of the nudity, it's because of the language and the subject matter. They could've easily made it a PG tv series, but that would've taken the realism involved with it.   Not quite that extreme, but with an ex I would wake up to find her resting her hand down there. I asked her about it and she said something about it just 'being nice to hold while going to sleep'.  Go figure :)   Don't forget free time, the extra money is nice but having the free time is also a benefit.   Welcome aboard, come to Melbourne - the greatest city in Australia :P   I've actually had this too, half of the girls I've dated have been against getting head. It's been for a variety of reasons too. One of them even said "I once had a guy do it so well that it has ruined head for me", which is kind of stupid.   Sucks too, I love doing it :(   This is actually a concern for me going into the future. I'm in the process of losing weight and getting fit again (40 lbs down so far, yay!). Knowing what I know now and doing what I'm doing now - I'll be keeping this lifestyle for the rest of my days.  But with that comes the fear that I won't meet someone else who is as health conscious as I am now. I've been on the receiving end of this topic and it fucking hurts. Sorry I don't have an answer for you, it's a tough thing to bring up.      And I know, who will sit on the Iron Throne."  Woah that's a massive deal! How did I find this quote like 5 comments down   Interesting idea, but we see at the end how he shuts the lights off his bike, we can see his face, it seems like he suddenly gets frustrated. Frustrated because he doesn't have the guts to commit to suicide? Or perhaps (following your impression) frustrated because he can't match this mysterious rush he is trying to replicate.    How likely is it that a guy that age and in that kind of shape is impotent?  PTSD can manifest with impotence, it can also manifest with hypersexuality. I like the gay angle (phrasing?), it could be both.    So going into this episode I was concerned about Taylor Kitsch's character. The pilot has alleviated those concerns. He was the character I most empathised with.  I have a sneaking suspicion that this bribery lie will come back to bite him in the arse. To us, we can see that he most likely didn't accept the sexual bribe (since he cant get it up), but he's probably going to have to accept the potential consequences of the accusation **or** he will have to prove that he couldn't have done it due to his impotence.  I loved the pilot, I'm so fucking amp'd for the rest of the season.  Edit: Alleviated not elevated lol   Thread's over boys, who wants some candy?   Hahaha I remember that feeling. I was like "Woah, what the hell is that. What ever I'm doing feels so much better".   I had the same condom break issue, when I told my dad he asked me "How can you break a condom? Doesn't the smell of burning rubber tell you that you should slow down?"  Thanks dad, I'm a 17 year old having a freak out and you're joking around.   Because Fathers day is still months away.

Season 2 is airing shortly :)    That's why I never let a guy choose where to finish. You can't sticky me without my consent!  /r/nocontext    You're right, I've found there is a middle ground though. I've looked at all of the food I love and I know the rough calories for them. With that knowlege I make mental guestimations for my daily meals.  I'm 40 lbs down in 15 weeks without doing daily accurate counting.  This isn't for everyone, but I'm a slave to routine, so it's just what I find easiest.   I was thinking something similar when I saw that doco. I think their point was that sugar is the culprit, when copious amounts is consumed. A donut here and there isn't going to fuck up your weight loss efforts (you're the case in point). But those who have shit loads of sugar in their diet will feel the effects described in the doco.   I found out that a close family memeber was into inter racial preggo porn.   yeesh.   Yeah, when I said 'nothing' I didn't mean literally not moving haha  I still went out and did stuff. I just didn't alot any time for strenuous exercise :)   When I was 12 I accidentally stole a penguin eraser. I was in a souvenir shop and I accidentally bumped into a shelf which had all of these novelty erasers on them. I turned to try to catch what ever I had knocked over. But as I looked down, I saw nothing fall. I was sure something fell.  Anyway, fast forward 25 minutes on the next leg of our drive. I reached into my jacket's side pocket and found a penguin eraser. Turns out my subconscious is a slight of hand master and when I bumped into the shelf, the eraser fell perfectly into my jacket pocket.   Yes, I have had a boring and legal life.   Hi. I'm a 27 year old Australian. We have had fluoride introduced to our water systems since the 70s. I'm part of the first generation to be brought up on it.   I don't know of a single person in my generation who has teeth problems. There are some (mainly who don't do any dental care), but most of us have strong and healthy teeth. Look at the baby boomer generation by comparison.  Fluoride addition has saved the average person hundreds and thousands of dollars worth of dental bills.    Nonsense, it's not a fucking waste. The pron industry (which we **all** love) has been gutted by piracy. I pay for a sub because I wan't to support the companies so that legit companies don't go under (giggity).  That's like saying "Paying for HBO is such a waste, just torrent".   Ever had onion salad? That shit is amazing and there is no lettuce to be found.  How it's made? Chop a bunch of onions and tomatoes, mix them in a bowel with a dressing made of vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper.  You'll be tasting the deliciousness with every burp for weeks.  Warning, only eat when single and not wanting a relationship.   I should clarify. I exercise on the weekends. Friday-Sunday. So I do vigorous sessions all 3 days. The past week I added extra days worth of work on tuesday and wednesday so by the time it hit the weekend I had been working out 5 out of the 7 past days.        My work schedule is flexible, I can start when I want as long as I do my 8.5 hours.  So I've found that it's much better to start at 7am to finish at 3:30pm. Having those extra hours before dinner is amazing.    Why not just plain water? None of those drinks actually refresh you as much as ice cold water   I get that, to a degree. It's healthy to have apprehension towards foods that's you know are high in calories. It can however be ok to have a little bit of those types of foods every now and again.  I remember feeling a moment of sadness when I saw how many calories were in a short stack of pancakes with ice cream and maple syrup. It had been years since I've had that, but it all hit me that I won't be eating that stuff for a while.  I guess you don't know what you've got till it's gone.   Another week, another loss. 40 lbs down in 15 weeks :)  But that's not the main reason I'm posting. I'm also posting to remind everyone to **take a day off once in a while from exercising** .  For the past few weeks I've kinda gotten a bit obsessed with getting into shape, so much so that I was not really giving my body a chance to recover. So what did I do yesterday as far as exercise is concerned? Absolutely nothing and it felt great. Having an exercise cheat day is as helpful for the soul as having a cheat meal is for a diet.  I'm giving myself a day or so of rest, then it's back on the horse!  **Edit:** For the sake of clarity, I exercise on the weekends. Friday through Sunday. What brought on this break was adding extra days during last week. This meant by the time it hit yesterday (Sunday), I've been at the gym almost everyday. I could tell my body needed a break. So when I say *take a day off*, I mean take a day (that you would otherwise be exercising on) off.     and I get the smugness of getting him off.  I love that this quality is shared between the genders.

It was a rather contentious issue with my last relationship and I'm suspecting my weight was largely related.  How has your loss affected you?   Totally, for me my last break up was clean as fuck. Literally I broke it off with her, we had a mature and adult discussion about it. I then left and we've not spoken since.  It was truly bizarre. What I did notice though. I felt 10000000x times better after doing it.  I'm now 100% sure that staying in a relationship that you don't want to be in is bad for you.   I so was committed to my indifference that I honestly couldn't tell you.  It would've just been awkward if we spoke TBH, we've not spoken since the break up.   I can't even fathom being back in onederland. 5'9 SW:285 CW:247.  I'm going to try to get there before 2016 :)   A 2014 series called Manhattan. It's incredible.. I've watched through it twice now and season 2 should be airing shortly.  It's a period drama set in the Manhattan Project, there is some artistic licence but it's mainly about the struggles of two different types of atom bombs. It has intrigue, science and great dialogue.   Definitely check it out.   It happened recently actually, I just pretended I didn't notice her and keep walking.

I was in China a few years ago. I took a day trip and was bullshitting with the other people in the group.  I mentioned I was from Belleville and the first thing they said  was oh,  where they used to brew Stag? Fucking surreal.  Literally as far away from home as I can possibly be and the first thing people think of when I say Belleville is Stag.   Its funny because he has aids.

When you assume there's only one god, you're assuming the truth of at least one religion  Not so. Why couldnt each culture find its own expression of something universal that is beyond all of them? If you want to look at it in a narrow way I suppose you could say that makes all of them wrong, but I think it makes more sense to consider all of them right. I refer you to my own comment above:   If lots of religions root their traditions in divine origin then one of the things that is common of religions is that they claim diving origin. Religions are cultural-linguistic traditions through which wisdom traditions are able to gain traction in and be transmitted through history. Religions reflect the culture and language from which they are born, and if they are around long enough, which they become. Lots of cultures means lots of religions. Some religions are monotheistic, some polytheistic, some pantheistic, some henotheistic. It is not uncommon for a religion that is one of these now to have been something else in the past. It is the nature of culture and language to evolve and progress and concepts of god evolve right along with them. To address your question more directly, many Christians refer to John 14:6 I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. to claim exclusivity. But many theologians simply ask the question. if Jesus is the way, what is the way that Jesus is? meaning that Jesus could be the incarnation of the way just as he is the incarnation of the word but that the way is not an exclusive path but a universal one that is accessible through all of the worlds religious traditions.

             Shudder, memories of that high school friend who would get pissed off that his favorite metal band wasn't getting any attention and then called them sell outs when they finally started selling lots of records and getting videos on MTV.   I enjoyed the segment, I thought it was weird that she was going to be on the show, not sure that the NPR demographic includes many people who will buy her selfie book, but I guess her publicists felt it was a good idea for her to give it a shot.   I had totally forgotten about these commercials until I listened to Constance Zimmer on Marc Maron's WTF podcast from the other week. She played the daughter in these commercials.   I had the version that was made for Sears, loved playing those games, such better graphics than Atari.      But True Detective is starting this weekend. That new show that starts this weekend, Brink, also looks good.   I tend to wait after a movie is over, just to let the crowd thin out.

Do you know how much of the building is currently occupied?

Ultimately, he turned the pistol over to the deputies.      The bulk of the first half of this long form commercial was shot in Houston. The circular skywalk, that was originally built for the now bankrupt Enron.         I can only imagine. If memory serves, one of the buildings wasn't even finished until after Enron filed for bankruptcy.

To me, the issue is that she didn't just identify as a certain race, she represented herself in such a way so as to obtain a position where she was the local representative for NAACP. It's not like Bruce Jenner dressed as a woman in order to trick people into giving him the job as the local representative for NOW.   My comfort book is one that goes back to one I was a kid in the 1980s. It's Daniel Pinkwater's "Lizard Music," which was published in 1976. It always takes me back to carefree summer days, and staying up late, watching bad tv, when you were supposed to be asleep.      Blaze Starr was a burlesque dancer who had an affair with Louisiana Governor Earl K. Long, but, more importantly, inspired filmmaker John Waters and drag queen/actor Divine.

I don't remember anyone like her doing the traffic when I was in high school, sigh . . .       I'll stick to looting in the Galleria, it has air conditioning.   Been raining in Alief, on and off most of the morning but for the past hour or so it has been a fairly steady, but light to moderate rain. Though, as I was about to hit save, it just got significantly heavier.   After Ike, it took a week to get my power back on, thankfully I listened and was prepared, wasn't fun, but could have been a lot worse.   I've seen some pictures on twitter of the water getting over the boardwalk, so Seabrook seems to be getting a bit of storm surge too.   I just drove a couple bridges over Keegans Bayou, which is near, thankfully, it is nowhere near as high as the one in your picture.   I like Rachel and Britta too . . , but Jennifer is why I watch traffic even though I usually leave so early traffic is not an issue.

Agree to disagree      Section 8 is a federal housing program for low income people, considering that, at the national level, race and the income gap have been big political issues, I believe this is about current US politics, especially with a presidential election in 2016 and the fact that people in the Elizabeth Warren camp are going to force the Democrats to address these issues.   That's the best "Bill" I've seen.   Let's not forget the German, Czech, and Polish cultural influences in Texas, or that a lot of the old big ranches were started by ScotIrish.

I went to a Walmart around 9 this morning to get batteries and the places was already getting super busy with the water buyers.   A lot of garages for the smaller office buildings (like on Bering in the Galleria area and those office building clusters along the Beltway) are your best bets because they rarely have require parking cards or payment for parking.      It sounds like there is a low pressure system in the area, so I suspect, but I'm no expert, that the possibility for tornadoes will come when the tropical storm hits the low pressure system.   Think of this like the Memorial Day rain, but more widespread, with some stronger wind, and some possible tornadoes. And, it may last well into Wednesday.

Also reminds me of this old, old piece from This American Life about doing a comedy set at a prison - http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/119/lockup?act=4   Saw this on the news this morning, I feel bad for the guy, but really feel bad for that dog.   I can honestly say this is the first police Hummer I've ever seen. Based on the posts over there, looks like it was confiscated. The only LEO in Houston I've seen with a decal saying it was confiscated was a really beat old Ford F150, I actually felt bad for the Constable who had to drive it.      Constable Precinct One   Well, this vehicle, which had Constable ID on dash and was parked in the Harris County fleet fuel depot this morning, indicates otherwise (and I've seen Ghost Constable vehicles in Alief with regular Texas plates too).    I'm not trying to incite outrage. In the past, there have been discussion about whether or not a certain vehicle someone has seen was LEO. A lot of people are under the misconception that all LEO vehicles in Texas have "Exempt" plates, I've always maintained that is not the case, and I'm posting this picture so as to educate people here on the issue. I actually went downtown to get pictures for /r/policevehicles - and happened to see this one parked in the Harris County fleet fuel depot.      I've listened to NPR since the late 1980s, and haven't felt any burn out. But, I don't listen to it exclusively. In the mornings I mix my Morning Edition with local sports talk radio and sometimes Howard Stern. During the middle of the day I listen to podcasts of my favorite NPR shows or stream the music oriented WFUV out of The Bronx. I love ATC and Marketplace in the late afternoons and on the drive home. Compared to most other news media out there, NPR still serves up better news coverage of national events and world events. The other "news" radio station in Houston is just a delivery vehicle for Fox.   Is it David Sedarises or David Sedari - that was one of my favorite NPR related shout-outs in Season 3.            It's more an issue of the license plates, there's a belief that all law enforcement vehicles in Texas have "Exempt" license plates, but that's not always the case.

They (or their taxidermist) can possess and sell a gallbladder (often with license/permit) attached only to those licensed to buy gallbladders. I get the impression that a lot of licensed bear hunters just destroy the gallbladder at the site of the kill so as not to accidentally run afoul of the laws.      Good time for a bathroom break.   I had always suspected that Chang was a Snakehead. But, her being involved in the illegal market for endangered animal parts makes sense too, that's crime with a big federal nexus, though many states, especially California, have applicable state laws too. [In fact that NatGeo show Wild Justice did an episode centered around Game Wardens in San Francisco's Chinatown.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3211848/)   The federal government has major crimes jurisdiction over Indian Reservations in non-PL 280 States (though there are exceptions). I remember one Native American activist (probably Russell Means or John Trudell, or could have been Leonard Peltier) saying that the federal correction system is the biggest Indian Reservation in the United States. Litchfield is part of the federal system so while it could get Natives from any Rez across the country, there are several nearby in New York and New England. I'm pretty certain that there are way more Native males in the system than Native females, but, plenty of Native women end up behind bars for the same reasons the current inmates of Litchfield are there. I've done a little work on accommodating the religious needs of Native inmates, and I'd just like to see OITNB address, even to a slight degree, the existence of Natives in the federal system.  EDIT: TL;DR - Because of Federal Jurisdictional Issues, OITNB should have Native American prisoners.   Bunk beds, buses of inmates, next season will really up the ante on the debate of the privatization of prisons in the United States. Not a fan of privatization, I look forward to how things play out.  	199

It has become clear that there is an important eukaryotic component to the gut microbiome of ruminant mammals, mainly in the form of anaerobic fungi and protozoa. However, when we talk about the human intestinal microbiome we always hear about bacteria. My two questions are: Are there eukaryotes in the human gut microbiome? If so, do they play an important role, with potential clinical implications?       The process by which the medication was made available to Brantly and Writebol is highly unusual. It may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's "compassionate use" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. Getting approval for compassionate use is often long and laborious.   A sad fact is we're looking at years if not decades before this treatment is approved for widespread use after the requisite clinical trials, and even then it may be prohibitively expensive for use in Africa. I may be proven wrong, but I don't see it being distributed to the hundreds of sick in the current outbreak.          Seems to be so. Comments in the article and /u/arrc clear that up.

He says he was following orders and has frequent nightmares about the incident, but these parts stand out, there are many coping mechanisms for the unthinkable or inexplicable:    But some Russians still believe no passengers were on board on the Korean Air Lines' jumbo, including Osipovich's wife Lyudmila.   Lyudmila, 67, told Kyodo News that her husband did nothing wrong, claiming the United States has woven a false story and that no passengers were on board.   But Osipovich said he saw only the South Korean plane and no U.S. military planes, and that he is sure there were passengers on the plane.   I imagine the flight data recorder could in theory be used to determine the *direction* of the missile's impact, based on tiny differences in the times certain components failed.

It also isn't sad though, at least not in Mexican culture. Death is a happy thing, and celebrated on holidays like `Day of the Dead` so maybe it isn't taken to hard in their family. People saying they are assholes seem to be pretty quick to judge, and are telling you what you want to hear.   It currently is very difficult to make a recipe that is complex and robust. Sometimes, it is even harder to link recipes with events that you want to happen because it is a three step process where the middle step is disjoint from the final step.   I wanted to have a recipe that every day at 12:30 PM grabbed the top post from a subreddit and posted it to the GroupMe. Now, I may be wrong - but I did look around and can't really think of a way to do this. However, if there was a way to make IFTTT recipes a trigger, it would really open up the possibilities for this. It would allow for hugely extensible recipes that could do huge amounts of work for you or even just provide some really cool functionality. Just a thought.  If someone knows how to do what I'm asking I would love to know since right now I'm pretty lost.  	4
 Nice one!!!   Sally looks great...the depression `suits` her    Hey, thanks a lot! You are too kind!                  I believe I did mention my source at the end of the blog post! Haven`t you seen it?    I`ve seen it online, you can search it if you like...the video quality is kinda bad..:(   true that!               	15
 brilliant, very well done!    third inning, worst park ever...   ya, they renamed again it in february, but you're right, rangers ballpark sounds better  	3
 gonna try this on my new Ho laptop.    Because I haven't had any issue with my car.   If a self-driving car comes from General Motors I will buy it. No matter how expensive it is.     	4
                                                          Good god, you're like my evil twin in reverse!  I was born in Chicago and escaped to Hawaii as soon as I finished college. Have been going back and forth from Honolulu and Tokyo ever since!   You've got waaaaay too much time on your hands!    This is a shit bot  I'm waiting for the Thisisashitbot to chime in in 5...4...3...   Thank goodness!   ?   Maybe:~)    Or large predators!  ?  Ever been in a club in Waikiki?    The hiking meetups are low-key and well worth your time to make.  If you suddenly notice a very strange new face in the next few months...don't panic. Just move away slowly and keep your hands and feet away from it's mouth:~)   Let's say I moved to Chicago and couldn't find a job. All I have to do is to pack everything in the car and drive to the next city over.  In Hawaii, your options are limited and it takes a pretty big chunk of change to get over there, let alone return back to wherever it is you came from if things bottom out.    You can always check /r/hawaiijobs!  I'm there looking in three weeks so please fill this bad boy up!!   Is that smoke from the burning pitchforks I smell?!    My RES  I'm afraid to wonder what you've got me tagged as!   I lurked here at first because, as some of you may know, I've been living between Honolulu and Tokyo for quite some time now, but due to my family situation, most of that time has been spent here in Tokyo.  Don't get me wrong, I love Japan, it's just that I really prefer to be in Hawaii, *especially* when I'm not actually *in* Hawaii!  Yes, Hawaii drives me nuts at times, but that's the difference between living there and just visiting.  Coming here has helped to keep me grounded, still feeling like I'm part of the community.  Even though posting pics was kind of frowned upon when I first started coming here, thankfully, the community has become more open and flexible to most things Hawaii.  Now, a big change is happening in my life because, unless something majorly bad happens, I'll be coming back to stay from the first week of August.  Because I haven't actually been living full time in Hawaii, every time I went back there, I never went on the internet, spent most of my time in the water and/or walking around.  Now, I hope to balance things out a bit and I hope to become more of an irregular regular here. I want to give back those feel-goods to those of you who are lurking and wished they were actually in Hawaii.                      May I play with them?!    Well, if this just doesn't sound like a terrible idea with pretty transparent spin control.  Oh? This sentance...  "This information will then be passed on to hotels, restaurants, hospitals **and other institutions in Japan.**"  ...doesn't raise any red flags for me.            Thanks for sharing:~)                   Well I am guilty of having 500 alter accounts.  UniGaseouspartdeux?    I'd get north of a couple thousand hits on a top post.  Sorry, that was me. I...I...I like pushing buttons:~)    Ah, trolls. XD  Not trolls, menehune!    WE DID IT REDDIT!  These words strike fear into the fiercest of Warriors!                                              Ok, I'm in Tokyo right now and it's 34c/93f and we've got about 67% humidity. I'll be back home the first week of August...so...is it possible to ditch the muggy air by then please!!                                                               Thank you /u/moonpurr, /u/hawaiithaibro, and /u/fern420.  As you may already know, I wasn't born in Hawaii and didn't attend school here, so when I first moved here in the 90's, I did my best to read as much as I could about Hawaii and ask everyone as many questions when I could, at the proper times.  I don't try to "be Hawaiian", but I sure as heck try to "be local." And what I mean by that is taking some pride in the fact that my kids were born here, go to school here and we all need to be aware of Hawaii's past, so that we can have some sort of future here.                                Title is directly from the story, it's the first paragraph.   I'm sure you'll be glowing after you spark this up!                                    Do tell, where's this at?            No need to worry, because we would *never* do that to /u/carmabound, right?!     	115
 My friend wants a specific discontinued bath and body works lotion for her Birthday. Breathe Romance. They are super expensive on ebay and I was wondering if there was a good subreddit that I could post and maybe buy a partly used bottle of this stuff for a little cheaper   That really does sound lovely. Our weather isn't cooperating at the moment but I appreciate the thought, Thank you   Your thoughtfulness is very much appreciated and unexpected, thank you. I sent you a message and can't say how nice it was to receive this one   I'm requesting healing and supportive thoughts be sent my way. I'm a strong believer in the power of positive thinking but have not been able to manage it for myself lately. I'll attach a picture and tell a little bit about my situation if that will help any of you focus your intentions.      [Picture](http://imgur.com/SFBN2XA)    I am a 23 year old female living in Oklahoma. A little over a month ago, I was released from the hospital after spending a week in inpatient while they switched my medication around. In the past, I've been diagnosed with something called Borderline Personality disorder, which basically means I have trouble controlling my emotions, especially the intense ones. I ended up in the hospital after breaking it off with my then significant other. Even though this was my choice, it left me feeling out of control and a risk to myself.      Sense being released, I have been physically ill for most of the time and am just now starting to feel like I'm close to getting well. I have had strep, a flu bug and an infection over the course of this last month and am absolutely drained. The people at my job, which I have been at for 7 months, really seem to like me a lot but I know my having to be out for the few days that I had to go to the doctor on top of being out for a week in the hospital have put a strain on things here and I'm not exactly viewed as the most reliable person anymore. My worrying over this has also caused me to lose some much needed focus on my tasks.      I take naps immediately after I get home from work every day and I know it is worrying my roommate, but I am just so tired all the time that I can't help it.      I miss having energy and motivation to do things. I miss being reliable at work. I hate feeling lonely all the time and doing dumb impulsive things in attempt to put a proverbial bandage over that feeling.      I have just completed my orientation process for volunteering a couple shifts each week at the children's hospital and I'm really hoping my severe lack of energy doesn't effect my ability to complete these shifts. Its so important to me to be able to have some kind of interaction with people.      I could really use positive, encouraging and healing thoughts being sent my way.         I don't have a therapist I see anymore, haven't had one for about 3 years. I have decided there isnt much more I can do other than check myself in. Im trying to work up the courage to go but Im really scared. I dont like not knowing how long theyll keep me for   This will be a messy post, I'm sure.   Running on very little sleep the past few days.  Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all.      It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place.      I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions.      I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills.      I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason.      I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before).      I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job.      So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable.      I am not sure what to do.   This will be a messy post, I'm sure.   Running on very little sleep the past few days.  Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female.

I am not sure what to do.     And because I feel like I'm out of plausible options, I'm ready to be done with everything.   Last nights dream was just weird. And scary. I'm not religious and while I do have nightmares a couple times a week (I usually give my anxious mind credit for these) I can usually see why I might be dreaming of a certain thing. But I was feeling pretty good when I went to sleep last night. And it was the most sleep I had gotten in a couple of days so it should have felt good. I have never dreamed of anything like this before. My dreams/nightmares usually have reoccurring themes like zombies, falling from a high place, seeing people I know or things like that so this is quite perplexing to me.  What I remember is being in a dark cavern like place with glowing veins of red running through the rocks, lava maybe. There were thousand of "demons" around me. That's the only way I would describe them. I woke up immediately knowing that. They all looked different. There were no people around, just me and the demons. And a couple of them were trying to communicate with me, to get me to attack or defend myself from others. I got the feeling that I was probably demonic too. We were floating in the cavern, like there was no gravity, but they didn't need it and moved freely in any direction. At one point I was running or fleeing from a group of them. Then after prodding from a few of them, I set thousands of other demons on fire that were surrounding my small group, using my mind.  I have no idea what to make of the dream/nightmare. It was definitely very unsettling.  	10

 i see you are grooming yourself. i think you are clean enough. my turn!    bonded buns together are just about the cutest thing in the universe   That said, there were some rabbits at BunnyFest wearing theirs all day!   That is exactly what she did as soon as I stopped petting her - this picture is taken in the split second between removing my hand and the ear flick ;)   o.m.g.  that is the cutest bunny ever!   Congrats! To many more comfortable, trusting flops!   This is so cool!

Izzy, the REW is trying desperately to get Rox to groom her - while he ignores her and licks his thigh instead.   Pics when you do, please!               One's a word. The other isn't.  Regardless means without regard.  Ir is a prefix usually negating what follows. (ir-responsible, ir-replaceable)  RegardLESS already negates the regard.  IR-regardless would mean NOT regardless. People use it to mean regardless. It isn't a word, and if it were it wouldn't mean what you are trying to use it to say.    And if you are going to have a yard rabbit - be aware that this is a house rabbit community and your decision to keep your rabbit outside will concern the users here and they will speak up about it.   It isn't about being harsh (though it is true people sometimes are) - it all comes from concern for the animals. As someone who volunteers for a rescue and shelter, I have seen rabbits who lived outdoors come in with bites, wounds, mites, infections, nails longer than my fingers, abscesses, urine scald, sore hocks, etc. Some of these conditions are caused by being kept outdoors (mites and predator bites definitely are higher risks for outdoor rabbits) and others are simply let to go on too long because they aren't noticed as the rabbit isn't getting proper attention.   Those of us who have seen the results of people keeping their rabbits outdoors are going to have strong feelings about it. Because it is not pretty - not because we dislike you.   Vet bills for rabbits are expensive as they are seen as an "exotic" pet and require special vets, and the heartache of feeling like you failed your pet or they are sick because of something you could have prevented is just not worth it.   Just make sure you know what you are getting into and are prepared to offer your rabbit a good home for its entire life.     No one has said it yet, so I will. Don't buy a rabbit, adopt one. Check out your local rescues and animal shelters. You can get a perfectly healthy, already fixed rabbit without contributing to breeders (who often are in it for profit and not for the well-being of the animals).   If you don't want a lot of grooming - stay away from lionheads, angoras, woolies, and all the super fuzzy breeds.   Be aware that you will have to brush your rabbit multiple times a week during molt, and that you will need to brush it at least once a week the rest of the time. (Assuming it is not a fuzzy breed)  Dwarf breeds are smaller when they are older - but come with higher risk for certain health problems. If you are looking for low maintenance a big red eyed white may be a safer bet.   And please, read up on rabbits. They really are safer and more comfortable indoors. There are a lot of reasons and u/vgr1 already linked you to a great video detailing them.  This is not me saying you are just going to throw it out there and ignore it - but that doesn't change the fact that they are safer indoors.   Rabbits do require a good amount of caring for. You won't find a breed that doesn't unless you find a colony of wild cottontails to relocate to your yard.   One huge reason it is good to have your rabbit indoors is because you notice things more quickly. Rabbits live on a sped up timeline - they can be fine today, not eat tonight, and die tomorrow. If your rabbit is living in the same space as you it is far more likely you will notice the change and get them to a vet. This also speaks to the amount of care they require - as a prey animal they try to hide their illness. In prey species - signs of weakness make you a target for predators. You need to be paying close attention to your pet in order to see changes in behavior or physical changes that signify major problems (and sometimes problems that can kill your pet within 24 hours). Rabbits in general don't require a ton of grooming - brushing once a week and a nail trim every 6 weeks - but they do require a lot of attention that they may not get in the backyard.   Check out some of the articles, research proper care, and when you are ready, adopt - don't buy.    :D   Vet like everyone says.   But for the record - bathing a rabbit with urine stains all over is not bad. Usually you would use just water or very very mild soap with no fragrance, and only wash the butt, gently because the skin is sensitive from urine scald - but we do this all the time with rabbits whose bottoms are urine-soaked as the urine needs to be washed off or it will continue to burn the skin.    He doesn't actually bite ;)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq8Ac2nAXJA  (his shelter name was Herschel, I assure you this is Squishy)   wtf is a cylinder fruit?   I like it - what is the point of the huge pot of soil at the bottom though? Is it only there to make the post stand?   Spending a few grand on a whole new wardrobe   I think your bunny looks cute. I love the curved bun! I call mine a croissant when he sleeps like that. Yours has its eye wide open, too - not so dead looking.    Mine look pretty dead, too. That said, dead-looking can be scary at first, but kind of cute in that they are willing to be super vulnerable and are clearly at home in their environment.   https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/1621842_256824737821983_120758305_n.jpg  https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/t1.0-9/q71/s720x720/1209135_197527637085027_708437528_n.jpg   It blows my mind that people will watch people be horrible parents on TV. How is it okay for these parents to behave like this in the first place? And why are we okay enough with it that we will watch it as entertainment, encouraging the behavior? (Toddlers in Tiaras, Dance Moms, that kinda stuff)    do it anyway   we use pine pellet horse bedding. Similar to wood stove pellets but I think they restrict the wood used a little more. The kiln process burns off any harmful phenols that wood shaving litter contains.   it is $10 for a 40 lb bag where I live, but if you are in an area with agriculture and horses it can be $5 for the same bag.   They are really absorbent and the odor isn't bad. You do have to change your litter every 2-3 days to keep odor down, with any litter.   We have 4 rabbits, 2 are a bonded pair that took about 2 weeks to get solid enough we were comfortable leaving them alone together (actually probably could have done it sooner but we were careful), and 2 we have been trying to bond for a year.   The 2 that we are trying to bond - They get along well in close quarters and cuddling on a lap, but any attempts to have them play together or hang out in a small neutral space they get nippy and sometimes fight. We can't house them together because of this, but they do live in side by side pens. They will often flop next to each other and nose each other through the bars. They look like they are chatting sometimes. It is clear to us that although they aren't "bonded" and we can't leave them alone together, they get something out of the relationship and would probably be lonely were we to separate them or put a solid barrier between their separator bars.  Background: We had walter, chose gwen, did a test bonding with our rescue that went well so we adopted her and started doing bonding at home.  I would definitely be aware that this scenario may happen. Bonding buns is an active process that takes patience and some rabbits just don't get along.   Our other rabbits - we adopted rox after fostering him because we fell in love. Having 3 single rabbits we tried some 3 way bonding which seemed to get walter and gwen a little closer and they both hated rox. We ended up taking rox to an adoption show to meet other rabbits and the first one he met they were grooming each other within the half hour we were sitting with them. we adopted Izzy and brought her home and worked daily with them - with a totally different approach. We worked with them IN their pen - and put a divider up when we weren't doing bonding. There were no problems with them ever and I think they were just a good match.  So, with this pair, Rox had been the original rabbit. He had been dumped at the shelter by his family and I think had some abandonment issues. He clung to me, licked me, humped me, circled me - part of how he won a place in our home :-p Once Izzy was in the picture, Rox mellowed WAY out. He still cuddles me and licks me some, but he is nowhere near as needy and seems more confident. Izzy is a huge lover and our most affectionate rabbit and I know she loves having him for a mate.  Basically, I think all of our rabbits get a lot from having other rabbits in their life. Rox and Izzy are definitely the shining example as he has changed so much for the better with her, and she just loves loving too much to be alone. Even Walter and Gwen seem to enjoy each others company.  I would be aware that if you are able to bond them it is easier as you have one set of dishes, one pen, one litter box. And I would be aware that it may take a while to get there. Be prepared to care for two separate rabbits if you decide to adopt, and take advantage of any matchmaking your local rescue may do. If you let your rabbit pick his friend it will make it much easier on you.    http://imgur.com/KqJxJSo   Unfortunately "on-hand" is as good as a "Free Bunnies!" craigslist ad away :-/ It was probably intended as a joke that you wouldn't actually have bunnies on hand, but putting the idea to add a rabbit to your basket in people's heads is the opposite of what we work for. "Add a bunny if you're prepared for the 10-year commitment" would be more acceptable.   	32

 Best Juri I've ever seen. No wonder he annihilated Daigo at Evo.

 Um no sir that is a rabbit. Sir...   Its for defrosting the restless souls of the damned probably. Might as well just harvest them fresh though so they don't have that weird freezer taste.   Nah dude it was probably just Jimmy Fallon doing an impression of Bigfoot impersonating a bear. Classic Jimmy.   Slartibartfast has outdone himself this time.   Wait so dragons' veins aren't actually that color?   Tulips are too cold.   Oh yeah well my dog is an honors student.  Even brag about it on my bumper sticker   As if it didn't look awesome enough in photos. I was next to one yesterday in white and it is absolutely stunning in real life.   Its pronounced "MOOLtipass"   My old boxer used to creep into the room, grab a sock and sprint off into the sunset with it. One time she was running round with 2 dollars in her mouth and nobody knew where shed taken it from.   Feeding bells will ring  Dingalingaling dingalingaling  And we'll give him some krill-ahh   I've been to reefs in 5 different countries and spent a week in a compound in Belize surveying one. And if I wasn't going into medicine I might have done marine biology. As for captive raising, eels are sedentary and the only reason they will even leave their burrow is to hunt so if the eel is placed in a tank with sufficient burrowing space and fed properly then it is irrelevant whether the burrow is in a tank or in the ocean or on the moon because it will not leave. I'm going to quit arguing here though because I know you're just going to keep nitpicking.   Please don't tell my dad. I don't want to get the belt again   I can't tell if you're trolling but he was captive bred and moved to a 500 gallon tank when he got too big. Keeping a saltwater aquarium isn't like keeping a hamster. It costs easily thousands and is an enormous time commitment and the people who are dedicated enough to get into it have actually contributed hugely to our understanding and awareness of coral reefs so maybe next time do your research before spouting bullshit about "horrible industry" and accusing people of not knowing what they are doing when you're the one who clearly has no idea what you're talking about.   Saw him at the pet store and told the guy "I need this"   I had a moray eel that I had to give up because he was way too big. He seemed thrilled with his new home which was 25 times bigger. I always wonder how he's doing since those guys live for like 40 years   It looks like one of those cheap airbrushings you get at like sea world. So cool on an actual animal though   I always wish I didn't have a warranty do that I could do stuff to it without feeling bad but then I remember I'm broke.   I've never seen a street car that could make army green look good until I saw a c7 do it. Its like blake lively. You could throw a clown suit on it and it'd still make my heart flutter.   They are messy as hell and lose their minds if the tank is too small. I'd have 1 in there tops   When you think a 2015 stingray is ugly your opinion is wrong.

I love the guys laugh at the end too. AHH HAH. OH HAH. HUH. UHHUH. HAH. WOHHHAH. WOO!   you sound le rad   Easier and more environmentally friendly to just harvest my beer and Mexican food shits and use that instead   Do you mean Jon snuhh?   You betta put a lid in there so it doesn't happen again   (    )   ^ literally this   you literally just read my mind.   Squirrel cat?   DAE le girlfriend?   More specifically, an amphipod eating all the crap in your tank is good because it prevents bacteria from getting at it and turning it into ammonia. Anything that slows down the decay process is good.   The water looks very cloudy. Either your filter is too high above the tank and its producing too many microbubbles or your phosphates or nitrates are off. The odds of a hitchhiker killing fish are almost 0 unless you get very unlucky and have tiny fish.   You're uh... You're beautiful...   Can you see Texas from your high horse?

Its OK for the dart but on a muscle car *cough* charger *cough* I really do not like it at all :(   Its a superveloce AND its Illini colors? This boner is going straight to the moon.   Make that 98,61*6*   If these literally grow on the ground then why am I still using a 6 year old athlon 2 in my pc   Nah man she's just wearing a really small softball mitt   As someone who has spent 24 years and counting in order to become a proper physician, this shit makes me physically ill.   I dunno man. Judging by its thick fur and adorable floppy ears I'd say this kind of rabbit runs wild in the fields of my heart.   Well maybe you should be more on top of things. God.   What medium?

 That is the BEST way to meet new people at shows! I had the same thing happen to me durong Wolfgang Gartners show here in Canada and I met a group of 4 really awesome guys and rahed with them for the entire night, now we go to a lot of events together! I hope the two of you are still raging g on together :) I love the story!   Epic pic haha! I love thay you introduced her to it and she ended up loving it, its so great when things work out perfectly like that :) im happy for you two, keep in keepin on :)   i was there and LOVED his set. No top 40 crap, lots of dirty house beats and he was a lot of fun to watch. So happy doing what he was doing. What did you think?   So happy to see best friends posted!! I think it's a really good idea to use a festival as your reason to meet up, that works perfectly and totally makes it worth traveling for both of you :) i hope you guys keep raging together, you look like you have a lot of fun and i love to see that! Don't lose that with each other. Peace and love dear! :)   very cute! love the collage and your outfit :)   congrats on the happy love story, that's a story book way to meet, but with a little rave in there ;) haha. You two are cute, and obviously comfortable together. Keep it up! Love and happiness :)   http://imgur.com/RXojNsE  I feel like we dont really SEE enough of eachother here! A huge part of why I rave is to get to know a completely diverse group of people in a different setting. Its like we all become the same for a night but so many people have completely different stories! So I encourage all of you to post a pic with you and your favourite rave partner, ive post one of myself and my boyfriend to get us started! You can post a friend, boyfriend/girlfriend, or even a family member if youvhappen to be that lucky!  I also think it would be great if you posted a little blurb on how you met eachother/started raving together and what has made them so significant to you :) it'll be a little bit like a show and tell about your personal rave story! Alright go!   i tried to give 3 levels of done up, the first one is like full going out kinda makeup, the second is none and the 3rd is just mascara and bronzer   the one of me without makeup? I dunno i don't take many pictures of myself i have like none of my body too. Not sure what to put up here   Wow! That is extremely well done!! I have no idea how you made it look a little different on each side but that's really really great! :) thank you so much you can barely tell it was photoshopped at all.  Edit: a word      He walked in eating a cheeseburger hahaha   Of course! But my boyfriend didnt take a picture in time   In Oshawa Ontario!      	15
 I'd probably pick Megan Salinas.   I am banned from /r/offmychest for complaining that criminal foreigners who come here only to do crime, are giving the rest of us minorities a bad reputation. Apparently, that's racist to say.      I don't know. We should probably ask him.   Here's another advice: Live in the USA where all the girls on this subreddit are from as well.   I live in one of the largest cities in my country yet tinder constantly shows me girls far away like 20+ miles outside of my city. I've tried to set the distance to 10 miles in settings yet it still shows me people 20-30 miles away.   Well it's always hard to give a transliteration, especially when the Swedish "j" is unique from many other languages like English. When it comes to the "j", I usually pronounce it like an "i" so that was why I added it.  In my opinion all 3 transliterations can be correct. Really depends on what type of dialect you refer to as well. But it's not like I meant for this post to be something insanely serious anyway. :)         Hjem-Is er racister!! De ngter at slge til indvandrere!! (sarkasme)    Even historically the Islamic empires did not favor forcible conversion (the European Christians were all about that though).  It's like you've never opened a history book before.   Norway and Scandinavian countries in general are very great to live in with lots of security.  As a Danish person who has lived all his life in Denmark (which is pretty much the same as Norway) I can say that I've thought many times about moving away from Scandinavia, especially to the US.  Yeah, it's true that statistically speaking Scandinavian countries might be superior to the US, but I feel that in the end personal subjectivity plays an even bigger part. Some people will love Scandinavian countries, others will hate them. I'm not too fond of Scandinavian countries.  My biggest pet peevees about my country is that people are very cold and not open to meeting new people. When I studied abroad in the US it was very easy to talk to new people or even other people coming up to you and talk to you. I never really felt alone there. In Denmark though, it's a constant battle with loneliness because people prefer to keep to themselves.  I also dislike the socialist aspect of Scandinavian society where almost half of my salary goes to taxes. I mean sure, it gives us free education and healthcare, but that also means that our education and healthcare has zero flexibility and is in total control of the bureaucracy.  But those are just my personal opinions. You should come here for a few months and experience it for yourself. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it. I've met both people who love this place and others who hate it.   Sweden would probably support this. They need all the land they can get to take in as many refugees as possible.   I thought we agreed on boycotting FIFA? Or did we stop caring after two days? I fucking hate you people.   Maybe the way he said it was really stupid, but I agree with him in that we should focus on getting good immigrants who are able to do jobs we need and make sure people who have a long crime history never get allowed in.   I don't CTRL V but I've seen many people here do that which is why I pointed it out.  Throughout the time I've spent here I've tried short messages, long elaborate messages, jokes, serious messages, etc etc.  I just feel like IRL makes it much easier and gives a better chance at success. At the very least people who don't have much success here should give a local party a try and actually talk to a girl when they're there. They also won't have to xompete with hundreds of other guys trying to get her attention at the same time like here on r4r.   I actually disagree. When you message a girl here, you're competing with hundreds of other guys messaging her at the same time.  When you walk up to a girl irl you have 2-5 min of her attention to advertise yourself and with a little practice that can easily be turned into 30 minutes or 1 hour which can be turned in to a date with practice.   I can see the appeal if you travel a lot. I just think that there are people who are static though and might be better off stopping with the online searches.   I agree with all your points. That's also why I think that it's better to just go out and meet people. I feel like you're able to show more of your qualities in person than just based off text ans maybe my texting is so boring that I was better off staying away from it.  If just one person decides to go out and meet people instead of spending another night on r4r I feel like my post has been worth it lol   For some disabled people or others in special situations this place can be great.  But I think that there are still many people who would be better off not spending energy on services like this. I feel that many people like me think that this is a much easier and effective way of meeting new people. Why spend half an hour getting ready and then spend money going to places and having to deal with body languages and all other pressure at parties when I can just sit at home half naked in my bed with a bag of doritos and CTRL + V a bunch of messages to people on r4r?  I feel like some people like me just needed to grow some balls and just go out and do it and realize it's not really that bad out there and that it can be much easier just talking to a girl than sitting at home hitting f5 wishing you are one of those lucky guys that hit jackpot and gets to have a 1 hour chat with a girl until she gets bored and stops responding back.   Kinda. I'm upset that I didn't do this a year ago instead of spending hours looking at r4r posts lol   Honestly, no offense to the mods here or anyone loyal to this subreddit... But after having spent a year here and haven't gone past a 1 week conversation, I feel like I can conclude this is a complete and utter waste of time.  It's one thing to never receive a reply from someone that you message. That's just how it is. But I feel like the biggest kick in the nuts is when you have a conversation going and after a few hours they stop the conversation. It happens way too often.  About a month ago I wen't out with my friends instead to a party. Something I rarely do. I manned up and decided to go and talk to a girl there I thought was cute. Guess who has had a girlfriend for a month so far?  My point is there are so many better and imo easier ways to connect with somebody else. I feel like this has been a complete waste of time and I've gotten nothing out of it yet had I jusy focused my time and energy other places like local parties, I'd have been better off.  Sorry about this little rant. Just feel like this whole online relationship and friendship things are the worst. Good luck to anyone out there still searching.  	22

 I don't condone racism from from anyone.  Are the people posted about here racist? Yes.  Is that wrong? Yes. Does that cancel out other people's racism? No.   What are you talking about?  Are you implying that I hate people on this subreddit?  I'm an active participant in this subreddit and I want to see it be the best that it can be.   Respectfully disagree.    contrary examples are hard to find and they are  On this subreddit, yes. Not in the world.    they are only human afterall  at least you concede that!    but what with seemingly 9/10 jews claiming to be irreligious or atheist  Are you saying that being religious is necessary for being ethical? Because there are quite a lot of contrary examples of that as well.  Yes, it is complicated.  "Jews" means a lot of different things to different people.  Basically my point is, you can't pigeonhole people. If you go around assuming things about people and treating them based off of your ASSUMPTIONS about them, it's not only incredibly hurtful to people who don't deserve your scorn, but you are also missing out on some potential allies.  So you don't like racism right?  I'll leave you with the word's the late great MJ: If you want to make the world a better place Take a look at yourself, and then make a change    Yes, it took me about 2 minutes of searching Google.  There are actually millions of stories of jews acting compassionately and peacefully.  I posted the wikipedia article to illustrate that it's actually something that's part of the religion.  Do you admit that you might have a slight confirmation bias when it comes to this?   I certainly don't have a geocentric view of the world.  Rather, the center is everywhere.  Also, the shift in my view wasn't based solely on scientific discovery, though it certainly played a part.  I think most importantly was the profound feelings of connection I felt that I couldn't easily rationalize away (and really I no longer have any desire to rationalize these things away).  I guess I really don't understand why some people try so hard to remove all sense of magic from the world.  Is that really the world you want to live in?   I don't think you are actually interested in seeing evidence contrary to your preexisting beliefs.  You are automatically downvoting my responses to the questions that YOU asked.   If you want to see the source, how hard is it to look at the references section?   http://forward.com/articles/202796/jews-march-in-new-york-rally-against-israel-war-in/  http://forward.com/articles/202897/thousands-of-israelis-protest-gaza-war-in-rare-out/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_peace   At the end of the day, there are many things that we don't KNOW.  So where do go from there?  We kind of fill in the blanks.  You can be agnostic about these things, and that's honorable, but sometimes entertaining a belief that you are not 100% sure of is not only harmless, but useful.  For instance, you might not be sure that you can run a marathon.  But you harbor this belief in yourself that you can, and this causes you to push yourself and train, and then lo and behold! you ran a marathon!  I think many things work this way.  Our thoughts actually create our reality.  I don't believe in objective truth and the process of belief to me is very much a creative one.   It absolutely led me to believe that my view of the world was too simplistic.  Part of that was realizing that a simple rejection of any notion of spirituality or connection to something larger than myself was too simplistic.  I accept that there is a whole lot that we don't know.  We will continue to learn more and more about the universe and our place in it.  I don't know if we will ever have a definitive answer to these really big questions, and for the moment I have to rely on what I *intuit* and what feels the best.  It seems to me like a lot of atheist are really uncomfortable with the idea of CHOOSING to believe something, but I think if they took a good look at their own thought process, they would realize they are doing the exact same thing.    There isn't actually any proof that our minds extend further than inside our physical brain. That's wishful thinking just like believing in God  There isn't any proof that they don't either.  So you CHOOSE to believe what you want just as I choose to believe what I want.  My world view happens to be more fun and useful for me personally.   Try mushrooms. In a comfortable setting (preferably outdoors), with people you trust, in a good head space, at a low dose.     Realistically, that probably won't happen, so my career plan at the moment for the future is to be a dietician.  I've got to stop you right there.  I was nodding my head through your entire post enthusiastically until I read this line.  You need to understand that you are the creator of your own destiny.  The cliche "whether you believe you can or can't, you're right" stands here.  Study and become a dietician if this makes you happy, it's a great thing to do, but never subjugate your dreams for something more "realistic".  Check out [/r/lawofattraction](http://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction)    I am an ex-atheist. I know what atheism is, I was very proud to ascribe this label to myself between the ages of 13 til about 18. I didn't call myself agnostic, I was sure. I took a completely mechanical, deterministic view of the universe. Everything was simply an unfolding of chemical reactions since the Big Bang and in that universe, there is no room for free will, let alone "God".  So what changed? Well, for one, I found out that this is not actually the universe we live in. The world we live in far far stranger than that. There are not 4, but 10? or maybe an infinite number of dimensions. Time is not linear, but more illusory. Zooming down into the most base levels of existence, we find not mechanical reactions, but "vibrations". There is a universality of a force that composes all things. The world of the physical and mental are one.  Today, if I had to label my believe it would fall somewhere between pantheism an panentheism. The psychedelic experiences I've had, as well as dreams, have given me first hand experience that we are tapped into something much larger than ourselves. I don't believe in the Judeo-Christian deity. I do believe that what we normally experience is only a tiny fraction of Existence. To be alive and conscious is to be Divine. We are co creators and experiencers of our own magnificence.  Is anyone else here an "ex-atheist"?  To me it seems like a natural progression to go from believing in the God in the Bible, to disbelief, to pantheism.   This is the single funniest sign I've ever seen in my life.  I love thinking about the who designed this sign and how they managed to get it approved.  We need more sign designers/approvers like this!   Yup, you've got it.

It's also common to have a social relationship with one's professor.   Taking them head on is basically out of the question. I think the solution lies more in doing everything we can to simply stop participating in their system.  Growing your own food and producing your own power is a good start.   There are so many ways to interpret this.  Can you post some examples of what you're complaining about?   So what's your solution?   Central valley farmers act like it's their god-given right to grow their monoculture crops there and would rather see all the rivers dry up then have to change their practices.   All we have to do is stop paying our taxes.  Collectively.  No tax income equals no way to pay the police and military.   I would love to know how many of the "conversations" about GMOs here on reddit are completely orchestrated.

I've been wanting to get into making visualizers for a while.  I might use your source as a starting point.   This ditty came up while reading this awesome book, [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/book/).      Fuck Comcast?   I picked this book up randomly in a bookstore when I was 14 when my sister was touring Humbolt U.  It literally changed the way I saw myself and the world and contributed very much to my philosophy.  That and mushrooms. Highly recommend both.   Oh look, reddit's being racist again.   I'm starting an organic garden on my front yard.  You should too.

The ability to realistically render an image with paper and pencil does not make one an artist.  Being an artist is about tapping into your creativity and giving in whatever form it may take.

Allow my to plug [my own](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/6463) portfolio for some examples.  And this book [The Artist's Way](http://www.amazon.com/The-Artists-Way-Julia-Cameron/dp/1585421464) which is a workbook for tapping into your own creativity and to stop censoring yourself!  Your photography is your art!  Whatever medium comes natural to you, practice it everyday and hone it into a talent uniquely yours.   Actually it's about Israel.  I don't think the OP would care if a bunch of jews living in the United States formed a security company and won a contract.    You're arguing against a claim nobody here has made.  It sure seems like you are making that claim when you post a link to something that is clearly NOT about jews but about Israel and call it anti-semetic.  Like I said before, there are a few people on that sub who routinely turn criticism of Israel into anti-semtism. And I and others call them out on their racist bullshit.  But you are poisoning the well by pointing to the worst of the bunch and saying it is indicative of the majority.   you know, like you're doing right now.  I'm not defending "thinly veiled antisemitism".  I'm defending the right of people to criticize Israel without being called racist (when they are actually not being racist).  It might seem like a tough distinction to make but it's really important to make that distinction.   Well, you are perpetuating the conflation.  I'm over there everyday trying to sort out the racist shit from the real criticism of Israel, calling people out.  What you are doing is just as bad and is playing into the confusion.   Yes, that sub is frequented by people who are genuinely anti-semitic and use criticism of Israel as a cover to voice their racist mentality. BUT that does not mean that everyone on that sub who is critical of Israel is anti-semitic.  What if I told you that there are jews who are critical of Israel? Does that blow your mind?  I know you probably don't care about this because your agenda is just to make people on that sub look bad, but I think you are being disingenuous when you conflate anti-zionism with anti-semitism.  EDIT: you could try replying to me before you hit that downvote button.   Where did I say I support the state of Israel?  You seem mentally incapable of separating criticism of Zionism with hatred of jews.  I'm done arguing with you because you're either a troll or very very lost.    A quote from a speech he gave in 1938:   I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustainespecially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.  Smart guy.   Yes. SEEEE, there are Jews who have been, do, and will continue to speak out against the injustices that go on in their name which has been HIJACKED by a dangerous elite.   The point had nothing do with the actual physiological reasons that sugar tastes good, as I'm sure you actually know.  The point is that not everything that tastes good is good for you, which was the original point icancatchbullets was trying to make.   It sounds to me like you're the one supporting genocide. YOU are the problem.    Plus, if superiority is a relative concept with no absolute definition, what's to stop people from forming different opinions on what "superiority" is?  Nothing, that's my point.  You really can use your own definition of "superior" if you insist on using that term at all.  Why not make your definition include some of the things you think are good?   ITT: racist fucks   Holy shit, I could find a thousand books written by white christians that have that exact same premise but with the group replaced.  When will you learn that the actions of an individual is not necessary indicative of that entire group.  You can cherry pick examples of assholes all you want, and you can come here to read more examples of what you already believe.  Do you know how fucking ridiculously fucked up your sort of rhetoric is?  How about treating all people with respect regardless of their race or religion?  Do you know how many Jews there are that are against Zionism and speak out about it?  I know it's real easy to spout out your racist nonsense behind the anonymity of a computer screen, but would you say these things in public? Why not?  /end rant   Sugar tastes fucking good because it triggers the same receptors as carbohydrates, which are nessesary for short-term survival.  This does not mean that our body knows that sugar is exactly what our body needs.  Your logic falls apart pretty fast.   How the heck do you figure that the ability to destroy one's own ecosystem is "superiority"?  As for "self-awareness" that is nearly impossible to define.  Try this on for size: superiority is a completely relative concept with no absolute definition.  It's just you saying "This is better than that" which translates to "I like this better than that."  Evolution does not give a shit about what you like better.  Complex does not equal better than simple.  The only metric of success you can use when talking about a lifeform is its ability to survive and proliferate, and by that metric, insects are surely doing better than we.   Please define "evolutionary superiority".   Holy shit, that sub is as bad as r/whiterights   So it's not possible for someone to engage in direct action and ALSO have a blog?    And how much is it to fly a head of lettuce across the continent, or a crate of bananas across the ocean?  Transporting anything is associated with carbon emissions, yes.  But that's not the point and that isn't what causes the huge emissions of meat consumption.  It is combination of methane output of cows and deforestation to make grazing land.    and what of the carbon cost of the fertilizer that their manure replaces?   [Manure only makes about 5% of fertilizer.](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.com/2013/03/no-cows-dont-make-fertilizer.html)  This is a non issue.   My point is that you cannot just take one part of modern society and blame it for all of the ills of modern society.   No one is claiming that meat consumption is to blame for ALL the ills of modern society.  Rather, it's about 14 and 22 percent of a very challenging problem. (Not to even mention the other compelling arguments for eating a plant-based diet.) If we want to solve it, we need to break it down and figure out what we can change.  Eating less meat is part of that.   That went from moving to powerful to jaw-dropping to eerily sobering.   Enjoy your prostate cancer.    The meat industry has contributed to climate change. Carnivorous diets haven't.  You do realize that industries don't magically emerge from nowhere and support themselves on air, right?  The strength of an industry is DIRECTLY related to consumer demand.   Edit: let me rephrase that.  You are right, air travel is an absolutely huge contributor to one's carbon footprint.  But Morrissey is right too.  [According to Scientific America](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-greenhouse-hamburger/): The FAO report found that current production levels of meat contribute between 14 and 22 percent of the 36 billion tons of "CO2-equivalent" greenhouse gases the world produces every year. It turns out that producing half a pound of hamburger for someone's lunch a patty of meat the size of two decks of cards releases as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as driving a 3,000-pound car nearly 10 miles.  It's a fairly easy change to make with a huge impact, which is probably why he's touting it, but does it make up for the rest of the carbon emissions involved in his lifestyle? Probably not.   Yeah, actually [most cancer studies use those rats and the study was retracted due to pressure by Monsanto](http://truth-out.org/news/item/20516-in-depth-journal-retracts-independent-study-linking-monsanto-gmo-corn-to-cancer-in-rats).     Health and safety are not the only reasons someone might want to avoid GMOs.  There are environmental effects for one, and someone might want to avoid purchasing GMO containing food because they simply don't want to support the companies profiting from it (perhaps because of the patent issue). People need to be informed in order to "vote with their dollars".   I get severe headaches EVERYTIME I eat food containing MSG, (even when I didn't know that it contained it before hand), so I am very grateful that it is labeled.  You cannot tell me it is completely harmless.  This is exactly why people need to be able to discern what is in the food they are eating.  You cannot make blanket statements about an organisms reaction to various chemical compounds (which is exactly what food is) and be right 100% of the time.   Damn, I'm sorry so many people aren't having any fun in life.  I'm an adult, I make games for a living, and I spend my copious free time hiking, swimming in rivers, playing music, and having sex with my polyamorous lovers.  This is the best my life has ever been.      Thanks!  You jolted me into realizing I need to get back to work!  My game is SOO close!   I'm travelling South America and I'm boarding a bus in Ecuador.  I have a plastic water bottle full of processed San Pedro cactus (which is a lot like Peyote, contains mescaline).  I also have some weed, which can also get you serious jail time in Ecuador.  As I'm waiting in line to board the bus, I notice a uniformed guard (perhaps a police officer?) searching people's bags before boarding.  I split off from my friend and walk around the corner where I down the San Pedro, not wanting it to go to waste, and put the weed in my sock under my foot....  Back at the bus, the guard is doing a really thorough job searching and it is taking quite a while.  By the time it is my turn I'm starting to feel the effects of the San Pedro kick in.  The guard asks me immediately to completely empty my bag.  I have a guitar, which he shakes, juggling balls, which he sniffs, and a little pipe which I've used to burn the herb that morning.  He examines the pipe for a long time, sniffing it, scraping tar with his finger, while my heart is pounding.  I mutter "para tobacco" as if that doesn't make me any more suspicious.  Finally he asks me to remove my shoes and it's all I can do to keep it together.  I step out of my my shoes and I'm now standing on top of the marijuana.  He shines a flashlight in my shoes and then finally, after what seemed like a half an hour search, tells me to get on the bus.  Needless to say, it was an interesting bus trip after that.      This is just not true.  There is a ton of research showing that sitting in excess is harmful to your health.  Here's a [summary of the research](http://www.juststand.org/tabid/816/default.aspx).      I just use a spreadsheet.  I use the following columns:   * Type (Feature, Bug) * Priority * Milestone (I highly recommend using a milestone system * Status (In Progress, Testing, Awaiting Assets, Complete, etc.)  I don't think the particular method of organization is important, just so long as you have a system which you use, makes sense to you, and use consistently.   Maybe I am learning this lesson now.. but is optimization really such a bad thing?  I think there is a probably a sweet spot in terms of how much effort you put into it.  Too much and you waste your time.  Too little and your game is inefficient and might not run on every device you want it to.   I like the music.   Thanks! I read that most games don't make it past alpha, so getting over these last hurdles is going to be an accomplishment!  I will be so happy just to see my game in the store.   Ever play [Zach McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders) that game was awesome.   I met with a client to discuss a potential new educational game.  Now I'm playing a game.. hehe.  Once I get that out of my system it's back to working on my game I've been working on for the past 6 months.  I think it's only a couple weeks from Beta now!   You sound like a confused individual.

    Walker continues to dig his own grave with his stupidity and delusions.  He will be completely vulnerable to public shaming and criticism if/when opponents go after him.  He will sink like a rock in a debate with just about anyone, even fellow idiot Rick Perry.  I'd like to see him go at it with Santorum just for the fun of it.   Sickening.   As if we needed more evidence about how delusional he is.   A tragedy for everyone.   He thinks he is, but actually he's on a mission from the Koch brothers.   No, it's religion interfering with the government that is the problem.  Women's reproductive rights and the war on women's bodies are a perfect example.    At Burger King.   Slavery rhetoric? Does Rand Paul think people will believe his ridiculous argument? He reveals what an evil, greedy pig he is and that as a doctor he's motivated by money alone.  The white male ruling class at its ugliest. Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy.  Americans themselves are slaves to the Medical-Insurance-Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex which addicts them to drugs and pigeon holes them into narrow diagnostic categories/treatment determined by insurance companies and medical bureaucracies.        Scott Walker and Joseph McCarthy - Wisconsin's most shameful politicians.     Her memoirs are brilliant.  I've read them several times.  It's terrible that the Soviets destroyed most of her work and erased any references to her - she was basically eliminated.  I was so happy to discover this recital.  There is another one from a few years later, in the Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin, where she's even more beautiful and impressive.  	12

 Holy hell, I'm so lost. Is this right?    Boy reports girl abducted.  Girl is found in Orange County.  Boy and Girl are reprimanded by the police.  Now, apparently, all along the police have been receiving emails from people claiming to be the actual kidnappers???  The alleged (are they even alleged if the crime didn't occur?) kidnappers are just a bunch of gentlemen crooks out to drink martinis and rob casinos???  They've threatened that they'll harm someone if they don't get an apology for doing something that the police say they didn't do but they insist that they did do??????   Keyence maybe, good but pricey. Omega has some cheapie ones, but I'm not sure how good they are. What's the budget? What's the intent?

Still a 'maker' type project, and probably get out of it for the same price, but it's a different skill set. And a different subreddit.    There's still a Chevy's in Novato.

Your next purchase should be a lottery ticket.   Better yet, buy three to guarantee one works.    Light sensors would be easiest. Create a screen of light beams across the goal. Each beam is about the diameter of a tennis ball from on to the next. Emitters on one side, receptors on the other. Seeing which two beams are broken will give you an approximate (x, y) of your ball. The more sensors you have, the more resolution you have. You will probably need some I/O expansion ICs, and a digital circuit that gives you latching values, so some type of shift register. That way once they're set you can read them whenever and not have to poll fast enough to catch the actual event.   If you're up north Marin Speed Shop (aka Hattar Motorsports) is a good place to buy high-end gear (Dianese, Shoei, Arai, etc...) or just up the street from them is Motopia for the rest of the manufacturers (Icon, Joe Rocket, Scorpion, etc...)   You're an idiot.   Is there a sub for these? I cannot get enough of these Leeroy Jenkins videos.   I know that it's better for her to sleep in her bed, but I can't help letting her fall asleep on me and stay there for an hour or two.   Here's a close-up of the [leaves](http://imgur.com/Bshkat0). They grow mostly in small groups of single trunked plants. There's one that's growing alone that's taller than the rest. Most are 4-6 feet tall, the tallest one is almost 8 feet tall. No discernible smell when crushing a leaf. I'm in the Bay Area of Northern California. Western Novato, CA to be most specific. Didn't flower this spring.       Cheap-ass brothers-in-arms. I have one also.   Probably a good idea to create a throwaway for this comment, nice move.   Is that California? I think I know that apartment building.   Cute kid. I own guns.    Complete and utter bullshit. I understand that the homeless don't have access to lawyers in most cases, but beat up, charged with assault, sentenced to probation, and the only thing the real assaulter's are getting is fired or suspended? Total bullshit.      Ah, the old reddit [bark-a-roo](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/30k7f3/the_stuggle/cpt945s?context=1)   My world is a roller coaster right now.   This is exactly what I thought when I saw this. You cannot rationally look at videos of apes and not see so many similarities that you could say that you believe WITHOUT A DOUBT that evolution is wrong. Maybe you could still have doubts, etc... But to say that there is no doubt is just plain stupid.   Mine has taken to a post-bath naked bounce on the trampoline most recently.   An additional point about #4, it now alsoo prompts a warning when your SRAM drops into the lock-up danger zone.   Bro, my AOL dial-up pretty much dies for an entire day when downloading this gargantuan IDE. Oh wait, this isn't 1996.   Why won't our kids wear pants? I mean, great picture and all, but seriously, what is it against pants? I can't get my 19 month old to put pants on without an act of Congress.   I once worked with a guy that refused to wire his errors up and used flat sequence structures to maintain on order of operations. Sometimes his vi's would throw errors so he got in the habit of putting Clear Errors vis after all of his vi's so he didn't have to deal with pop-up errors.   Starship Toopers (the book) did the same, just better.   In software when you pass a piece of executable code as an argument to another piece of code it is referred to as a "callback".   From the entrance of the corner, given a proper entrance speed, you should use what's called maintenance throttle to stabilize the bike. Not accelerating, not decelerating, just steady throttle to help hold your line. After crossing the apex you can begin to apply throttle as you begin to stand the bike up.   The reality of the situation is that this rider was riding at 10/10ths (or possibly 11/10ths) and left no room for error or dirty roads.   Check out [this](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_EMG_Detector) page that has slightly more information about the EMG sensor. It looks like it's basically a comparator and some op amps. My guess is that the output is a differential, it says the output ranges from 1.5V at a static state to 3.3V. It doesn't look like you can tell which pad is outputting what.   Yeah, dirty corner, on the gas while tipping it in, sounds like cold tires to me.   It sounded like the back broke loose before you see him lose the front. My guess is the outside of that corner was dirty as fuck and he spun the rear entering it.   Here's a [pastebin link](http://pastebin.com/GQPAj3ZF) to a project I've been working on. I removed some of the confusing I2C stuff so you can see how I implemented my TCP server and API. Mine works basically as a telnet server with clients connecting on the telnet port, so not exactly what you're looking for, but may start you going in the right direction.   Yeah, poured in Novato a couple of times through the night. Was done when I left for work at 6, but I got soaked coming up 880 by the Oco.   How do you handle libraries, do you pretty much have to start everything from scratch?   Yes. The following statement;  int tmp = 488 / 100;  Serial.println(tmp);  Will print the value 4 to your serial screen.    Using int's is probably the cleanest way to do it. Just make sure to leave a note to yourself so when you look at the code months from now you'll remember what your intent was.   Freedom of speech does not mean that you are free from the results of your speech. Just that you are allowed to say what you want. He's not being censored. But his decision to represent his team as a group of people that are okay with calling 13 year old girls sluts (which he was actually stupid enough to express publicly) got him fired.    I ran my first half-marathon at 280 lbs. It's not that unbelievable.    I disagree a little, but only a little. I've only ever run half-marathons, so this varies a little, but my long training runs were reserved for weekends, per a well-qualified running trainers schedule that I met with personally (just making sure you don't think this was just a schedule I got off the internet). During the week I would either focus on high intensity intervals in the 3-5 mile range, or do a slow 6 miles. I kept the 10+ mile training runs for the weekends only. I'm going to run a full-marathon next year sometime and the schedule that we've been given is similar to that, just more months of training working up to longer training runs on the weekend. Still, nothing further than 7 miles during the week.   And it's never at best. It's usually at worst. My grandma could write better HTML than this article.   I'm getting a real Hexen vibe from this.    I've been doing the StrongLifts 5x5 program for the last month. When I started it was all I could do to do bar weight lifts. On Wednesday I did a B workout and did 145 on my squat and 135 on my deadlift. This morning I did an A workout. 150 on my squat, 115 on my bench press and my bent-over rows. This morning I even had one of the personal trainers come over (these guys are notorious for ignoring people unless they think they can get them to pay for some personal training sessions) and tell me that he'd seen me coming in all month and that I was looking good, good form, etc... I was ready for the sales pitch, but after the compliment, he just said, have a good day and walked away.   I'm a pretty stocky guy. I was hoping to lose weight in the middle without putting on too much bulky looking muscle. I was always told that getting to a comfortable weight and upping reps would help lose weight and tone muscle to lean it out and was preferred over higher weight, lower reps workouts.    Gorgeous. Congrats. I would normally wish you well but my 18 month old had a night last night, so I've been up since 2AM. Instead I'll wish you luck.   He didn't have evidence that the man didn't do it. What he withheld was evidence that the evidence he was using to convict (the supposed confession from the jailmate) was false and given under the pretense of reward from the prosecution. Which isn't that say that the guy isn't a scumbag, he is.  Not that I don't believe that the guy was innocent. He could have been. You can look at Hurst's other cases, the guy is somewhat of a genius and it doesn't seem like he's accepted coercion or money to offer his completely science-based testimony. If he says it wasn't arson, it probably wasn't arson.   Yeah, this exactly. A fire is a disorienting and confusing thing. Throw that in with just being roused from sleep and you have a recipe for him not finding the daughter in the same room with him.   Flew from Chicago Midway to SFO once. They delayed my flight out of Chicago by a few hours so I went to the agent to see if there was something else they could do. They put me on a flight to Oakland (which is fine for me I take a cab either way) that left immediately but had a layover in Phoenix. I get to Phoenix and they say the flight to Oakland is overbooked. So I give up my seat, they put me on a flight that leaves an hour later to SFO (my original destination)  give me a credit for the original price of the ticket plus $300, plus the front of the line upgrades, drinks, etc... I ended up with almost $900 credit (it was a business trip so work paid for the flight,) a seat to my original destination, and I got off the plane just as my delayed flight from Chicago was getting in so I could pick up my luggage too.    Keep your helmet up. If you're ever out in NorCal drop me a line. You can ride with me whenever.   Not on my dinner table. On the Olympic bar. I decided to get serious about a month ago and got a gym membership. I've just been doing the [Stronglifts 5x5 workout](http://stronglifts.com/). I started out barely able to lift the empty bar, in fact, on my overhead press I started with a 20lb barbell since the 45lb Olympic bar was too much.   But yesterday I did my B workout with 145lbs on my squats and 135 lbs on my deadlift. That's right, using the big 45lb plates on the bar now. It felt good to be able to put those on and still get my 5 sets done. I'm also up to 70 lbs on the overhead press, and tomorrow I'll go for 100lbs on my bench press and my rows.   I know alot of guys can do alot more weight, but I'm pretty proud of myself. My goal is to get to somewhere between 150lbs and 175lbs on all the lifts in that workout than increase the reps to 5x10 or 5x12 to help with the toning. Between my lifting and cardio I've lost a bunch of inches in the last month, but the best part is being able to keep up with and toss around my 1 year old. She's definitely enjoying my gains as much as I am.   Yes, this feedback loop is all sorts of positive. Thanks for the grins this morning, only more amusing if I would been on the list.   Holy shit, this thread is a god damn roller coaster.   All right, I've been thinking, when life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade! Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man whose gonna burn your house down - with the lemons!  Portal 2   I checked the NOAA sea level rise map. 3 feet makes my house in Novato, CA beachfront property, so, I'm finding it tough to be sad about this.   But they have a PC and PS4 demo, check out the end of the video.   I've already told myself that whatever my 1 year old daughter chooses to be interested in when she starts growing up is fine with me and I have no expectations. However, I would love it so much if she's as into cars as /u/littlefeather is.   Your friends are trying to liven up their stories, I think. I commute an hour each way in the East Bay. The assholes that attempt harm to me are few and far between. Seems to be a pretty even mix of people trying to be courteous and people just blissfully ignorant of the world around them.    Keep it down.   Why does that R1 rider keep getting all the way off the throttle and use the clutch to shift?   I gotta say, it sucks. You sound like an alright dude. However, every cab ride that I've had in SF from airports to home, around to bars, and around Marin has been horrible. Bad drivers, trouble using my credit card to pay, dickish attitudes, just a general not-give-a-fuck outlook on being a service provider. So yeah, while it may suck for you, the bulk of your 'co-workers' have ruined it for the few of you that give a damn.   The Arnold Schwarzenegger hideout costume lady in Total Recall???   Can you ELI5, I still don't get it.   I'm officially using this term from here on out. Thanks.   My rest days are 'light' days at the gym. Instead of running my 3 miles, I walk/run for 20 minutes. I also just do some core exercises instead of focusing on legs, arms, chest, etc... I've found that it's really hard for me to overcome my caloric intake issues, so I instead try to ensure that I'm definitely burning a lot every day.   I totally understand this. I work for a family-run company that is populated by mostly Chinese (or half-Chinese) people. They are orderly, polite, and very decent people. They occasionally have our customers visit the shop and engineering area and these customers are sometimes from China. They can be some of the most disrespectful and annoying people ever and the people I work for always feel bad that they act the way they do.   My favorite is the Frazier knockout. That right-left-right combo when it's pretty obvious that Frazier was done for on the upper cut is just so awesome to watch.   Oh yeah, the after picture was about four steps closer. That's my daughters swingin' tree, no way she'd let me take that down.   I woke up this morning and did not feel like running. I had made it to gym everyday for the last two weeks and this morning I just wasn't doing it. I needed a break. So instead I got up, had my sensible breakfast, walked a mile there and back to the hardware store for a few odds and ends, and worked in the yard. All day long. I mowed and weed-ate (eated?), cleaned up from that, turned over and weeded the entire garden in my side yard, fixed the fence, finished the chicken coop waterers and feeders, and chased my daughter around for an hour playing 1-year old tag. Most likely burnt a lot more calories today than I would've if I went to the gym and didn't do this stuff.  A different kind of [before](http://i.imgur.com/yHrBzqi.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/8uD2Gmk.jpg).   And now since the house is empty of anyone else beside your friend, they are free to burn it down at their leisure.    Educate me here, I used to know so much about gaming machines, but I feel like things have moved so far past my old trusty i486 DX2.  I'm assuming that Skyrim isn't actually running on the tablet, but on some other machine? So, where is the graphic processing done? Does this have to run on lower video settings to account for cheaper video hardware on the tablet?    It seemed like that mother or father type character died in the trailer. Pretty depressing to me, is all.   It's called [Tilt-Shift photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt%E2%80%93shift_photography). By creating an extremely sharp portion of the picture and blurring the rest you can trick the brain into thinking you're taking pictures of miniatures.   I've always thought that it's so much easier to get stunning views of the Bay Bridge than the Golden Gate. Great picture OP, thanks for sharing.   I'd fart in his face.   What is it with depressing games now-a-days? Is it just the trailers they're putting out? This looks like an awesome game, but man, just depressing as shit.   Unsure about buying this. I do like side-scrollers (finished Guacamelee and working on Rayman now,) but after watching the trailer just now I remembered that looks like about the saddest game ever. Any confirmation on that, am I going to be weeping like an infant if I get into it?   Yeah, mine fell asleep on me while I was playing Rayman the other day. We stayed like that for a few hours. I wasn't complaining one bit.   The sad part is, this is a rookie mistake that my wife makes all the time. She thinks it's so cute to watch my daughter run all over buck-ass naked. That is, until she pisses on the floor.   Sorry bro, I'm an Its-It guy.   Weird Weekends is so good. So... which one is BBC Two on my Comcast?   Your references are on point. I just watched that video. And I live in San Francisco.   I saw a test drive of it in early-early-pre-beta and it was slick than. I'm sure it's gotten slicker.    [Real-Time FAQ](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-35053) : About halfway down you'll see that while it's not supported by NI, the distro is available on github. The rest is left up to you.   [LabVIEW to Arduino Compiler](http://www.tsxperts.com/arduino-compatible-compiler-for-labview/) : Another, in my opinion better, method of running LabVIEW to Arduino. This actually compiles and deploys LabVIEW code on the Arduino to run headless.   I'm mobile at the moment, but will link when I get back to my computer.   Or look into compiling your Labview straight onto the Arduino or running the Labview RTOS on your Beagleboard.    Wasn't that Scarface? And that wasn't freestyled, that was written.   What's a gas port? Is that where the gas ships come in to harbor?   I was always taught, wait ten seconds, eject the round. Leave it on the ground. A misfire (didn't fire) or hangfire (fires late, as it's properly called outside of southern Missouri, I've been informed) is much less dangerous on the ground than in the barrel.   Typically referred to as a 'slow burn'. Not un-heard-of.   Oh my god. Yes. Came here specifically to make sure this whiny little brat was mentioned.   If only this shield could block cancer.   I hope  my daughter hates riding with me as much as you hate riding with your dad. Thanks for the video.   I'm still somewhat new to JS and node.JS, but not new to development. I ran into this [this page.](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) I am in no way affiliated with this website at all, but I was wondering how relevant the material still is. I saw that it was posted on reddit 3 years ago, so it seems like it's a fairly old page, but it claims it was updated in January of this year. Mostly interested because after reading the first few paragraphs it kind of defines my experience to a 'T'.   Looks good. Have fun in the snow and be safe.   What year is that R1?   Not true. I got caught in some snow once coming over a pass in California. Kept it slow, got way off the bike when turning to try and keep it as upright as possible, but I survived. Didn't go down once.   Never been, what's the concept, do your own work, just use their shop?   Don't forget when they're sitting in your lap and decide to kick and get you with their heel.   Not to make this too NSFW, but yeah, the extra inch or two is gonna be nice for my wife.    Yeah, the title says it's the opposite of road rage, but I get the feeling that this video is the absolute furthest that rage can go.   Yeah, good on you for knowing the limits of your job and putting your family's health and safety (by keeping your job, no matter what the cost) before your own gratification. I commend you, no matter what anyone else says. Plus, good looking kid, he's got the same look on his face that you do.   Thank you for saying this. I saw them a while back and kept thinking the same thing, "Man, this show is awesome and all, but I would love it more if these guys sounded a bit more like Slipknot."   I am, but mine started when my dad passed, however I didn't notice it until one of the delivery nurses mentioned how great it would've been if both of parents could've been there to see my daughter born.    The cure for all the sunset photo's of the bay. Shitty sunset photos.   Only heard it once, but yes, it's a sound you never forget, I'm sure.  	106

 There's actually a mod to THUG2 called THUGPRO that's takes all the levels from thug1 and 2, thps4, thaw, and more. The community is growing. Check it out! Just Google it.    Thank you to the team for making this! I am reliving a huge part of my first gaming experiences. I hope the community builds again!    I remember Create-a-review. That's was the place for the community! I remember hanging out with the Tho guys. Tek was really cool.    Just some beautiful animation there. I love how Quagmire just stands there stone faced, unblinking. There's so much liveliness in the characters, especially if you remove Peters mouth. Walt Disney would be proud.      	5

 Tom Cruise.   this makes me feel so much better.....   This is unrelated, but I've always wanted to thank you for giving me a safe place to work through my Feels after the Walking Dead on The Talking Dead. I once told a friend "it's Chris Hardwick's job to help us through the feels!" You're like a zombie guidance counselor, bless you.   FLAPJAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!   Oculus. I'm still angry.  	5
 meh, natural selection   Robert pattinson? Poor guy   Every time this guy opens his mouth, more bullshit comes out.   Same in Belgium, and the bags are red. (Two basic flavours are salt or paprika)   There's one like this in a bookstore in paris (i'm thinking virgin but i'm not sure)   Her lips aren't even that big... Kim's are bigger   College students in movies are always just hanging around campus and never actually in any classes, while in real life- No. Wait. That's exactly what I do all day.   i thought he was wearing a baret    is this from kanye's collection?   i don't know what race that guy thinks me and the bald dude are holding...   three extra seconds to do what?   being completely honest your hair always looks great underwater    but maybe don't do it in public   Did anyone watch this show where he cooks at home with his daughters and his voice is all soft and he acts like he's actually in love with these quails he's so lovingly stuffing    i bet he was lovely   i think it's a case of 'you had to be there'   titty clouds    There's this trashy reality tv show in germany that has like a dozen daughters and one son named Jeremy-Pascal. Pretty awful.   I was 13, and got a growth spurt which suddenly made me 5'8. Then we went on holiday in Rome and i wore all the same clothes i'd always worn, since i'd only gained height. A specific pair of white shorts- then hotpants got me so many whistles i didn't wear them for the rest of the trip. Hell, I was still reading lemony snicket back then!   How is this even remotely wtf  	20
 (   )   Documentary about this guy's porn addiciton   Yea but it's time to add some zest into our cowbell hate...  Denver seems just like the perfect city to hate.    You have our ex coach and ex GM...  You have swirled around in trade rumors consistently and are virtually a comparable team to the Kings and the Lakers are to shitty to hate...  So there ya go   Yea...  [about that](http://www.reddit.com/r/denvernuggets/comments/3aciqm/what_is_up_with_the_negativity_of_this_sub/)....   r/kings is actually a super friendly and inviting sub.  But when you post stuff regarding a star player with no credible source either for karma *or* out of bad choice...  That's when they have come out.  We haven't been abrasive and we are open to all opinionated questions...  Shit I post multiple bad posts a month and still get treated well here.  It's how you may be coming across especially as a moderator or r/denvernuggets and judging another sub.    Cousins upside is huge as a scoring center.  I am overjoyed to have him for 3 years.  His attitude improved under Malone so I'm convinced he will be better again.  His contract is good for being arguably the best center in the league.  Many years looking forward boogie.    Fuck r/nba who down vote anybody who isn't general opinion.  You guys are Pao/Hitler.    Yea but that's not unwritten rules of reddit.  Unwritten rules are down vote if they don't agree..    Why is that?    I live Thompson and get ripped on here constantly (semi justifiably)  but who is going to take Landry's injured shitty self?     Fareid  JT.     Assuming WCS is gone..   Would you take this?  Fareid is still a great player and not bad on price.  We'd lose alot by dropping JT and eventually we can write off Landry. What do you think about it?    Edit: What if WCS is available?    But he is George Karl...  So we won't be worse.    Yea it is definitely a new rival.       /r/leagueofshadows   INB4 downvotes     RIP Mr.  Lawn...    Sunflower cafe  FTFY   This...  And damn near this only   I want the Cotto fight as I have said many times in this sub.  But we won't get that til after canelo cotto.    Fuck your cake day   Fuck your cake day   But Khan deserves a Mayweather  fight.  He has trained and prepped for the fight.  Does he stand a chance cell IMO....  No but he has wearied it and besides GGG and Garcia...  I don't think there's anyone else other than Cotto IMO...  (only because cotto gave Mayweather an entertaining fight.)  Give Khan his fight no matter how shitty it's gonna be. There honestly isn't anyone else. (I'd take a Danny Garcia fight too.)    Sure but they haven't been writing about the Kings for 6 months...  They have been focusing on the playoffs... If they have it was pure speculation because I neverneveheard anybody talking talking about  d'allesandro leaving...  That is important whether we assumed it or not...  All I heard was "George Karl trading Cousins..."   Oh BTW...  I'd check your calender..  I think it's broken   *"playoffs are over..  I  want 1500 words of bs on my desk by Monday.  MAKE IT RIDICULOUS OR ELSE"*   What doesn't the little fuck do...    All good nothing but growth.  All in good sport.    Lol I'm weak   Fuck man..  Curry went 7th... People sleeping on draft day.  "Here's lawson a guy we need to get rid of.  Let me take your shitty 6th pick...?"   C'mon man.  6th is a good pick in what looks like a good draft.    Just about to say this....  About time we got some quality names thrown. Lou,  Cousins,  Gay,  and Collison?  Pshhh get out.  That's a squad.   Edit: I'm assuming we still have our pick.    Haha we hate Hickson more I'm sure. In all I'd love to have Ty but not for our pick.  If you wanted to trade up and dump salary I'd do that. And take Hickson and dump him after we give you McCallum.    Little chance of effect?  Damian Lillard was the 6th pick?  A 7'0 defensive 5 has great impact...  You are making assumptions on notions you can't justify. We can't project anything about any pick.  If you are asking me if I would rather gamble on a franchise changer or take the sure thing at improving 1 step of my franchise,  I take the gamble because we can sign free agents with the money we save from Ty.  5s don't come very often.  Our post would be stacked and we could sign a 1 or 2 for probably cheaper than Ty or maybe attract an even better guard with all the talent we now have.    You are making Lawson sound like he is LeBron. (meaning he has the power to take us to the ship)  I agree that Lawson is great but it was known since last year that Lawson was on the trading block. I would rather hold the pick until 6th to see if WCS falls.  Call us on draft day.  You guys are dumping Lawson in my opinion no matter what. Winslow wouldn't be a horrible pick.  But you are right,  only time will tell if we are stupid enough to give you guys 6th + 7th + Stauskas or McCallum (you keep putting McCollum who is on the blazers)  while you dump Lawson and Hickson on us like you guys keep talking about on your thread.    ^ Fuckin trippin  Edit: We have a capable point guard in Collison.  Lawson would be great for our team but over a defensive 5...?  You are insane. Lawson has shown what he can do...  WCS could be a future asset at a much more reasonable cost. Let's be frank...  You don't want lawson as much as lawson doesn't want you guys.  Just because you want a 6th and 7th pick doesn't mean you get to wish it upon yourself....  Hence my first statement.    He replied, "it's hard man..  I got to much love for the hoes"    WCS or Lawson? lol I'm insulted   He was just a fun player for me to watch.     - Travis outlaw  - Cole Aldrodge  - IT   Edit: This I purely fun.  Not necessarily right or wrong.  Just who do you wish we didn't get rid of whether it was right to or not.     Fuck your cake day         We should have fucking kept him...    Yea that was my point..    Wait..  You had a helmet that like other male helmets?    Until kings start winning..  Then they were fans since 01'   I literally say it to every cake day person when I cross one.  Nothing personal.    Fuck your cake day   Do what I do for the last two years...   - Compliment the shirt: "Hey!  that's a nice shirt!  Is it new?"    - Ask them what team Iggy came from: "He was a sixers right? Who cares the guy is a shooting machine"   - Ask their favorite player: "Currys daughter.  Have you seen X video!?"    - Ask what Kerr did differently this year than last year: "It's that defense thoooooo"   - And my all time favorite...  Why do you root for GSW?: "Nor Cal rocks man..."    Only thing worse is the band wagoner that come next year once we take 8-6th seed...       Fuck your cake day   I honestly feel this would be the biggest move the owner could do.

If your interested   Fuck your cake day   Doesn't need to be to children... It would reflect Jobs childish nature and his neck for minimalism.  Most adults watch Pixar movies anyways but a story of early success to a terrible downfall to overcome and accomplish what he did isn't a bad children story. You can make jobs the "Grumpy"  character who gets nicer towards the end of the movie through interactions with the other characters in his life.    A part of me honestly feels this would be a great way to tell the story of Jobs. Stop trying to find an actor to play Jobs but instead let Jobs live through a company he helped flourish.    Of course...  It worked for America didn't it?       Fuck your cake day  Edit: fuck your downvotes   Probably should get that checked out   He's speaking about the spooky ghost in the video...

 And yet losers like you oppose training courses at every level, unless it allows you to make it prohibitively expensive and inconvenient to own a firearm.  You're part of the problem, Chester.   Bill Maher is an anti-vaccination lunatic.  He's a completely partisan hack.   It's off interest to people who are pro gun rights.   Keep your friends close and all that.    I'm only in favor of UBC's if they are conducted as follows:  Government-issued drivers licenses are conspicuously marked in one of two ways:  People who can legally buy a gun have an icon on their id of a little green circle with a pistol in the center.   People who are prohibited from owning a gun have an icon on their id of a pistol with an international no symbol over it.   When selling a gun, you simply ask to see the buyer's id. If you see the green icon, you're good to go. If you see the red icon you are legally required to decline the sale.   This UBC method empowers gun owners to be the first line of defense in making sure guns aren't sold to criminals, requires no government bureaucracy, does not force buyers or sellers to have to waste time driving to an FFL, or waste money forcing them to pay fees to conduct a check.          Assault kettles are black, have an external handle to make it easier to quickly pour the contents, the ability to heat the contents above 200 degrees F, and an internal capacity greater than 10 fluid ounces.   It's a trick.  Get an axe.    It was, but it's still a great trope to break out when dealing with antis.   By any chance is your ISP Comcast?      Wow. I'd like to thank the kind soul who gilded my link!                   Red meat for the election season grist mill.    I'm in total agreement with you; fuck people in wheel chairs. If they can't learn Krav, they deserve to be victimized!   GrC.   I totally forgot about that place!   The thing that's funny about them is that the rules are purposely designed to allow them to ban anyone.   Most subs that cliquey just end up going private, but the folks at GrC seem to get off on engaging in a public circle jerk, which is really just kind of sad, when you think about it.    For your clothes, here's a pretty flower.   Anti-gun bigots extolling their fairness and compassion in 5...4...3..         Aside from political lobbying and such, the NRA is the largest organisation dedicated to offering training classes dealing with many facets of gun ownership, including four hunting, concealed carry and home defense.   They are also one of the largest competitions shooting organizations, with NRA-sponsored shooting matches in every state.   On top of that, they offer consultation on range construction, evaluation and grants for the building and improvement of shooting ranges.   They also offer members insurance on their gun collections.   That's just off the top of my head.       It's a very Spielbergian moment. He always puts nice little touches like that in his movies.    The Kirkland fish oil doesn't have as much EPA and DHA as some other brands, so you might try changing it out for another brand.  There are some brands for sale on Amazon with very high EPA and DHA content, and even a couple for sale at Costco. Next time you shop there, compare labels.   The problem is that a lot of people would see a correlation with race and assume causation, when that isn't the factor driving these injuries, but rather the culture of desperation that arises in economically and educationally depressed areas of the country, which tend to be disproportionately African-American.   Passing a law that allows people to be thrown in prison for merely owning a piece of optical gear is reprehensible.  I'm glad to see you oppose such onerous legislation.      Great post. I've submitted it to r/bestof.       How, exactly, would they enforce this law?   After all, federal law prohibits the government from retaining NICS check records for more than a week (iirc), so it would be impossible to prove whether someone did or did not submit to a NICS check.   So this law is completely unenforceable and utterly useless, except to act as the groundwork for further restrictions down the road.          It's actually worse than the headline makes it seem.   What has the antis all up in arms isn't the gun itself, but the optical and electronic system attached to it.   They don't want to ban the rifle, they want to ban the scope attached to it, which is just insane.    That's some grade-a trolling.   The gun used was built on an 80% receiver.    Headline should read "Democrats try to regulate blocks of aluminum/spools of plastic."  I can't decide if this is more, or less, idiotic than their attempt to ban incandescent bulbs.    For a second there, I thought this was an announcement that Brady group had gone through yet another name change.       Relevant User name.   Ever notice how the solution to failed gun control policies is the institution of more gun control?   After California passed their state level ban on so-called "assault weapons" it turned out that they left a certain model of SKS off of the list.  Since the window to register them had closed, and they were now considered an "assault weapon " anyonewho had one was told to turn it in or have it confiscated.  I don't know how actively they pursued the owners of those rifles, but its my understanding that some forced confiscations did occur.  There is also a concerted effort in California to match gun registration information up against prohibited persons databases, and then they dispatch LE to confiscate the guns. I don't have a problem with this, at least for people with violent felonies, but they're also going after people who have mental health issues, and even family members who are legal to own guns, but who live with someone who is a prohibited person.   Ask them if they would support instituting Australian-style gun control in the US.  If they say "yes" then they're lying when they say no one wants to take guns away.   While this isn't strictly gun-related, I thought it was worth sharing because it shows that the world is more complex than most gun control fans think, and that it's completely possible that there are factors other than gun availability that play into violence and suicide.   Given the revelation that high amounts of environmental lead were likely a large part of high crime rates through the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, it seems plausible and reasonable that other chemical and environmental factors could be related to violent behavior or mental disorders.             Always remember, the only reason gun control ever fails is because it doesn't go far enough.       At this point, the NRA could come out in favor of puppies, baseball, and apple pie, and the mainstream media would have an aneurysm in response.   It's freaking hilarious.       Don't bother, they went out of business years ago.         Ah, yes, the old "some the people who disagree with me are mean, so clearly they're all mean" tactic of argumentation.  If you can't win on facts and reason, then slander your opponents in the public eye.   Someone who thinks they know it all isn't interested in learning.      None of your points matter to him because for him, gun violence is just the friendly cause he's using to mask hits actual hatred for all gun owners.   You see, combat effective is both deeply fearful and wildly self-absorbed, and as a result, he believes that anyone who holds the capacity to kill him actually would do so given half a chance.   As a result of this fear and paranoia, he supports laws that punish lawful gun owners for no reason other than the fact that they make him afraid and uncomfortable.   This is why anti-gun people are so irrational, and it also explains why they added completely incapable of differentiating between someone who owns a gun for legitimate reasons, and someone who is a violent criminal.   To him, deep down inside, we're all violent criminals.       It's a purely political play to try to draw a comparison between the NRA, practical shooting sports, and police militarization/excessive force.  tl;dr: Cops practicing with their guns = ZOMG POLICE STATE!   While some people get all up in arms about cops with modern rifles and pistols, I don't have a problem with it. The problem with police militarization is one of mindset (us vs. them) and not an issue of whether a cop has a wood or plastic-stocked patrol rifle.  As for cops practicing head shots, I'm fairly certain most police academies practice head shots, and have done so since time immemorial. The notion of criticizing cops for practicing shots that require precision is, frankly, utterly idiotic.  The problem is that the article is trying to draw a connection between a competition that will actually help cops have better and safer gun handling, and a militarized police state and/or cases of police using excessive force.   As I understand it, Truth Out is a left-wing organization on par with Media Matters and the like.   Always remember, according to the left wing, only police and military are competent enough to be allowed access to firearms.          Tl;dr: it's a trick, get an axe.       After about the fifth season I started thinking the show would be awesome if Michael's monologues would start getting more and more bizarre, and the series finale would reveal that he wasn't a spy, but in reality just a really clever paranoid schizophrenic.   Oh, they've known that for years. The anti-gun crowd learned how to play the incremental infringement game starting in the 1900s.   Now that much of the populace has gotten wise to their shenanigans, they're having to shift which strategy they use.    I always liked this one:  http://www.theonion.com/articles/peace-activist-has-to-admit-barrett-50-caliber-sni,234/   From where I sit, the proposal to regulate semi-auto guns under the NFA, or requiring a permit to own one has two long-term goals: to invalidate the Common Usage litmus test spelled out in Heller (after all, if they make it more inconvenient to own a certain class of gun vs. another, most people will default to the easier choice out of sheer convenience.)  This will have the effect of making semi-auto firearms much less common, and therefore likely to fail the Common Usage test in Heller, which then opens the door to further regulation. (Oh, and hey, since you required registration to own those guns, it becomes much easier to pass new regulations governing who can own them and how they can be used!)  TL;DR: CAP to gun owners: C'mon, how about just the tip?   It's interesting reading.  Of particular note is their prescription for requiring the registration of so-called "assault weapons."  Basically, they want to re-categorize semi-auto firearms as Title II NFA guns, and force you to jump through the same hoops for an AR15 that you would have to jump through to get a full-auto M16.  This doesn't mark a change of heart for the left regarding gun control; rather, it's just a change in tactics.      requiring a license for so-called "assault weapons" is probably coded language for a plan to move to regulate then under the NFA.   That was part of Feinstein's proposal to pass a new ban post-Sandy Hook.    That's so Raven!         In my experience, the vast majority of ardent anti gun people suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder.  Logical arguments don't hold any sway over them because the very nature of your gun ownership personally offends them on a visceral level.  Since their motivations are purely emotional and deeply selfish, facts, stats, figures, and appeals to logic and reasoned thinking will not sway them in the least.  It also turns out that this is a two-way street. Since facts don't have any power to change how they think, they will not consider fact-based arguments to be effective, so they emotionally lash out instead.  Ultimately, the name calling is just an attempt to outgroup you in order to make themselves feel better.   Extremely well done, OP.   Shitty website fails on mobile = downvotesville.   Feel free to post the numbers of all of those working-class people who are dues paying members in anti-gun organizations.    It's also worth pointing out that none of the gun control laws proposed within living memory works actually do anything to stop a suicidal person from getting a gun.   Therefore it is completely disingenuous for gun control advocates to include suicide numbers in their gun death statistics in a cynical bid to make it appear that the US has a violence problem.       Want buses to have more appeal?   Then they need to not smell like pee, enforce a dress code, and have an open bar.    Yohimbine and green tea extract work well to take the edge off of a chronic compulsion to eat, but you still have to exercise some self-restraint.    I honestly can't say if I do or not, I've never gotten blood work done, so my choice in supplementation is less than scientific.   I'll check out the beta alanine.    It seems a there is valid reason to be concerned about the safety of fully-autonomous weapon systems.  http://www.wired.com/2007/10/robot-cannon-ki/   I can't speak to the reputation of the university that conducted the study, but I don't see a reason to be outright dismissive of the tests they're conducting.  After all, it's not like antibiotics haven't come from novel sources before, including soil samples from the grounds of a medieval castle and bacteria found in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean.  Hell, there's even an antibacterial agent used in scientific testing that is only found in the blood of horseshoe crabs.  Unless the studies being undertaken are complete woo, or the university has a reputation for poorly controlled studies, I don't see a reason to completely dismiss this research.   Yes, I know its baking soda.  No worries.   I'ge been working to be better at drinking plenty of water during the day. I usually drink at least 1 8oz glass of water before leaving for the gym, and consume a half liter container at the gym during warmup.  Not sure I follow on the acetic acid?   Evidently there is some evidence that it helps control acidosis.  http://examine.com/supplements/Sodium+Bicarbonate/  I figured I'd give it a try, but not sure if I'd do it again.   I'll oblige them by continuing to not purchase their horrendously overpriced soups and sandwiches.   I've been supplementing with green tea extract and yohimbine for a couple of months without any serious side effects.  Today I figured I'd try adding sodium bicarbonate into the mix, and about 3/4 of the way through a fairly intense workout, I started feeling nauseated.  Doses were 10g sodium bicarbonate, 800mg ECGC and 12.5 Mg yohimbine hcl.  Other supps are D3, zinc, and creatine.  About half an hour after, I had an intense bout of puking.      You can see the key holes in the google maps photos if you pan straight up otter straight down.    To make a crappy analogy then, it's sort of similar to having a computer with a really powerful graphics card.   A normal human's vision system (graphics card) isn't all that high tech, so it just hands the stimulus off to the brain (processor), which is pretty to of the line, for interpretation.   But in a mantis shrimp the vision system (graphics card) is a top of the line model that can handle a lot of that work locally without having to hand the stimulus to the primitive brain (processor) for interpretation, which probably cuts down on the amount of time the brain needs to make a decision as to whether it's seeing food (attack) or a threat (run).   Probably more than just Reddit. Lots of other gun forums will post announcements to vote on these kinds of polls.   If Shantel wants to make more, maybe she should take some initiative and find a new job or develop some marketable skills.    My, aren't we all testy.       Whoops. My bad. I should have checked the date before posting.    Not if you'ge got an agitprop fetish.      Bear in mind that so long as general population growth outstrips the growth of the segment of the population that chooses to become first-time gun owners, it is completely possible for the raw number of gun owners to grow, while their percentage as a part of the overall population gets smaller, which some people would interpret as a drop in gun owners.   Typical rent-seeking behavior.   Improperly contained involuntary protein spill.                     That subreddit is full of utter assholes. I'm not aware of another firearms related sub where anyone has anything positive to say about them.   /r/shittynealdegrassetyson         Bloomberg makes for a good villain because he is such a lunatic control freak, and had a tendency to say tremendously stupid things.   Gates will be harder to go up against because he's done am exceptional job of building himself up as a humanitarian good guy.   They won't be able to use the same tactics against Gates.   Once upon a time, surplus rifles and pistols were sold to citizens via the Civilian Marksmanship Program.   Was it, *Batteries Not Included?  http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0092494/   http://i.lvme.me/enys03l.jpg   Obvious troll is obvious.    Christo is brilliant, and the project is temporary.   I'd love to see this one in person.    Maybe some of the guys on the force are into those battle bot competitions?   Tl;dr: Inelastic Supply meets Increased Demand, they get married and have two kids named Increased Prices and Short Supply.  In the last few years there has been a massive spike in interest in guns and marksmanship among the general population.  This demand was enough to outstrip the manufacturers' abilities to make and distribute ammunition, even when running 3 shifts per day, and a lot of companies were reluctant to expand their facilities because its an expensive process and they were unsure if the elevated demand was a temporary thing or indicative of a more permanent trend.   I'm not aware of any legislative or courtroom victories won by JPFO.  The NRA and SAF, for all of the dumb things they've done, are the two organizations most directly responsible for the lion's share of pro gun victories.    While not strictly gun-related, there is some interesting info here.      A couple of years ago, 500 round value packs were around $15.   At least then they'd stop accidentally shooting innocent bystanders when getting into skirmishes over gang territory.   Once upon a time military surplus pistols and rifles were able to be sold to competition shooters under the auspices of the Civilian Marksmanship Program.   Handgun transfers were ended in the 1960s, and the rest of the program was killed by Clinton, but resurrected as a non-profit, but will only last as long as stocks of antique Garands are still available.    In that case, you're not actually seeing infrared on your phone's screen, but rather infrared as filtered and translated to be displayed on a screen designed to display RGB.    Why does your list have Water World and Judge Dredd on it?    I started using a magnesium solution applied externally a couple of days ago. I really haven't noticed a difference as of yet.   If "the ends justify the means" is an integral part of how your party operates, intellectual honesty is an impossibility.             The old saw about them being more afraid of you than you are of them is pretty true.  I haven't encountered a bear yet that didn't run from a bright flashlight and yelling.  If you feel so inclined, get some bear spray and keep it handy for when you let your dogs out at night, just in case. That said, it's unlikely you'll ever need to use it.   Personally, I think it's a toss-up between the 47 or 15.  If you get the Compensator 10, though, be sure to get the optional ball-cupping heat-shield. Not only is it more comfortable, but it will keep you from sustaining burns on your testicles when you are busy compensating.   HBAR AR15s are widely used for Service Rifle and National Match Rifle competitions.   My guess is that there were probably some MD High Power shooters who were able to successfully make the case for their sport.    Why, it's almost as if he held those views from the beginning, and only claimed otherwise so he could make a dramatic show of being driven away from voting for pro-rights candidates so he could foster internet drama!   But that would imply that he's lying about changing his views, and I'm pretty sure no one lies on the internet.    The version of me that lives in your head is highly amusing.   If you feel the need to donate to Bloomberg supported groups, go ahead. I'm sure that as a member of the .01% he'll be duly impressed with your financial assistance.    And here you sit, reaping the rewards of slavery and land theft.    Don't soft-pedal it and claim you support regulation.   At least have the courage of your convictions to state that you are in favor of outright prohibition.    That's the thing.   It's clearly obvious these laws easily circumvented and wholly unenforceable, and preliminary data has shown that to be the case.   Frankly, if anything, gun control advocates should be even more in favor of repealing these laws than gun owners on account of the fact that these laws are so poorly written and unenforceable that they only serve to highlight just how absurd the gun control movement in this country is.    So brave.    If the antis are so in favor of the sale of smart guns, perhaps they should give a little, too.  -Industry immunity to protect from lawsuits like the ones in the story. -Repeal the NJ "mandatory smart gun" law.   Heck, since the gun lobby can negotiate from a position of power on this one, maybe they should demand concealed carry reciprocity, and repeals on magazine bans, hollow-point bans, and other ridiculous gun control laws.  If the antis want smart guns on the market so badly, maybe they should compromise for once.   He feels strongly about guns because he's deeply afraid of them.  Even worse, he's deeply afraid of the inherent symbolism they represent, which is individual autonomy and responsibility.  He's not interested in "saving lives," rather, he's interested in scoring points in a culture war where doing things that piss off people who aren't from his tribe makes him feel good.  *edited to add: the down votes are proof that I'm right.     The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.  -9th Amendment to the US Constitution    You kind of suck at this.   I think it's amusing that your perfectly reasonable statement of fact garnered downvotes from people who couldn't come up with a reply.   The good is all on this side of the table.      And yet you evidently have the right to say infinitely stupid things...   I have to wonder if he used little hearts to dot all of the i's.          It's a new term coined by Bill Maher.   If you hear them use it, you know you're debating someone willing to spring for HBO.    Harming animals is one of the items on the checklist for determining if someone is a psychopathic.   We must ban temporal bullets.   For the children.    The problem is that there's no way for the system to stop someone who's suffering from undiagnosed mental illness.  Your name doesn't go into the NCICS prohibited persons list unless you've been involuntarily committed or legally adjudicated as mentally ill.  In the case of a lot of states, they don't even bother to report those people to the national-level organization responsible for maintaining the NCICS list, so in some cases even people who should have a record in NCICS don't, and are still able to buy guns. (The Virginia Tech shooter is one example of that particular systemic failure.)   That's not necessarily true.  There have been laws proposed that would put people on the NCICS prohibited persons list for having a mental illness diagnosis of any sort.  This, most notably, resulted in an outcry from people who believed it to be unfair that they would lose the ability to exercise a civil right for being stigmatized for seeking treatment for a mental disorder despite the fact that they were not violent.        There have been some stories floating around about the companies that run private prisons donating to certain politicians/causes in order to pass more laws, harsher sentences, or opposing things like legalizing pot because it's seen as harming the prison company's bottom line.   IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEEEEEE.  Clearly the vapers are out to get you.   Claiming something is "a right" is the pseudointellectual's version of "think of the children."

 Devil. That movie never had a chance. Not to mention the twist is the title.   Fiery crash of two clown cars, 38 dead.      Giving it that [Tucci](http://i.imgur.com/BbsIoCY.gif) bump, huh?   If the audio quality suffered as much as the video, this would sound like Kermit the frog giving a blowjob to a highway patrolman.   :'-(            Chief of staff,Jack Klein rushed into the Oval office. President Warner sat at his desk reading over  the parks appropriations act that had been passed by the house. Jack stood before the President.  "Jack have you gone over this?" "Of course, Mr. President." "What did you think of the Yellowstone oversight comittee." "Mr. President, I just had aides look over the 600 page bill last night, not a one think you should pass it."  "And why is that?"  "It's socialist to begin with, the democratic leadership made it marginally socialist to win political capital come the midterms. They expect you to veto."  "Which I will?" "It's either that or the republicans will shun you come 2020, they'll call you the second coming of Vlad Lenin." "Right, was there something you wanted to talk about?" "Yes, Mr. President. There's an unidentified flying object sighted just northwest of Oregon by an F-22 raptor part of the 142nd fighter squad out of Portland. I have General Braddock briefing David as we speak." "What do we think it is?" "The pilot is still pursuing the object but cannot establish visual contact. Our intelligence notice a spike in Russian activity, so the general consensus is that it's a Russian bomber defecting."  "Alright, let's go."    The President enters the situation room, it is filled wall to wall with men and women wearing stars and stripes. They stand before him.   "Have a seat, let's do this."  The Generals sit. Jack sits to the left of the President.   "Alright, I want to know what you know."  The room is silent.   "I meant you, General Reynolds." The general looks at the President, clears his throat. "Mr. President, two hours ago our pilot spotted an airborne object over Canadian soil, now after interfacing with NORAD we've confirmed that it's not ours."  "And we believe it's Russian?"  "Well considering the size, yes."  "Do we know what kind of plane it is?"   "Well, we think it's a long range bomber."  President Warner turns to Jack. "Why do they keep saying think and guess?"  "Mr. President we've only detected the object through radar. There's a snowstorm in the area and the pilot of the F-22 has had to keep altitude well above it."  General Reynolds interjects, "Mr. President the pilot says the object is clearing the edge of the storm. I'm putting him on speaker. He's on."  The President looks at the radar on the t.v. across the room, a big blip is steadily in front of the smaller blip in the center. General Reynolds says,"Son you're on in the situation room with the President of the United States."  President Warner leans forward slightly,"Good afternoon son, can you tell me your name?"  "My name is Captain James Bradley. Mr. President it's an honor."  "Captain, what can you tell me about this flying object?"   "I'm afraid not much, I only picked it up as it was going into the storm a while ago and it's been in there pulling serpentine maneuvers. It seems to be heading towards the edge of the storm now. General Reynolds has advised me to approach at an intercept vector from it's right flank to confirm visibility."  The President nods at General Reynolds. The General says to Captain Bradley," Maintain open radio Captain we're keeping you on. " The General presses the mute button."Thirty seconds until we achieve visibility."  The President looks at the General, "No radio response, yet?"  "None, it could be interference from within the storm."  President Warner turns to Jack Klein and whispers, "Jack."  "Yes, Mr. President? "  "If this goes poorly take us to DEFCON 3."  "Yes, Mr. President."  The General looks at the radar screen. The big blip is now to the top left of the small blip and closing. "FIVE seconds, Mr. President."  "Three."  "One."  The General unmutes the pilot. "Captain Bradley what can you see?"  "ERm, not anything right now. Wait. I see something. It's one fire. Wait I'm picking up a signal. It's NORAD."  An aid hands General Reynolds a phone. The General says," Patch it through."    "Mayday, mayday. our engine is on fire this is flight 7---"  Captain Bradley comes back on the speaker, "General, can you hear me?"  "I'm here, Captain. Can you tell us what's going on?"    "It, uh,appears sir to be a single engine Cessna got lost in the storm. Pulling back around to get a better look. I think on ground personnel should get ready for this."  Jack turns to the President. He looks intently at the radar screen. The big blip remains only it's now behind the pilot. The President stands. "Call him out of there."  The pilot on the intercom says,"Sorry, what was that." The line turns to static.  "Get out of there Captain!"   The radar goes to black. The President bellows, "What the hell happened?"  General Reynolds now wears a bead of sweat, "we lost connection."  "Well get it back, get me something I can look at!"   A General from the edge of the table swipes at his tablet. "Getting you satellite now, Mr. President."   The President squints at the end of the table, "Who's that Tambley?"  "Yes, Mr. President."   "Now then, General Tambley."  A top down satellite image appears on the screen. A massive snow storm frames the left side. In the center are two pillars of black smoke. The image switches to infrared, only two sources of heat, both of them are downed aircraft. From the corner of the screen appears a great, big blue bird, draped in thorns, it flies over the smoke and into the storm.    The room is silent. Every mouth agape. Jack turns to the President. "Mr. President?"  "Do it, Jack. God Help us. Do it."   Jack stands up, "alright Ladies and Gentlemen take us to DEFCON 3, we need to scramble fighters..."  The President sits, beset by terror. Staring on at the screen, now centered on the storm slowly inching towards Seattle.             Okay, I'm gonna try.   I'd just never heard the phrase jump jet.   Like an F-22?

It's just my opinion that given the content of the mission strikes a negative chord with me given the recent events.

All I remember is needing my mom to come comfort me and tell me it would all be okay. That's the only way I'd sleep soundly. I would call it the 'death' thing and she would know what to do.   Put on clothes.   Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!   Had problems sleeping as a child. I would lay in the dark, crying, thinking about how I would out-live my family one day.

 Requesting an extension from the court to reply to a motion does not guarantee you get that extension. It is common practice for both sides to agree to an extension either while attempting to resolve the issue without the need for further litigation or as a common courtesy (after all you may be the one requesting the extension next time). Six times is excessive but from the wording of the article it appears the extension was on consent from Microsoft and Google: "Smith says that Microsoft and Google won't agree to any more extensions."   You're welcome. As a public defender maybe this [site](http://whatthepublicdefender.tumblr.com/) will cheer you up if you have not already seen it.                  Almost everything you said was correct. Yes, it would have an official court date and while it could be a summons it was more likely a DAT. It does not really matter though because it has the same effect in having you appear in court. The statute actually allows for 3 months in prison, not 90 days. That is important because it can actually be more or less than 90 days depending on what month you get sentenced. Probation would be 1 year, not 3. 3 years is for an A Misdemeanor. You were charged with a B Misdemeanor. Regardless, you were still eligible for a MACD if you had no prior record. I hope that is what you ended up with if the case was not outright dismissed. I absolutely believe it cost you $750. More importantly I agree that the marijuana laws are outdated and unnecessarily harsh.   A couple of things about this. First, you were facing up to 3 months in prison, not 6. It would be highly unlikely for you to get any prison time if you were convicted. If you had no prior convictions on your record and you were only charged with the marijuana you were eligible for a Marijuana Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal (MACD). An MACD means that if you don't get in trouble for a year your case is dismissed and sealed without any conviction or guilt. Simple possession is not a "citation" but a violation, less than a misdemeanor and not considered a criminal charge under NY law. Also, you probably received a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT) and not a citation to appear in court. Finally, the cops illegally searched and seized you (arguably) but unfortunately we all know how hard it is to prove the truth when the officers will lie about what happened.   I will try to clear up a lot of confusion that is present here. The article is misleading. First, the charges will be the same but until now for a misdemeanor marijuana arrest the police had the option of either holding someone until they saw a judge (sometimes that may take until the next day or two) or issuing him/her a Desk Appearance Ticket (DAT). A DAT gives you a court date that you will have to appear in the future (usually a month away) but allows you to walk out of the precinct as soon as the police are done processing you. Until now, depending on the cop, your record, and other factors you may have ended up being held or being issued a DAT. The NYPD actually fills out a form (like everything else) showing how they determined why or why not a person deserved a DAT. It is a useless form for the most part because it was still mostly subjective.   Now, the new policy will be that any one charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession and only misdemeanor or violation marijuana possession and has no outstanding warrants they will received a DAT. You still face the same criminal charges and the same possible jail time, probation, etc. if you plead guilty or are convicted at trial. The Governor, apparently now backed by Bloomberg, is trying to have the current misdemeanor charge for marijuana changed to a violation but he has so far failed to get it past the legislature. The big difference that is not mentioned in the article is the issue of bail. As long as you show up on the correct date it is incredibly rare a judge sets bail on a DAT whereas a regular arraignment may end with bail being set depending on many factors. Being stuck in jail because a person cannot make bail is more likely to lead to that person taking a guilty plea to get released rather than fight the case. Feel free to ask me any questions. I will do my best to answer.         The burden does not shift but a presumption may apply depending on the jurisdiction. For example in NY when there is a refusal there is a presumption of intoxication. The prosecutor still has to prove the element of driving but a jury can presume the intoxication without the prosecutor presenting any further evidence than the refusal. The U.S. Supreme Court has unfortunately said that this does not shift the burden and it is constitutional.    Yes a portable breathalyzer test is only enough to generate probable cause but the officer's observations and any statements she made or the officer testifies to her making can be enough to convict without a breathalyzer test. Especially based on this story I would not put it past the officers saying she refused the regular breathalyzer test.   I can't speak about "the vast majority of states" but I will speak about the states I have worked in and the judge cannot throw out the charges because there is no breathalyzer result. And you can be convicted. The officer will testify to this "When we arrived on the scene she smelled of alcohol, had been in accident, slurred her speech, was belligerent, incorrectly identified the street she was on, etc." Then they will say she refused the breathalyzer test. And now you have a cop's word against her word. Very possible to get a conviction.  Probable cause is enough for an arrest. That's actually what you need to arrest someone. You may being thinking of "reasonable suspicion" to stop a car, approach her, or ask her questions.   Actually this is not true. Many states go forward with prosecutions when there is a breathalyzer refusal. It does amaze me how many people on here are so quick to blame the lawyer when they do not know anything about what state this took place in and what the law is there.   It differs by each state. Some states can charge you with a presumption of DUI if you refuse to take a breathalyzer test. That leaves you with a jury being instructed that there is a presumption you were drunk that you now have to overcome. Even though I find such presumptions completely unconstitutional the Supreme Court says they are fine.

 if he was in radley like charles supposedly was two years ago, how would wren become a licensed doctor that quickly?   if thats true then you'd have to rule out everyone, especially wren and cece. if charles is charles and hes alive, we never saw him and all the a clues are useless.   wasnt he homeschooled after he got tired of Mona blackmailing him. He even mentioned, he has a lot of free time. He could have easily just impersonated Charles in order to hide his true identity. Besides, we haven't seen Wren or Jason in a black hoodie. But we have Lucas and Cece. And i think lucas is a transgendered person so i definitely think it's him.      MMMMm you speaking to my heart right now. I'd drink the whole bottle with some smoked gouda and graham crackers.      What if Alison saw her mom give Charles a yellow dress? And then her mom told her to forget him? That could tie in the real yellow dress and the metaphor.   I think Alison saw her mom buy Charlie a yellow dress and then her mom made her forget she saw Charlie altogether and the dream became the two yellow dresses  	8
 Marxist professor Richard Wolff outlines his own thoughts on [one thing that is replacing capitalism here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOGTv3_Ukjc). As Wolff points out, it's already happening in the US in Silicon Valley organized, in fact, by mostly Republicans.  (Another 10min. video by Wolff about worker cooperatives in other places in the world is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-CuPWrGax4).)    In Colorado we have several police brutality cases being covered by national media that our local media refuses to cover.  The first thing I'll mention is that *both* the national and local media are examples of the "corporate mass media" I mentioned above.  But this is really not surprising. It's similar to the way the British corporate mass media is often more honest and insightful about US wars and geo-political skulduggery than our own media.  As they say, local politics are the most important, and that's doubly true for media capitalists.   FWIW, though it's widely attributed to him, Mussolini actually did [not say](http://www.publiceye.org/fascist/corporatism.html) that. Like Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy functioned with a symbiosis between capitalists and the state, but the fascists clearly put the state/nation ahead as their writings and actions starkly demonstrate.    but I'd really like to see some accounts of him saying the same thing WHILE he was a general just a little bit ago,  Telling blunt truths when you're a high-ranking officer on active duty is the way you get forced into retirement (and threatened with losing your retirement).  We only have to think of  US Army Major General Antonio Taguba -- a classic example of a truth-teller being forced into retirement.   "...[T]he commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture....There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes." -- US Army Major General Antonio Taguba, commissioned by the Pentagon in 2004 to investigate the "abuses" at Abu Ghraib.   Linux is the kernel.  As groups like Debian and the Free Software Foundation correctly point out, the operating system is "GNU/Linux." But since that is a mouthful, people typically shorten the name to "Linux."   The reality is that the US has been arming and using radical Muslim fundamentalists as American proxy forces to attack other countries for decades.  We started this under Jimmy Carter and used them to attack the progressive government in Afghanistan in Carter's plot to provoke the USSR into sending troops into Afghanistan and trapping them in a guerrilla war.  We used Muslim fundamentalists as US proxy soldiers in the 1990s in Bosnia and in Chechnya. We also used them to overthrow the progressive Libyan dictatorship and to turn that country into a feuding hellhole.  Thus, Hillary's advocacy of using Muslim fundamentalists to attack the secular Syrian dictatorship is nothing special -- it's just standard US policy.   "The greatest crime since World War II has been U.S. foreign policy." -- Ramsey Clark, former U.S. Attorney General.   This is one of the biggest untapped, easily-accessible forms of renewable energy around. Forget Wales :), this is very applicable to the NE, NW and other parts of the US.  I'm always baffled at people paying large sums of money for solar installations ([conspicuous consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption)?) that generate power only during daylight, as they ignore the brook that flows through their property and could be generating much more power 24/7.   The US government has a stated goal of "regime change" on Iran and Congress has previously (under Bush) funded hundreds of millions of dollars to achieve that goal.  Do you think this agreement alters that policy?   Good advice. But that is still no excuse for the cop's overreaction and punishment.   "Papers please."  Yet our corporate mass media denies we live in a police state.               Of course it would. But our Supreme ~~Corp.~~ Court would rule them a violation of free speech based on their erroneous capitalist assumption that "speech" equals "money".  Our existing publicly-funded campaign finance matching system worked well for many years. But then the Supreme ~~Corp.~~ Court's plutocratic rulings blew that away and Obama became the first president to abandon the government-funded finance system preferring to avoid the regulations to promote openness in campaigns and to rely on private money. Since that time the cost of elections has skyrocketed -- and rich capitalists *love* *it* that way.  Rich capitalists have taken over the country. The corporate mass media that they own have warped our values and morality to adopt the greed-based mindsets that they want us to have. We see this in many ways.  A Princeton study [recently came out](http://www.commondreams.org/views/2014/04/14/us-oligarchy-not-democracy-says-scientific-study) which reported that the US is actually an oligarchy and not a democracy. I would label the US as some sort of "plutocratic oligarchy" but that is a trivial difference. The point is the system is massively and systemically broken and mere "reforms" are not going to do anything. We need to rethink our values and make dramatic, systemic and/or revolutionary changes.   It's not a disconnect. It's capitalist corruption and our corporate-controlled government. Money rules.   "All the props of a democracy remain intact - elections, legislatures, media - but they predominantly function at the service of the oligarchy."  Richard Wolff   Is this any surprise?  Turn on your TV or the news -- what is the corporate mass media *teaching* us to be scared of? It certainly isn't global warming...   Why the downvotes? Isn't this a huge political story? Was anyone else aware of this clever scheme to allow criminal banks to suck at the public trough?  I cannot help but to think this is just a Yellow Dog Democrat response -- it's a story critical of the Obama administration's refusal to prosecute *criminal* banks and to throw banksters in prison, a story which highlights the rampant, out-of-control corruption that permeates *both* of our ruling political parties, so therefore it must be downvoted and ignored.   "And the banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place." -- Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, May 8, 2009.   I don't see the analogy.  Those now-dead Marines voluntarily joined our country's war machine in a time of war. They joined a country's military that *unapologetically* tortures people and wages unprovoked wars of aggression. They joined a military whose hands are drenched in the blood of innocents and saturated with war crimes.  Just like I wish the US military was not slaughtering people around the world, I wish those Marines were not killed. But I can hardly fault some person who objects to the crimes of our government and who is brave enough to try to provoke the apathetic American people to pay attention to our government's crimes and to counter-attack against our attacking military. Whether we want to admit it or not, the US military are legitimate targets of people wanting to fight back against the US government's immoral wars.  Let's hope we stop waging our immoral wars and that our victims accept our profound and sincere apologies and repartition payments.   "There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes." -- US Army Major General Antonio Taguba, commissioned by the Pentagon in 2004 to investigate the "abuses" at Abu Ghraib.    How do you compensate for wrongful death?  Oh, let me call our largest recipient of "Operation Bomb All the Things" -- Vietnam.  Hold on while I make the call...  Okay, Vietnam said paying war repartitions is the way. The US agreed in a peace treaty to pay Vietnam a huge sum of money for the millions of dead people and destruction we wrought on their country.  Of course, Vietnam added that the "honorable US government" then reneged on the treaty promise and never paid them a dime.   When some random person made the same points based on common sense and simple morality, no one listens.  When some retired general says it based on a nationalistic geo-political calculation, it's big news!  But we don't have a screwed up sense of moral values and way of thinking about our country and the world, do we?!   This isn't going to make our rightist wing-nuts happier about the Iran agreement. And it no doubt must make Obama and his war mongers trying to paint Russia as the new Axis of Evil all pissed off.   How sad; more needless killing.  But if it's any consolation, we're still ahead by something like a million dead Muslims compared to the number of dead Americans.   Why the surprise? When we wage non-stop wars against many different Muslim nations, shouldn't this type of thing be *expected?*  **Edit:** Hmm, downvotes. So I guess we assume that we can wage war on multiple countries and the victims will just roll over and take it and no one will rise up to try to counter-attack? That sort of attitude makes me wonder how people think.   And if we keep voting for Republicans or Democrats at the national level, that's what we'll wind up with -- more war and wasted money.  It's long past time we started building a party to represent common Americans.   Because the US has such a *great* record of fighting and winning wars!   Isn't it funny how foreign media like the BBC, the Guardian, RT, etc. often have more pointed and at the same time more accurate commentary/analysis/reporting about the US compared to our own sycophantic corporate mass media?   That *might* be a way to loosen the rigged non-debate debates that are cooked up and agreed to between the 2 parties during the actual presidential election. But I doubt it...    Moreover, former UNSCOM inspector Scott Ritter contends that the U.S. attempted to manipulate UNSCOM so that it could be used as a tool in an attempted coup against Saddam Hussein organized by the U.S. in 1996.  This is the key. Ritter, a US Marine officer, also says the US and Israel were using UN weapons inspections to blatantly spy on the Iraqi military in clear violation of the UN rules. *That* is why Iraq's Saddam Hussein started his foot dragging and resisting the inspections.  But our mass media propaganda system is *very* strong -- the US government lied through its teeth and spun Iraq's foot dragging as evidence that Iraq was hiding WMD and we later used those lies (and new additional lies) to attack, invade and occupy Iraq.  With that treacherous history of our criminal government, is it any surprise that Iran refuses no-notice inspections and is leery of inspections in general?      He could not say anything else about that insane program, but that's "nice" of Clinton to admit.  Now, how about admitting his signing of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was a massive blunder that set the stage for both the inflation and bursting of the housing bubble and the resulting banking scandals of the Bush administration?  Will Bill admit that or will that piss off too many of his and Hillary's corporate bankster friends?    If he ran as an independent then Clinton would definitely get the nod, and a three way race between D/R/I is almost certainly going to go to the republicans. So what exactly is gained from that?  We are so indoctrinated to think of politics in the binary that it shows up many ways. Not to be a personal attack or anything, but just the D/R/I shows that binary thinking.  The problem is that the parties need to stand for something -- an ideology. Sanders should not be an Independent, he should be a Socialist or a Progressive or something that has some clear mindset of what you're voting for.  The advantage of Sanders running as a third party would be to start building a real third party. If that cause Hillary to lose an election, so be it -- good.  We saw what Ross Perot's role was in the 1992 election. Perot split the vote of the right and put Clinton into the White House. Perot started to work to build the "Reform Party". The Reform Party flopped like a dying fish primarily because it had no ideology and no actual party platform positions other than wanting to balance the budget. It was not distinguishable from the Republicans or Democrats in any meaningful way. *Any* generic party that labels itself as merely "Independent" will suffer a similar fate.  The Reform Party also suffered from Perot's billionaire status. It floundered when it came to the hard drudgery work of building up a party from the grassroots. (An actual left party today could seek to use the remnants of the labor movement and other social movements for an impetus.)  What is crystal clear is where the current rule by our 2 plutocratic political parties will take us. We're fast on the road to becoming some sort of smiling fascist surveillance/police state. We've seen what voting for hope and change we can believe in has gotten us -- it's time we accepted the sad state we're in and do something different.    So I guess Sanders is supposed to run as an independent, and then split the democrat vote in the general election?  If Sanders did that, I'd vote for him. If by some miracle the corporate backers of the Democratic Party makes him their nominee, there's no way I'd vote for him.  You phrase splitting the vote as if it's some sort of cardinal sin. The bottom line is that the 2 ruling parties of the US only should get our vote if they *deserve* it -- they're not *entitled* to it.  This is what makes Sanders' home state of Vermont so great -- the left in Vermont refuses to mindlessly back the Democrats.  By Vermonters forming the Progressive Coalition, which runs many candidates for most statewide offices every election, the PC forces the Democrats to defend their left. If the Democrats try to be the center-right party that we see they are at the national level, the Democrats *lose* races -- as they should.  The Progressive Coalition functions to move the entire political spectrum to the *left* (similar to the way the Republicans' Tea Party caucus functions to move the Republican Party to the right). This is because with 2 distinct parties to the left of the Republicans the center shifts and the Republicans feel pressure to moderate their stance.  This is not rocket science.  By a progressive or someone on the political left mindlessly being a Yellow Dog Democrat you wind up becoming just like the way the Democrats treat labor -- you're ignored and taken for granted because the Democrats know you'll never vote for a Republican. The key is the organized third party to shift the spectrum.  With only 2 parties the 2 parties fight over and move to the center, with one or the other occasionally trying to move to the others' position to "steal" votes from their rival. Isn't that what we see today?  This is why it is a complete waste of time for Sanders to run as a Democrat. Not only will he never win the nomination, but he is refusing to build a third party and is ignoring the lessons of his own home state.   "I'd rather vote for something I want and not get it, than vote for something I don't want and get it." -- Eugene Debs, the socialist presidential candidate who received more than 3% of the vote for president while sitting in a jail cell for opposing WWI.  Edit: Typos, clarity.    Iranians don't get to decided whether an Islamic republic is a true republic.  You're right, the Iranians don't get to decide, the ancient Greeks who invented the terms "republic" and "democracy" and much of the west's political thinking are the ones who decided. And Iran today is a republic, just like the US and North Korea are republics, though of different strains.   Yes, the last time I saw lukewarm beer there was quite some time ago. More recent trips just changing over between Heathrow and Gatwick had normal cold beer.   I know most Americans are used to bottled piss like Bud Light,  Sadly, I probably can't argue with the characterization of "most". :(   but surely a pint on tap in an English pub has always been pretty decent.  Certainly far more decent than Budweiser or Coors or any of the other light pilsners that are standard American beers.   Exactly.

 I know! Check [this](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-02/26/spotify-axes-apps) article. Looks like the apps took away from actually listening and discovering music aside from a few key players. Musixmatch was so popular they just integrated it.    Soundrop has been removed from Spotify as have most 3rd party apps. We used to use Soundrop at work but have not been able to since they decided to do away with 3rd party apps.

Who did you tell first about the idea to affirm your desires for a superior hand dryer and how did they react to learning that you wanted to make something that blows air out instead of being sucked in?  3. Do you think your invention has revolutionized modern bathrooms across the globe and if so, how?  4. Have you ever left a restroom using your own invention saying to yourself "Wow!

If I had my way I would have gotten better speakers but as long as you have music and a comfy chair (my great grandfathers leopard colored-zebra patterned is what I use) you are golden!           perhaps but I feel that some genres still command a core following; a certain type of 'stereotypical' listener. Or it might just mean that music is more accessible and due to this people are listening to all different genres rather because they are all so easy to find. The internet is a global musical-ecosystem where all of these genres are floating around and is easy to access by all types of people. In contrast before the internet, it was much harder to find different types of music outside of what your community's radios were playing. That was why your spectrum of choice was mostly influenced by the radio and perpetuated to the other people around them and down the line to kids etc etc.    Love Streetlight Manifesto.

 This is an example of why I'd like a female OB lol   This is very good to know.  I always thought discharge meant a more thicker substance, and I started to freak out lately because it has felt as though I've mildly peed my pants.  Thank you!   That's actually pretty helpful lol,  thank you.   If the amount of discharge I'm experiencing is normal.  It is odorless and doesn't have any other symptoms with it, but sometimes my underwear just feels so wet.  They say it will increase the further you get.  Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing something similar.   Nice!   It seems that a lot of those communities create circles of friends(which you think would be great) instead of support and help anyone.    So I'm glad people found friends to be snarky with, but it is very off putting for newcomers.     Oh my god, I'm so sorry!  This is a great thing for you to share with us though, very appreciated.  Have fun with your baby girl, take it easy xoxo   My last 3D ultrasound was at 17 weeks, it still looked just like your pic.

I just finally watched this movie from start to finish.  I never realized that the few times I tried to start it before I was pretty much 95% done.  It's surprising how simple of a production that was and how many waves of emotions it made me go through.    I'm not sure how I would have  changed the ending.  But at the same time, I feel like I was craving for something more to happen.   What pissed me off was in the 3rd movie with the little girls,  some parts in the previews that made me want to see it were not in the movie!  I'm thinking of 2 particular scenes.  1. Little girl silently jumping off the second floor next to the stairs at night.  2. Little girl sitting next to mom at art easel,  explaining to mom that the ghost is right next to them and throws a can of water on the ghost to prove it.  But mostly about this movie, I was hoping to finally have closure about the house fire that they mention in movies 1, and 2.  But no, they open up a new can of worms with that weird cult, and nobody knows what's going on.  Unless I'm really missing something,  someone tell me.         Lol perfect gif.   It might taste ok, but no one can convince me to put oil in coffee.     Whoa!  Loved that song.  Actually that whole Phantom Planet album was badass.   Remind myself that the grass isn't always greener.   Oh I'm so excited for you!  I'm sure that was a long road xoxo   Those came out good!  Isn't it the funnest thing ever? xoxo   [How Tuna got his name](http://www.imgur.com/1Q9cYfm.jpeg)   "Judge Coogler addressed the couple saying, 'You robbed this child of her childhood and her soul, and a maximum sentence is the only sentence appropriate.'"  Chilling.   Omg, I forgot about that shit.  That was bad.   I was so sad about this one.   I like you.   O god!   Love them all   You did say "I dont want a boy."  I'm not putting words in your mouth here. Why someone would conceive a child knowing there would be a 50% chance of making something they don't want, blows my mind.  Why not adopt, so you know exactly what you're getting?   I really enjoy hearing stories of good mom/son relationships. I really don't know... any. Out of the 25+ men I work with (programming, so that might be a factor) and my husband/BIL no one likes their mom. Most go out of their way to avoid their mom.  You only seem to recognize positive relationships with daughters, and negative with sons, that isn't the way it is, and it isn't healthy.  The things you're saying throughout this whole thread are not specific problems to men.  Men and *women* can be shitty human beings.  For every instance you give of a shitty son, I could give you one about daughters.    I especially don't sympathize with gender disappointment, when it's based on stereotypes.     He's going to grow into the person you nurture him to be.  When I observe the people in my life and their families, it all has to do with how they are raised.  Stop comparing life with the standards in old sayings and on tv shows.  People used to live a lot differently,  and tv is fiction.  And I'm sorry but I find your post a little insensitive.  There are so many women out there who would die for the chance to have a baby, and you're disappointed by whether or not it will sit to use the toilet.   Oh boy, you are in my thoughts!   Very graceful.   Omg, how scary.  My thoughts are with you!   This is one that really makes me sad.  I would do that to my mom all the time, well into my late teens even.  I didn't really live on my own til my mid-twenties,  and this was a harsh reality.   I'm so sorry, I hear of this happening far too often.  You will be in my thoughts.   This was my problem too, so pissed!  Maybe OP is having this issue.  I've been an adult for a long time and I'm still learning things.    Yes!  Like the other person said, mine was also $65 for a 3D one.  They also do quick sneak peeks in 2D,  and you hear heartbeat for $25, definitely look into this!   My insurance only covers one at 20 weeks :(   Let me say, I had an ultrasound at 14w4d, the tech said girl.  I asked how sure she was, she said 100%.  No way I thought that was possible. Well at 20w,  still girl!    Edit: Forgot to say good luck with your anatomy scan!   Thank you for asking something I would never think of!  I'd have it altogether,  lay baby down, then be all, "wow, that can't be comfortable. "   Look at that smug, entitled face.   Yes, definitely switch now to prenatals,  but it's very good that you were intaking some of those vitamins!   I don't know the list of vitamins off hand that is required for an expectant mother, but it's not all about what you're missing.  As a pregnant women, there is also a list of vitamins that we *shouldn't* consume, and others that we shouldn't consume in high quantities.  So that is just as important to monitor,  as what you *should* be taking.    That's why prenatals, across the board, are safe and amazing.  Everyone has their own opinion on which brand is the best, but I just go by the highest concentration of the most important ingredients.   That's actually a very beautiful thing!  They said for optimum brain development,  we should start on prenatal vitamins when we start trying to conceive,  so yes, very good.   At least you didn't waste your money and did it at 14 weeks, lol.  That was pretty scary looking.  I can't wait to do one again when I'm much farther.     It's a cruel trick that pms and early pregnancy have similar symptoms.  But I don't care what people say, no such thing as a false positive.    But prenatal vitamins are so important right now, it's so early in the game that the higher amount of folic acid and dha you intake the less likely for baby to have abnormalities!     This was the only other thing I remember Omri Katz being in.   It went great!  I was nervous for no reason.  I appreciate everyone's comments to my first post,  it made me feel a lot better going into it.  I'm about 18 and a half weeks and she was measuring on target.  Looking at my little girl on the screen for 30 min was probably the best thing in life so far   [Little Maggie](http://www.imgur.com/NaNbeo0.jpeg)   Omg I love that.  Where can I get this outfit!?   Thank you!   Yay :D   Oh will do definitely :D   I really appreciate the well wishes xoxo. I'll update everyone tuesday!   Thank you, I'm trying so hard to be optimistic!  Xoxo   Oh how exciting.  It is all viewed in 2d?  Or did you also get to see in 3d?  Just curious.   I am pretty excited just to see her again,  thank you for the response xoxo   :'D Sounds great, I hope I have a similar experience xoxo Thank you   Thank you!  For some reason I'm crying reading these responses.  But I appreciate the nice response, I do feel better xoxo   Everything has been going good this pregnancy.  We found out it is a little girl, we named her Margaret.  I'm starting to feel her move a little.  I'm so in love already.  I just don't know what I would do with myself if we find out she isn't well.  Was maybe hoping to hear some nice stories of Anatomy Scans going well.  What to expect maybe, although all Dr's are different.  Thanks ladies xoxo   K   You don't understand me.  **It doesn't matter how much it is or isn't scripted, because he's not an actor.**  That means he would have to be on the Pacino level of acting for me to be convinced he was just *acting* like an asshole.  And I'm not convinced.   I could possibly see him in the future and change my opinion of him, but based on this show, he's not my favorite.   Edit: Actually,  based on this show *and* the fact he went to jail for hitting that girlfriend, is why he's not my favorite.     Aw yay!   I got it dude.  I'm not disagreeing that there are scripted guidelines for the show.    I'm saying that Coolio isn't some phenomenal actor that has the ability to change his whole persona, like your ridiculous comparison of Al Pacino who does have that capability.   Whether it is scripted or not, it still showcases his personality.   So he's an amazing actor at *playing* an asshole?  I get it now.   I wouldn't really call that *making fun of him*.     Well he was on an [episode of Celebrity Wife Swap](http://youtu.be/IXa_TtST99Y), and he was an asshole.   I live in Vegas and you can't count on this working everywhere.  Some places I would try it and ask for a beer, they would kindly tell me that I should be betting at least 25 cents a hand for free drinks.   I push pretty hard with mine, and I pivot and move so slow.  Sometimes if I have to poop or pee I can't find her, lol.  Just relax, walk around, lay down and try again.  I only had trouble a couple times, but found it within the hour.   This is exactly what I was told too OP.   I found out maybe 4w5d.  A week before I tested, I did have menstrual cramps when I was due for them, so I just had thought my period was coming, but then the cramps went away and I never got my period, lol so I tested.   What a strong blueberry you had.   I'm 17w4d and I'm just now feeling flutters.  It's pretty exciting!    I definitely wouldn't turn down the test either,  but I have two friends with perfectly healthy babies that tested positive for down syndrome.  I don't have personal experience,  just sharing the consensus of the people I know who have done it.   This gift is underrated.   I know, I sneezed hard yesterday and I feel like I fucked something up.   Confront your MIL and make her deal with her daughter.  Ugh. Sorry you have to deal with this.    Cab yes.  Personal vehicle,  still no.  You can go crazy, but not in your car, just so everyone knows.   Lol of course   I'd really need to see it.  But either way, an extra day would give you an even stronger result, so no harm in trying again tomorrow.  Morning pee is the strongest/best.   Definitely looks like a first trimester thing, by looking at the characteristics of the baby at the end.   Thank you for the response!  Will try exactly what you said.  Yes he is fixed, lol.   [Better quality](http://www.imgur.com/zMkr6yD.png)   [That's a little different than what I expected him to say.](http://www.imgur.com/2Y4r1KL.jpeg)   2 quick questions.   My house-broken shorkie still occasionally likes to urinate on the corners or furniture,  why does he pee in the correct place 90% of the time, and not the rest, any way to fix that?  He also gets crazy separation anxiety and cries if I even close a door in the house for 10 seconds, he always wants to be with us and follows us, any advice there?     [Now she plays in Tyler Perry movies](http://www.imgur.com/BEYHrY6.jpeg)   This was me last week, it eventually goes away I promise.  But what helped me the most was my nettie pot.  Omg those things are cool.   Uh. Yeaaa   He looks perfect xoxo   Very nice and classy!   We are almost due date buddies!   I've been feeling the same thing for about a week now too.  Very seldom mind you.  But I think we are feeling them!   And it looks like OP could be bending down next to him taking the picture.   [Reference](http://m.imgur.com/r/4chan/3YdJs)      I'm sorry you're going through this, I know that it's real easy to get upset in our state.  I personally don't have advice, but this seems like an issue that needs more communication so badly.  It's just going to eat you up inside if you keep quiet :(.  You don't need anything going on that makes you upset like this.       I really feel if it was seriously important,  they wouldn't have just left you a message saying to call them in the AM.  I would really hope no office works like that anyway.   Sounds like a dream! I'm jealous. Xx   Oh how exciting!  I'm so nervous about our big scan.   We are renting ours from Baby Beats, for about $20/month.  It works well for me.  I couldn't find the heartbeat til about 10w5d.  But once I found it the first time, I've never been unable to find it.  Some people say it could cause extra worry if you can't find it sometimes, but I was willing to take that risk.  Once you know what sounds to look for, it's easier.  I watched a bunch of youtube videos that helped me.   I thought the Mexican drug lord was going to be the worst of it, everything after just kept topping it.     Well, when the first time they are able to turn over is unknown, it's good to avoid the risks altogether.    Thanks xoxo   I know, I was never one of the people to tell others they should be happy they don't feel sick.  Because I know it is worrying to not feel pregnant.  But fatigue is a doozy.   Yea, my morning sickness didn't start til almost 7 weeks.  And it was only full force til about 10.5 weeks.  But the fatigue was crazy!  If you can barely keep your eyes open, that's good, it's a strong symptom!  But don't worry yourself too much, like others say, you might not get the sickness.   I just think everyone has different priorities.  You know all those assholes have smart phones.  	103
 Too bad playing sports or competitive games with pinoys happens to be the most unenjoyable way to spend time.  arrogant, loud, self-centered.  I have not had very many pleasant pinoy encounters in my lifetime.   She works out, look at those muscles.   Only new bandwagon laker fans like Mitch Kupchak, real Laker fans could give a shit about that baboon.   Git gud, these are just replay errors.   holy shit hon trash, gtfo.  no more comeback mechanics means shitty players can't win anymore.  git gud.   I hate to admit but, he suffered from some powercreep, so he ends up a lot weaker now in this patch.  I think it will be sorted out now that 6.82   6.83 is done with, hoping for 6.85.   you could say it was the fault of comeback mechanics overwhelming everyone, and TB took the brunt of the pitchforks/kneejerk.  But no one is going to see the fault of comeback mechanic, it was clear TB would have been fine had people known about Sniper/Storm/Troll at the beginning of 6.82.  At this point he's not the strongest hero, either a STR gain nerf-revert, or illusion dmg taken revert is necessary just for sake of not being so squishy.  Overall he's an okay hero, there are many shittier heroes, it's just the repeated nerfs to his squishiness make it awkward to play.  The full toolkit is not bad, silly weird nerfs like the movespeed on meta were really annoying, hopefully he can change that and nerf something else less annoying.  Only real TB players would understand why he's in such a bad position, so there's not much point in bringing up TB anymore.  Fuck comeback mechanic era, caused so many unnecessary nerfs to heroes that ended up shit now.   it's hard to play, but it's not impossible.  	8
 He used his waypoint.    Make like an envelope, and leave!    Serious question and all respect to this guy (rip).

Turns me on   Solitare    I love you and I need to tell my scary moment.    I was in 10nth grade and went to Mexico for 10 days for my Spanish class.   Anyway one destination was Playa de Carmen?   If I remember correctly.    The class was looking for something to do when we stumbled upon snorkeling.    We all had to pay and watch a quick tutorial on the Do's n Don'ts.     We took boats out to our location of course and the whole class jumped in (20+).    We were rushed on this whole situation cause a storm was coming in and no one wanted to go thru the process of getting refunded.         Anyway a girl n I were swimming around a pretty neat spot with coral Reef just a couple feet under us.      Which was scary cause the waves started pulling me down into the reefs and u learned you didn't want to touch them.         The waves started increasing in size and rain started to pour.      I took a quick glance up while trying to float myself away from the reefs to see the whole class dispersed amongst the water.        It got pretty sketchy quick when lighting and thunder arrived along with a heavy down pour.     With the waves increasing I kept getting hurled to the coral reefs that were inches underneath me.   I kept my head under to make sure I could get out of this clearing and not get hurt.    As soon as I made it out I looked up and couldn't see any of my classmates nor any of the boats.   I could barely even make out where the beach was.     This is when I went into complete panic mode and started swimming frantically to Just a dot in my vision.    As I swam and swam All I could think about was drowning or getting washed out to sea.    I finally made it close to a boat and started yelling.     Turns out the boat I swam to was not a tourist boat but a couple Mexicans just doing their thing.    They helped me on and brought me to land.      The teacher started doing head counts after that.    He dabbled in some coke    No he just experimented and had fun like every other person in their 20's.   But when you are a public figure no one likes dealing with those questions.        One of Jimmy's interns is a reddit user. (That I know, I'm sure there's more) The show slowly started incorporating bits and pieces from Reddit users to the show.     I'm sure he will do it as long as the drug related questions from his earlier years don't flood the AMA.

So pretty much a replay of "The one who must not be name's" tribute?   What is this down time you speak of?   When I was in Culinary school it was color coded by kitchen. One was blue, one was red, and so on.   And the razor???   Old Town St. Chuck would be the perfect place for a shop of this nature.   BAZINGA!   AKA foot traffic   Yeah just checked out their site and not one mention of a physical location.   These poker ones are always the best IMO.   Shout out back to you from North County. Never heard of those two places but I'll check them out. Thanks for mentioning them.   Don't mind it one bit. I was just wanting to know in case I wanted to get my hands on something without having to wait on it.   This might be a long shot but I'm looking for a shave supply store or stores in the St. Louis area. Born and raised here and the only place I know of is Art of Shaving. Any help would be appreciated because I hate going to the corporate drug stores and looking at the very slim selection.   "I've had five kitchen jobs and I've walked out of or quit without notice in everyone."  Yeah not really helping your case here. Just by reading this(can't believe I read it all) it sounds to me like you have a big ego and when somebody does something to counter that ego you say fuck this I'm out.   As a word of advice suck it up, drop the ego, and do your job without fuckin quitting.   Don't lose your shit and get yourself in the weeds.   Hot Damn! I thought we were the only ones.   Congrats   Send him to fetch a bucket of steam.   This brings back memories.   I know all about your criminal charges, restraining orders against you, and your kids being taken away from you. It took me a long time to get over you, and still till this day I can't listen to our songs. I mean you were the first girl I ever said I Love You to face to face. Oh in case you're wondering I ending up finding an amazing woman who saved my life by actually giving a shit about me instead of what dick was fucking her like you did.  P.S. I made that move to Georgia like I dreamed of. Only lasted 2 1/2 weeks before I moved back home but I at least did it.   That's great. That's really great. Now don't be a stranger and have a nice day.   Grab some food off the shelves and lock my ass in the bathroom.   Ever seen the movie Waiting? From what I've heard it's pretty much that to a T.   http://i.imgur.com/yRO9z8n.jpg   YAY Pepto Bismo!   Had the same thing happen here with Longhorn. Every single position was open at one location.   Shit with that overtime you can buy your own restaurant.   Not the worst idea I've read on this sub but a very close second. If you go ahead with this not only will you be ran over so quick that you won't even see it, they will back up and hit you again.   This or for like they do for the luaus in Hawaii and cook it in a hole.   I think I got stupider reading some of those comments.   In reality all this right here is all you need.   Nix the culinary school and the debt and get a job in another kitchen. Some of the skills you learned at the current place may be transferable without you even knowing it.   That's when hot behind comes into play. lol   This. It'll make him change his mind real quick.   You tried shaving the cat again didn't you?   You pretty much found it here.   Congrats and welcome to the club.   An icicle fell off the house and broke my glasses I SWEAR.   Contact a local food truck and ask if you can stage for a run in order to see if that's what you really want.   That girl really had no fucks to give when she modeled.   There is actually a pizza cheese out there that has little pieces of pepperoni in it. Parents used to buy it all the time for my brother and I when we were younger but now it's very hard to find.  With this though I call laziness or the inability to spell mozzarella.   Yeah that page is off the wall crazy. They posted some shit one time about killing Pitbulls in order to rid the world if "devil dogs." WTF!   I use the stuff religiously because there's not much I like the smell of and I can attest to that. Used to get bad irritation if I left my beard grow out for a week and it helped clear it up.   Smurf cumshot   Fast food or a liquid diet of alcohol.   After reading the rest of the comments why do I feel that we'll be seeing this on /r/shittykickstarters within the next week?   That's the thing though unless you specifically said no emails how would they know you barely check your email?   I see no problem with it. I've known people who fill out an app and get a call an hour later to interview the next day.   Hell yeah do it. It's not only helping you with the skills it's also helping that resume for the future.   Does offering them a half eaten can of ravioli count in this???   Nothing like a nice ass welcome back.   Sadly it didn't click until this comment.   Watching it live now and the bids are not really coming in for it. Sold for $585,000.   I must have this in my life.   Please tell me it's Up Up, Down Down, Left Right, Left Right, B, A, Start.   If it moves and it shouldn't use duct tape, if it doesn't move and it should use WD-40.   Went through this myself almost 9 years ago not to that extinct but it still took me a month and a half to recover. Soreness from the incisions lasted much longer though. Anyway hang tough and welcome back.   Now that's a bomb I wouldn't mind getting in the mail. Nice job Alebue and congrats Wew5450.      Sadly can't seem to find this video anymore.   That was what my mind immediately went to when I saw the mean green. Gonna go with a simple WTF for this pic.   We need to stop kissing every body's ass with this new stadium and upgrade what we got. I for one will say I'd gladly help the Rams and Uncle Rico pack.   Get a free pit pass from your local FORD dealer   Holy Fuck there's so many misguided info in this thread it's like going to a Dr. in a dark alley.   Cuts: As long as they're not deep clean it with soap and water, apply pressure, and raise your hand above your head until the blood stops. Apply bandage, glove it, and get back to work.  Burns: Cool not cold water like has been said and polysporin.      Ooh that shit always makes me happy.   Wait a minute here. You want US to determine if you're crazy or not??? Hahahaha ok then.   Label that shit. No need for a screw up that can be easily avoided.   This and to add another non-cooking related app: Pandora to bring a lil music to the kitchen.   Looks like it's trying to be like EMT INA way and failing miserably.   There are rougher versions of SOS pads.   Same here and the only one I know of is that yellow one.   In a freaking heartbeat.  You should x-post this over on r/kitchenconfidential   That is a huge ass Holy Fuck You.   Nuke it or deep fry it, and they gave what they want sans char.   Bye Felicia!   Picking up a couple boxes Friday.   Wait so you're telling me restaurants close??? All thus time I thought the locks were for show.   Haha good point.   With mine I rinse it with hot water, shake the excess off, and tap it on a towel.   Yep. Forgot what the ratio was but it was in the post about the hipster douche not allowing chef coats in his kitchen.   Like the other two this is a story I'd like to hear.   Steak Tartare   Two Words: Stress Reliever. Can't really smoke a full blown cigar in 5 minutes so I went the e-cig route and it has helped just as well.   Bahahaha and very accurate.   Here in St. Louis we can buy beer and liquor at the same place any day we want. Moved to Warner Robins, GA for 2 weeks and it was the first time I ever saw where you could buy beer at the grocery store but not liquor. you also couldn't buy anything on Sunday so Saturday night was alcohol run nights.   We have this same thought about East St. Louis, IL.   Did you base your character Red Foreman off of anybody in particular?   It'll be a fuckin bloodbath.   Damn man i'm sorry. Went through something like this before just not to this extinct. Had a buddy pass out in the kitchen, and nobody could wake him up for anything. Called paramedics and turns out he had a heart defect he told no one about. Was torn up the rest of that day.  It sucks I know but I say go out and honor him even if you guys weren't that close.   Welcome back. Loved you on Scrubs and recently saw you on Jim Hensons Creature Shop. Question is: Who's your fave Muppet?     Oh yes I hate my chef whoa is me. Actually i'm the Chef and don't fall for the gluten free fad. Yeah if you have an actual medical condition that's fine but don't come to me asking for gluten free just cause it's the hip thing to do.   Leaving your ego and deflating your big head at the door. Those two things don't belong in any kitchen   Now in light of what Chef McDouchebag said about not liking chef coats: If I'm ever in a kitchen like his please shoot me. When I have my coat on it feels me with pride knowing I'm doing what I love. He on the other hand sounds like he's trying to make up for a fuck up he once made.   Yes, absolutely do it. Not only will you learn a lot it'll look damn good on your resume. Good Luck and mist importantly have fun.   Almost had to go to the 10 second rule    Hiding a body for the mob. Shh...   As a yankee with southern blood I can say that means they're damn good.   Oh good God not with the gluten free shit. If you don't want to use butter please pack your knives and find a different job.   Care to elaborate?   If I was that other student I would have asked for the plate # of the bus you ran me over with.   If you don't enjoy it I say run. No use in doing something you don't enjoy doing. Good luck and hope you find something you love and stick with it.   Well thank God I know where the mute button is. Booker T is a great wrestler but him on the announce team is like nails on a chalkboard.   The money the owners are paying out for that could go for a new range w/o the BS.   My brother is an engineer with U.P. and he was telling us one time that there's a section of track here in St. Louis by Jefferson Barracks National Cemetary that has watch out for explosives sign posted. This is due to unearthed grenades and mines still possible in the area.   From the picture it looks like a Mom   Pop place so there is no way that's Kobe beef. If it was the food cost alone would be so much that they'd have to charge $25-$30 for the burger, and that's after the standard 30%-35% markup. Oh and those onion are way too thick.  Source: I'm a Chef.   Exactly! WTF is a tap chop?   I'd go with a dark colored mechanic like button-up shirt and anything but a denim apron.  	108
 I wonder what living conditions most of the workers came from? We're framing this in western standards and the poor in India, Pakistan, etc do not live any where near western standards.   Not saying this is OK, but they may be living in better conditions than they did at home.   With low end being lipton, store brands, etc. Companies that sell just Black Tea, Green Tea.   Companies that actually sell regional and loose teas are getting into mid grade imo. While there's a difference between Twinings bagged and loose Darjeeling, it's not as drastic as the difference between a generic black tea and any Twinings tea     High grade is artisan type teas, well regarded estates, fermentation methods, regions or in some cases even individual plants, etc.   Where do you draw the line between the 3?     When being on the court and on the video screen has more value than the reward.   Wu Liang Hong Mao Feng Yunnan Black Tea is a good example of a decent Yunnan tea.   High Mountain Red Ai Lao Mountain Black Tea is a unique tea from the region and has many characteristics of a nice Taiwanese black tea.   Real fresh teas have a unique flavor. I like them once they've aged a few weeks or months.    I think loose leaf tea drinkers accept variation from year to year. People who drink bag tea are after a consistent tea, year in, year out. The Prince of Wales I drink today tastes exactly like it did 20 years ago. My Yunnan loose leaf teas taste different this month than they will in a couple more months. I just got an aged Yunnan black tea from 2012 from Tea Trekker.   Not necessarily. While many cheap teas use the fannings, I doubt if companies like Twinings and other mid to high end bag teas use them. They probably grind leaf for their mix. Unlike loose teas where each crop may be very different, bag tea remains the same year to year.    Have you gone to Yunnan Sourcing's Chinese site? When you first go to their site, the center image sends you to their international site where they have a lot more tea.With what I've read about Ali Express, I wouldn't risk any money with them without specific recommendations.   Tea bags are almost always ground tea. Full tea leaves expand too much for a tea bag. I drink primarily Yunnan black teas and oolongs. Green tea and oolongs keep me up at night if I have them after dinner. I find if I brew a relatively weak Yunnan gold, the caffeine is minimal. They're also very fruity teas and work nicely with a bit of honey.   Thanks for sharing this information   The same way Tolkien knew what a Balrog looked like so Jackson could put it in the movies. ;-p    Watch out for these guys: http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/07/how-mit-students-scammed-the-massachusetts-lottery-for-8-million/   http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/02/02/statistician-cracked-lottery/   Examples of both drawings and scratch offs   It's unfortunate they are on different networks, but it would be cool to see Elton Brown and Gordon Ramsey do some cooking challenges. Guiding teams to a final winner and/or One on One challenges between them.   I think Elton would guide a team better and improve their skills quicker. I think Gordon would Psych Elton out a bit on one on one's.   One of the most beautiful sounds of the north.   Regarding communism, read about why the New Deal was made and the strength the socialists were gaining across the US at the time. Look at how workers were being treated. Look at the consolidation of wealth. We were Bangladesh in a land of supposed freedom and equality. Communism was only a threat because people wanted to share in the wealth they created through their labor. It wasn't a communist plot as much as it was the industrialists wanting to live like European royalty treating their workers like peasants. Creating laws to protect workers and provide some basic care for all citizens saved our nation. Preventing them from becoming peasants under the industrialists instead of peasants under a communist government was a major turning point in our history and gets very little discussion in the history books we use in school.   I am somewhat amused by you saying the best pure democracy you can think of, restricted the voting to a very small group of people; the owner class. I guess some of the tribes making up the Iroquois confederacy were the closest I can think of. Almost all people had a say in important decisions affecting the tribe, and pretty much the freedom to do what they wanted as individuals.   Even then, they had to have someone representing them in cross tribal meetings.   In one of my media classes we talked about how it was not even the angle reporters put on a story, but what stories they are given to write about that affected what news we read. It's why the OWS movement got so little attention. What the movement represented was a direct assault on the status quo. Our police force does what it always does in times of struggle, represent the government. They are not the protector of the people. They are the protectors of the status quo. As are the corporate sources of news.   In a poli sci class I had, they talked about how you can see the true interests and driving forces of a government by looking at who the laws are written to protect. Labor laws, environmental laws, laws for legal recourse against injury and damages, trade laws, regulations to protect free enterprise or monopolies. How did the law work for a black guy in the south until the 50's-60's? The new trade agreements are written in such a way that the trade laws will supersede local and national laws and disputes are handled through the trade courts, not the courts of the nations. Who are those laws written for?   When WWII started Hearst and a few others controlled a large segment of the news most people read in the cities. Many of them were supporting the fascist ideals of Hitler. Many of our most powerful leaders of industry supported Germany. A general actually told the president about a plot the industrialists and military leaders had to grab power and ally with Germany. It's an extremely interesting piece of history to explore in depth. One of the first things any revolutionaries or conquerors want to do is control the information. If you investigate their attempt to grab power in the US, read what the media owners who were part of the plot were writing in their papers. And then reconsider the unbiased media ideal.  Iraq is the best recent example. When the war drums were being pounded, most of my sources of information were calling them on their lies. The mainstream corporate media were banging the drums with really good stories and images. And our first videos of guided missiles for even better show. Now, it's Oh if we had only known then. Or well, it really had to be done at some point.   An expansionist Israel, The Sunni/Shia civil war, our choosing sides in the civil war and the location of some of the best crude oil on the planet are the 4 main causes of the tinderbox over there. And lurking in the background, Russia and China provide military and technical materials and knowledge to Syria, Iran, India and others in the region. Our propaganda does not fly with the leaders in China and Russia. They know the truth, not the distortions we are told. They know why we have an issue with Iran. They know why we support the sheiks and Israel and they knew why we went into Iraq both times. As do the leaders in Europe, and most of the rest of the world. They provide their own propaganda, designed for their country.   And yes, the beginning of our invasion of Iraq was easy. As I said before, Kuwait was side drilling into Iraq's reserves. Iraq went to the US since we were allies for both. We told them it was a middle east affair. They went to the regional Arab states group who told them it was an argument between them. Iraq then told everyone they were going to attack and nationalize Kuwait, yada yada. Everyone sat back and watched Iraq build up their forces for a few weeks. Lines of tanks, jets in advanced bases, infantry spread out in a line. All ready for the invasion. If the US did not want Iraq to attack Kuwait, they only had to send one company or even a division to make it a firm line in the sand. A marine company can be in place in most places in the Middle East in under 24 hours and probably a light division as well. Attack this line and you are attacking the US. There was a fair amount of discussion about this at the time in military journals. What Saddam did not know was our alliance was over and we were going to destroy his military once he got them all lined up nicely for our advanced aircraft and guided missiles. Pre-made for incredible kill numbers and a great show of force at home and around the world. Threat against Israel from Iraq brought from an annoyance to nothing in the blink of an eye. Saddam's response, cancel the oil contracts with the west and give them to Russia and China. The west's response, re-invade and put someone in power who gave the contracts back.   I worry about our future when we are sending all of our jobs overseas. Kids can't find jobs and our middle class is shrinking. Wealth is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. We're allowing big money to have more and more influence on our elections. Through the 70's most improvements in productivity gave almost equal growth in wages across the board. Now those productivity increases go to the top with greater and greater difference between wages at the top and bottom. The elite don't care about countries. The top 1% lives pretty much the same all over the world. They actually have it better in the 3rd world because of how cheap it is to hire people. Not even counting land, you can build a huge royal estate in India for way under 10% of what it would cost you in the spoiled west where people aren't willing to work hard for reasonable pay. Notice the sarcasm at the end. I think it is extremely unwise to move all of our manufacturing and sharing of advanced technical knowledge with our global adversaries like we are with China. We are destroying our environment. I can't hunt what I used to hunt because we have turned 80% of our farmland into subdivisions. I can't fish where I used to because the rivers have become too poisoned to have healthy populations. I have to drive N of Lake Superior from where I am to catch fish like I did 25 years ago or drive to the Dakotas to hunt bird like I used to. My kids are having kids now and I wonder what the world will be like in 25 more years.   I'd like to see our 2 party system end. To achieve that, we would have to form gov's from multiple party's like many democracies throughout Europe and around the world. A 2 party system is inherently adversarial, which makes sense since our rules are written by lawyers. When your only tool is a hammer, all problems look like a nail. Their system is purely adversarial. I'd like to see a national or state holiday for all elections and make our voting far more secure and easier to do. I'd like to see elections with no outside money influencing them. We own or regulate the airwaves and cable/cellular bands, we can require all media airing on those airwaves (including cable) to offer free time for debates and limited air time for them to explain their views in their own setting. I'd like to see a company like Shell fined so hard for hard for their environmental and safety incompetence that bankrupt people up and down the coast that it jails some and nearly bankrupts them. The cost of not protecting the environment has to be so high, that they put extreme effort into preventing it. As long as we only slap their hands, they will continue to do it. Until we slap them so hard with fines, things like this will continue to happen. As long as the rules and regulations are written in such a way that we protect them over us, it will continue to happen. I think we should find key industries that employ a lot of skilled and hard working people and protect those industries through our trade policies. I think we should promote other countries to make the goods that don't fall in those categories. I think with our ingenuity and work ethic, we should have a positive trade balance with the rest of the world. People around the world love our stuff. Which is really just our brands and many of those brands are not even made in the US anymore. Which is why we have such a trade deficit. We import almost as much oil as we export. We export far more refined petroleum products than we import, so it is not our energy and fuel needs that cause our deficits. It's because 80+% of what we own is made in Asia. It seems like most people have jobs either moving or selling products made somewhere else. Our service based economy of the future supposedly. It makes for a very top heavy economy benefiting global oligarchs with national loyalty being nothing more than a coin to use at the bargaining table. I think we should find strong allies in key locations around the world, treat them right, press for a gov where the people feel they are treated right and have a strong middle class to increase national stability and help them build the infrastructure to help them achieve that.   NO, Lake of the Woods is ours too. Next you'll want all our loons.   Someone must have been really tired of coming up with names for new birds. "I'll name that the black and white hawk eagle bird thingy.   On a serious note, as a birder, I'd like to see them. Thanks for sharing.   Someone designing IKEA mugs saw that somewhere, thought it made a good draining method, and claimed it as a benefit. I doubt if the IKEA designer was the first to do this. I've seen it before on cups and thought it was part of the manufacturing process. Then I realized it prevented them from pulling up coasters, I really liked the design then.   I agree, I think from the near site we are within degrees of each other. It's as we get out to the edge that the differences are more noticeable,   Terrorism is the modern day communism. It's a catch all to justify our actions. War is profit. Huge profit. Eisenhower made a statement about the military industrial complex, that I am sure you are aware of, based on the breadth of knowledge you've shown. Even during the birth of England, France, Spain, Russia, etc., factions within the barony and church guided their actions as much as the kings or queens. Even in China, Japan, etc with their warlords. It was also not unusual for other countries to influence the politics of another. The East India Trade Company is a great example how private industry started influencing governments as well, once democracies overtook monarchies.   Can you provide any examples now or in the past of this real democracy or pure democracy you feel is the standard and not based on set laws, where all laws are voted on by every citizen instead of elected officials? Democracies are governments elected by the people. The whole concept of a democracy is all citizens elect representatives who are supposed to follow the will of the people. Democracy does not mean every rule and law is passed by every citizen each election cycle. We would not need elected officials in this pure democracy you reference as all decisions would be made by each of us through voting. I don't think even a utopian view of democracy is what I think you define democracy as and is certainly not any definition I ever heard in any poli-sci or gov classes in college or before. It's almost the angle I read from anarchists; no gov, we can make all decisions as individuals and don't need gov defined structures.   I imagine both our views are much more nuanced than what we can get across on reddit. I really think we are both over simplifying the issue to fit within a post too, when there are hundreds of page papers written about what we are talking about, from all angles. I agree with those who feel we could have done the same thing the west did after WWII, to the countries in S and C America as well as Mexico. We could have built modern industry and had people get paid enough to build a middle class, which is the cornerstone of any country. Japan and Germany both have very strong economies with a balanced middle class. Instead we chose to support the oligarchs and allow the average citizen to get crapped on for our benefit. So we can have cheap fruit, oil, minerals, and any other resource they have that we need.   And even this is a massive oversimplification. Japanese and German society is far more structured than anything in S or C America or most parts of Africa or the middle east. The priorities, cultural values, work ethics and many other things have an impact as well. And once again, have hundreds of papers from all angles.   I've enjoyed reading your views and it made me think and investigate and question some of my facts/beliefs/opinions in more detail. Often what we want to believe is different than the facts. We are all good at using cognitive dissonance to see the world the way we want. Sometimes we need to verify the things we want to believe even more than the things we don't want to believe. It's so easy to accept faulty data when it's the data that matches our views.   I use news sources that have been proven accurate to me over the years. Many news sources followed the gov line about Iraq, Iran Contra, 9/11, etc. or about GMO foods, radiating our food supply, industrial farms, raw sewage being used as fertilizer, toxins killing birds, bees, etc.  A few were telling us the truth. The sources that lied about each, are pretty consistent and some only told the truth about some things and not others. It seems like most people continue to use sources that have repeatedly distorted reality. Not only leaving them less informed, but even worse, misinformed But it's a distortion that matches their beliefs, so they continue to read and watch their Washington Times, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, etc. The lies they have been told, do not trump the worldview they want to maintain. I personally believe very little the corporations tell me through their newspapers and other media. We are a long way from a Walter Cronkite or  newspapers that investigate and publish stories about the little guy being stepped on by the big guy. Our media now represents the big guys. The little guy does not have a voice that can be heard through the trees. By no means, do I have the lock on truth or how to provide world, let alone national  'best methods' to govern the masses in a dog eat dog world. Facts not based on pure science are like a huge disco ball sending facts from thousands of different mirrors. We find the ones that match our view, or construct our view from a few cherry picked facts that match our greater view. I grew up hunting and fishing. I love nature, being outside, getting my own meal from the land and water. I despise what is being done to nature to benefit a few, with protections that prove faulty time and time again. Protections often written by the lobbyists, for the few. This view makes me believe corporate malfeasance involving the environment, when I read about it, without the usual verification of facts. There are too many past examples of it happening and being whitewashed or swept under the rug as soon as possible. I believe powerful industry, led by what are for all practical purposes; oligarchs, use our military and intelligence services to protect their interests overseas through the power their money has on our gov. This doesn't preclude WWI and WWII when we went in to stop Allied/Central Powers, or Korea against Russia and China. (That whole Russia China alliance after WWII is very interesting to read about. They were not the most trusting of allies or working toward the same goals.) All 3 are much more complicated than the fairy tales and fables we are fed, but if you don't protect your allies, you diminish your power in the world.   There are actually a lot of good authors that use the early19th century to the mid 60's in Asia as their settings. It's also a region I visit and try to stay up on current news.  I've watched what our economic and trade policies have done for the few, and what they've done to our job market and our middle class. When I read about a new economic or trade policy written by the same people who have given us the same thing over and over, I don't believe a word they say. I've already heard their distortions and fantasies for the last 20+ years. I've seen who they benefit. I'm lucky, my wife is lucky, my 2 kids are lucky. We've never had a major injury or sickness. We work in the fields we went to school for. We've never been unemployed. All but my wife have 4 years degrees with no student loans. We all have supplemented medical through work and decent benefits. But I know so many people who have a lot of skills, worked hard and still saw their jobs leave when their employers moved to a free trade, low wage country. I have a lot of strong protectionist views.   These and other life experiences, education and readings have colored my view of the world. I'm ignorant about far more than I am knowledgeable about. People consider the word ignorant to be a negative term, but we are all ignorant about many things. I know virtually nothing about brain surgery, rocket science, astronomy, physics or most advanced sciences. My level of ignorance about those subjects is vast. I'm a news hound and enjoy researching topics I become interested in. I enjoy current events around the world. I like following the money to understand a main facet driving war, or allowing and even supporting such short term thinking about the environment and the profit some can suck from it in the short term, with no regard for the very long term ecological cost.  I 'm also a war gaming fan from the old Avalon Hill games like Squad Leader, and Eastern and Western Front. and miniature battle recreations in GameCons. Now I enjoy games like EU3 and SPWINWW2 (A remake and expansion of the old Gary Grigsby Steel Panthers.) because they are more playable from the same computer or internal network and don't require all the setup. From a purely strategic angle, my view changes quite a bit about our global actions. No games can recreate the global fencing between nations and religious, racial, and philosophical differences creating variables in regional and global plans. Plus there is the influence of all sorts of special interest groups and individuals within a nation on their economy and relations with other nations. The global economy and banking system, religious extremism, nationalism, environment vs growth in the 3rd world, are all subjects that we could study and read thousands of papers on from experts explaining a variety of problems and their solutions. Each facet from that disco ball is worth a discussion like we've had. And would likely be as interesting.   Nor is Saudi Arabia, but like Pakistan they cast a blind eye to the powerful elements in their country and gov who do support terrorism. Bin Laden lived in Pakistan with full awareness by many throughout their gov. Powerful elements in the Saudi gov funded the terrorists for 9/11. If this was happening from Venezuela, we would have invaded them.  Instead we invade Afghanistan, where it just so happens we've been trying to build a pipeline for years. We being oligarchs from the west. And the pipeline is moving along quite nicely now.   Yes, it is wrong to overthrow govs, as we've done throughout S. and C. America to protect companies like United Fruit. We purport to stand for freedom and human rights, which is window dressing. We support the most viscous dictators around the world and ridicule democratic countries who won't allow us to have their resources for pennies on the dollar. Look at countries like Dominican Republic and Haiti or Honduras and Panama, or Columbia and Chile. What kind of  life have we created for all but a few in those countries? These are countries we either put leaders in power or greatly influenced who was in power. We got sweet heart deals for their resources by lining the pockets of a few people. Now any future gov who challenges those long term corrupt and unfair deals is made a pariah. How our power manifested itself throughout the region, and continues to, shows our true colors. As does our silence about the sheiks behavior in the middle east. If we came right out and said, we're like China or Russia and we care more about the resources and strategic value of  a country than the people of the world, I would not have an argument. But when we hold ourselves up as the beacon of democracy and high regard for human rights, we also can't begrudge people who show the hypocrisy of what amounts to our Corporate Statement/Pledge.   Democracy comes in many forms. It just means elected government, at its most base definition. As a republic, we do not have mob rules. Our system of checks and balances through the division of power is supposed to protect us from dictators.  We have a basis of laws that protects all equally. Well except slaves when we were created as a nation. Or gays now. And others in between; women, laborers, kids, fringe religions, etc. I can't think of any pure democracy where people vote on anchor laws every cycle. There are republics, parliament monarchies, theocracies, socialist, and all sorts of other flavors of democracy. Mob rule democracy is not something I am aware of in the world now or historically so I do not know what you mean by pure democracy.   Yes, our country offers many opportunities. But Jose Mujica in Uruguay achieved the same thing from a lesser background. All throughout the world people are able to live their dreams. But if you are already born on 3rd base, your opportunities are far greater. I live in a city known for its bars and restaurants. There is one family that pretty much has their way when they want to open a new one. Everyone else spends 5  10 years jumping through hoops. And even then, it's extremely challenging. The same thing plays out in all levels of our gov, and all other govs around the world. Corruption helps those in power and with power more than the little guy trying to rise up.   There have been hundreds of articles written by a wide range of people discussing how prophetic both authors were. In some areas we have grown beyond them and others are still in their infancy. To deny the similarities between the war on terrorism and what both authors describe requires a very narrow view of both.     People who have no opportunity are vulnerable to all sorts of shady employers. Read about people working on fishing boats, it's pretty much the same in some parts of the world as the Middle East and their construction firms. Recruiters promise them all sorts of things without telling them the costs. Once they are on the job, their ability to leave is extremely restricted.   On the other hand, we're putting their living conditions in a western framework. They did not come from western living conditions. The poor in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc live in and eat worse than homeless trash divers in western cities. Those who survive can come back and get married and maybe start a little business or buy a little land. In their terms, it may be their only chance to survive at all.   Our allies in the Middle East show the hypocrisy of our concern for human rights around the globe.   It's a pure money grab. It's like the Olympics, billions spent to build an infrastructure that will help bankrupt a country later. In Qatar, they spend human lives instead of bankrupting their country like Greece, but they will still be left with empty stadiums like Brazil.   A few people, the deciders, make millions to screw the people under them. And no lube is offered.   FIFA is an example of how the oligarchs think everyone else should be treated. We're all BIC lighters to use up.   Whistling the banjo solo from Deliverance   I realize the current war was not purely about oil and in 91 it was about destroying their military. There is a lot more about Iraq/Kuwait than most people know. Kuwait was stealing oil using slant oil wells that went into Iraq's reserves. All the big players said it was between the 2 of them. The manipulators wanted the results they got. Iraq's military was destroyed.   You don't mention the Shiite/Sunni divide and how we've taken sides in that because of the power the Sheiks have in our gov, through their wealth. Or how that divide is a big cause of ISIS, the Taliban and most other Sunni funded groups. It is the Sunni's who caused 9/11 and most other Arab based terrorist attacks. It is also the Sunni side we have taken in their religious war. Once again, because of their oil money buying our gov.   And using Israel as an example is bad form imo. They are the aggressors and we do not hold others to the same litmus paper we hold them to. Israel can have nukes, but no one else in the region. Having and using them are also 2 different things. Pakistan has them and they are one of the most unstable, terrorist funding  govs in the world. But they know, using them is the end of their country. Same for India and even Iran if they get one. What we don't like is nukes prevent other countries from attacking them. Being a bully is only effective until your victims get guns. Nukes on the global scale are based on the same reasoning the CCW groups use to allow them to carry guns. They are for their protection against aggressors.   I also do not buy that Israel deserves or should have gotten Israel based on biblical text. "Our sky God says this is our land" being taken as legit is Monty Pythonish to me. Giving them a country is fine, but make it some place they actually currently live and have a population. Not in the backyard of their adversaries. Maybe England could have given them land, or the US, or even Germany since they were the most recent gov who wanted to wipe them out. Germany could have been forced to provide land for Jews, Gypsies and any other native group they wanted to kill off.   I also believe there is irrefutable proof that about 90% of our wars/police actions we've been involved in, were to protect our access to resources in that region/country. About 9% were to protect strategic locations, and 1% were legit and used to knock down an aggressor with regional ambitions. Propaganda wise, it was always to protect the people or our allies.   And to finish up with, The Project for the New American Century wrote the blueprint we are still following, in the mid 90's. Our 2 party system is not democracy. Funding our election system with money from the powerful only helps the powerful. We are an oligarhy under the guise of a democracy.   I'm also not saying it is right or wrong. All of global politics is about creating the right lies to allow them to behave the way they want. We live in 1984 and Brave New World. Huxley and Orwell were more prophets than the writers of most religious texts.   My buddy just bought a house outside Flint for 16k and put another 15k redoing the roof, new siding, new drywall, plumbing, electrical, flooring, etc. He's a handy guy so he did a lot of the work. But for 32k he has a nice 1100 sq ft house and 2 car garage.   edit - and over 2 acres.   I realized that. My response was more tongue in cheek than anything.   You are right. Russia, Venezuela, Norway, England and other countries have increased their production and we are not as vulnerable to embargoes from the middle east. But oil is sold as a commodity on the global market. We import and export almost the same amount right now. Very few gas station chains get gas from only one country. Marathon has a huge local refinery and you see trucks of all manufacturers filling up there. Marathon gets the oil they refine from all over the world. Something like 30% of it is coming from shale in Alberta and the Dakotas.   But ABSCAM was not about oil, it was about money and the Arabs ability to buy favors. It's like one of the top articles in /news about the gyrocopter pilot. Money poisons politics in our country and if you have enough money, you can turn our politicians into puppets.   http://www.teachat.com/viewtopic.php?p=194093   It does not directly reference blue scale, but you may find their article informative and relevant.   Supposedly, Hefner was drinking coke all night and would not touch one that he did not open himself. Everyone pretty much knew you were getting dosed at that show. Hefner avoided it.   Did I say oil?  It's the money. The Koch's and Soros' don't have to give oil either to have their paid puppets do their will.   I agree with your statement, "they have not been less independent of Saudi oil in a century".   It's there. Earl Grey is a black tea. Constant Comment is another black tea not shown. They both add flavoring, like bergamot for Earl Grey and a variety of things in Constant Comment so they may be considered herbal, but the additional temp for the black tea leaves would make it out of range for them.    I've never used the pitcher or understood why they were used. I just read it's also called the fair cup. I had noticed how as you poured, each cup would be a bit darker than the previous cup. This allows everyone to have the pour blend, for lack of a better term.   Thanks for piquing my interest and allowing me to learn something new.   http://www.teavivre.com/info/how-to-use-gongfu-tea-set/   Just as an aside; was it just a bagged tea, a restaurant specialty loose tea, or ...? Not mentioning the tea itself is more like something I see in /teaporn.   Edit-typo   And the best I've been able to come up with in my trips to France is Kusmi tea. Sort of the Twinings of France. Since I've found this site, I hope to go back and try some of the shops people have talked about.   LMN  :-)   http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/14/america-s-allies-are-funding-isis.html   Maybe if we can get our allies to quit funding them, we could make some inroads against their expansion.  Unfortunately, as ABSCAM proved, our gov is owned or rented by the oil sheiks.   http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/us-senate-intelligence-officials-nsa   We've known about this for a long time. This linked article is from 2013. It's just that a vocal anti gov group in the US has decided this is bad now too, so it is getting more mainstream press time.   And for you to think most people know who owns their news source is ignorant imo. If someone put up a news article from RT or The Socialist news, the source would be questioned because people would rightly understand that the source has an agenda. Most people do not know The Washington Times is a Moonie newspaper. They guy who cuts my hair has a stack of them next to his chair for people to read. When I told him, he did not know, but he (this is important for what I am trying to point out) likes the angle they present their stories from. Yes, he is a hard core tea partier/Ayn Randian. edit - typo   I'm a bird watcher so I have a lot of berry bushes and trees, that flower.  I am not seeing any bumblebees this year, which is unusual.  It's been bad the last few years, but not seeing any is scary unusual.   Washington Times is a Moonie owned newspaper. The Rev. Sun Yung Moon ran what was considered a cult until he built power up in our gov. It's like reading The Mormon News, or some other religious paper for news.   Let the dv's commence but hopefully a few investigate and see the veracity of my comment.   Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything.   Diebold   I'd tell the world, 10% of us are going to die on X date. Who volunteers to be one of the 10%? You may have to turn people away.   The store is called TeaHaus in Ann Arbor Michigan   The Darjeelings I get are sold through Geschwendner. They have a Ligia and Steinhal estate Darjeelings that I find very nice. Not cheap, but very tasty.   Their Grand Yunnan was the best tea I had ever tasted until I tried TWG's Golden Needle Yunnan.  My last order of Grand Yunnan was not as good as previous orders.  Their shipping costs are very high.   I would put them several steps above Teavana.   Excellent!  You now have my 2 favorite regions covered; Yunnan Province and Taiwan.   You can get 250g of Twinings for between 4 and 7 US. I think that is about as cheap as you get for loose tea. Harney and Sons is a bit more expensive and has a bit higher quality, but still pretty reasonable. I go through Yunnan Sourcing for a lot of my teas and I have found their prices very reasonable.   He's kind of like Bugs Bunny in that it's written on several levels. He jabs quite nicely at the stuff society does that is odd and inconsistent.   I've never seen their tea in any local shops. I see it on occasion in restaurants, but not in stores to buy.   I saw that it was still available in Australia and I looked around while I was there a couple of years ago, but I could not find it.  It is no longer imported into the US. I really like T2Tea in Melbourne so I tried their's and was fairly disappointed. I still have 90% of it in my tea cabinet.   IMO Vonnegut stands alone. There are other good satirists, but none like Kurt. I have really enjoyed Ben Elton's books. Both Gridlock and Stark have a similar flavor to Vonnegut's books. I also found Carl Haiisen to be a good satirist. And lastly, not someone people usually see as satire, Terry Pratchett. The Discworld series is very satirical and pokes hard at our current world.   Biography of George Bush   Their good teas are over priced and their flavored teas are not something I appreciate. I prefer whole leaf tea with no additives.   Each method gives a different flavor imo. I almost feel like I am wasting oolong by making it western style because it lends itself so well to multiple steepings. The first steep does not give the same character as other steepings.   Rinse with water after I've dumped out what I can.   Twinings used to make an excellent Russian Caravan. You can't find it in the states anymore and other brands have not appealed to me as much. I miss the unique flavor of that tea.  	57
  Three months after the abrupt end of "Top Gear" on BBC2, reports indicate that the show's trio of hosts are headed for Netflix. [Report] (http://uk.businessinsider.com/report-top-gear-trio-headed-to-netflix-2015-6?r=US#ixzz3caWQY3Vd)   So yes, its speculative.                     Youre wellcome. Im a hue user and jailbreak already can do somethings more usefull to it with activator.

 Thanks. I kinda thought that before I posted this, I just wanted to make sure.   I'm dual enrolling my junior and senior year, but I'm taking all my classes there so by the time I graduate HS I will also get my AA. Will I enter a 4 year school as a freshmen or a transfer student? Will applying as a transfer help/hurt my chances of acceptance? Some of the schools I want to go to are UC Berkeley, Stanford, MIT, and Duke. My AA is in Mathematics.    Not my point but thanks for the info, I didn't even know about COINTELPRO   I reeeeeaaaaally hope this wasn't a hate crime purely because I don't want to deal with the backlash from society. Why can't it ever just be about a psychopath being himself? Why does every murder have to be about race? Edit: Of course I feel bad about it happening, just saying...   Yah, I already have those scores.  	5
 Affirmative bingo down. I repeat bingo down   Relationship goals    My god, that means I'm a tamato   I think. An innocent pedestrian in gta would be the worse. Your walking minding your own business when BAM! Random ads helicopter lands on you   It does not matter if it is a main character or a background character. ANY Character, which would be the worst?   My name is kevin, but my fellow co-workers call me koop. I work at nasa analyzing data that our satellite pick up on. It is an excruciatingly boring job, but is worth the pay.  I mainly analyze data from a small satellite that we call D.R.O.V.E. which stand for digital recording of void energy. basically it records data from the empty spaces of, well, space. the spots where there's no known wave signals of any sort. I know it sounds weird, useless, and implausible that nasa will try to find something where nothing is, but really that's all they do. What I don't understand is how I get so much data. These spaces should not have this much activity going on there.  Well a few weeks ago my questions were answered on what, why, and where this information is coming from.  It was a normal morning for me. got up, got dressed, ate breakfast, and headed for work. I live 2 hours away, so I leave around 10 am and arrive at noon. When I arrived, that's when my day went hay wire. They rushed up to me and dragged me to my station. They scream at me and tell me to tell them what the hell is this shit that they are seeing. they play back a recording they took hours earlier.  Before I go into the recording let me explain how I analyze data. The satalite sends me signals that I read on a GREEN graph that places dots in various places on it to signal various things. The recording did not show a green graph, it showed a screen full of falling numbers. not just any numbers but zeros and ones. binary codes.   That was not what they were freaking out about. An image of a face was outlined by the code its mouth moved as if it was saying something. It if it was it did not say much. They told me they needed me to decode the message. that it was important for mankind to know what it said. I spent hours trying to figure out what the message was. I, for no good reason, decided to exit out of the recording. I was not done analyzing It, but something just told me to exit out of it. when I did, there it was. The binary face looking at me. at first I thought I did not exit out of the recording. but I quickly realized that it was live, happening now. I screamed for my supervisors to come near. I projected the image on the main monitor for everyone to see. when I did the face turned into an image of a hand pointing. pointing at a single floating digit in the binary code. it was not a one or a zero but a 6. my superior told me to click on it. I don't know why he wanted be to, but I did. A loud shriek came from the surround sound hooked up to the main computer. There was a dark raspy laugh followed by this sentence.  God is not real, we made you.  the screen goes black. then after the lights flickered, all power was shut off. A voice came from the darkness.   only this awaits you when you die.   There was silence. an hour passed before someone decided to do something. We got our selves together and got the power on and the system running again. The whole scene was being recorded but somehow was erased. there is no trace of what happened. We decided to continue to find out what was happening but we found no answers. I have recently decided that I am quitting this job to be a teacher. the pay is less but it is a lot less exciting than analyzing data.   Gex  	7
 Hey, so lately I've been watching a lot of **Miyazaki** films, such as **Spirited Away**, **Princess Mononoke** and **My Neighbour Totoro**. I've also watched **The Raid** and **Raid 2**, and I think they're pretty awesome. I was wanting to get more in to Asian cinema as a whole.   I like a wide variety of movies, and have no idea where to start. Are there any **large blockbuster** asian movies I should check out? And any **small/independent** films worth watching too?   If you could give **reasons** to watch these films too without spoilers then I would appreciate it greatly.  **Preferably** no horror suggestions, as I am a massive wimp, however I do hear that some great horror films have originally come out of Asia.    I personally hope he does, he was one of the only redeemable qualities of the prequels, and it would be interesting to see what obi-wan did between 3   4. Unless it's just adventures on Tatooine.  	2
 I am just starting to watch the episode.  I find it weird that girl is addicted to gabapentin.   I have hardware and other gnarly looking mri's. Pm?   are they giving out free opiate based drugs at this super bowl??  if so, yes, yes I am very fucking interested in this bowl that is super.   stop taking them immediately and send the rest to me for further evaluation    I must purchase one of these.   yeah you're right about the driving around part haha just did that today with a pound of weed.   never used SR or any of them. Probably never will. Seems way too sketchy.   ok thanks for the info. and i have been in the same boat as you more or less with anxiety/depression issues my whole life most likely so I know that any pill is no cure all to anything. i am still waiting for them to approve fucking opiates for depression!! not gonna happen but still can wish.   haha i'll accept that as a viable answer!   oh ok.  I was prescribed it in hope of getting something more like xanax.  I have been on Paxil for 12 years now and have a history of depression anxiety.   yep exactly what happened for a bit. not too long tho and it was when i was dozing off sleeping so i thought maybe it was happening naturally since that is when people tend to jerk around.       so it's like Jesus is putting his arm in place of dude's?     holy shit!! 50 is supposed to knock most people on their ass.     ok that kinda started to happen to me when i was falling asleep now that you mentoin it.   I have taken 100mg on top of several norcos. Nothing.   I have taken 100mg on top of several norcos. Nothing.    Happy birthday.  nod it out!   So I've seen a few posts here and there about seroquel and taking it with opiates but never really got much from those threads.  I guess basically the seroquel intensifies the nodding effects.  Curious because today i was prescribed seroquel and took 100mg and so far not much!!    This has been discussed many times but i'll chirp in again haha.  I don't know, have a job i guess??  When I have no cash flow i do recycling and coinstair.     yeah i'm curious about those grainy looking pills too haha   yep it sucks. next time around on subs (I have access to real opiates at the moment) i am going to probably quarter what i was started on.  I don't know why bupe doctors heavily overprescribe the stuff.   actually my story is just an example of how this shit can backfire in your face.  i thought that since my doc was referring me to a pain specialist i'd be taken care of right??  well the exact opposite happened. Yes they will or at least should pee test you but if you are on narcotics already you should pee positive for them and that is completely fine.  They want to make sure you are actually taking the medicine that they prescribe to you.  but yeah hopefully what happened to me doesnt to you-just a cautionary tale of when everything should be set in stone it gets all fucked up.  Murphy's law at it's finest.     i have to say I was on about the exact same dosage as you and put on 8mg twice a day.  It worked yes but in the end jacked up my tolerance immensly so that when i went back to use i had to take way more to feel the same effect.   If you feel up to reading my post from a few months ago here is my 1st (and worst) experience with a pain management program.  This is how it should not go!!  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1pzawa/doctor_question/   about?   ok. i've never done any drugs other than weed so the freebase part i don't follow but its all good.  so the other day my homie got a small amount of tar for $50. i looked at it. seemed a bit bigger than say a nickel. i thought it was just so small but now that you told me only a match head size you can smoke to get 3 hits off of it makes more sense now. thanks for the info!!   ok also i want to ask you some questions. I have only ever done pharms: norco, oxy, etc.  I just usually pop them but I have foiled some roxi blues. How does the tar compare to smoking a roxi? do you do it off foil?     lol how many norcos and kpins you working with?!?!    i am in almost the same exact thing as you. norcos then started buying roxy to supplement.  i have to agree with everyone saying tolerance.  thats really all it is.  oxy is a bit stronger than hydro in comparison but not enough for me to notice.  tolerance sucks!! i hate it.   lol the ninja opiate. didn't know that about fent.   tramadol is so weak I am surprised you get anything from it. but that's actually good for you if you can still catch a buzz from it.  Why don't you tell your doctor you at least need something to replace the tramadol with.  If you get lucky he might give you something better but i'd stay away from saying names of meds like "I want Norco" or etc.  its not fair that he cut you off completely he should at least taper you.  I have been in very similar situations too.    $1 per milligram sounds about right!?!?  I am not positive though.   nevermind sorry for asking a dumb question you already answered!    how many     ah ok haha    mmmk   let's party    I am just using trams for being able to sleep thru the night right now.  that and gabapentin help a lot.  I don't have a huge habit/tolerance.  I'd say about 120 mg hydro daily. but lately like the last month i can't sleep up until 8am without jerking all around and crawling outta my skin.  That sucks and I am now realizing shit is getting serious.  So anyways I got tramadol and gaba scripted to me and take them around 2am and they really do help me just sleep.  I am trying to keep my tolerance in check so yeah in that respect if you have em for maintenince and don't want to go crazy with your tolerance they do help.   FUCK YEAH!! and don't they suck when you wake up???!?!!! but this one was different. it wasnt completely lucid like i knew it was kinda a dream to begin with so when i woke up i was like wtf but not totally bummed haha.    LOL ok. i just never seen any asians dabbling in opiates like  I have never seen an IV user strung out on the streets. to me that's a picture of a white guy/girl.    lol it was basically like how they sell "legal weed" synthetic stuff now. but this was claiming it was a certain % pure heroin.   I had a pretty cool dream last night.  Basically I was looking through a magazine and they were advertising selling heroin.  Thing is somehow it was legal to sell because it was only 7.xx real heroin so they were able to find a loophole I guess haha. I think i remember it was sold and shipped from some little tiny country as well. Woke up like damn!! not real.  Anyways thought I would share that with everyone.   OK I have been using this lately for withdrawls in between my doses.  I am taking pills-oxy or hydro.  In the early morning I had been getting the classic symptoms-jerky body, restless legs, basically couldn't sleep and I did NOT want to waste my precious limited suppy of real opiates so I was able to procure a script from my doc. Took 2-3 around 2am and voila no more symptoms whatsoever. I can now get a great mornings sleep.  Other than that, the times I did take Trams they made me a bit nauseous but I was riding in a car and hadn't had much to eat.  As far as recreational value, if you have little to no opiate tolerance I bet they would be kinda cool.   lol probably. opiates, at least to me seem like a white mans burden haha.   So are you looking for pills? if you now graduated to H would pills still do anything for you? I guess it depends on your habit and ROA?? I haven't gone the H route yet so I am not sure.  Anyways I live near a big college town and pills are pretty hit and miss but then again I am 10 years above your average freshman college goer so I don't really run with that crowd.     Reading the last paragraph oh this really sums it up for a lot of people on this sub i bet.  It at least hit home with me   the op 80s i have now i put in coke overnight so my tolerance is 1 a day of the op 80s and the buzz lasts me a while.   so i just had op 80s for the first time the other week. i like them.  paid $20 a piece for them.  i have a chance to get blue i think 30mg roxis for the same price.  is this a fair price and what is the difference between the 2 as far as the high is. i am bit confused as to why they are both the same price when one is an 80mg pill and the other is only 30.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh8zcbC_Dcw   it was actually an oral surgeon!! haha you'd think he would know.   lol i got darvocet for my wisdom teeth and they were impacted meaning they had to cut out my gums to get to them.   dying of cancer and last leg of life shit basically.  doctors are getting to be assholes about scripting anything anymore.   ok i just drank the whole concotion yesterday and it seemed to work fine.   ok last night i threw a whole 80 in a a shot glass of coke. this morning it's looking all gelly and i can still see the actual pill or carcasss of the pill. its all blown up like 3 times bigger than original.  just sip the mixture or what? haha i hope i didn't mess up.    i did haha it worked.    ok i just checked on it. its all gelled up but seems to be broken down. i am just scooping some out and eating it haha is that ok?     ok i just checked on it. its all gelled up but seems to be broken down. i am just scooping some out and eating it haha is that ok?   lol it's all good. thanks. lots of good info in there.   will do. thanks everyone!   Exactly what im doing.  How long do you wait?    I know i'm probably beating a dead horse her but i've never had them before. my tolerance is up to 10 norcos in 24 hours. usually a bit less though.  i currently broke one in 1/2 and have it sitting in a shot glass of coke and they are floating around haha.  any other ideas? they are the op 80s incase it's hard to tell in the pic.  http://i43.tinypic.com/2s6mu50.jpg   Damn that s a ton of pills but i recently go cut off as well. My script pales in comparison to yours but i can still understand the betrayment and downright fear you  feel   Chico 530 help a n*gga out    you been at the local dog park picking up the turds?!?! hahaha jk have fun!!   ah ok   anyone around chico?   are you yelling at me?? I don't understand I was just asking a question.   what are in you in the hospital for?  you got a do it your self pump in your bed?     I've never heard of this ever in the states.   i was in a similiar situation before.  I thought it over then i decided not to do it since i'd be totally up shits creek with nothing if I got caught and i hear that pharmacies call the doctor back sometimes a lot nowadays. depends on on the pharmacy maybe.  you can do it but just weigh the pros/cons i guess of the situation haha   haha it didnt really do anything!! Gonna go with 100 mg today and see.   Ite. Just popped one 50mg tram a few minutes ago.  would try more but it's my 1st time so i'm being safe hah.   Ok cool. Im not on subs right now but i might try a couple trams tonight when i get home.  Got the script yesterday and haven't touched it yet   yeah i usually do that with norco the empty stomach routine and never have had a problem with that. i also have a pill crusher and use that.  i started on subs recently as well but have a decent amount of norcos left so i was wondering what will work best haha.  Yeah the buzz from subs, not really a buzz but i'd call it like a dirtier version of a norco buzz.  It's not bad it gets me thru the day but i'd take norcos any day over subs.     also do you think that if i took these with norco it would help or hinder the norco buzz?     Alright thanks.  i have little round white pills that say an 527 i believe on them.   lol dude!! exactly............   aight. i will look into it though. since i am going to use anything before I have to go back onto subs which I assume will be the rest of my life.    yeah i'd like to know too after being in my current situation.   ok this is probably a no but is it possible to take this with suboxone?  I am doubting it.....   and also I am under Kaiser insurance.  if you haven't heard of Kaiser its like a network of hospitals and doctors all intertwined (is that a word?) haha but anyways i cannot simply just switch doctors under kaiser to get back on my meds cause any doctor under kaiser will see that fucking recommendation from the head of pain managment saying something like no more norco. so i'm fucked unless I change insurance and start all the way fucking over again.   She reffered me to pain mgmt. Head guy there is anti meds and put a recommendation to my doc that my norco should be pulled.  funny thing is i thought i was moving up the ladder when being reffered.  I am now on suboxone which i did with my own money and no insurance since they fucked me over.   isnt that essentially a speedball?    ok. i am on paxil as well. heard of any interactions?  	85
 Thankyou so much for your message. I want to stay with him, we have been together for three years and I want to be there for him. But it's confusing me when he acts happy and seems perfectly OK and himself, and then treats me poorly (forgetting our anniversary, not being there for me through things, not seeing me often). I am associating his bad behaviour with what he is going through, but then he doesn't seem any different and I'm finding it difficult.  	1
 Yea that's the point I've reached after biting it for the 30th time during breakfast this morning.      This actually made me lol       In a 400 level electrical engineering course:  *Awkward guy in class raises hand in the middle of the lecture*  Guy: Whats a derivative?" Professor: You're telling me that you're getting ready to graduate with an engineering degree and you don't know what a derivative is?" Guy:Well I know what it is" Professor:Well then explain it" Guy: ............."  *Class busts out laughing and the teacher goes back to teaching*   In a college algebra class as we're discussing inequalities:  Girl: Wait, why are there letters and where's the equal sign?" *Class gets awkwardly silent and the teacher stares at her for a good 10 seconds in silence* Teacher: The letters are variables or numbers we dont know yet and there's  no equal sign because this is an inequalitity" Girl: If there's no equal sign then you can't do anything" *professor turns back around and goes back to teaching  She dropped the class the next day   No, Maryland      A little back information: my Dad and Grandma were notorious for playing pranks on each other when they'd visit each other, putting stuff on each other's face while they slept, my dad hid a full bag of trash in her car when she went on a trip back home, etc. Well it was Christmas in like '97-'98(I was about 9) and we had received a package from Grandma and were supposed to open it on Christmas Eve. We open it to see a bunch of what look like gourmet chocolates, so we all enjoy the evening and each the chocolates without anyone noticing. We get a call from our family who lives near my Grandma and they're just laughing it up and barking throughout the entire conversation, come to find out that she ate all the actual chcolates and dipped dog food bits in chocolate and repackaged the box. Come to find out, apparently chocolate covered dog food isn't that bad tasting.              	13
 Thank you for sharing your experience. I've known about neurofeedback for some time but always wanted to hear a first hand account. How old are you, OP?    Sonic and Knuckles. Try as hard as I could I was never able to beat the final boss.   	2
 Ate too much chocolate    But Hitler was vegetarian   You'd think so, but nah, they're fairly sturdy.    My guess would be that physiologically, its the same reason.  Safety in numbers and all that, knowing is safe to fall asleep because someone is 'keeping watch'.    Its really not true,  Australia has dangerous animals but so does the rest of the world,  I've lived here my whole life, in a rural town, and have seen very very few dangerous animals.  But I spent a week in Alaska once and saw numerous moose and some bears, I feared for my life there on a few occasions.    notice Rogers cleanliness      Lyssavirus is pretty rare, but you're partner should have seen a doctor asap just in case.     Yeah,  the last heat wave did kill a few hundred but that's out of a few thousand so there numbers weren't really affected    What kind of bats? I believe there's been a steady rise in the number of flying foxes, they're breeding up in the botanic gardens and surrounding areas with plenty of food available. But I'm not sure about the other kinds of bats, been hearing a lot of them at night though.        It is pretty socially acceptable for men to have casual sex, sometimes even expected.   The women in the picture are (probably) wanting to 'reclaim' the word slut, and the actions associated with it,  to say its OK  want and have casual sex,  as often or rarely as you like, as men are allowed to do.    There aren't words that are the equivalent of slut for men,  but women have plenty used to insult and degrade them.    Its not about promoting any particular lifestyle, but saying that women shouldn't be treated poorly or judged for their choices, particularly when men act similarly and no one cares.     We have this is Australia, online and over the phone schooling. I homeschooled part of highschool, but I would go into the nearest school to be supervised for tests.  The curriculum was the same for regular schooling.    Its a huge source of nutrients and vitamins beneficial for post-birth recovery.  many animals eat the placenta, I watched pet guinea pigs do it once, but its not generally socially acceptable for humans to do it.   I guess its technically cannibalism, but no one was killed for it and it would be destroyed as medical waste otherwise.    Oh of course,  very important.    And this is just one country,  there are entire nations that will be completely underwater.      On a related logic: why does human kind have to evolve in one specific region of the world, and then migrate to the rest of it?  It doesnt 'have to' but all the evidence we have suggests that it did.  Like most other life forms,  there are kangaroos in Europe and there aren't bears in Australia. Different regions create different things, its going to be pretty unlikely that the exact same animal will evolve in two separate locations.    I've lived 26 years in this time zone and its never caused me any inconvenience.   But if it we do change it forward or back half an hour I would be fine with that.    What are peoples reasons for wanting change?     And avocados trees take a long time to produce fruit, 5+ years from seed.    Nah, they're wallaroos, commonly shot for food along with reds and western and eastern greys.    Its a female, the bald patch is her pouch opening.    Neat flacid shamrock.... sure   It would be great if they could standardise that,  its super annoying   Kind of gross, but they're beautiful pictures.   My cousin used hair as a medium for a uni art project, but she included pubes and hairs from strangers so it kind of really put me off the idea of hair in art.    I believe that the placement of the brake and accelerator is the same in both left and right hand drives to avoid confusion and potential accidents by people who may drive both.     I have no advice, but I'll cry for you.  Hope you get it sorted   These are all so adorable!    So its still ok to abort before the heart starts beating?    Doing thinks is challenging    That's so cute   And dogs are innocent, they aren't responsible for the situation they are in,  they didn't invent cars.    Told my parents I hated them,  too many times. I was an angry child   Aww :)   But how did it get in there?   Vest? Tank top? I don't know what else they're called. Top usually made of cotton with thin straps worn under clothing for extra warmth.    Well the alternative to a medically necessary c-section can be death  of the baby and mother, so it's maybe not easy but definitely preferable.    When my sister was 3ish she refused to wear a singlet and told our mum "you be the little girl and wear the singlet"    I think our looks and languages will grow more similar but still have regional differences.    My sister was born. Hur hur hur   Uhm... what is a dimbit?   I want one   My friend was once outdoors pooping, a dog came up behind her and stole the poop before it hit the ground   Suddenly 40 and back in high school.   I woke up on the verge of tears.    We don't have free speech here,  there are a lot of restrictions on what we can say publically. Any thing that is highly offensive, derogatory, racist, sexist etc is usually censored.    And talk to your midwife/ doctor, they will have all the information you need and once baby arrives they will help you begin and continue breast feeding if you are struggling.    Time is relative but the speed of light is constant.    Seconded   The last guy does not look at all impressed    Oh thanks.  I get you now.    I thought they were the norm...    What?    To amaze all the friends i don't have at the dinner parties i don't go to   My bearded dragon doesn't react   Immediately because your meat will quickly rot and be useless.    Nothing.  I think that anything I took would remind me of what I'd left behind and it would be too hard to ever look at.     You don't.  Stranger danger.    I just want a dog   Almost everything.    My life doesn't suck,  its just so dull, I could have done do much better.    Dog breeding has caused loads of genetic problems...    That's an excellent plan. Why isn't that in any movie or book?  They always go into forests and get killed by zombies hiding behind trees.    I have no idea.  But i just can't believe it's been a year already. Time goes too fast.   Massive freakout now.     Stay inside and use the Internet    A few different  species by the looks of it,  this is what I've always called a blue tongue but I've heard people  refer to what I know as sleepy lizards (shingle backs) as blue tongues too, they're related species. I'm not sure exactly what variety you have there.    That's a blue tongue   Thanks! I was getting so confused!   But not all brains,  maybe only one brain named itself and all the rest copied    What's the difference between a head transplant and a body transplant?    Nothing we could do about it,  not very likely it will happen, more important and realistic things to worry about.    Is there a word for needing a word for something?    Hydrated   A shower is temporary, they don't take long,  if you spent a whole day in a hot shower you'd be pretty uncomfortable.      I agree.  Its the same blue and black dress with stupud gold lighting now   I agree, Frozen was huge and is still really popular, with adults and kids.     My uncle speaks like "so i bloody uh got the bloody tractor bloody stuck and bloody uh kim came to bloody give me a hand to get it bloody out."    Its not only Americans who do this,  I'm Australian and we have 'famous' killers here.   Ivan milat, John Bunting (had a movie made about him) and Ned Kelly (arguably)  Its morbid curiosity.    I've heard rumours. But I swear, us Ameristralians are just as patriotic as any one else.     Where is that?   And can you adopt me?    What am I reading?  What are all those words?     And slavery still continues around the world with all races represented amongst the slaves. They overlook that a lot...or all the time.     The family was outraged, but sadly, nothing could be done.    My sister got an f once in grade 5 for being too creative. I still remember the last line of the story... "and Barbara learned to love horses, she ate them every day at 1pm which was when the mental hospital served lunch."   Why is that bad? I get chocolate,  flowers, bath bombs and sex?! Sounds fine to me.    I'm baffled by how they're actually terrified by hypothetical people hypothetically using them maybe.    I know of someone who was 'that driver', it completely destroyed their life.    My advice: stop thinking about it before your brain melts.  Its impossible for the human brain to comprehend time before time.    The hormones are the trigger, to dont need a specific sad thought.     All the other species currently living and reproducing are successful because they are currently living and reproducing.   We are more successful according to us,  but nature doesn't really care,  we aren't really better or worse than any other species.    Their languages are English based Creoles, that most likely developed by the people in those places hearing english being spoken but having no formal learning of it,  so they didn't correctly learn English but made up their own versions based on what they thought or guessed to be correct, their native languages and slang.    Can not figure it out.    Edit: luckily, wikipedia had had it figured out before I had...had   Today I got of out of bed at 3.30pm, I kind of have no reason get up in the morning, but need one.     I need to unsubscribe from r/food. It doesn't help my determination to stick with the keto diet.     An assignment that was due yesterday and also making a hair appointment.    Life is hard,  and I have all episodes of friends to watch   I grew up in a rural area of Australia that has no signs of aboriginal habitation, there are areas that are remote, hilly, thick bush and its pretty possible that no one has ever been to some of those places.    Females are mostly only able to conceive about 1 or 2 days of the month,  a week at most,  so if you miss the fertile period you'll have to try again next month.   Plus,  many men and women have fertility issues which can delay or prevent conception.    I'm sure many do   She didn't have any for the rest of the time we lived together but i don't see her much anymore so they may have come back and i haven't heard about it.    It used to really scare her and she thought she would see ghosts of irish men. But yeah, after a diet change it all stopped.    A break from having to look after myself.  Where do i sign up?    =get out of my nostrils you damn flys!   Not eating a big main meal    Shut up you stupid loud jerks.    Summer.    Olives   My sister used to get sleep paralysis, turns out it was a vitamin deficiency  (don't remember which vitamin), my parents made her take supplements and changed her diet a bit. Cured!   	103
 Oh man, awesome video, thank you for sharing!        The visual aid aspect of his wave machine really makes a (kind of) obscure concept very easy to see, understand, and visualize.          Amazing how applicable it is as a teaching tool all these years later.          I'm going to forward this video to my boss, hes a rather avid HF / MF listener (grundig radios, big loop antennas, etc) but doesnt fundamentally understand the physics behind RF propagation /  resonance / etc. I think if he watches this vid, it will teach (even him, LOL) a bit more about the physics / magic behind being able to pull in RF signals from thousands of miles away..         Thank you again, infinite upvotes from me :-)   This KX3 auction.        ..I has it.   Just because of the connections at the top, and jutting out the side, I want to say it looks like it might be an unreasonably huge triode, but I can not find anything on google (shrug)        Cool piece tho, I'd hang onto it..

No, the 8800 only does VHF / UHF (as does the 7900, sorry for the confusion.. My bad) I'm not too up on the 7900s specs. Sorry I cant help you more. Maybe someone can chime in with some better info?   For some reason, I had 2 different FRNs associated with my SSN. the ARRL VEC didnt know what to do with that. Unfortunately, no-one got back to me to let me know there was a problem. I had to track down the lead VE, and ask him what was going on.  Oh well.. Glad its taken care of now :-)   I'm still new to the radios, so hopefully someone can chine in and correct me where I'm wrong, but the FT-8900 (as I understand) is essentially an 8800, but with more bands. I'm only working VHF/UHF currently, and learning more before I plonk down the cash to dive into HF. The 8800 has glowing reviews (so does the 8900) and the cross-band repeat was important to me (I believe the 8900 does that as well)    I actually did pass my General on the same day as my Tech, so I called the ARRL back today, and they see the mistake. He said they'd be submitting my general creds to the FCC today.  As far as radios, I have the ubiquitous chinese HT, but I also picked up a Yaesu FT-8800.   Going to be building a 2m cubic quad for the house this weekend! :)    I *finally* got everything squared away with the ARRL, and FCC.     Call sign just showed up.  -KK6SFZ     Cant wait to get on the air tonight.    	11

 I was actually thinking this morning, before checking in on reddit, that whatever wording I used in this post yesterday was probably too harsh. I think saying it was an annoying/depressing episode is fine, because it fits the portions I listened to, but I regret calling Marcus horrid (even just as a guest). So you make a fair point.   No good editing the original post, but I should have described Marcus as a "disappointing" guest, or a "difficult" guest.        Ugh. After over an hour of nearly non-stop complaining, I just had to stop listening. Marcus is a horrid guest. Kind of like a giant, exhaustively negative steamroller. Hopefully, next week's show will be back to the fun.   This is silly. Safe hollandaise sauce is easy.   Bleh... No gameplay; who cares?   I hear you. But you may have a misconception about which movies are successful and which aren't. Edge of Tomorrow was a hands-down financial disappointment for the studio, and Interstellar was also a stinker at the box office. When you say EoT made almost four times its budget, that means you must be including overseas gross. But, domestic gross is far more important for determining whether a film was financially successful.  EoT had a production budget of ~$178 million. And the general rule of thumb is that a movie must make twice its production budget in revenue in order to break even (due to advertising, marketing and distribution costs). So, EoT had to take in over $300 million. And how much did it make domestically? $100 million. Yikes.   Sure, it made another $250 million overseas, but overseas profits are much less valuable to the studios. Between tariffs, higher distribution costs, expenses and fluctuating currency values, the studios are lucky to get 15% of overseas gross in actual revenue (versus domestic gross, where the studio collects 45-60%). So, for EoT, it's more likely that the studio made ~$100 million, total... on a film that cost $178 million to make (not including advertising and marketing). Even if they got 60% of both domestic and overseas gross, that's still only $220 million--far less than the $300+ million needed to 'break even'.   So, yeah, Edge of Tomorrow was a failure for the studio. They might make it up on home video and TV, but they're not going to be champing at the bit to make a sequel--and it's not going to be a strong argument for making more original scifi movies. If you run the numbers for Interstellar, the picture isn't much rosier.   Anyway, all of that aside, yes--I agree. There are tons of original films made every year, and that will continue to be the case. Regardless of all the doom and gloom people like to drum up about sequels and reboots. But, that doesn't mean that the state of the movie industry isn't hampering more good, original films from being made. Again, particularly genre films. How many original sci-fi films are released each year? Very few, compared to other genres.   Wow. Well, I played Rogue Legacy on PS4/Vita, so I essentially played for months... at home, at work, at lunch, in bed... whatever. Played and played. Fortunately, the timer on the PS4 version was bugged, so I really have no idea how long I actually played. :)   I think the reality is that different people consume games differently. I don't doubt that you will avoid going back to older games when new DLC is released, but there are plenty of people who will (I assume).  I'm playing Witcher 3 right now, but if DLC hit next week for Last of Us, I'd drop Witcher 3 for a bit. Not because I don't like Witcher 3, but because I really liked Last of Us. Heck, as I was trying to finish up Bloodborne, I quit cold turkey for a bit when the Mario Kart DLC hit. As with anything, it all depends on what excites me at the time. I can't be alone in this.  All of this is anecdotal, though. It might just be easier for us to agree that CDPR would not continue working on DLC for two years unless there was substantial financial benefit in doing so (i.e., there must be enough people still willing to buy DLC that long after release).    I had similar issues with DA:I combat. I loved the tactical view in the first game, and I spent countless hours stepping through each combat slowly, planning my attacks meticulously and really using the battlefield to my advantage. You just can't do that in DA:I--in fact, I'm not sure I would even call it a "tactical" camera; it's just an overhead camera.  The combat in DA:I is way too straightforward and twitchy to benefit from tactical consideration. Example: In the first game, I would generally keep my mages in the back, station a ranged character on something elevated, and then wade in with my close-range fighter. The mage might cast a wall of some type (fire/ice), or an area effect, to cut off some enemies from the main battle, and my archer would pick them off. In DA:I, that's just not possible--the enemies warp all over the battlefield, rendering barriers, planning and character placement entirely moot. As an action game, it was sufficient, but it can't touch the tactical goodness found in DA1.   I don't even want to know how many hours I logged in that game.    There's an element of truth to what you say--we should not support bad movies just because they are original. However, the author of this article also has a point: original films (particularly original *genre* films) do not generally fare very well at the box office, regardless of how good they might be. Edge of Tomorrow, from last year, is a recent example. Very good movie (some might say great), but severely underperformed. Meanwhile, mediocre sequels and remakes catering to the same audience raked in the dough.  As for Tomorrowland itself, I don't think the consensus is that it's a bad film. I haven't seen it, so I won't comment on its merits, but it seems to be pretty divisive. Some people love it, some people really, really don't. Usually, films like that are good, but controversial.   Oh, I get it. This is pretty much what I meant by "Stupid internet."   Maybe. I've always thought if you have to use '/s' you aren't doing sarcasm very well. But, my sarcasm skills are evidently suspect, anyway, so...   Yes, thanks. Thick, thick sarcasm.   Hmm. I thought the sarcasm was sufficiently thick to guarantee detection. Considering Journey was a sales record-breaker, how did you miss it? Stupid internet. :/  	14

This is a classic Reddit trope I see all the time. I swear this website has to be made up of some of the most socially retarded people on the planet. /r/tifu is full of this shit. One slightly socially awkward blunder and it's like the Armageddon.   It's also kind of a less funny version of [this classic 4chan green text.](http://i.imgur.com/H39tuWI.png)   If you think you're going to change the mind of a conpiratard with facts, I have bad news for you.   For me it's the fact. This is literally just a quote from a book that anyone would know if they read the book, and, last I checked, it's pretty much on every school reading list.   You might as well post TIL we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.   Subscribing doesn't do much for me if 90% I'm just rolling my eyes and muttering "no shit" to myself.   The point is, as soon as the animated white-out eyes start moving/expressing motion, they will appear animated, fake, cartoony, and silly. For Deadpool, that will work wonders and fit the character perfectly. For Batman, a more grounded and realistic character in more grounded and realistic movies, it work against the look, feel, and tone of both the character and the movies.    Who's to say it has to be goofy and cartoony?  Because that is exactly what is going to happen when you try to apply a cartoon/animated feature to a live action person.  [Picture this](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif) on a real actor.      You'd either have white-out eyes that don't move and don't express emotion, which no filmmaker or actor would want, or you'd have animated white out eyes which would be goofy and cartoony. Either way, not appropriate for any remotely serious Batman movie.  Again, Deadpool and Batman are very different animals.   It's not an issue of money. Of course Nolan and others have had the budget to white out the eyes; they don't want to for reasons posted throughout this thread, but mostly because the filmmakers want you to see the actor's real eyes.   Also, because Batman is a more grounded, realistic comic book character compared to Deadpool, they took a more grounded, realistic approach to the look. The white, animated, expressive eyes in the Deadpool movie will look cartoony, and for Deadpool, that's perfect. For Batman, it would be laughable.   Now I can't stop thinking of Batman: The Animated Series and the [infamous squint.](http://media.giphy.com/media/14iEFCXZcJmfXq/giphy.gif)     because they are among the best comic book movies of all-time  As long as we're not including Rises in that phrase, I agree completely.   I like both for different reasons.   That *was* true, which is why the current comics Batman does (and has for a while now) rocked an all black (actually shades of gray) costume. Inks and paper have improved vastly since. People tend to forget that comics character's [black hair was blue](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114711/3191617-9264010257-bruce.jpg) as well. Is anyone demanding "comics accurate" blue haired Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent?  The Spider-Man villain [Venom was depicted as blue](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/156-VenomSBHImage_1135.jpg) even though he was blatantly referred to as being all black in the comics.    That's an in-universe explanation that only appeared in Miller's non-canonical Dark Knight Returns. The truth is that it was that way specifically for trademark reasons. Once they were able to get around that, they restored the oval-less chest emblem.   Whole different animal. His white eyes in the comics and in the movies are animated and expressive, part of his cartoon qualities.   Too true. Aquaman can swim at 10,000 feet per second. 10,000 feet per second is more than 3 kilometers per second, or 6,800 miles per hour.   For comparison, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps can sustain a speed of 4.7 miles per hour.   Coupled with invincible plot armor makes him every bit as powerful as Superman.  Popularity is a hell of a power.   The Ultimate Nullifier is almost a literal deus ex machina.   But *they* didn't give him claws. He was born a mutant with claws. This goes back quite a ways. Even when Magneto ripped the adamantium out of him he had bone claws.   That's a really good point. At the time of Justice League's beginning, the concept of creating a superhero team didn't even exist.   It's cool you like Superman, but are you going to kick Strawman's ass all day? You're literally arguing with no one. I never said a good writer couldn't write a team of Kyptonians on earth. I never said a good Justice League story couldn't be written with or without Superman, so you're arguing with an imaginary friend.  As for downvotes, I rarely use the button. I'm not the only man on Reddit.   The dynamic of their powers works because there's variety; the writing makes the story work.  Do I really have to spell this out? I'm talking about one aspect specifically. Superman's presence on a team is like having God with a team of lesser gods who each get maybe one or two of God's powers. It's redundant. That's the only point I was making.   Yes, because I'm pointing out the redundancy of Superman's powers with those of his teammates I must be completely failing to grasp every Justice League story that has ever been written. You nailed it.   So I've bounced around working here or there, and I don't know how it is people amass these portfolios. Any work I did for various printers and ad agencies was considered theirs. I didn't get a copy. Should I have? Now I'm looking for work and suddenly everyone asking for a portfolio. I don't have one besides the one I needed to graduate with ten years ago, which doesn't really reflect my talents now. Should I just invent stuff? I feel like I missed a vital lecture/class that everyone else in the industry attended. I feel quite stupid and lost. Any advice?    the whole idea of Speedforce is that it's in every univers  In every *DC Universe*, which is already novel considering there are some pretty significant differences between the various universes within the DC universe alone. You don't need to explain that anymore than you'd have to explain there not being a Phoenix Force, Captain Universe, or Power Cosmic in the DC Universe. What's true in one isn't necessarily true in another.    Clearly DC and Marvel are in some kind of agreement in that scenario  Yes, and they agree, per DC Comics copyright and interests, that "Speed Force" is a unique property of DC Comics and does not/can not exist in the Marvel Universe, just as the Infinity Gauntlet proved useless to Darkseid in the DC Universe.   DC Comics doesn't get to decide what does and doesn't exist in other companies' multiverses.   I'm actually sick to death of Batgod. A man who is fallible and isn't the be-all/end-all answer to every conceivable question is a lot more interesting.  I don't even have a problem with "world's greatest detective" and best martial artist in the DCU, but does he have to perfect in every way? It's always either that he knows everything and is the world's leading expert, but in the rare case he isn't, he will be by the time you come back with coffee.   That's kind of my problem with Superman and the Justice League. The X-Men work because they're a team with a variety of powers. Yes, some are more powerful than others, but there aren't really much in the way of redundancies.   Super strength? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct assistance), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, and the Flash (infinite mass punch anyone?).   Flight? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter.   Neigh-invulnerable? Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (with hard light construct shielding), Aquaman, Martian Manhunter (more likely density shifts through it, but he's still physically tough), etc.  Super Speed? Superman and The Flash, although Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are able to get to wherever they need to go quickly, including across vast expanses of space.  Justice League *with* Superman just seems kind of redundant. Superman is a one-man superhero team.   Yeah, but not in seven or eight months. I'd say there's a good chance of a lot of people seeing this for the first time.

In retaliation, Prince played a cover of "Best of You" at the 2006 Super Bowl. However, his revenge didn't work out as planned, as Dave Grohl was stoked to get covered by one of his musical idols.  TL;DR Prince is a pretty reliable copyright dick    What's really amazing is that 50 out of 69 actually found that review helpful...    I think the film is cheap and vapid  You've got my attention. How so?   I would if it was the word I required, yes.  I'm really not getting all the fuss over my word choice. I never considered "modicum" such a highfalutin bit of vocabulary.    Fair enough.   Borderline pedantry, but when you're right you're right. Either way, you understand why I'd consider Momento a postmodernist film in that sense.   I have read and re-read the post that continuously gets the downvoting and it's far from pretentious. It sounds like you're saying I have to dumb down my comments in order for /r/movies not to have their intelligence insulted, which is actually *more* insulting to their intelligence.  A fellow commenter claimed this movie was postmodern. I disagreed politely and explained my reasoning. If that's something considered a "dick move" by the Reddit masses, so be it. Negative Reddit karma isn't going to keep me up at night.  And I'll keep "modicum." It's a lovely word when it's precisely what I mean.   Are there formal and informal versions of /r/movies? If not, what is it about /r/movies that demands exclusively informal speech? How is "modicum" even beyond informal speech?   You're telling me /r/movies is no place for serious, academic, formal, or even relatively learned discussion about film? Then please, direct me to the subreddit that is, and please do so while remembering that it was not I who brought "postmodern" into the discussion. I'm just the one being crucified over daring to question it.   So glad you asked! I think Memento is postmodern in its depiction of life and memories. It supports the postmodern claim that truth is what we believe it to be, and memories are not reliable because we sometimes lie to ourselves, sometimes even unknowingly. The underlying idea is that 'real' truth does not exist. If postmodernism is, at its core, questioning the certainty of things, surely our own minds and the way we lie to ourselves is valid.   I aim to please.   Postmodernism *is* a vague category; it would be wholly ironic to try and define it with passionate certainty since that is exactly what postmodernism seeks to critique. That being said, I don't see it as a synonym for meta humor or any self-referential or self-aware comedy. That was the crux of my comment. I consider--as I suspect many do--that postmodernism carries deeper meaning than that.   Obviously I haven't seen "A Deadly Adoption," but I would expect it to be like an hour-plus SNL sketch lampooning the Lifetime movie clich. If that's all it is, would you really categorize it as "postmodern?"  And let's say you would. Fuck me for having a contrary opinion? I have been under the impression that the point of these comments sections was for discussion. If everyone is going to just upvote everyone they agree with and comment the same thing worded differently, what's the point?   I'm glad I'm not alone. I've questioned the downvoting of some of my comments and posts, but this one left me truly baffled.  Of course, whenever one is dealing with the written word, there's what you write and then there's what people will read into it.   I write as I speak. What's wrong with modicum?    [Or zombie strippers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0960890/)   It's a joke that you're taking seriously.   I quite like both ;)   Explain to me how any of that was the least bit pretentious, rude, or how it could sound "awful."   *I tend to reserve*  As in me, my opinion. Not saying the other chap is wrong, but here's what works for me.   I list a number of fantastic films that I consider prime examples of how I interpret postmodernism. What a dick. I mean really, who does that? /r/movies is for discussing movies, not... discussing... movies?  Finally, I simply state the definition of postmodernism from which I am working so that /u/I_AM_LOOKING_AT_YOU and others can understand where I'm coming from, and then I offer another potentially more accurate term for the aforementioned Lifetime movie.  There's nothing "pretentious" about my post. I politely disagreed with someone and explained exactly why. If that's pretentious, you'd have an awfully hard time having any conversation that isn't.   You'd think *someone* would have the initiative...   For the lazy:  Insofar as I may be heard by anything, which may or may not care what I say, I ask, if it matters, that you be forgiven for anything you may have done or failed to do which requires forgiveness. Conversely, if not forgiveness but something else may be required to ensure any possible benefit for which you may be eligible after the destruction of your body, I ask that this, whatever it may be, be granted or withheld, as the case may be, in such a manner as to insure your receiving said benefit. I ask this in my capacity as your elected intermediary between yourself and that which may not be yourself, but which may have an interest in the matter of your receiving as much as it is possible for you to receive of this thing, and which may in some way be influenced by this ceremony. Amen.  This is taken from *Creatures of Light and Darkness*, a 1969 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny.      Not really; he just didn't remember.   That's what I figured. It's funny because I thought of the exact same thing when I saw this post.   Disagreeing politely and contributing meaningfully to the conversation = pretentious.  Ah, Reddit...   You're not wrong. I'd suggest the loosest definition would be skeptical or critical works of their own time/genre/artform in the wake of modernism.      Makes a lot more sense than they're all right.   Only if said wrestling involves [zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UaY4idyLww).   I forgot that this is Reddit, where contributing to a conversation with a modicum of intelligence is considered "pretentious."  Next time I'll just comment "this."   I don't get Reddit sometimes. All I did was explain why /u/seven3true is correct in that celery can be considered less calories than listed. Why would anyone downvote that?

Kind of.  [Sauce](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/myth-or-fact-celery-has-negative-calories.html)   Yes, but celery has "negative calories."   As a plant, celery stores its calories throughout its body, just as every other plant does. There are plenty of food calories in celery; the difference is that humans cannot adequately process those calories.  The majority of energy that celery has locked within it passes through our digestive system without being processed. The cellulose calories celery has is irrelevant; all that counts is the six or so food calories we can get from each eight-inch stalk. Since it takes more than six food calories of energy to digest the celery, the net result is that digesting celery does, in fact, exhaust calories. In a very real sense, celery is a "negative calorie" food.   Of course.   That's not odd; it's logic.    I'd love to see their list  You mean the PDF I posted to make this TIL?  Also, in the introduction of the Wikipedia link you just provided:  ***This is not a complete list***  That's basically the opposite of "comprehensive."   Brilliant.         Right, because it's an unpopular opinion that gets downvoted like crazy. I don't find most of these particularly funny or creative either.  Now let's see what happens to my comment.   I went to Castaway Cay for my honeymoon. I was very tempted to hide and not get back on the cruise ship.   Well, I'm sorry you lost a friend but I'm very happy to read that you and your boyfriend are still going strong. Congratulations.   Aw... happy for you and your guy.    Well, only because you are just thinking about sex  I'm really not. True, I'm not sexually attracted to men and definitely don't want sex with a man, but more importantly, I don't fall romantically in love with men. I have two or three male friends whom I love, but it's a brotherly love, not a romantic or sexual love. I can't see that working in a relationship, even if he could fix my car for free, which would be amazing...  I like your analogies, though. Definitely laughed out loud at "your balls small funny."   That's a fascinating story. So you and your boyfriend (the original) are still together and totally "survived" the experience?  Also, CJ happens to me *my* initials... freaky.   Haterade is too sour for my taste buds.    Be a man, break it off, don't cheat.  Been saying this forever bro.   If you consider pedophilia and incest fucked up, yes. Yes it is.      Your user name plus dropping an Alan Moore reference to explain things means we're friends now.   That would be no different that straight people cheating then. I'm talking about 3, 4, or even more in a loving, committed relationship, kind of like polygamy, but that's almost always one man and like a dozen women, and the women are all for the one guy.    I legitimately had a hard time with Ratatouille for that very reason. For some reason, I could easily suspend my disbelief for the talking rat that can cook and whatnot, but controlling a man by his hair? Preposterous!   Seriously. The word "misdemeanor" doesn't even appear in the article, probably because it's not a relevant term in this context.  I guess "results in relatively lighter punitive measures" wasn't eye-catching enough.    No, there is not much evidence to back up this idea.  Or Freud in general, but he *is* a fun read.

I appreciate your civility and lack of defenciveness, but it's more than an opinion; it's an opinion based on quite a lot of research.    I believe that exposure to hyper-realistic violence in a controlled enviroment is a practical approach to parenting  Can you read that again and tell me you're actually being serious?  A four-year-old has no ability whatsoever to comprehend what he or she is seeing. Why would you show them at that young and impressionable age where they're still trying to make sense of the world people intentionally and purposefully doing wanton violence to one another? That's the impression you'd want a young child to have of the world? Just dash their innocence against the rocks right off the bat?  As for citing a source, I don't know how to narrow it down from [these 386,000](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=exposure+to+media+violence+children hl=en as_sdt=0 as_vis=1 oi=scholart sa=X ei=wlFsVYzBGMaagwTQtoP4CA ved=0CBwQgQMwAA), but feel free to pick the first three you like and peruse.  Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.  Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14). This association was significant and independent for television, video games, and music violence exposure in a model including all 3 media types (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.11; video games, 0.09; music, 0.09). There was a significant positive interaction between media time and media violence for video games and music but not for television. Effect sizes for the association of media violence exposure and physical aggression were greater in magnitude than for most of the other examined variables.  Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.  This really shouldn't surprise anybody.    The notion that hyper-realistic violence should not be exposed to children is utterly arbitrary  Not according to the many, MANY studies done on the subject, and your anecdote is meaningless; anecdotes are not evidence.  There are hundreds of thousands of studies I could link to supporting what I'm saying: a young child, a four-year-old, should *not* be exposed to the kind of violence depicted in Mortal Kombat.  Like I said, I'll take the downvotes, because fuck me for caring more about the welfare of children than... what? I don't even know why this warrants downvoting. I've been a fan of Mortal Kombat since the original hit arcades in 1992. I was eleven at the time. I've owned the home console version of all of them including X, but I don't play them in front of my now 5-year-old daughter because it would be grossly irresponsible bad parenting.    I doubt OP does fatalities/x-rays while his daughter is watching  What are you basing that doubt on? Even if OP doesn't, there's nothing stopping the opponent from doing it.  Besides, this is MK9 we're talking about. The regular gameplay and even backgrounds are graphically violent.   I don't care if I get downvoted for this; a four-year-old girl should not be exposed that kind of violence.    Great advice. Thank you.   As I said in my original post, it's all about convenience. There are currently about 20-30 bottles of delicious water in my refrigerator at about 34 degrees F that I can grab and drink at my leisure. The containers are also convenient, because even if I'm on the go, I can crush them down to almost nothing and screw on the cap. They fit right in my pocket until I can find a proper receptacle.   So, back to my original point, I use bottled water for the same reason I use floss picks rather than spool floss. Convenience is king.   There are lots of reasons including [breakdown on the plastics](http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/clinical/departments/medicine/divisions/digestive-health/clinical-care/nutrition-support-team/nutrition-articles/LeisingArticle.pdf) by reuse and the fact that the bottles turn into [bacteria parties.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12353459)   Seriously, people are buying this?    the floss picks are the only thing keeping daily flossing convenient enough to actually do  Same rationale I use when buying packs of bottled water. I know I'm supposed to drink water rather than soda, juice, etc., but without the convenience of the bottles and the awesome coldness of the refrigerator, I know I won't.   Yeah, as a parent of a five-year-old girl, I would not be comfortable with her seeing this.   Which is amazing when you consider how hilariously tame it looks next to something like MKX.   I don't even consider it "soft" atheism. Atheism is just a-theism, i.e., without theism. I'm irreligious and I don't believe in god. That's what an atheist actually is, regardless of how many people try to define it on their own terms or make ridiculous line graphs.   In other words, I'm not making any extraordinary claims. In spite of tons of reading, research, and opening myself up to many ideas, I see no evidence supporting the existence of god, nor do I see the need for one. I stop short of saying there is no god because that's impossible for me or anyone else to say meaningfully. There's no proof either way.   God either exists and it's wrong to say god doesn't exist, or god doesn't exist and it's impossible to prove a negative. I can't prove pink unicorns that eat rainbows and shit butterflies *don't* exist, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to not believe in them.  Therefore, rationally, "I don't believe in god" is the only sensible statement.   Meh. It's not as if I have to re-read it.   If every bullshit post were appropriately downvoted, there'd scarcely be a Reddit left.   Seriously. I'm 34. I cannot convey to today's teenagers and young adults how outrageous it was to see this in the arcades back in 1992. Minds were absolutely blown. A new ratings system was introduced because of this. People lost all their shit. All of it.   Character is unique by being completely black.  "Hey guys! I got a great animal for Noob Saibot! A black panther!"  "Anteater, yo."  "But-"  "Bro. Anteater."  "But he's-"  "Ant... eater."  "Sigh. K."   I can't even discuss Transmetropolitan because I start physically shaking with joy. It's that damned good.   Warren Ellis is easily one of my favorite comic book writers ever. His run on The Authority was brilliant.   I didn't fail to grasp anything. Either is wrong. You're making a statement of fact about something that cannot be proven. It makes no more sense to say God or gods exist than it does to say God or gods don't exist.   The sensible thing to say is either "I don't believe in god" or "I don't believe in gods."   It also doesn't matter which one you say as "god," singular, would stand in for any god; it doesn't matter how many there are.   Neither is correct.   Atheists don't believe in god, but in the same way that there is no evidence for god, one cannot disprove a negative. While I certainly don't believe in gods or anything else without proof, I nor anyone else can claim with 100% certainty that an improvable thing doesn't exist. That is logically impossible.  That being said, one should rationally say "I do not believe in god" rather than making any factual statement that they do not exist or cannot exist.  Taking that to OP's point, there is a semantic difference between "I don't believe in god" and "I don't believe in God." The capitalized "God" is a specific one, and, in the United States, most often assumed to mean the Abrahamic God, an even more specifically, the Christian trinity god based on demographics. An lower-case "god" could refer generically to any god, goddess, or similar deity and is therefore a perfectly reasonable substitute. You don't need to pluralize "gods" any more than you'd need to say, "I don't believe in God, god, gods, goddesses, or deities of any kind."    We can all read. Your post is   "There is no God" is incorrect. "There are no gods" is the proper term.   You're saying one is incorrect and the other is correct.  Not only are you wrong, but you're telling everyone *they're* wrong just because you have an opinion.

The first supernatural Ghost Rider, a cowboy of the same name doesn't count.   For stealth reasons, dark blue and gray actually make more sense than black.   [Here you go.](http://www.amazon.com/Green-Arrow-Quiver-New-Edition/dp/1401259421)  If you like Kevin Smith, he's actually written a few comics including for Daredevil and Batman.    I always thought of the grinch as a recluse Who who was pushed out of the town by the other who's because of his appearance.  Maybe he is, but it never suggests that in the book.   We don't speak of the Widening Gyre.   Quiver, Kevin Smith.   Because Kevin Smith.   "Your toys are of terrible quality."  "Ma'am, I assure you, we at Cruddifux make only the finest in action figurines!"  "This one's arm fell off."  "Hence the action! Arm Fall Off Boy!"  "The package says 'He-Man.'"  "Arm Fall Off Boy!"   I couldn't agree more. I like Batman dark as the night itself. It doesn't make sense to have a bright yellow belt when the idea is to be stealthy. Brown, tan, or even black leather would make plenty of sense.   They eat fat?   Egregiously so. Has any limit to his power been established? The kid literally alters realities and has even created new ones, wiped people's minds, and traveled between dimensions. What *can't* he do?   Mine is left out on the counter by the sink, so definitely don't use that, right?    You can also take all of your fats and mix them with sodium or potassium hydroxide (you can get this online) to make soap.   I'd have a hard time feeling clean after rubbing animal fat all over my body.   Would I smell of bacon?     He doesn't grow new ones; they just detach and reattach.  He can use his arm as a blunt weapon and swing it like a club, but aside from a few novelty uses, it's not a very useful power.   I suppose some cocks are nice to look at, but I don't think I'd like to get to know one intimately.    the grinch is still a Who as well  Is he?   [This is a Snyder Batman book right here.](http://allaboutbooksandcomics.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/batman-annual-cover.jpg)  It may vary by artist/colorist, but the standard has been yellow.   I had no idea. Does this infuse food with bacon's natural deliciousness?    I know where you can begin, reading comprehension courses.  Really? Because here's what you *actually* wrote:  Exactly, making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing. Some people don't seem to get that it has nothing to do with race and everything to do with fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy".  making Sue black would have been a lot less confusing  How is making Sue black *less* confusing? The only way her not being black could be construed as confusing is if you didn't grasp the incredibly simple concept of adoption or step siblings. This isn't hard.  fucking with the character's for what seems like no other reason than to be "edgy"  The only "fucking with the characters" (no apostrophe needed there) the filmmaker has done was to make Johnny Storm black, so that's you thinking black = "edgy."  I'm not the one in need of reading comprehension courses. If anyone needs an education here, it's you.   [His box office numbers would like a word with you.](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor id=willsmith.htm sort=rank order=ASC p=.htm)  These are all over a quarter of billion dollar earners and not one is adjusted for inflation.  Independence Day: $817.4 million.    Hancock: $624.4  MIB 3: $624.0  Men in Black: $589.4  I Am Legend: $585.3  Men in Black II: $441.8  Hitch: $368.1  Shark Tale: $367.3  I, Robot: $347.2  The Pursuit of Happyness: $307.1  Bad Boys II: $273.3  Enemy of the State: $250.6  Also, it's not as if Will Smith is the only star or even *the* star of the movie.   Is that sanitary?   Very true.       that can improve your day to day life  How so? I'm genuinely curious and I can't immediately recognize the appeal.   Probably the fact that I didn't know it was already posted yesterday.   [This is this year's Batman/Superman annual.](http://i.imgur.com/9AYBYpm.jpg)   It came out a month ago.   Note the belt color.   I'd like a list of most powerful humans.   I assume that's the balancing doohickey there?   I would have thought so considering he's literally #2 to The One Above All.    My theory is going primarily by the books. I didn't know The Grinch shows up in the Horton Hears a Who! movie, nor was I aware of Seussical.  EDIT 1: Which movie version of Horton Hears a Who! did the Grinch appear in? There are two.  EDIT 2: Actually, I have to insist this theory sticks to the books only as there have been two Horton movies and two Grinch movies. The movies contradict themselves and it cannot be sensibly said that one is canon while the other is not. This is strictly a book theory.    Jesus was born in the spring, and they moved the celebration day to coincide with the winter solstice  The Gospel of Luke references shepherds grazing their sheep in the fields implying a birth during the springtime, summer or early fall, so yeah, more or less. Your point stands.   It made $668 million.   Exactly. If I'm a capable enough writer and I want Arm Fall Off Boy to beat Darkseid, Arm Fall Off Boy beats Darkseid.  	192

Thanks for the interest but I am not the OP, I thought that knife people would find this interesting so I reposted this to that "OTHER SUB", got no love there and reposted again to here.Just wanted to share some nice knives. Enjoy!      Farscape   Do you ever even clean that thing!?   When I was first learning the trade at 15 years old, Mr. Budini would say,"If ya gotta look at a recipe, ya don't know what yer doin ya stupid sumdababitch!"  Learn what goes good with what and know your spices.Soon you will be creating your own recipes.   Umm, honey? About the 401k...   I spend all morning making home made soups stews and specials,then I work the line and yes I flip burgers.I consider myself more of a chef than the "Cryo-pac jockeys" at most chains.   Fuck you! I have made a very good living"Flipping Burgers" my whole life.I hate people who trash chefs/cooks and try to put them into the same category as trash collectors and such.FUCK YOU!      How do you like the Massakage? I have a mizu gyuto and it kicks ass!      Handy dandy   Take a piss after picking cayenne peppers.   I remember seeing a news article along time ago,(90's mabey?) that Bob Denver was arrested for trying to send some pot to her in a letter.Gilligan knows who's the hottest!   That is my favorite Beatles song!   Bobby Magee,Janis.   What about Billy the mountain? Zappa and the Mothers live album.   In the US, be very carefull about how you say things when you text or call back home.A phrase like "We came here to party and we're gonna burn this city up!" will probably get you detained and deported.   And Buck.   Why is this an issue? People are just trying to be happy. Fuck religion.   Purty!   No #'s after my name,be creative!   I went to a free concert back in the early 90's featuring "Muddy Waters' guitar player".Was expecting an old blues man to come out and sit in a chair and play some acoustic blues.Buddy came out in a red coverall with a wireless guitar and blew the fucking roof off the place! He was out in the crowd and even up in the balconey,what a showman,been a big fan ever since.   If Al Bundy and Red Foreman did a movie I would be so happy.   And a fine blues singer.   Imagine the Red Green show being marketed as a "reality" show,and the stores are  trying to sell you Red Green diapers or Red Green shampoo,ect...ect...that is Duck Dynasty. Bye the way,what ever happened to Red Green,I loved that show   Then they would set up camp close to where they fell and spend months processing the meat, hides, bones, ect, ect for their own use and for trade goods. After that they would move on to find a winter camp to settle into and in the sping the cycle would begin again.Taking that much game at one time would have been a huge piece of luck and and seen as a gift from the spirits.   Anything by SRV or Buddy Guy.   This was a joke about knife collecting posted to a sub about knife collecting.You sound like you're talking about gambling or drug addiction!Get over yourself Dr fuckin Phil!   HA HA! Thanks all.To be fair,my wife is a quilter and she says I can't understand why she keeps buying fabric.      Italian sausage and peppers,eaten with big buttery slices of Italian bread. YUM!   That is one sweet knife!   Old guy here,never liked family guy because I just don't think it's funny,south park is so much better.      877 cash now!   Ceramic knives don't live up to the hype. Your money would be better spent on a steel knife.   Amazon carries replacment parts for SAK's.   Anyone else see the bird on the mountain?   Really like this,nice work!   Benchmade, Spyderco, ZT too. My Christmas wish is to see something new!   Learn to cook, eat and drink at home instead of restaraunts and above all don't get married.   Take care of this one! Cattaraugus knives were good quality and made in NY state,they shut down in the early 60's.   Because girls get all horny over "sensitive" guys.   I have a set of the original pure Komachi knives which are very nice light duty kitchen knives made in Japan.They were very,very popular so Kershaw decided to use cheaper steel,shitty plastic handles, move production to China and call them Pure Komachi 2. I like Kershaw knives but that was a shitty move.I would not expect much quality on these.   GE   Yep!   that IS wierd,works on my ps3 but I always have to pause a few minutes at the start,on my 360 it just plays.Mabey it's location or something.   The small town I work in is like this,people just stroll into the road without looking.   Has Sony upgraded Their servers? I always watch netflix on my 360 because I don't have to wait for buffering.   HA HA! Hope you are enjoying this one!   I've been looking for a knife with very specific characteristics for a long time.First and foremost,it had to chop,slice and do tip-work all equally well.secondly,it had to be light, nimble and easy to use on the fly in a fast short-order kitchen on the 2'/10" cutting board of my sandwich bar. last but not least,it had to be under $100 and not so fancy that I would cringe to beat it up. I'm an old school chef and don't believe in cutting up tons of stuff ahead of time.I use a heavier, taller gyuto knife to make my soups and specials in the AM,then go to this as I do orders.I tried so many of my knives for this and it was always a trade off,a tad long or short, good sweet spot for chopping but no good for tip work,nice tip and belly but no chop spot.Ran across this by chance and I love it!      Correct,you win a biscuit!   I agree, but we are not splitting hairs here,If you live in the suburbs and drive a Hummer that never leaves the pavement,you are an extreme douche.    Humvee, king of all douche-mobiles   Good bye life savings,Stokholm here I come!   Don't buy ceramic kitchen knives, you will be disappointed.Search instead for Victorinox, Kershaw or Dexter to name a few.   German made.Nice knife,keep it and treat it well.Search youtube about sharpening. P.S. This is probably an import from the 70's.   In a drawer, and I throw in every silica gel pac from the meds my wife and I take   Meh,Hetz rent a car already did it.   Taxes.   Kids will wear shirts for pants and pants on their head.   I have collected knives and also used them to make a living my entire life,I'm no expert but here's my take:You can drive yourself crazy with edge theory,or any other theory for that matter.If an edge works for you it's good,period. Unless you are a world class wood carver or an internationaly acclaimed sushi chef,you don't need to inspect your blade with a microscope.I hear the same arguments about theory on ham radio,I am talking to a guy in Russia while another guy here in the US is telling me why my antenna wont work.   Fine collection,keep them well!         Yhea,I get it. Try a Tomcat or a Vulcan, it might change your mind.   Bone,copper,D-2      Yhea,if you are young get used to it, you will see it more and more as you get older.   I threw the "Big man in town" out of my kitchen a few months ago,tried to be polite but the fat-ass just ignored me until I got in his face.   I have seen seen people totally abusing the server while at at the same time explaining to their kids that they have to know their "station in life",arrogant enough?   Bobcat Goldthwait.   I used to have a job where I would have to portion out 200# of raw fish every Wed. Nobody ever sat next to me on the way home!   Love it! That style is known as a "sunfish" or "elephant toe" and they are very collectable.   Ok then,from the top down: Linder mini hunter, Nieto picnic knife, Spyderco something, Kershaw double cross and Therias   L 'econome.   Got it from World knives,it is out of stock now. Mabey E-Bay?   Don't be sorry,most of the people that would bust on you for using a good sharpener are just hipsters and fan boys. The only good hand sharpeners in the world are people who have devoted their entire lives to it.   As requested,I posted a short review.Thank you for your interest   I love that little Nieto picnic knife,comes mostly sharp,could be better. A few imperfections such as a buffer burn on the corner of one scale, and in my case a tiny nick in the edge of the main blade.Not a deal breaker for me as I can easily correct that when I get to it.Build is very tight and right,both blades walk well and have a good snap.Overall I'm happy with this knife and would buy from this maker in the future   That would be a  kershaw Double cross,made in Japan by Kershaws Kai division.Sadly, it and it's larger brother the double duty have been discontinued.      Fuck you.   Their high-end knives are great,the rest just so so.   Grew up with that nonsense,we even had "Sacred ash-trays"!   Sweet!   masakagi mizu.   Old Hickory and Dexter knives are good,the rest are junk.$3.00,ya done good kid!  	109

 Indeed, but in your honest opinion, do you think they'll make a season 3? Even if it is way down the road?  	1
 Thanks for the love! Yes, I'll most likely return to the series, or at least the CONCEPT of the series at some point in time.   I would absolutely be interested in approaching that subject, but probably not from a novella standpoint. I think things would be very, very different overseas for various geopolitical reasons, so I think broaching that story would take a little more than a novella. But it's definitely something I've thought about!   Definitely something else. For now.  My book that's being shopped right now (Wolves) is post-apocalyptic, but that's really more of just the setting of the story, and not necessarily the story itself.  The book I'm writing right now is...dystopian. And has to do with revolution, which is a touchy subject. But I'm having fun.  Well, the rights are taken. We'll just have to cross our fingers and see what happens!  	3
 For research    As always your stories most certainly do not suck. Kudos and have an upvote.   	2
 Damnit, I was so afraid this was going to come after I saw the vid. First off, you didn't ruin shit, by the amount of flaming done by the opposite team, they deserve no less. Plus, it's bronze and you're climbing really fast, these people have basically a 0% chance to ever play with you again so for them, it's one game where they're either on the right or the wrong side.  And to be fair, I'm in gold and would love a game where I get stomped by someone of your level just to see where all my mistakes lie.. Seriously, keep it up, do whatever you feel like doing and fuck us, Reddit will always find a way to disagree!   Is it because he streams on azubu.tv now that his channel isn't being shown anymore on lolstreams?   I'll give that a try, thanks! However, I'm afraid that even when it dries out, it will still leave behind that sticky mess wich will destroy everything anyway, any tips for that? Btw, seems like it's only on the side with my battery, ventilator and USB ports, HDD, Ram and video card seem safe   Hi,  I manged to spill half a glass of red vodka on my laptop the other night and it's basically dead now. It was an Alienware M14x with pretty decent allround stats, bought for 1600-ish. Now, I'm going to send it back to Dell and ask if they can fix it and if now, if they can just replace the broken parts or give me a discount if I buy the same one since there's probably parts in that that work just fine.  In case this doesn't work for whatever reason, I would like some suggestions for a new one, with about the same specs or better but perhaps for a cheaper price because I know Alienwares are expensive.  Stats I had now: Windows 7 Home Edition 500GB 7,200 RPM SATA + 32GB mSATA Caching SSD  8GB (2 X 4GB) Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz and a 6GB Nvidia card (forgot exactly wich one it was)  All suggestions are welcome! Thank you   I main adc and can trade while farming pretty well now, however, due to always having a support by my side, my map awareness is not what it should be.

And some chocolate for dessert :)   Why are these top comments getting deleted when they're telling the truth? Already seen multiple of these..   Thank you so much for giving such a detailed answer. I'm going to buy and download it now, will let you know in some time what I think of the game and wether it was worth it! I'm very interested   Hi, I'm looking for a (if possible) Steam  racing game. It has to have an open world and preferably a large collection of excisting supercars in wich you can cruise around. I don't really like racing other people or AI itself, just would love to just drive the cars. Bonus points is if's not needed to grind points/cash for hours before you get your first decent car.  I looked for a game like this and found TDU2. Is this the right game for me? Or other suggestions? Thanks alot!  Ps: I know it's weird to want a racing game without having to do alot of racing itself but I remember I just loved to drive in GTA with the faster cars. This is what I'm looking for now, only more realistic and perhaps less killing stuff :)   *sigh* gifbin..

 Cool, thanks for your insight. Cheers on being a better person. :)   "quit all news 5 years ago"  On reddit.   Hows that going for you? Where do you base your...oh forget it you've got it all figured out.    You dont watch morning news, do you?    thanks Einstein.    No, that's not why. Why is this upvote so much.    My ex girlfriend lived in two states in her 40 years of life. Jersey and Oregon. Imagine it.    Wrong. Old laws.    I just want my local morning news. That's it. It's a ritual for waking up showering getting ready etc.    Whatever, *dude*.    Yep. This part sucks.    Northern is key. I'm in Southeast. You're probably closer to Hartford metro.    Edward 40 hands it is.       http://www.antennaweb.org/ says i can only really get two channels which are both the same ION.    that it is plausible but when talking to some people and a guy at best buy who tried it said it just doesnt happen.  I guess the amount of trees and hills it just wont work.    I am now realizing that I wont even be able to get my local channels even if I buy a digital antenna. The only reason I kept cable for as long as I did was for AMC (Walking Dead, Better Call Saul and Mad Men which is over) and my local NBC news station. Everywhere I've looked I wont be able to reach them.   I am in Connecticut. Anyone else have a work around for the local broadcasts? The loss of AMC was something I was going to have to work around but not having my local news really sucks. It's a big part of morning and nightly routines.   Thanks for reading.    I really am going to miss getting the local channels. We cut cable as of yesterday and none of the stations are in reach of me. I'm in Connecticut not east bumble fuck Nebraska.    yep thanks but same as always. I get 12 stations from 2 channels. ION and ION. I'm screwed. And I live in Connecticut not like im in some out in the middle of nowhere bumblefuck.   I cut cable on this love. (just moved know yesterday) and I'm afraid a digital antenna isn't going to reach my local stations. Super bummed.    Well, I would certainly hope it was.

[beware of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr7u345D3xc)   just bought one tonight at best buy. on it for not not more than ten minutes and love it so far. it does what it's supposed to....and well.   How about the s5? I'm due for an upgrade in November and will probably just go to that.    Hmmm, how much did it cost to build? HD?   Thank you. I'm just getting into this and realize I need to find an antenna thats going to reach the NBC one in New Britian from where I am. Thank you for that link.   Luckily I have a smart tv and amazon prime and netflix already. I also have a comcast account I can access. Currently going from Comcast to Metrocast and not as good of pricing.    cutting the cord on June 1st. All I'm worried about is The Walking Dead.   How has the HD Antenna worked out for you. I plan on doing the same for local news etc. What state are you in? I'm in Connecticut.   I was only subscribed for AMC for The Walking Dead and Mad Men. Now that Mad Men is over I'm cutting the cord but don't know how I'm going to watch The Walking Dead. I do still have a comcast login password from a previous house that still works. Will I be able to catch up the next day with that?   damn skippy.   I've got 12 bucks and this is the perfect thread to use up some of that cashola!   been using it for a couple years now.    The Place is a lot of fun. Bring your own table wares, sides of food, booze etc.    she was wearing the '13 outfit. Shit brought her back in time.    over the ten year I lived in Seattle I used that thing once...when my mom was visiting. A touristy thing.    I had a grey cat like that but fluffier. He loved to play catch. His name was Chicken. RIP Chicken.    is there a gif of him in the empty apartment looking around? Thats how i felt.   Crazy! As i started reading this I thought you saw my uncle. Every memorial day he flies his boss to a party in New York from Nantucket. He's a private pilot and every year on his way back he lets us know about when to look up. We have a picnic at my grandpas in Old Lyme and he flies a bit lower and kicks in the "turbo" or whatever it's called (I don't know any technical terms). It's really cool to witness.      even for when im using drum machine apps on my ipad? Just have it set to 4/4? Not lining up.   I have options 5/4 6/4 7/4 etc 6/8 9/8 12/8     i have been having this problem with my s4   newampshuh?   I love that era. Do you know what you are getting for gas mileage?   this entire day does. you should see me today at the parade. Hell, I get emotional over cereal commercials.    lol   no way, just this one easy trick by some redditor and voila.    How about that Danny DeVito phase, right?   "Now can I go back to eating my dry grilled chicken and over cooked pasta?"   im sorry but one more thing. I can't seem to find that signature on any program im using. can it also be something else?   You chuckled at a flip phone pointing out to a smart phone that it can flip open and closed?     Not kidding that's what I saw with the thumbnail.    RIP /showerthoughts   Smilin along the way.    wow, that was quick and awesome. thank you so much. :)      Man, I miss playing snooker.    My goodness.    Seattle?    First day I moved to Seattle. 1997. Small town kid never really spent much time in any city. Witnessed a lady take a shit up against a building down by pike place market.     , dawg.    meh, i guess.   I'm 36. all im asking is whats so funny about this? I know what flip phones are.    i dont get it   was that picture taken with a russet potato in 2015/   dont ever listen to Christina Aguilera   Welcome to Connecticut. Stay off of our fucking roads.    Summers in New England are no fucking joke.    Mega gnarly Mrs B.   i swear im having deja vu in this thread.   its been slowly getting worse and worse. sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt at all. sometimes it get stuck and just makes a long bzzzzzzz etc...  is this something i am going to be able to  fix myself?

Thanks for the info. :)    Been using comcast for many years and although there practices can be shady the internet/cable has been great.  Anyone have any tips on what to pay for and what you actually get?   White hatters is something we used to call the douche bag jocks in high school. They always wore those stupid white college logo hats.   Cheers, thanks.    Hey, I stickied this post but now that your a mod please feel free to do the same on Thursday or Friday for sure. Just remember to take it down Sunday night or Monday. Great job. Cheers. :)         Danger is my middle name.   It isn't.    Which is the right thing to do.    Sorry about that.    Willing to bet it still is.    And you?    Is that on the toy's r us website?    I'd cuddle the ever living shit out of that.    We aren't talking about real bears here, son.    Please show me a teddy bear that isn't soft and cuddly.    I'm a 36 year old white guy with a beard down to my t shirt. I do this song at the local dive bar karaoke and people fucking **JAM**  I GOT IT ON LOCK DOWN.    So did my mom. She also calls it walmarts.    Catering chef. So weekends Fri-sat its both in the summer. 14-16 hour shifts. Weddings. There are some random Saturdays I am done by 3 but few and far between.    As a mod I would love to attend and set one up but unfortunately I always work Saturdays in the summer. I know last year's appeared to go well so hopefully you all do it again. :)    Railroad salvage. Wow.    Because beer snot.    damn that innuendo.    - my dad   36 checking in. Too much reddit.    Where  is weaver? Sounds familiar.     Same here. This is so tough.    Just take it from behind.    *surfing*   This was fun to read. I'm a catering chef by trade and do about 70 weddings a year.    Right? Ridiculous. What do you use instead?    Or you know, this is just a silly joke to put on the Internet? Relax.    Me. It shows up in every fucking Pandora station. Wtf!    Or that fucking Hawaiian dude singing somewhere over the Rainbow shit? Every fucking dyationstation.    The song is a jam, though.    Someone just posted this, right?    Ya, amount of expendable income varies by person. That 70 bucks a month isn't much for a good amount of people. No need to justify it, ya know?   So if I wanted to buy a Ford truck I could get it cheaper by going to the plant as opposed to the dealership?    I have.    []GunsNGravy 6 points 4 hours ago  I saw a lady stomp a guy's fingers to grab a guitar pick that the bassist had thrown out at a concert this past Saturday. Some people are fucking insane.   it's like they are trying to eat those rice cakes as sloppily as possible.    just got out of one 4 months ago. really missing what I had. :(   Weird. Ctrl f bass guitar in this thread. Another person has a very similar story.    *he's just so handsome*   Never enjoyed a beer out of a green bottle.    A pierogi truck? Good god where is this heavenly food truck?    I can just hear the white man blues jam from the picture.    hey, i thought it was cute.            Seriously though.

How am I supposed to even view the show when my eyes are pouring tears from the intro?   My fucking God im anxious. Cheers to my fellow drinkers. I'm getting hammered tonight.    shit, I've been found.   "mastrobate"   I know what I'm calling it from here on in.    well, ive seen it all. pack your reddit bags no where else to go.   which one?

"cool"   Zillow    Oh cool. Doesn't matter.    When I do that the sound cuts out.    Can we please get back on the topic of Cheers, please?    Sad, I can't even share this because then I'm somehow a sexist.       He is such a talented actor I hope this works.   Does anyone know what I'm talking about?   And?    It isn't technically but it used as such.    I live how the pad is a male. Even the pad is failing you.    Why is it tagged r/all?    Nope, plenty others in this thread.    Damn that's good.    Thanks :)       what did they give you for prep?   My buddy wrote that on both of my hands the morning after a long ass cocaiine and whiskey fueled night. My coworkers were not very amused.    Or, the people that feel this way should just not go. What's the deal with everyone?   Oh I know. She checks my kink all the time. It's weird I feel that way, I get it. Just being honest.

 So is spelling.   Or give it a Coca-Cola.   May the fourth be with you.   Shh, patience...   especially after having to deal with shitty Apple products on a daily basis for several years  You know, you do have a choice to buy other phones right?   An innuendo would not be one if you didn't understand it.  So therefore the thought was already in your head.  All he did was make you consciously aware.    It's never bothered me.

I expected this.   Good job, but the funny thing about real life is, your GPA doesn't mean shit in a few years.   It was the juice cleanse that dealt the final blow.   Hey, you've already done all the hard work so whatever intern picks up your story will look like they are smart and did some work.   The pictures are eerily similar to how the 4th dimension was depicted in the film Interstellar. Which would be accurate since space (x,y,z axes) is 3 dimensions and time being the 4th.   I used to try and butcher people's names as much as possible because I knew it would give them something to instagram about,  so that they can feel that the people following them online really give a shit about anything they have to post about.

Damn kids!   Hey Jim, I love your character in The Big Bang Theory. Can you tell us how it's like to work with a hottie like Kaley Couco?    Or fearing that her parents might pick up the line while you're having a phone sex session.    3 way ftw!   You compare the act of running a red light to the crime of shooting someone.  Does running a red light constitute a crime? Is it an immoral act?   Oooooo, I got this reference. Although I don't remember from where.    Awesome! This is great for road trips since you can stream from Spotify.    I have an office job so I listen to tracks at work.   If you can't discover new music on Spotify, there must be something wrong with you.   There are tons of playlists to explore.    Some of the top earners make in the millions.    That was his cell phone.    Aw, I hate it when that happens.    I'm more shocked that the most expensive thing on the menu is under $5 US dollars.    Saving up for a week in order to afford coffee? You can make enough money for coffee in an hour of panhandling.   Google the MTV show "Jersey Shore" to get an idea of what American Italians are like.

Go to the event page on Facebook and post on the wall that you have tickets for tomorrow's show.   Or just eat varied food that is cheaper than ramen. It's not impossible to develop a diet for yourself that is cheaper than ramen, just requires a little bit of effort.  You talk a big game, but I seriously doubt you can put your money where your mouth is.

 i'm still worried about the coverage honestly.  Verizon has WAY better coverage than sprint and tmo...probably combined it's still not as good in rural areas.  Unless there are some giant WiFi towers out there that google has certified, it'll be interesting to see how it pans out.   link? I can't find it.   The thing that broke on my g27 was the plastic position sensor.  I ordered a brass one online and now it works like a champ again.   Yeah, that's why I bought PCars for PC   Too bad this doesn't work with the xb1 or ps4 .  I know there is a USB converter out there but the force feedback doesn't work as of now   I have the same color. Get looks and complements constantly   I just picked up a turbocharger for the car. Worked pretty well.   went from 46% to 71% in about 45 min while using the screen, GPS, spotify, emails, etc.   don't think that is a jammer, just a really good detector   I've done this jump. It's pretty cold but neat to swim in.   Well, that's niche markets in general.  My uncle got a degree in geology but ended up manufacturing a upgraded part for ICP-MS machines (I think) that made the resolution better or something along those lines.  He's made millions off of this little process in this little corner of one market.  The point of the video is to get people to evaluate their situation and perhaps look around to see if there is something they can do to change it if they are unhappy.  The path to success looks like [this](http://wp.patheos.com.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/files/2014/02/Path-to-success.jpg)  I've done a whole lot of different things and I'm on my 2nd-3rd major career and I'm 35.  So, it's all about what you are willing to do and be willing to fail.   I rode my bike through that exact stretch of walkway on Saturday.  It was nice that day too, I wonder if he was filming that day.   Not sure of how long it takes to for him to edit and post these.   You're probably OK with just the one then. Just keep the two in the back the same tread depth.   Awd? Then replace them all if the new one is more than 3/32" difference than the rest.  If rwd, then you could be OK   I did that too.  After a 1000 it seems to get easier because you can clear the 3 cactus bunches easily   Unlimited money to political parties   I'm a few days behind, but the last one I watched went did this again. But they are changing it up a bit   He'll get local people that seem like fairly knowledgeable people there, but only local people in NYC.  They are usually news station contributors or advocate group spokesperson.  I'm sure they are having a hard time getting people on short notice, so that's why you see the shows staff and touring comedians on the show to fill one of the 4 spots.     It's three 7 min segments.  Monolog, panel, keep it 100.  6 min isn't really worth it   It seems like they're trying out a few things.  I don't mind the panel with opposing views, but they only have about 6 - 12 min to talk about anything so it's really hard to actually get a good conversation going and wrap it up in that time frame.     Mahr does it better, but that's once a week for an hour.  Just like I'm sure The Daily Show won't stand up to Oliver after Jon leaves.   Only if you look at the exact same things all day everyday   Voice Over LTE    I sell portable industrial scientific equipment.  You want to know what that metal, gas, powder, or dirt has in it? I probably have something that will tell you and can hold it with one hand   I sell portable XRF units, you may have or may be getting a new unit from us soon.     My wife works at amgen, but she transitioning into web development.  Who knows, she could end up at that same site in a few years when it's ready.  Very cool spot.  I hear 2018 is the target? Seems long   I hear that you should be getting a portable  XRF and nir unit soon.  Not sure if you inspect the incoming metal grades or scrap, but I sell those   Obviously if verified, and it would help if they posted a fair bit too before they get the flair.  Are we going to separate employees of dealers and corp employees I'm not sure which employees we've had   What lawns?   Yup.  Under the main heading you could see the upvotes in orange, and downvotes in blue.  The sum would be the number we still have.  Remember reddit puts automatic downvotes on threads over time to allow new ones to come up.  So a thread that had 3000 net upvotes would show like 15000 upvotes and 12000 downvotes .  I'm sure in most cases there weren't actually that many real downvotes, just a small portion and the rest were added by the algorithm  EDIT:  Here's an example of what it was like http://i.imgur.com/7rcMyAO.jpg   What channel? Nat Geo?   Repo'd?  That might be a possibility   ok. There's a handful on Craigslist around the same price around here, so I'll keep an eye out on either site.   13 is the time to get pregnant there apparently.   Neat, was that with the kinect as well?   Also, did you catch the price?     guess I'll just have to monitor it more today    Will this ever list a current gen system? Or are they all last gen systems?  I'll take a Xbox one for cheap.   Or they have older kids and they don't need any more crap?   I was looking into buying an ATF franchise.  The key fee is just what they mark up the $4 RFID chip so you can access the building whenever.   To seal the deal to get new members they can waive "activation fees" or discount the "key fee".  Both of those have very little costs so it's easy to waive it to get someone to pay $45-$50/mo.  As long as they have 600+ members they are making money. (depending on rent costs)   That's for the smaller club access, it's like $460 for the larger ones. Still $15/mo for 2 years and no initiation fees.   This is the most accurate answer, however you need to have it rooted and a custom recovery installed to do it. (not too difficult to do)   With all the sensitivity around this subject in the US, I have NO CLUE how this song ever got on the radio unedited.    Didn't say it was. Just saying it takes 500 lbs to bend a wrench.    Unless you cache the area you are in, yup.   With the right training, we have more distance running ability.  They will be faster in the short term, but they will get tired faster   I'm sure the massive guys in the main pic are stronger than this guy, but wouldn't be able to come close to being able to do this, even using a proper technique.  There's something different about him that normal people don't have.   Then how'd he do it?   oh yeah, for sure. The part where he "measures" the force of the bike with the crane gauge?  The rope had some slack in it and when he popped the clutch, the rope snapped to tension resulting in WAY more force than when he slowly got the rope taught for the guy then slowly applied the throttle.   I'm sure it takes a lot of strength to hold back a motocycle, but it wasn't 1300 lbs of force.  but their explanation for his ability to do the things he does makes the most plausible sense.  Especially since the supposedly do that for a living.   http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4a6_1369884683  Motocycles can hurt you   yup http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4a6_1369884683   http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4a6_1369884683  Motorcycle accident.   http://m.liveleak.com/view?i=4a6_1369884683   Good on you, detective Friends.   "Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements."  Care to explain where I'm wrong?   I was stating that girls like this DO EXIST.  Attractive, smart, stable and like games/anime.  Might be 1 in 100,000,000, but they are out there.  As the gaming/geek culture gets more mainstream and girls are exposed to and not shamed for liking that culture the odds will get better and better.    Stay vigilant young brothers! (older ones?...yeah, good luck)   Force = Mass * Acceleration.  They measured his muscle fiber output and apparently he can activate more fibers that a normal person.  So when he activates all of them at once, he can accelerate his hands at a faster rate, therefore producing a higher force.  He was on an episode of "Stan Lee's Superhumans" where they hooked him up to a computer to measure his output.  It was off the scale their first attempt.   *EDIT*  It's on Netflix, the first episode, his section starts at 33 min.  They replicate the force to see how much weight it would take to bend a wrench like that and it's over 500 pounds of static force.   To tag on to this,  Id probably buy a used G35 and run it until the engine needs replacing.  That will be FOREVER.  These engines don't really die as long as you take care of it.  I'd love to see a G35 sedan with an LS1, but that would cost at least 3x as much as you paid for the car.   Well, I think the adaptable cruise control and lane assist are pretty cool, but pretty useless for any 1/2 competent driver, so not really worth the money.  They wont help if someone is dumb and smashes in to you.  As far as advanced driving skills go, it's hard to explain in short order.  The main thing is to be smooth.  Smooth driving is fast driving.  I've been self studying these tactics 30+ years with no official training.  I did attend one of these schools that I mentioned back in 2006 and they said they couldn't teach me anything more than what I already knew.  I was passing corvette Z06's in a 350z, I out run most Porsches (non turbo) around tracks in my G37 (until the oil cooler can't handle it and gimps the RPMs).  Of course if they had drivers similar to me, they'd walk away no problem.  I am no pro, but I'm better than most people on the road.  I placed in the top 1% of people in [GT academy](http://www.gran-turismo.com/us/academy/about/)  It's a lot of theory and understanding the physics of what is happening during every second the car is moving.  Understanding things like what a [contact patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_patch) is and how [weight transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer) affects it.  No matter what road I'm on I'm always am looking for the proper [driving line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_line) and also figuring out where the optimal [braking zone](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/braking.htm) is.  If you are on a wet road and start to [oversteer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/oversteer.htm) you need to know how to recover safely (RWD mostly, but they can [understeer](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/understeer.htm) too.)  If you understand these basics, you can drive any car fast once you get the feel how the car performs.  Then you can drive that same car at a normal speed, but have the skills to get you out of any mess you or someone else puts you in.  Check out that www.drivingfast.net  That seems to describe the basics pretty well.  If you can find a closed parking lot or private road(track) to practice on, that would be best.  Once you get into it, you might discover that you have a little of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) and realize you didn't know how much you really don't know about driving.   A licence just proves you know the rules of the road and can operate the basics of a car.  It doesn't mean you can actually *drive*       well, first off, do you want a manual or auto?  That'll eliminate a few options right there (no manual and AWD)  Also, if you've only been driving on public streets since January, this will be a lot of car for you (300+hp).  There are lots of electronic counter measures that will help keep you on the road, but that doesn't keep you 100% safe.  Am I reading right that you are in Mexico?  No idea what's available as far as driver training, but in the states we have advanced driving courses that teach you racing mechanics and skills that will translate well to emergency maneuvers when needed, but it requires practice to be able to feel what the car is doing or is going to do and adjust accordingly.  They can be pricey ($500/day) but if you love to drive it's worth every penny (peso?)   That or they don't believe me   Find a normal tightness, then go one looser and you should be fine   Loose fit should be fine.  I wear mine one notch looser than I normally would.  The normal notch cracked it in the first week   Nothing.  It's when the band is under too much stress.  A normal metal back would have no issues with the amount of stress it takes to crack the back of this   Mobile app glitched   My wife looks very similar to her, and she's a gamer/anime watcher.  She's my personal geek goddess   Kind of like amg for Mercedes and SRT for Dodge.   Weird. Not sure then   I'll never buy a car that has an automatic transmission.  A sequential paddle one is the closest I'll get.  My 08 had the slave cylinder fail, but it's never been an issue as far engagement   I'm sure it's the same thing that happens to all brakes.  When you push the pedal down, it compresses some air and it's leaking out right at the pedal.  Nothing too wrong about it, but dust could get in there   Lead was banned across the board in 1978   Inner cities are nothing but roads and buildings.  The lead gets everywhere and people were breathing it in.   Love, to a tennis player, only means you haven't scored yet.   Or project cars?   well...the hair dryer does move air.   Chocolate's melting point is 88 degrees  Fahrenheit. The phone is meant to withstand about 120 degrees like most other electronics   You might be able to take a hair dryer, heat up the chocolate and blow it out at the same time.  You can also put a towel over the affected area and use the dryer again to heat up the towel and soak up the chocolate at the same time.  Just take your time and don't get the phone too hot.

They have one master box that is connected to the modem.  Then if you have slave boxes where other tv's are, those act as repeaters for the wifi.  So when they claim the fastest "in home wifi", it's due to having a very strong wifi signal that allows you to get the most speed that the modem is providing anywhere in the house (or outside).    You can have a 10Gbps connection right to your house, and a 802.11AC router sitting right next to it.  But if it's like my house and in a closet in a corner of the house, it doesn't have a strong wifi connection in most areas of the house.  So you'll be lucky to get 5-10% of what the modem can do.    in 2010, ATT claimed largest 4G network because HSPA+ was considered "4G" at the time.  So they were right.  VZW said they had the most LTE coverage, so they were right as well.  T-Mobile claimed the fastest LTE, and they were also right because it was averaging like 30mbps, but only in like 4 cities at the time.  It's all about how you spin it.  So when you see all these claims that each one of them makes, it seems like they all make the same claim and it gets jumbled when you try to remember it later.  	106

 Yea from all the comments i figured SMS and email are much better, will definitely use them :)   you can do video streaming with the Skype shield in the 1Sheeld app.  http://1sheeld.com/shields/skype-shield/   Haha I don't have a baby i just built the system.   I just used it for the sake of using Twitter you know, you're right notifications and email would wor better.    Twitter is free, while most SMS services are at least nominally pay.    Yea you're right, I could use the notification, e-mail or SMS. They are all included in the 1Sheeld app.   Actually I'm using the phone for that, I use the phone as a gateway to Twitter through the Twitter shield in 1Sheeld.   Thanks! You can find all the details in the instructable :)      Yea the point is to leave a cheap smart phone inside the car, and this phone acts as a GPS, Accelerometer and GSM shield so you can talk to it and receive messages as well.   This one is the easiest, you use 1Sheeld that connects to an old phone, the Arduino is connected to the master fuse so you can send it a message to stop remotely. With the GPS and accelerometer in the phone, it sends you a text message with the location of the car. http://www.instructables.com/id/Tracking-and-Controlling-your-car-remotely-using-A/   Where is the US link?

Yea the beauty about it is that you access 36 shields on the phone itself, including voice recognition, text to speech, facebook, phone calls, video calls ... etc.   Yea the meaning here is this one line:   Twitter.tweet("Plant is thirsty!");  	17
 Have I answered all your questions satisfactorily and offered good customer service?    OP's Mom.   [Subtitles to movies that aren't actually read as part of the movie aren't subtitles they're scripts]  (http://www.imsdb.com/)   It looks like my compost turner married a spit roast and had a baby.   From what I'm reading California has a Points system like we have here ... these are basically demerits that go on your record in addition to the monetary fees.  If they accumulate too high, worse things happen.  Depending on your insurance, they may only look at the points on your record.     Sometimes even for a simple speeding ticket by appearing in court you can explain the circumstance, that it's your first ticket, etc and perhaps get the points reduced or removed.  It's extremely doubtful you'll get out of the monetary pentalties though.   Apparently for CA if you just pay the ticket online than you get hit with the points.  As a young drive you're already starting from a ditch in terms of insurance ... I would find and insurance sub and ask if your insurers looks at anything other than points.  If they only look at points, I'd go to court and try to get the points removed at least.   You definitely don't need a lawyer.     By turning yourself in did you get reduced sentencing ? What was it like living before turning yourself in ? Were you paranoid ? Scared ? Making the decision to do your time while your kid  is still a baby seems to make sense.   Also, this is the single best AMA I've ever read on Reddit.   Ever.     SINGLE BEST AMA EVER.      Never camped a day in my life in PA, all I know is my wife is from there and she's been bugging me to take her camping at Rickett's Glenn.   If it's really just a matter of needing a short sternum strap, I'd consider taking it to your local cleaner/taylor and ask them if they could cut it, shorten it, and then restitch the bar stitching that holds it onto the buckles.     Don't know what your normal diet  is, but I don't see a huge amount of protein in there.  I'd have to eat the whole bag of nuts on day 1 just to get my daily protein ... food for though, perhaps a packet of tuna or some jerky may be good as well.    Hey man, having fun leaving Penn-Mar park, I'm jealous.    I have a buddy who's never spent the night outdoors and he's working up the courage.  We've agreed to start with car camping, let him ease into it, and then hopefully by fall he'll be backpacking with the rest of us.  I figured I'd take him to any of the nearby State parks; with the showers and potable water on demand plus other activites it seems like a great starter.   In our State  parks they put you on defined sites that are really gravel pads, about 10 feet away from the next site.  I've only ever car camped on multi-family trips, where we all had sites side by side and even if multiple groups split out playing, hiking whatever there was a group behind to watch over things.   In this case with just the two of us, if we want to go for a hike think it's ok to leave the gear out, or should we pack it up into the car ?  Or perhaps pack up only stuff that's easy to take (like the stove, cookware, etc) and leave the tent standing ?     I would call those backpacking tents, where you're really paying for reduced weight and pack size as much as anything else.  If  you're only car camping, and particularly if you're just getting started, you may want to consider a cheaper tent like Eureka.  They'll be roomier, but  bulkier and heavier (as in not recommended necessarily for backpacking) and they'll last forever.   Many of us have 20-30 year old Eurekas that are still holding up fine.     For waterproofness, the big thing to look at is the fly design; make sure it comes down nice and far and has plenty of lashing points - you want to tension it out away from the main tent walls so they don't touch.   Also consider a footprint or a tarp to go under the main tent floor, particularly if  you'll be in state parks where you may end up setting up on gravel.   If you use a tarp, keep it slightly smaller than the tent's floorprint - you don't want the tarp to stick out past the tent collecting water and funnelling it below you.

My idea of a great father's day is pretty cheap... I get to chill while someone else cuts the grass, someone else makes  some killer burgers on the grill while I'm sipping pina colada's in the hammock.   If you're asking for your own Dad, and not for yourself/SO, consider something like that .... consider taking a look at the routine work he has to do and just taking some of that off his hands, followed by like a nice sirloin on the grill and a nice beer or something to that effect.

Actually I had blood sausage on a trip years ago, really enjoyed it. Even after the Irishman across the table told me what it was.    Backpacking *is* travelling with no money, but with an emphasis on hiking long distances in nature as a form of outdoor recreation.  If you're talking about travelling betweens towns, site seeing for little to no money, taking on jobs along the way etc than it sounds like you should google "Vagabond" "hobo" or "tramp" "hostels" "student travel" and terms more like that.    Hmm, actually I'm glad you mentioned "Shelving". All the closets in this house had strips of MDF along the walls as brackets.  Not particularly nice nor adjustable.  A few of them I replaced over the years with stained hardwood in which I routed nice edges ... perhaps if I upgraded the actual shelfing in it that would make it more useful to her.      Sorry, the intent wasn't to move the entertainment center up there to use it as an entertainment center.  She wants to use it as the  new linen cabinet, placing it in the same space as the linen closet.   I realize there's painting, drywalling etc involved.  I've done some pretty large scale work in the house (like completely rebuilding the master bath from the joists up) and I'm not afraid of this tiny job.    I'm really more concerned over whether it's the right move - ripping out a built in feature of the house that seems to work perfectly well only to replace it with an entertainment center.  This could be received as "cool, nice design touch" or as "what the hell, you ripped out your linen closet ? " I'm definitely in the second camp, but don't want to assume anything so was hoping for more opinions on it. thanks !

Can you share what your day job is ?    What does the Hog say ? PHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT   I'm going to guess Mushrooms.    Hello, we live in a very small 60's house with really very limited storage.   The wife would like to rip out [this linen closet at the top of the stairs] (http://i.imgur.com/BJGilwW.jpg)  and replace it with [this entertainment cabinet] (http://i.imgur.com/XH6D8wG.jpg).    The Space:  The door to the left  of the linen cabinet is the smallest bedroom which we use as an office.  To the right is a full bathroom.  I'm standing in the hallway that provides access to the other 3 bedrooms to take this photo.    Do you think this would be a wise decision, or are we best off keeping the linen closet that came with the house ?  Thanks     why do you recommend staying single?  LoL.  You'll figure it out right about ten years into  marriage ;)   What this dude said.  You likely don't have have tax problems ... while you're making great money for a kid it's not huge in the overall scheme of things and not like you need to worry about AMT or shelters, income from other sources and other complex scenarios.     Working at home you may qualify for home office deductions perhaps ... go ask about that in a tax sub.    But the most important thing is to figure out what you should look like financially; debt free, emergency savings, large retirement contributions, savings towards goals, etc.   Make sure you're saving correctly.  Don't be the dude who make great money and puts it all into a BMW.   And stay single.        I attended Self Destruction School too.  Of course, it's a lot easier now than it was back then.

Take an extra coffee with my lunch and create a black market for those vouchers...    I heard there's this awesome linguistics school in Monterey.     As a shop owner you have a responsibility to keep your store free of nuisance people, but I can understand how as a human you'd want a nice way of going about it.   One idea is to look for local resources in your area, so that when you approach the person you're not just turning them away from your store, but pushing them towards something better.   If the shop owner doesn't mind hiim coming around, but just doesn't want him harassing customers, than something else you could also consider is telling the person to only come by at closing.  Something to the effect of "look man, we realize you're having a rough go and we'd like to help, but you can't harass the customers.  We know you need a restroom like anyone else, and you like doughnuts ... if you can keep yourself from hitting up the customers you're welcome to come by at closing time, use the latrine and grab a doughnut.  But I'm sure you understand that people don't want to be panhandled while shopping.  We want to help you out, but we can't do that if we have to close our shop because noone wants to shop here anymore.".   In other words, you can still take the high road while asking him to move along.  Of course, if that doesn't work there are absolutely trespass laws that your police will enforce.  Or just find someone to manup and tell hiim straight "look bro, can't come in anymore, customers been complaining".  May have to do it a couple times a row, but eventually he'll get the message... but someone has to man up to it first.     Awesome ones I made the other night:  Giant package of ground breef, probably 3, 4 pounds 1 half onion, finely chopped some dried parsley a smidgen of dried organo -have to be careful not to use too much a smidgen of garlic power roughly a cup of bread crumbs 2 eggs a whole splattering of A1 sauce.  Been putting A1 in my burgers for years, it's the bestestess.   grill, top with a good cheese (like a sharp cheddar, a bleu, gouda.

The mod's haven't chimed in on this thread yet so perhaps they're leaving it go to see the community's position on it.    I know I'm going to need wood flooring soon, as well as interior doors hung and cased if anyone has recommendations on that.      it's making more sense now.   We're mulching for like the first time ever.  Have a lot of large tree trunks- anywhere from 1 to 2.5 feet in diameter.  We're putting down that black weed barrier; should we put that over the remaining trunks and mulch over them, or cut around ?  Seems like it might be better to know they're there.  And that we could put potted plants on them or something till they rot out.     I'm so confused.   First he's hardcore gangster, then he's goofy family comedy Dad, then he's hardcore gangster.     thanks! I try to drink minimum once a day, but if I run or lift I'll drink as recovery as well.  I've been considering laying back off it a bit, but it really does seem to help with growing muscle while losing fat, and with muscle recovery.  The appetite suppresant aspects of protein are a great help too.  I also have a very, very sporadic schedule and may end up missing meals on a regular basis.... try not to let that happen, but it's a reality I have to deal with.    I found that doing alot of ab and core work helped me tighten the belt.  Situps, planks, leg lifts, air biking and other lower body/core/ab stuff ... improved my posture which made my belly stick out less, and pulled my belly up and in. It's not reducing the fat - you can't "spot reduce" fat, but it just holds everything up in place better.   If I stop the ab and core work, even while increasing running, the belly makes itself known again, even though it's getting smaller.   Now, combine all that with cardio and better nutrition, and you'll be doing really well. my two cents, downvote as you will.   Sounds less about the phone, and more about cleaning up after yourself.    You think it would be okay to use the dextrose/protein blend all the time ? Or should I only use that as recovery, and keep some plain protein (without dextrose) available for taking in the mornings, not  pwo?    I haven't struck out since early spring, but round here "summer" means just take a bag liner. Doesn't get lighter than that.    they aren't just websites.

I do know they rent it out for corporate events though, and I'm beginning to suspect it's the corporate events that keep them going, not the museum visits itself.     I feel you... but using  Hotwire and other websites you may be able to say closer in for that money.   Being on the Metro in Shady Grove is a good backup, but honestly man, that area is the most boring suburbs there  is.  Not like upper East side boring, I mean like LI boring.   Not saying doint do it, just realize that once you get back to your hotel each night you'll have nothing to do.  Probably literally won't even be able to walk to a restaurant, so really I would just do everything downtown, and Metro back north when you're ready to pass out.   Arlington and some of the closer Va suburbs will give you more nightlife, more local dining, and save you a ton of commuting time that you could spend in our great museums instead.  Really, after hoofing around all day you may regret a long commute. Also, don't underestimate the ability of our metro to get packed shoulder to shoulder, break down, etc. It doesn't leak rainwater or smell of urine though;)   Another commenter found a room in the city for a hundred bucks a night; you can't beat that.   How experienced are you with digging out cheap hotel rates ? Are you comfortable using stuff like Priceline, Hotwire, etc ?  You realize that going straight to the hotel to book is often the most expensive way right ?   What time frame are you looking at ?    $100 ? Hell, I may drive down and spend the night just to be able to say I got a room in the city for a hundred bucks.    I honestly can't figure out how the Newseum exists- in that location - other than for corporate events. But they've held up for years ...    All depends on how you like to live OP. I'm sure there are plenty of folks perfectly happy on 40k, and plenty of folks not happy on 150k.  I'll tell you this though - the entire DC region is high earn, high cost.  Kansas this ain't.   Throw some numbers on the table and you'll get more useful responses from folks.     Was really hoping to see some woman in Mom pants and an ugly blouse jump the fence and climb in.    I thought doing a couple light arm sets before going out on a date was universally understood.    I take a lean isolate protein as a nutritional supplement as well as a recovery.  It was suggested I add dextrose to it for carbs when using as a recovery drink.  My question is ... do I want to add the dextrose to the whole tub, and have the carb/protein mix the whole time, or mix it separately on the side and only use the dextrose-added mix for recovery purposes only ?    I use the lean isolate because fat loss is a goal.     Honestly I think Tire Rack and Tires By Web have the best prices on cheap wheels for snowies ... if you call them up and tell them what you have I'm sure they'll be able to tell you exactly what fits.  I got my Nokians and wheels from Tires by Web, got a great deal, and was very happy last winter.    So, I clicked through, and got some giant full  page layover thing and immediately clicked backwards.    Now, on to the regularly scheduled discussion... the EPA has - very seriously - been starting to regulate wood burning stoves.  There are now EPA compliant wood stoves.   I would not be at all surprised to find in a few years that they started regulating Smoking.    yeah, price counts.  I read reviews of some places on like Angies list that go "5 star experience" without talking about the price.  I mean, they could have paid 3 times more for that 5 star experience than say another company.      True. I"m not looking for cheap either, just reasonable. I don't mind paying for good work, but I've paid premium pricing for bad work in the past, trying to avoid that.  I guess the most easily discovered companies are the ones who spend alot of money on call centers and radio ads to make themselves more easily discovered...   Well, for starts, what's wrong with your own country ? If it's safe to travel alone in the wilderness (and I understand in many, many countries it isn't) than I'm willing to be there's all sorts of spectacular sites to be seen right in your own country.  If you really want to "backpack  the world" than I would  find a travel sub, and start inquiring about the process to get Visas.  Yes, Visas take time and money to get, but you'll also be spending money on airfare, supplies, transportation, probably even some lodging, so you'll need plenty of dough anyhow.   I would also seek about blogs by folks who have done multi-country backpacks and learn from them.      yeah, in hindsight and reading here I think the problem was that I really had only protein.  Pyschologically I felt good, caridio and muscularly I felt good but I guess my energy stores just ran out right away.   So I guess carrying this hump of calories with me doesn't help, I need to make sure I'm getting my carbs before running.    Correct.  I have mostly leveraged funds and had one issue. The issue dipped below principal and I sold it.  Keep it on a watch list and it continued diving, so I'm glad I got out when I did. That  was chump change for me, like hundreds of dollars.  My real money is in funds that of course ebb and flow like anything else, but have always remained above my principal balance.  I learned to just make sure I wasn't losing money.  NOT losing opportunity cost, but actual  money.  That was a psychological trick that helped me resist the temptation to jump in and out, and I'm glad I took that approach as my multiyear return on them has been great.    "First Sausage".  OMG, dying.    and you've already tried scouring powder and a green scrubby ?  what color is the tile? Maybe some diluted bleach may help.   Also, have you documented the state with your ncoic so that if the shit is like *permanently* damanged you won't get burnt for it ?    seriously ? Where is it ? Like 4 blocks north of K-Mart ?    For some reason he reminds me of Denzel Washington.  I bet that after the lawsuit, when the book is turned into the movie, he plays this guy.    From the third week of basic training on, I have never met anyone in the Army who wasn't a fucking expert on cleaning tile floors.     "I tell ya, when I was just a young Micrathene my mother moved us all into a research nest just so she could get some pretty leg bands.  No respect I tell ya, I get no respect. "   Your lucky man. Round here you can even rent a lane and a pistol and they'll only sell you one box of 22s.   I prefer good sites over glass on a pistol too, but for hunting purposes, figured some glass would help. Though I've never used a pistol for hunting animals.    Or, in my case, master the side box, then spend a couple-four hundred on a lazy-q cause we're all easting so much I need it to smoke while I"m at work, then one of the family members turns vegetarian.    dude you do realize noone's going to lift a finger to mail you a buck fifyt's worth of anything right ?    "I'm a private pilot and am looking for places like Lake Whitney in Texas which offers nice camping and has a decent paved runway. Been to some nice places in Oklahoma and Arkansas as such. Does Texas offer anything other than Lake Whitney?"  There, FTFY.  I think.    hey man, not to jack your thread but I"ve been thinking about returning a new camelbak for the osprey. I have an osprey pack and the water pouch sleeve is internal and squeezing the camelback into it with a fullpack is a serious pain ... does that long handle on the osprey make it any easier ?    Ah, I get it. OP does NOT live in US (which is so damn large, you could spend a lifetime exploring just one country), Canada (ditto, plus bears, syrup and Leafs), or Europe (tons of small countries but with free passage).   So OP lives in a small  country with no free passage to surrounding countries, and apparently doesn't want to explore their own country.  I'm gonna go ahead and guess Middle East.   How'd I do OP?    One year now. Only ever returned one item, it was very cheerfully refunded.   So still a premier customer service experience, just not over the top anymore.  Over stores have the same (or better? ) policy ... if you're going to mail order from the states you have a huge choice; check out places like Backcountry, Backcountry Edge, EMS (who has a lot of solid store branded products as well), gosh, I couldn't list all the great retail/online options here... but Google can.  And you know, LL Bean has some really good stuff too.   those ole Eurekas *still* have design details on them that new manufacturers lack, lack sealable meshing for winter use.   But yes, H.E.A.V.Y.  IIRC, mine was like 7 pounds before fly and footprint.  My new one cost a fortune, is a fraction of the size, but it weighs like 3 pounds.    yeah man, give it another day or two before you decide it just isn't for you.  Then, once you've made  up your mind, just tell her you gave it a good go, but it's not for you.    I like wheel guns too. Just wanted to say that.    Had a 10/22. Great plinker for the money.  Throw a decent scope on it, keep it zero'd, buy extra magazines and you're money ... if you can find 22 ammo anymore.    I still have my twenty year old Eureka - different model though ...same colors.  It's a great tent and I'll never part with it.  Spent many evenings in it with my Lab.  Recently bought all new gear, including new fangled backpacking tents.  Can't believe I used to carry that Eureka in a backpack.  No wonder I couldn't log any miles.   Hey dude, stop sharing our local spots with out of towners !      I wouldn't call it an alternative to 495.  The path is takes is really odd - going so.far.north on the west side, yet so.far.south on the east side.   I haven't found it particularly useful yet as a Md commutter who very regularly has to schlep to Va.    LoL, everything about this warns me not to hire them as a contractor.    No no no, not crayfish.  Rock Shrimp are *awesome* shrimp ... sweeter than most, more like a lobster taste.  Everytime I go to the Orlando/Coco region I head up to Titusville for fill up on Rock Shrimp at Dixies Crossroads.  Great stuff.   Honestly only been there like 3 times, and the last time was probably 10 years ago but that's how awesome it is; I still remember it clearly.  But, sorry OP, never  heard of them outside of Fla.  Would definitely like to find some up here though.    There needs to be a National Free Sirloin Day.   Who wants to sponsor the bill ?    Oh wow, I cant even remember the last time I had those ...the red ones.  Now I'm craving them.     This may have been why I felt so tired about halfway through the run.  Muscularly my legs felt good, cardio felt good .... my breathing rate actually seemed lower than usual, but I just had no energy at all.  I guess I ran out of carbohydrates.     is that like the bovine equivalent of back ribs ?    Curious. I had a complete shite run today, and I'm wondering how much of it was not eating versus other variables (such as...oh,not training in weeks lets just say hypothetically) . I *am* a Calorie Camel though.  I store spare calories in a hump around my middle ...    yeah, brisket's always gone instantly.  ribs are always left over I'm noticing.  I guess the rest of the family is growing weary of them too.  I need to go get me a brisket again.  I have a lazyq now, I'd like to see how it comes out in that.   	113
 He seriously has been around a long time. It's a neat compilation. Clay guy to say the least.    Very limited options there.

Great visualization.     It's going to be a good fight.     I live in Bel Air, the group is leaving from Annapolis. The original plan was to pick me up on the way but they mentioned some tolls on the way to Hull, MA. They're thinking in order to circumvent tolls they would go the way of the Bay Bridge. This would totally bypass my location and therefore would need to drive an hour and a half to meet them in Annapolis. If I new how much the tolls were I could pay those.     Yeah now that you mention it, yes they all are similar.  Why don't producers and directors notice this, or they just ignore it in the hopes of making money.    Are there any parts where attire is blue jeans and Polo?    Ok   I'm trying to have options, how much tolls would cost if we went through them vs not.    There's nothing there.

So in the meantime while police are being called, in this article 2 hours what is being done to ensure safety if no one is legally allowed to restrain the individual, are they just running amok?    Previously unseen rifle presented at Ukrainian arms inspection   But with special needs kids there are no luxuries, that's why there are action plans agreed upon by the staff, and parents. I know the article states the child was injuring himself, but you can't tell me the police needed to be called to provide a bearhug, come on. There are adults that can provide a bearhug until the agreed upon action plan is floored through as agreed (ie) called the parents baring any significant safety issues.

Yes that is correct depending on the state. The only two states I know allow BCBA's to provide services in the classroom are Florida and Pennsylvania. I would not suggest an aide as they serve more as an assistant rather than a board certified behavioral analysts. Look into what BCBA's do and see if that is right for you and your son, I'm sure it will be. Additionally, if you don't feel the classroom has BCBA or principals there are centers you can go to where they provide BCBA play based services with other children. Your sons transition into adulthood starts now and the curriculum they go through know will set them on their way.  Feel free with any questions.   Geneva conventions.

 A stand-alone remastered zombie collection would be mucho appreciated...   Even as a kid, I felt Jedi kinda sucked... compared to the original 2.   Lucas came back in the fold a bit with Jedi. It was originally 'Revenge of the Jedi'.  But then he got to thinking about his (new) children. He became soft. He didn't understand the difference between a movie being 'kid friendly'   'for kids'.   He changed the name to 'Return'   the tone. He replaced a planet of wookies   replaced them with ewoks (easier to sell toys). He changed Luke's approach at Jabba's palace. He didn't realize his movies weren't kid movies, just movies kids enjoy. He did what he's prone to do   made it weak.   Take the Greedo scene in IV. Greedo is a bad guy who's gonna kill Han if Han doesn't come with him. He's got a gun drawn on him (he's gonna shoot first, but Han beat him to it). Yet, Lucas became a Dad   suddenly thinks kids can't understand the situation. Even as a kid, I thought VI was crap (compared to originals)   wasn't surprised with the prequels...   If you make something aimed directly at kids, it's gonna suck for adults.  The secret is make it something you can take a child to watch but made for everyone. Don't spoon-feed the kids, don't dumb it down, don't think they can't understand/appreciate it.   (BTW: when will they include the Han/Leia wedding footage? When they test screened 'Revenge of the Jedi' there was a wedding at the end... )   while you're preaching, might as well post in a better place...  http://www.reddit.com/r/AustinPetLostAndFound   was one of THE most impressive demonstrations I've ever watched,   yet barely got any coverage...

Today, a driver opened up   said "I'd like to tip you but I can't... I finally found out why they don't tip:  * Postmates instructs them not to tip...ever.   This company who makes money from the food service industry in multiple cities explicitly instructs their drivers to never tip using company credit cards...  (BTW: If you are a driver, you can tip cash... I know it's togo, but at least a dollar. Most everyone in this industry tips, even on togo)      that   when they just gun their nose in the gap forcing you to prevent a wreck...   if you're gonna do this, at least put your blinker on   wait for an opening / permission    he have the 4 CD box set of rarities they just put out?    just let me know when the game is at least 90% fixed...   haven't played one game. don't want to hate my favorite game.   They will grow up to overtake Putin   rule with an iron fist for sure...   OK, sounds like something from the National Enquirer, right next to the wolfman elvis...  I've been following these Romanian kids (the Stroes) for a couple years. Their father (a fitness freak) has been making these kids work out at least 2 hours a day since they were barely able to walk... I've even got a google news alert about them. I find it interesting (one of them holds the world record for vertical pushups   some other record). Of the numerous articles I've read / watched, this is the first mention of a 'mutation' I've ever read... I tried to cross reference that condition with results of the kids   came up with nothing.  I know that condition exists, but I'm sure their bodies are the result of hard work   not being mutants.     Bukowski is great... the difference is he constantly reminds you he's a piece of shit. completely upfront about it.

It's a prohibition that has only created a huge demand for crime. US money has been funneled out of the country   into the hands of gangsters   crime lords. It's a huge violent fight to control this source of insane income. Mexico has crime syndicates that have to house US money is different houses it's so rampant   abundant. This prohibition has funded this criminal takeover of Mexico... the US has created it.     I had forgotten about the deluxe disc to Whole Love, thanks.    my favorite albums to date are the ones that 'grew' on me. the ones I grew to love are still my most favorite, way more than albums I instantly loved.

 I might be underestimating the price a bit, but yeah buy a small or used set for starters.  Cheaper than Lego, that's for sure.   Repost   Probably $180 for 4 sets.  Rocket Boost Roller Coaster is the best bang for your buck in terms of track pieces        Warner Brothers is possibly doing an FNAF movie      That was great   The ride has an automatic shutdown if measured wind speeds are too high   That was beautiful.   I made a video in Santa Monica once and everybody online says "Oh my gosh!  The beach from GTA V!"  Haha, I wonder how many real-world things people are introduced to in video games.      What if we could go all the way from 1% screenshot to 100% screenshot?   https://xkcd.com/1373/      Yes I think he says that in the description.  He points out that the main difference is that his model's lift wheel is hollow, allowing the track to pass through it      Sick reference bro   Isn't every color section 50 feet high?  That's what my dad told me.    Isn't the same true of amusement park attractions?  Most accidents are user error, operation error, or mantainence error.  Very few times is it the fault of the machine.   Right, that's what I meant.  Sorry used a double negative in that last sentence   Beautiful   I love ending movie scenes where the camera dollies out.  Great way to close   A helicopter is probably less safe because of wind and how close the helicopter would have to get to the tower.  Plus it's more expensive      With a drone.  The guy's YouTube channel is sweet https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVh4MBwjxHFc2Wvz_n3fQww      My friend works the drop tower ride at Knott's and has to keep an eye out for falling cell phones during the entire ride operation.  Says it hurts his neck after a while!   They used a drone for this video but I wonder what a helicopter would have looked like.  Probably couldn't have safely got as close to the tower as the drone   Geez that's crazy how most of the incidents are on towers less than 300 feet high.  Maybe because there are more towers in the US around that height but still it doesn't seem like higher height doesn't mean more injuries.   You can tell if a shot is a zoom in/out if the background and foreground change at the same rate.  If background is staying the same but the foreground is changing, it is x-axis camera movement.  Only exception is when you combine movement and a zoom, when it is possible to make the foreground stay the same while the background changes.   It's a clear signal that he loves his job      Definitely not      Nice.  Bummer about Amazon      Thanks!  But when you say that cinema evolves... I know that different aspects of the presentation change, but overall I would say that the standards for a great movie have changed very little over the past 100 years.   I get that all the CDs below Discovery are the singles but why are there two Human After All CDs?   I made a response below to user "andupitt" about the psychiatrist scene, can you check it out?  Sorry it's pretty long   Thank you sir.  It hasn't ever been posted to Reddit that I know of, so no, it's not a repost.  Though I did make the original Imgur post in January.  Have a good day   I think that the final psychiatrist scene in Psycho is crucial, because it offers the audience the false hope of fully explaining the plot.  It gives the audience a chance to laugh at themselves and relax, convinced that the whole ordeal was simply an illusion... only to find themselves face to face with the gruesome reality after the psychologist is done.  Using Hitchcock's roller coaster metaphor, the entire movie is a ridiculous roller coaster that leaves the entire audience out of breath.  If you cut out the psychiatrist scene, you cut out the brake run and dump the audience off in the station before they've even got their wits back.  It would be like hitting a brick wall while going sixty miles an hour.  So the psychiatrist scene slowly brings the audience's energy from sixty miles an hour down to a slow crawling speed for a minute, and then gives them one last jerk as the train comes to a stop and we see Norman's face superimposed with the skull/car.  The same rules apply for movies and roller coasters: you want to push the boundaries as far as they can go, but you want to keep people reasonably comfortable in the process.  Unlike roller coasters, movies won't kill audiences if they are designed poorly, but it's important to remember that you never want to leave a bad taste in people's mouths.  While modern directors like to end a movie right when the audience is still on the edge of their seats (Nolan's Inception is a good example), I kind of admire the classic directors who were able to use their filmmaking power to efficiently guide an audience in and out of an intense movie.  Also, Hitchcock considered the psychiatrist scene one of his "icebox scenes".  His theory was that when moviegoers come home, they are inevitably going to grab some snacks from the fridge and talk about the movie for a bit.  This scene gives moviegoers something to talk about, or at least a springboard for understanding the rest of the movie.  It's the old "audiences are stupid" scene that Hitchcock was fond of; it explains the plot of the movie so that viewers can't complain afterwards about the its logic but can just talk about their favorite parts of the story.  If you think this scene really is bad let me know, but for me it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie because of the delicious irony of "modern" psychology attempting to explain what almost seems to border on the supernatural.  My non-film roommate enjoyed the movie and said afterwards, "Isn't it nice that they explain everything for you?"  I had to laugh because the scene hardly explains anything.  Other similar dissonant ending scenes would be the "isn't nature beautiful" helicopter ride at the end of Jurassic Park or the nonchalant "we've got top men working on it" government scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  These scenes tie up the pretty little bow of the story all too neatly, making the audience want to watch it again and get to the heart of what the movie was really about.   I just watched Clue last night and I was surprised that pretty much the whole movie is the characters verbally explaining the plot.  Almost scene was them talking about either the backstory of the movie, what had just happened in the movie or what was going to happen in the movie.         So behind your back is actually in front of your face      That's true. The first game is still the creepiest for me just because it's harder to keep track of four animatronics than just one.  Also the first game is the only one with doors, which gives you that false sense of security, while the other two games keep you on edge almost constantly and thus have less suspense   I like his videos cos they are better tan every sin else on the internet  	48
  But there isn't a single professional I can think of that just responds with a joke without bothering to discuss a single aspect of the question.  Good thing this isn't an office or a professional environment and these posters aren't even close to clients.      Thank god you were here to carry the load. This is serious business!!   can they be charged with anything   It's certainly possible if their admit to a crime within the statute of limitations.  In practice the police pursuing this is unlikely.       I think that should tell their lawyers what little involvement I had in it.  They still have a right, and frankly a duty to their client, to depose you under oath so they know for certain.   You must attend the deposition and give truthful testimony.  If you don't remember much, it's unlikely they will need you to testify at trial.  However, based on your recounting the story here, it appears you have a pretty good memory of what happened.  If either side decides they need your testimony you will be required to attend.   I am not going to pay the remainder of the invoice as he did not diagnose and repair the unit as agreed.

It's unlikely that a minor will be permitted to represent themselves in court.     It is his child.  No it isn't. It is his pet.

Ambulance chasers is a insulting term thrown around to smear every single plaintiff's attorney whether they have a good case or not.  Please don't use it.  You have no responsibility to give your homeowners insurance info, but if you are sued, you will have no choice.  It's a good idea to inform them now of what happened so they are on notice.

How does one obtain a lawyer during questioning? (since, at least in my town, they do not operate off retainers)  You may not be able to.  All questioning will cease.  You will then either be released, or placed under arrest.   If you are arrested and able to make bail, you'll be free to find your own attorney, or apply for the PD.  If you cannot make bail you'll need to find a way to get in touch with an attorney or apply for the PD.

Any BAC can get you a DUI.  Blowing a .07 does NOT get you off scott free.  It simply means that the State has to prove your impairment instead of your impairment being presumed.    driving with a non-zero BAC below the legal limit is not legally considered to be impaired driving  Yes, it is.  You can absolutely get a DUI for BAC under the legal limit.  If your BAC is over .08, you are presumed to be impaired.  That doesn't mean if you're impaired and driving at .07 that you get off scot free.  There's simply more that the State has to do to prove your impairment.

 I never use voicemail. Got it disabled.    Or more.    Taxes not useful?    It's not wasting. It gives me pleasure.    Rome fell.    In like fine dining too,  so why not.    Wine is expensive everywhere.    This shit ain't papa joes son.    Menus change yearly,  and I often eat out as such restaurant.   Generally you can expect the following: Foie gras,  sweetbreads, various preparations of fish and meat. A fee veggie dishes. All made in a way you have never had them before.   I prefer European style cooking by the way. I have eaten at Jiro about 5 years back. Lunch was 400 ish euro and completely amazing,  but I won't do it again.    Good luck. Pm me when you are done,  I'll come spend some money.   Make sure to bring a couple of million in funding up front to get things going.    About 8 years now, as I said,  I have been lucky to be in the right place at the right to.   I currently live in inner city Frankfurt and have lived in Tokyo,  NYC,  Zurich,  and Amsterdam. Prague is pretty steep to be honest. Then again I am often in the poorer parts of CZ and compared to that everything is expensive.    Ah,  I understand.   Usually bottles start around 75-100. If you want to make friends with the sommelier ask him to suggest a page 1 wine. They love it, they hardly get that question and enjoy also suggesting something on the lower side of the spectrum.    I'm working at a very large international supplier (top 20) of OEM automotive components in a senior management function. Also I have been fortunate my lucky in life. I'm not a millionaire or anything close,  but spending 1K on a really nice dinner once every other month or 500 once a month is absolutely not a problem. It's a hobby as well which I like to spend money on.    A lesson well learned. I met my wife years ago,  she's frugal as shit, it's great. More money in the bank.    I've seen people ordering over 100k in wine in one evening. It's really crazy. I was telling my wife the prices and types of wine they were ordering and they overheard me. I got offered a glass of 1991 Domaine Leroy Musigny Grand Cru, Cote de Nuit)(I will never forget). A bottle retails for 4500$ at distributors. They paid over 15 grand for it. The glass of wine cost over 2000$.   They didn't care., they just wanted to have fun and share something special.    About 200 person for the preset menu (usually the thing to pick at a restaurant of this kinds). It was on the high side,  but not over the top. Places like Michel Bras and Paul Bocuse are much higher.    Remember that a 40$ bottle of wine sold at a wine importer will sell for 150-200$ in a restaurant. The factor is anywhere between 2 and 6 times the purchase value.   These restaurants don't make much money on the food. If you have 40 seat,  but also employ 20+ kitchen staff,  plus front house staff,  including a matre and a sommelier that will make absolute bank if they are half decent,  you need to win it back on the wine.    Or I just like to spend money and can easily afford it?    The thing is. For some people 5 grand is the same as 5 euro is for you and me. At a certain point money is taken out of the equation. Good for the economy as well.  That 5K bottle of wine is taxed as well.    The courses are really small. Like 2-3 bites each. There is no huge steak. There is probably a course that is 2 Oz. Of perfectly prepared veal tenderloin or whatnot.    This is for 1 and 2 Michelin star restaurants.   I was in Prague last month and went to the only 1 star restaurant there. I think the total bill for 2 people,  14 course with wine came to 480 euro. Not too terrible for an expensive city like Prague.    Usually the menu is very affordable. Between 75 and 150 per person. Add a page 1 wine for 50-100 and enjoy.    Please be aware different people have different incomes and spending habits.    It's hit and miss. I like fine dining. The food is amazing. The wine is overpriced. I usually take the wine menu for around 75-100 which pairs a wine with every course.    300 was a page 1 wine. They had bottles over 5 grand on the menu.    Went on a date with a chick that was clearly a gold digger. I never suggested I'd pay the bill and told her to find a restaurant she'd like. Cue the evening and we're in a 2 Michelin star place. I'm looking at a 400 food bill without wine and she orders a 300 euro bottle of wine for herself.   Now I would have paid, but she was a total cunt. It became very clear that she was pulling this shit often to get free fancy meals.   Ate my food,  didn't drink the wine (driving). Got up. Paid for my food and the bottle of water I had and told the waiter we were going Dutch. He laughed,  gave me my receipt,  I tipped him 25% and left.   No clue what ever happened afterwards as I didn't pick up the 67 missed calls and blocker her on Facebook.    At this point I am entirely convinced a full contingency plan is available and that a Grexit will be well contained. Greece will be completely fucked though and a humanitarian disaster.   That chicken blender is pretty much the most humane way to disposing of male chicks.    This comes to about 295 euro incl shipping to many mainland countries.

Modern nuclear technology is save,  zero co2 and in between breeder,  burner and various other types of reactors there is almost no waste.   The fear is just irrational fear mongering by people stuck in the 80s.   About 10 years ago I worked in a phone store. It was even worse then. I personally had to send away a girl that signed up for 4 contracts because she thought she was getting them for free.  Her credit check failed on the spot.

Don't forget inflation. If the price stayed the same for 10 years on the same quantity it's significantly cheaper. (at 3% annual inflation about 34%)   In Europe we have Mediamarkt and Saturn. All partnumbers on expensive electronics are custom to them. It's a sham.   My pension fund has an annual performance of..... 17%.   Each year I get a letter that my pension is lowered due to unforseen circumstances.   We had a small, optional course during my MBA (HEC) on pension funds. For some pension funds the average cost (including profit to the pension fund provider)  of the entire pension is roughly 100K per member. It's pretty crazy.    In my previous employer we had security cameras. Just the shell and a red led. Theft dropped significantly.    Explain to me your train of logic that allows Verizon to sell you a 599 phone for either 0 or 199 from the goodness of their heart. After all it's free. They must be the most altruistic organisation on the planet. Modern day saints even just handing out money as a private organisation.   Grow up.    They you got scammed by Verizon.    Actually no. You're falling victim to clever marketing. The phone costs 599 with a 199 down payment and 400 spread over 24 months.   It's still a good deal with a 199 discount over the Google play price. However that 400$ you're still paying wrapped into your monthly fee. Why do you think sim only contracts are cheaper ;)    It came to ~400$ spread over 24 months and no up front cost. Don't use poor people logic to think it's free.   Thinking it's free makes you a victim to clever marketing. Same thing has been made illegal in my country recently. You're basically taking out a 2 year loan on the phone.    Nope. The payment is still wrapped in your contract fee. You didn't change your contract price because you were already paying for your old phone.   Wrong. The phone doesn't cost 199. It costs 599.

Not a spammer - I post a wide mix of sites! This user has had it in for me since I started reporting their (and their other account's) spammy submissions to futurology.

Looks like the garbled text accompanying this is just some nonsensical waffle to justify posting it as an article.    I want to get a pair of these so much!   If they become a commercial product, you just know they'll become a common sight at cosplay events.    Correct - pretty handy for camping in cold weather   That's an interesting point - I wonder if this will have an impact on the concept of original art being of higher value - I guess the same goes for digital art.        I agree, I don't really get why people keep upvoting them   The text in this reads a lot like it was translated from another language.   Does anyone have another link to this concept? It would be interesting to read a bit more about it.                      This sounds like something a crazy cartoon villain would do. If it weren't so awful and terrifying it would be utterly hilarious            That sounds like a potentially brilliant idea for food aid, thanks for sharing it :)      No, this is a different article - note the way the text is different.   You and your many accounts need to stop downvoting and negatively commenting on things I post - your attempt at revenge is weird and petty.            That is really disappointing!   This is a repost of a [Daily Mail article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2839558/Could-POO-soon-power-smartphones-Bacteria-faeces-improve-bio-batteries.html) - bit of a trend at the moment      Erm, isn't the link you've posted just a preview to their magazine?    Do you include redditors that post articles that have sensationalised headlines? Or just ones that sensationalise them themselves?   As with the article yesterday, this is a repost of a [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2840627/A-house-seasons-Shape-shifting-home-transforms-year-response-changing-temperatures.html) article            I thought they looked familiar when I posted this and I couldn't think why!

How was it?   Does Alexander Gerst ever stop smiling? He must be the world's cheeriest astronaut!   No I wouldn't - responding to an article you haven't read, particularly with such vitriol, just seems foolish.   The answer you linked to didn't answer my question.    Have you read it or not? It doesn't seem  like you have.    That sounds like a hilarious article - I wish that was what it was about!   Only very briefly at the start of the intro and the first section, and the fact that you have focused so heavily on this makes it seem a lot like you haven't read the vast majority of this article.   Yeah, this is one of those technologies where it feels as if people are only exploring it because its part of a romantic view of the future, not because it's actually a useful, problem solving technology   Everything you've said about the article suggests you think it takes a different angle and chain of discussion to the one it does, which leads me to assume you haven't actually read it.    Have you read the article?               Who buys print media anymore?                        I want to live in a future where those exist!                     I like the idea of us actually taking action on something - im sure between us we do have the skills to achieve some v cool things   There's a huge number of other reasons for GM crops other than to be resistant to pesticides etc. These include making the stems shorter to reduce growing cycles and adding key vitamins to aid nutrition.

 I wish I could remember what it cost to build the stadium in New Britain. Hopefully, it's been paid off.   This will likely revive the debate in NB whether bringing the Rock Cats was a good idea in the first place. The stadium, near the Berlin border, offered no help to NB's downtown, the focus of its economic development.  I recall the idea of building a stadium downtown coming up, but not the reasons for its rejection. The right downtown parcel probably wasn't available.   Hartford wants the stadium in walk-able distance to its downtown stores and shops, so they must be expecting some indirect economic benefit. Wonder if they're right.    I just find this entire thing disgusting. It's one city against another, and the only true winner are the Rock Cats.   So now New Britain is stuck with a useless stadium facility and Hartford residents may be taking on some debt they can't afford.   I'm sure there will be talk about turning NB stadium over to NBHS or CCSU to use, but those teams won't drive attendance so it's going to be a big waste of space.   I also don't get why NB officials -- apparently -- didn't see this coming. One explanation is that the Rock Cats were out to leave NB and weren't interested in any local drama. It may be that their business model is to bolt for a better deal when any lease is up. But still, the Rock Cats had an obligation to disclose their plan and see if there wasn't something NB could do to fix whatever it was they wanted addressed. Maybe they did earlier. Maybe there was some bad blood. I don't know, but the newly elected mayor seemed clueless. I'm not blaming her; this thing had to be simmering before she took office. I won't blame NB for feeling a little used by the Rock Cats, and Hartford officials would be wise to soak in some of that feeling.    I do think the NB location was family-friendly, however. Easy to get to. Safe. Where will people park to see the Rock Cats in downtown Hartford? Will they have to walk to garages? Will it lead to an overall more expensive outing?   Two pieces of advice to Hartford: Make sure the Rock Cats can't leave until the bonds are paid off. And remember the Whalers. Once their brand-new Hartford lease up, the Rock Cats will probably head out of state to the embracing arms of a new group of dumb bunny politicians.     Freelancing is ideal, but another path is to try blogging. Hopefully, you can carve out a few hours a week to do this. I don't know how successful people have been to use their self-published work as a means to a news (not opinion/blogging) job. But I believe it's possible, and it's certainly one way of getting on the radar of local news organizations, especially if you scoop them on something interesting. If you do, send a respectful note to a local editor with the link/clip and ask them if you could write this up for them.   This is what I have in mind:  There's a fellow in DC who covers local meetings in his neighborhood and writes up reports: http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/  His coverage is straight news, and little different from a local news reporter's work. His effort is getting local recognition because fact-based stories free of rant and opinion are still appreciated. He could, I suspect, turn this blog into a source of part-time income via advertising.   As far as age goes, you are a youngster. I'm in late 50s. I didn't get my first full-time job until about 25/26. I freelanced initially, but I would have been blogging as well ... had there been an Internet ....    If you go the blog route, keep polishing and fixing your stories even if they are week old. You want your published work to be as sharp and clean as possible. Get an up-to-date an AP style guide, and practice writing with economy and precision. (I love this work: How to Write Short, Roy Peter Clark). Even Hunter Thompson started straight.           I have some serious problems with this opinion piece.    It's author writes, "see how few women hold the programmer-journalist roles that have become so prized" and "When I do find women in these spots, theyre often doing front-end work, designing the interactives rather than doing the programming thats so highly prized."  Tech reporter here. First, only about 26% of the people in computer occupations are women, and women only constitute about 15% of a typical computer science graduating class.  Now, I'll guess that a large number of  "programmer-journalist" do not have CS degrees, but they probably have some technical training and their courses were mostly male.   This point rang absolutely true: that women are "doing front-end work, designing the interactives" -- yes. You are more likely to find women doing Web design and user interface work because it combines art, in this case graphic arts, design and some code work.  The problem is more general and involves increasing the percentage of women who seek some technical training. At its root, this is a national problem and is not specific to journalism. That's an essential perspective and it's missing from the piece.    Technically, you're right. It's in Agawam. But under a special act approved by the Connecticut Legislature the property was annexed by Connecticut.   Connecticut residents loved that place, and so lawmakers felt they had to do something to take it away from our northern neighbors. It was justified as payback for the bad driving they inflict on our state.    Alas, the special act was approved Aug. 17, 1969 at 2 a.m. There weren't any news reporters there to witness it, because, coincidentally, it was approved during Woodstock. To keep Massachusetts from finding out that we had just annexed part of their state, an employee from the Secretary of State's office took the freshly printed law and coded it and put the document in one place and the cipher for decoding it in another. Lawmakers pledged themselves to secrecy. It was a different era back then.     In 1998, when Six Flags was considering acquiring Riverside, a secret council of lawmakers who knew about the then 30-year-old Riverside Park Annexation Law gathered in panic. They felt it was time to make the law public and asset the state's right over the property and thwart the sale to Six Flags.   But, alas, there was only one clue to the location of the cipher. The secretary of state employee who hid the cipher, in keeping with the great tradition of the Charter Oak, sealed the cipher with bee's wax in a great oak tree in Farmington. This employee then retired and left for Florida and was never heard from again. Unfortunately, the tree was removed in 1973. It was located on the site of Westfarms Mall, which opened in 1974.   This is a true story.    I like the Clairefontaine wirebound book. It's a French based company, and the paper is excellent quality and designed for fountain pens, but any semi-liquid pen looks great. It's hard to find. In the DC area, the pen store across the press club has them; otherwise, online.   I wish someone made a reporter's style notebook with good quality paper.   On a purely technical level, I would suggest this: Sony recorders, which I use, have something called a T mark. It is essentially a bookmark. Press the T Mark button when you hear something you may want to quote.    You can manually jump ahead to T marks for playback. From the stop position, hit the fast forward on the voice recorder and it will jump from T Mark to T Mark.   It's easier if you hook the recorder up to a PC.  The Sony voice editing software will show where the T mark is; just click on the spot. (There's no Mac version of the Sony editing software, and I really don't know if a Mac will recognize the Sony recorder as a separate drive.)  To keep track of T Mark numbers, the easiest way for me is to just keep track of how many times I pressed it. From experience, I've found it best to use the T Marks sparingly. If it's a quote I'm sure I will want to double check, I hit it.   Using a T Mark is super fast way to zero in an quote without having to look away from a speaker in a face-to-face interview. (Or shift gaze from notepad to recorder, which I find is distracting to the person you are interviewing.)   Almost all the Sony recorders, especially the ones with the USB port, have the T Mark function. Starting price is around $50 an up.   Another thing I really like about Sony is the ability to customize the keyboard commands for voice editing. I can speed through a recording very quickly.   In buying a voice recorder, you may want to look at where the T-Mark is located and consider the button layout. I don't want to accidentally press the wrong button. I have two Sony units currently: The ICD-UX533 has the T Mark button adjacent to the folder and menu buttons, and while it's a good recorder, I'm not super-pleased with this layout. I also own a ICD-SX712. The T Mark button is the lower right, separate from everything else, and easy to find by touch.     I worked at a time when many newspapers augment FT reporters with small armies of stringers. It was a foundation for good local coverage. The stringers were axed as time went on, and I agree that local bloggers, with exceptions, didn't replace them.   On the issue of bad hiring I wonder if newsrooms aren't suffering from the same thing that afflicts a lot of industries. Many candidates do not make it pass computer screenings of resumes because they are missing certain certifications or skill sets. I'm not suggesting that editors use algorithms to screen out candidates, but I will argue that newsroom hiring may be too focused on credentials and has lost the ability to recognize raw talent. They may be on unwilling to take a risk on someone. I do not know.       Your analysis is correct and isn't yet. Yes, "too few people start blogs to cover local meetings and such." But relative to what? There are plenty of local bloggers who do the work, but in the vast blog-o-sphere, they will be always be the minority. You can't use the volume of poor bloggers to hang the rest. That's one of the problems local bloggers face; they are dismissed, under-appreciated and unnoticed, because of the sins of the many.   I wasn't suggesting j-school was a "soviet re-education camp" -- I actually think j-school has some value today, especially since journalists will have have to know far more than than the basics. Technology and databases are too big a part of it. But I do believe that the j-school dominated newsroom management is self-reinforcing about hiring. They look for people with j-school and may be blind to great potential. Journalism doesn't require a j-school degree. In an event, the degree is low down on the list once you get past entry level. At that point, you either have the work to show or you don't.     So excuse me if I don't think your average citizen journalist has the skills and judgement of someone with a master's degree in journalism. There is a reason that citizen journalism is, as you said, "an excuse for uninformed opinion pieces." It's because citizen journalists are untrained, unskilled hacks.  Where is all this anger coming from? Our business is laying off people, not hiring. Starting a blog, covering local meetings, is the new entry level "job" for a lot people. Their material may not be up your standards, and they operate with benefit of skilled editors who have seen every mistake imaginable, but bless them for trying.    We should be encouraging citizen journalism, especially for people who want to break into the business. I really don't know any other way to do so today. Sure, you could blow a ton of money on a grad degree, but it's still about clips.  And is it smart to only hire people with a J-degree, a master's at that. How terribly sad. Editors use to value drive, curiosity, and evidence of intelligence in whatever form it took. I remember discussions in my first newsroom, 30 years ago, about whether the then increasing interest in j-school would radically change hiring practices and we wondered.   My first newsroom, with about a dozen reporters, had two Ivy league grads with various liberal arts degrees, one with a law degree, and the balance from universities and state colleges that didn't appear on college rankings. No one had a j-degree.  One of the editors didn't even have a college degree. They were all hired because they had some good clips, could think on their feet, tell a joke, weren't easily intimidated, write a clear sentence and were relentless in pursuit of a story. I felt honored to be in their company and my hiring an anomaly.   I get that there are fewer editors in newsrooms today, and can see the logic of hiring interns with their rookie errors squeezed out of them. But that still doesn't prepare them for what they may really need.   Back in the day, we all knew the J-school people would take over in the end, because it's self-perpetuating. Specialization always wins out. Once someone with a masters in journalism becomes ME or EE, that sets the tone. I don't think that's a great outcome for a business that requires a lot of intellectual diversity. J-school can help turn out competent reporters, I suppose, but a great reporter is a force of nature.        I think it depends what type of blog you're talking about. I agree that there are a lot of national blogs that siphon ad dollars and do little for journalism. And let's not forget the impact Craigslist had on classifieds, or Zillow/Trulia etc. on real estate advertising etc.   But local blogs, with one or a few people writing for nothing or pocket change, are getting ads from local businesses and returning real content to the community.  They aren't parasitic. If anything, the daily journos gain story ideas from their work.    Blogger and Word Press are great, and Typepad has been around for a  long time.  If you sign up for any of the newer operations listed here, find out what your options are for moving all your content to Word Press. Have a back-up/bail out plan. If any of these platforms are running on VC money, they may still be shy of making a profit. Also, think long term. Do you want advertising and how friendly are some of these other platforms to ads?    You're talking about citizen journalism? Not about paid journalists who also blog?   Anyone who is hostile toward citizen journalists is, IMHO, a complete shithead and who, despite this horrid condition, doesn't know crap.   Here are some great examples of citizen journalism by people who do this in DC.   http://shortarticlesaboutlongmeetings.blogspot.com/  http://capitolhillcorner.org/  http://homicidewatch.org/  The coverage speaks for itself.    It's a news judgment issue. The collapse of the  West Antarctic sheets means that sea levels will rise to catastrophic levels. It's now officially unavoidable. So, yes, as a longtime reporter, I'm very interested in discovering whether news organizations can really assess the implications of this finding, and, if so how do you treat it?   Future generations will assess how this generation reported this issue; they'll see how much importance was assigned to the story, and they ask whether the journalists of this period really understood the findings.  As the saying goes, journalism is the first draft of history. Will we get it right?   (Regarding the Bloomberg link, I used only because it seemed competent and isn't behind a paywall. There are a lot of good explanatory reports out there.)                 Yelp has a listing http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=newsstand find_loc=Washington,+DC     Skews very young, which is evident from a lot of the postings.  Thanks for doing the survey. Interesting results.    Well, I will disagree. I am an older journo and stories that tend to read are fact based. Unemployment is higher for this generation; college debt is high, and that is worrisome and a lot of the reporting seems to reflect that. As far as work culture, some of the business reporting that I've seen about millennial work habits isn't negative; it's about how businesses can adapt and retain the younger generation that is likely to be very well educated, less loyal (and for good reason), and insisting on more flexibility in work/life arrangements.   The BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) to work, something many IT department are adapting to, is being driven in large part by the younger generation that doesn't want to be constrained by out-of-date tech.   And as far as destruction of humanity goes ... the polls seem to indicate that millennials may be the most concerned about climate change. Millennials aren't very well represented in Congress yet, so I won't fault them for causing the destruction of humanity. As far as who screwed up the economy: every earlier generation blames the older generation for this or that. It's a waste of energy, because as the saying goes, nobody is perfect.   And regarding the journalism business: Most of the web news start-ups, I would suppose, that are roiling this business are the efforts of millennial generation, not the baby boomers. The younger generation is carving out a new paths for making journalism thrive. I hope they succeed.   If you read something that blames the millennial generation for the national woe, just keep in mind that it was written by a dull, ignorant, full-of-crap, dense and misinformed person who probably has no idea where his/her local library is, and likely has the IQ of a hen.       Nothing converted me. This isn't a belief. The science is simply overwhelming. The impact of rising C02 levels on the oceans, land and atmosphere arrives daily. Reading about climate change, studying it, and trying to act proactively to bring about change is important for me.   Right now I'm reading The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert, which documents to accelerating decline of species. Many species aren't adapting well to warmer climate and the increasing acidification of the oceans as they absorb more C02. Really recommend it. It's not polemic. She's a top notch reporter who had access to scientists in the field, and she reports on their findings.   The worry, the concern and the fear is authentic for many people. There is no doubt.          Taxes on a suburban ranch house can run 4K in the 860. Car taxes can add another 1K easily. Energy cost are high. It's a beautiful state, but if you're getting close to retirement the overhead is really tough.   The winters may be getting tougher, too. More snow it seems.       This Huff post screed is more than 1,100 words over a problem that could have been explained in 25.      Kudos to the farmer for writing this piece. But reading between the lines of his essay, you can sense that he's being cautious. He calls for "common sense" solutions twice, without really explaining what he means beyond increasing reliance on alternative energy. But in Iowa, as I understand, landowners are doing ok by making land available for wind generation. Is he arguing for expanded use of land for alternative energy? Is there a subtext here? Not really sure.    Here's the museum's write-up of its exhibit. (Scroll down)  http://www.nbmaa.org/index.php?option=com_content task=view id=32 Itemid      How everyone is preternaturally young. In DC, I feel like I'm living in the movie Twilight.    We're describing different things. Facebook didn't close the door to content. But it did close the door to searchable content independent of Facebook's own engine. And I wasn't describing full-time content creators, but people with day jobs who write as a hobby.      Before there was Facebook, there were a lot of blogs, personal blogs, where people shared stories about their communities and reaction to things. They were open and accessible and uniquely valuable; they tended to humanize a community, and enliven.   Over the years, many of these writers, understandably, migrated to Facebook because they're real interest was to use the blog for social networking. (And they weren't that much interested in maintaining a blog.)  But this shift to Facebook also closed the door to a lot of content. The local blogging universe gradually became mostly specialized: food, clothing, mom blogs, real estate, neighborhood, etc.    Many of the story tellers, who had a talent for making a community alive, were posting on Facebook. They're content, for the most part, was no longer discoverable via a general search engine.   If FB Newswire has a plan to take some of this content and allow it to find its way to the broad public domain, (something I think these writers, when asked would embrace), then it might be very useful. This content doesn't even have to be connected to any news event.   If Facebook could find, discover and promote writing that tells us something about the world we live in and add that to your news feed, then it might be doing something important and powerful.          Ignorance in the world? Film at 11.    In science, research is first peer reviewed, and, second, the validity of a finding is only established after others duplicate the research.  In data journalism, there's no easy way to know whether the data has been interpreted correctly, or manipulated to support a news hook. Other news organizations, bloggers etc., are more likely to amplify the findings instead of critically asking whether the data is accurate, complete, or represents reality.    I've used data to support stories for decades, but in extremely targeted ways. The data was the icing, not the story. Now we have news orgs downloading every spreadsheet they can find. Danger ahead, IMHO.        The ownership model is a lot different for the affiliates. In Hartford, the major state newspaper, the Courant, is owned by the Tribune Co. The local Fox affiliate in Hartford is also owned by the Tribune, and the reporting is very good.     The Courant, like the state, is a fairly liberal paper, editorial-wise. The Courant and the Fox affiliate also work in concert on some things, especially weather reporting.   If anything, the local Fox affiliates that I've seen work to rise above the national reputation of Fox News.     It's not that. In Connecticut it's about the view. These things can be as high as 400 feet and have a wingspan that's massive. They are landscape altering, and having one here, one there, isn't going to make a one bit of a difference to global climate or to big oil. This will never be a windfarm state like Iowa or Texas. More likely than not, some business will put one up as an advertising gimmick to claim that that they are green.   As it is, most towns try to shrink business signs, just to keep the landscape view pristine.    Frankly, I think the state should do more to encourage solar. Or keep builders from constructing 2,500 square-feet plus houses, or putting in more mass transit in the Hartford region, in particular, as well as allowing higher density housing near potential mass transit centers. More bike paths on roads would be great as well.     Try a hotel bag check. You may get away with it if you're generous with the tip.    Catch a cab to the National Gallery. Not far.

Blame for the low turnout rest completely on DC's leaders.   April primary: Bad idea. It should be in Sept.   Field was too busy.   There were no issues. Everyone was running against Gray.   I'm hoping November is better. It's basically a face off between David Catania and Muriel Bowser. With Mayor Gray out, that means these two will actually have to campaign on issues.     The bill, ostensibly, is design to ensure that people can take photos of police activity. But the exceptions appear to give police broad latitude to shut down photography.   This is the text of the bill.   http://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/FC/2014HB-05060-R000545-FC.htm  AN ACT CONCERNING THE RECORDING OF POLICE ACTIVITY BY THE PUBLIC.

I was the editor of my college paper, 30 years ago. Same deal, and no explanation for it. But my college paper work gave me clips and contacts, and my first reporting job.   The people I met, some whom became lifelong friends, was the best part of it.    Your query prompted me to think about the writers of Wall Street Journal's All Things Digital worked under contract. They split from the WSJ and formed http://recode.net/ (Another who started with a personal brand, moved to large outfit and then returned to a personal brand, is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Romenesko)   There's a whole emerging issue about whether journalists will actually become "brands," and operate as independent contractors with the freedom to move name and brand from pub to pub. I don't know enough about this issue as I would like. But if you have a blog with a following and good brand and you see it as a potential revenue source, then you want to protect yourself. Linking up with a newspaper may accelerate your brand and profile, and help theirs as well, since food bloggers can be very popular and great source of ad revenue.   Personally, I'd want the ability to return my blog and brand if I parted company. I might think differently if they bought out my food blog and coupled that with a contract to write for it. But right now it sounds like you would be migrating without an offer, so you are the one in the stronger position in a sense. If they aren't offering you anything to bring your blog to their platform, it seems entirely reasonably that you should keep the brand. (Will you be giving up ad revenue that you now make on your personal blog?)   The All Things Digital writers, and they left in one big group, weren't able to keep that brand. The WSJ retains it. I don't know how ReCode is doing; maybe it's a rousing success, I just don't know. But having to re-brand seems like a risk.   Congratulations, I must say, for putting yourself in this position to begin with. It's an interesting issue, and the editors must think well of your work to offer.    I don't think there is a source on that. And I don't think it's something that the TSA wants to advertise. But I have heard of people who didn't have a driver's license, lost it, forgot it, or whatever, who were still able to get on planes.    Was the military trying to enhance security, somehow, with these arrests? You can tour U.S. military bases via Google Earth. Surprising amount of detail in the satellite images.    First, I think it's just super that you are working on a neighborhood blog. That's outstanding.  Layout wise, dunno. The "free and affordable fun," video teaser is wordy, takes up too much white space, and doesn't really compel you to click on link. It needs art.   The side-by-side Knoxville Opera/Spring football heds seems a little too busy.   Most neighborhood blogs use a blog-type format, and, honestly, I feel readers get confused by formats that stray away from that model.    I think these layouts are a little more action-packed:   http://www.popville.com/  http://www.brownstoner.com/     	45
 Which one's normal?   Did anyone kick you out of their stores...anyone at all? I didn't think so.   I lost interest when Ramsey went irrational over his kid. But I lean towards being a cynical jerk anyway.    By her reaction, it wasn't on purpose.

 and /lookatthisolddoll   Damn, I was gonna post exactly this...   He was asking for it, wearing those sexy clothes. Anyway, I bet he even enjoyed it.   I'm thinking that already.   I love black holes. They are dark mother fuckers that one day will destroy the whole universe.   If that works for you and you are happy this way, go ahead. There have always been recluse, hermit and antisocial people, living appart from society, in a cabin in the woods, or shut in their studios. I know some people that live like this and they are happy. I don't like personally this way of living, but I don't see there is any problem for them.  My concern is, as you say, that this can be bad for young people that have social problems. Some communities are reinforcing this attitudes that can cripple their abbilities and lead to problems like depresion.  Maybe I'm just getting old (I'm 34) and I'm in my new-things-are-the-devil phase. But, honestly, as the years pass, I'm witnessing how some concerning phenomena are appearing as the Internet evolves.  I know, saying "get out and get a social live" can be too rude and cliche, and it's not something so simple to do. When I wrote that I was angry, sad and concerned about these people.   I have. It's interesting if you are into experimental arts. But yes, it's long and slow. I think you can find an explanation of the meaning of each scene on the wikipedia article.   They download it from the internet.   "lol white people are so weird". I get it, white people dance funny and don't know how to bro fist properly but what the fuck has this to do with race? Don't other races make crazy creepy art?  Those comments are made by young ignorant brainwashed people, I guess.  Damn, sometimes reading the comments section is a dangerous idea.   The comments in that site are very sad. Lots of people saying "White people are weird" and "Only liberals would take their children to watch this". Can you just appreciate something crazy, funny and genuine? Haven't you ever seen something provoking in your life, something truly artistic? Yeah, it has a pig, and guts, and a baby being given birth, and a vagina and a penis urinating on people. So? For god sake, it's funny. Did they miss all of the avant-garde art movements in the 20 century? Not everything in art is a fucking Marvel movie, a Disney movie or an HBO series.   This is a hommage to all the helpless children who get eaten by monsters every year.  I'm glad somebody finally portrayed this subject. I don't think it's getting an appropiate treatment in the media.   And "taco" means "cuss word" in Spain.   This "last time" shower thoughts always hit me right in the feels for some reason.  [Like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/37w0ej/there_will_be_a_last_time_anyone_says_your_name/)    They should either not exist, or be an uncontrollable force of chaos.  I prefer them this way in the story: being weapons with complicated moral implications.   It's a very interesting concept. Being your own master. Taking care of yourself and give yourself orders, respecting yourself. Having always your own autorithy there to guide you.  Go ahead, wear a collar. There are lots of goth and punk girls doing it.  Some day you'll find something special you can wear to symbolize your subjugation to your master.   That's because Jesus magic comes from God, and witches' magic comes from their pacts with the devil.   I'm sure somebody thought this was perfect for a girl bedroom and that she would always sleep peacefully being watched by all those empty eyes.   Daenerys has dragons. So? The Lannisters have gold and the throne, the Starks had the Wall and the support of a lot of people in the north, the Tyrells have food, Valirya had strange stuff like valyrian fire and steel... There are many different forces clashing in the saga. And there are some mytical creatures like giants and white walkers and, yes, dragons, but very scarce and as remnants of past ages. They just enrich the story and fit the medieval fantastic setting, but in a subtle way, leaving space for political plot.  Yeah, Daenerys has a lot of stuff but she doesn't know what to do with all that. She is too worried about being the perfect queen and fixing every injustice she finds.   She hasn't won yet because she's too busy trying to make justice and fixing every social problem in her way to the iron throne.   At first I didn't understand this statement neither, but after thinking for a while, I believe he means it's like she had an unending supply of atomic bombs. You spend bombs and have to built some more, but dragons power doesn't exhaust, at least not in the same way that bombs.   You have a nice premise there for a sci-fi novel.   This is good material for r/deepintoyoutube   Hostia puta!

I was checking her profile and all her comments are rude, downvoted, calling people names and wishing some people die. What an incredible brat. That would be a turn off.  Edit: OK. I think it's not her. He posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RealGirls/comments/36lhm7/short_hair_selfies/crfehsg), saying "videos of **her** masturbating". http://www.reddit.com/r/RealGirls/comments/36lhm7/short_hair_selfies/crfehsg   Oh, god, thanks for this set. I found some time ago that pic with the mouse in the mouth and I had to save it. It's one of my favorite. And now this... God, it's my dream girl.   I must say this boy is quite creative. It's an unusual way to represent your parents. Not the typical drawing.   Just like every language do.   Yeah, it's more like a gnome. Actually in Spain we mostly use this word referring to flamenco artists very captivating or with a stroke of genius, like if some fairy poured some magic dust on him.   Maybe a more appropiate title for this would be "Words that haven't an equivalent in english".   I'm afraid you just were memed.  Or copypasted.   Maybe there was a time when "duende" was applied to any form of artistic talent, but today we only use it when talking about a talented flamenco artist. I guess you could use this word while talking about other kind of artists, specially talented people, people with "spirit", or a stroke of genius or artists that captivate you. But, really, we almost use it only referring to flamenco.  Source: I live in Spain.   We say "friolero" in Spain with that exact meaning.   I like to watch the brush strokes from up close. I can feel every movement the hand of the artist made years and maybe decades ago. It's like he is speaking to me, like a travel in time. I can feel the artist there with me.   In Spanish we have a word for "schlimazl". We say "gafe".   The [langoliers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langoliers) eat it all (spoilers).   Madre del amor hermoso!   lol shelfonso!   I just think its arrogant that you think you're in a place to tell people what to do with their lives  I'm not in 4chan telling those guys what to do. I'm in Reddit telling my opinion about their attitude. My opinion is that they should stop romanticizing social incompetence and hating what they considere is "normal".  and pathetic to react with fear towards people who make different choices than you.  I don't feel fear like this people would come to my house and stab me. I feel fear for the future of this people. I could just not care about them at all, you know, they are probably not even in my same continent. But I'm afraid of some effects of technology on people these days.  What are those choices you say they took? Playing videogames? Smoking weed? Surfing the internet? I have no problem with that. I have a problem with the fact that being secluded and hating social people is becoming a cool attitude in some places in the net. What kind of individuals is this going to produce in the future?  By the way, you don't know me. You don't know what choices I have taken in my life. Maybe you'll be surprised. Maybe I'm too similar to this people I'm talking about.   If you like that video chek out the channel, Memory Hole. It's a goldmine, pure r/creepy material.   And Gilgamesh   Oh, God, how I loved that guy.   Maybe about walking on the sand of the beach and taking hot baths.   Actually in the games it's errant heroes and warriors who loot the bodies, and they are not exactly rich people.   It depends. I don't think they would like Merzbow or Whitehouse, for example.   Yes, they can do be   He finally found "the sound".   Perspective.   No problem. This happens to me now and then.  I should have reread my text before sending it.   Ok, I'm insensitive and selfish, and this people are gonna do great in life hating "normal" people and not evolving. Whatever, buddy.   Ok. I'm not a native english speaker. Writing all this is hard for me, you know.   I think there are two possibilities:  1. The kid died while on the swing. He would have fell off. There is no way somebody dies in such a peaceful way he just keeps sitting in a swing. The mother, for no apparent reason, went crazy at that precise moment, didn't care about his death, sat the kid back on the swing and kept on pushing him until the next day.  2. The kid died. The mom went crazy, couldn't accept it and wanted to play with his dead child a little more. She took the body to the park.  Both are crazy and scary, but the first one doesn't sound plausible to me.   The most terrifying part of this for me is that the child died and then the mother carried his corpse to the park.   The shadow on the moon is round because Earth is a disc. A flat disc.   Time machines will not transport you to certain space and time. They will insert your data into the code of another moment in history. It's not a matter of things moving, but of the language the universe is programmed on.   I think about this very often. I am almost convinced that this reality is an enormous simulation, a videogame made with a programming language so complex we can't even imagine. There are some gods/players/spectators watching us and maybe controling us. Maybe this is a game they play or just an experiment. I'm not sure about this yet.   Choo choo motherfucker!   I heard there is a secret entrance to heaven in the bathrooms of some Walmart in Boston.   I don't get this. Could you elaborate, please? Did he mention Mia in his lyrics  or something?   Finally. I was tired of lists with the same creepy videos again and again.   I was expecting some picture. That would have improve the story. Like the girl sending photos of what she is seeing. The guy getting closer and closer.   You don't have to worry. There are no jumpscares. I was worried about that too.   It's a show, not real life. You can't expect people to react the same way to different characters.  Even in real life, you don't feel the same if your father has an accident that if you see in the news that some unknown women are being raped in India. Obviously, both things are wrong and you'll be sorry about them, but you don't react at the same level.   Commiseration can be nice, I guess. People supporting each other's suffering. Sharing experiences and problems. But romanticizing social ineptitude and perpetuating hate towards well adjusted people is not.  I'm not condescending this people. I'm worried about them. They scare me.  I'm rarely happy in my real life. I have a lot of social and mental problems just like this people. Very often I feel a strong hate for "normal" people, but then I try to remember this hate is not healthy, nor fair or cool. "Normal people" don't exist. It's just a tag I put on them because of my own problems.  I have two objectives:  1) Accepting the way I am. I am shy. I am an introvert. I like quiet and sometimes loneliness. I don't like crowds. I don't like clubs or parties. I'm awkward with women. 2) Improving my social skills. If I don't want to be alone I must learn to relate to people.  And I'm not gonna improve my skills if I have people online patting me in the back and saying: "Fucking normies, am I right?" and laughing at my memes. This can be a very bad influence, even more if you are a teenager.  	69
 Regardless of what happened. When someone pulls a gun on you and does not seem to be an imminent threat, you DO NOT argue with them no matter how wrong you think they are. Someone pulling a gun like that in a situation like this probably isn't too stable, and the best thing to do is to move along and call the police.   Just about anybody that improves their diet, sleep and health habits will likely see both physical and mental improvements.   This study seems a bit odd. Reported results were subjective, and there is nothing substantiating that the patients were not still at a major cognitive deficit. It seems to me it is less about 'reversing' Alzheimer's losses and more about reducing the number of other factors that lead to cognitive impairment (like stress, sleep deprivation, malnutrition, etc etc).      I have a neuromuscular disorder that causes severe pain and this is the way things are for me. I'm still quite young, but I don't feel things like I should because the background pain masks it. Somehow I recently got a gigantic bruise/abrasion on my leg that covered my whole thigh, but I have no idea when or how it happened because the pain never broke through the existing pain. It sucks.      There is a certain type of bot that is 100% indistinguishable from a human user when using Reddit. They cannot be feasibly detected outside of requiring non-software-trivial manual intervention (like captchas) on the part of the users of Reddit. Even then the captchas can be farmed out to real users for solving.  It's Reddit's Achilles heel. Such bots could network together or use embedded upvote/downvote logic to wreak havoc on Reddit. The "solution" would likely involve invasive captcha style validations paired with two factor authentication, but as a solution it also ruins Reddit simplicity in other ways.   Lakes like this can be so freaky and misleading when it comes to depth. I remember going to a clear alpine lake like this when I was a kid. Being a kid I had a little toy boat and had it attached to kite string so I could put it on the water and have it blow out towards the middle of the lake.  It only sank once, and it wasn't very far from the shore, out where I expected I could wade out and get it. But as I watched the crystal clear waters it kept sinking, and sinking... and sinking.  I watched it sink probably 15 feet all the way to the bottom. From the shore it looked like the water would only be a few feet deep. Nope nope nope nope.      Localized in the sense that it was not an organized group perpetrating the attack.   The Canadian attack was considered terrorism related because it was an attack against the government, and the ideology behind it was driven by a call from ISIS for lone wolf attacks against governments. It was not a hate crime.  The Australian attack was similar, and was directed towards the general public of a country labeled an enemy by ISIS. In that case too the man behind the attack was driven by ISIS, and even had victims hold up an Islamic State flag.    Because it appears to be a localized hate crime. This should no more be considered a terrorist attack than if an atheist black man shot three white Christians because of their religion and race.  It's tragic, it's terrible, but labeling it a terrorist attack seems unfounded. Even if the races were reversed.   Windows Intune is for managing existing Windows systems in a centralized fashion. It is not a new form of Windows client or an "online version" of Windows.               Not to my knowledge in terms of significant dietary methods, but I'm not too up to speed on that. I do know lots of supplements claim things that really haven't been substantiated well by evidence.  You can use coffee to get a small boost.  I think the best advice is to eat healthy and to stay active.      The news sources seem to have quieted down now and French TV stations are mostly back to original programming. I don't think this is a terrorist attack. Police at the scene also appear to be all to calm and not in defensive positions that would be expected if it were terrorism related.      At least he's honest.   Seeing those Japanese soldiers roaming the streets must have been absolutely terrifying to civilians. They look like invaders from another planet.   The West Coast doesn't even feel like it's part of the same world anymore. Over here for most of the region it's felt like spring/summer for over a month now. We're breaking heat records and many of the sky resorts are bare. It's hard to imagine the other side of the country is on the opposite side of the spectrum and in the dead of winter.   ELI5: Your body controls your desire to do things. But you have the ability to influence your body with your actions. By doing activities you enjoy and playing outside you may feel happier and more motivated to do the things you don't enjoy.  Better? =)   Cocaine and other stimulants work very well in increasing dopamine levels for a short while, but long term they will wreak havoc on the dopamine related systems (and others)... especially when you try to quit and your body is still expecting very high levels of dopamine (but has suppressed more natural production due to previous excesses).  I would definitely not recommend it.   It's due to levels of neurotransmitters in your brain changing due to large variety of physiological, environmental, and emotional factors. There are likely a lot of neurotransmitters in play that have a huge impact on motivation, but currently the most well-known is one called "Dopamine".   People who have disorders involving dopamine regulation dysfunction (such as Parkinson's, some forms of Depression, MS, etc) have severe disruption in motivation. The lower the dopamine production/uptake, the lower the motivation. They lack what would be considered a normal motivation drive, and typically see improvements in this motivation when undergoing pharmaceutical therapy to increase levels of dopamine.  So what can you do to influence dopamine? Well, the field is still very young and is full of unknowns, but it seems that one way to increase dopamine in healthy individuals is to have them partake in activities they **enjoy**. Exercise also has an effect on dopamine levels and as a result may increase levels of motivation.   So if you're feeling unmotivated, perhaps it'd be wise to spend some time among friends or go for a quick jog/walk/bike ride before returning to your work. It could have a very positive impact.   If we're talking about a legit murder weapon, then I'd have to go with the poison dart frog. It's silent, it's deadly, it's small, and it'd be hard if not impossible to trace.   Things are not so black and white (no pun intended). There are a lot of factors in play here, like how statistically blacks are more likely than whites to be living in a poor neighborhood. Living in a poor neighborhood usually means more police patrols, which means more arrests.  The title is FUBAR.    Do they though? Most of the people I know with BMWs are either young professionals or older individuals and take care of their vehicles. I see people beat the crap out of Audis a lot, but it's rare for me to see someone treating their BMW in any way that could significantly affect its future reliability.   Ah... Somebody has been using a clay bar =)        I would be surprised if they weren't. My friend who's a mechanic says people give both Audi's and BMWs too much credit for reliability. Apparently they have a lot more problems than most other brands, but the difference is that the owners are usually wealthy and can afford to fix them   Are GameStop's really doing that bad financially? I live in a big city, but all the GameStop's in my area are usually pretty busy.      I'm curious to know if they continued followup of the rats after 10 weeks? I would guess not, as they were likely dissected. Prolific cancer seems to be one of the biggest hurdles/side effects of current experimental stem cell therapy. Is 10 weeks long enough to say the treatment did not cause cancer?   I would hope so for those that have little chance of coming out of it (like those facing medical issues or those who have lost all that is around them). I'd be curious as to whether addicts could use this as well... So many of them have zero hope and are essentially already taking their own lives in a slow manner that other people pay for...  In practice however I doubt there will be any approval for anything but terminal illnesses or those which are progressive and do not respond well to treatment.      Cool data, horrible visualization. =(   As automotive automation and natural language interfaces become more advanced it'll be interesting to see how much the common jobs change. Perhaps in 20 years this map would be mostly software developers.     This isn't really something they can push things for that limit the cyber rights of citizens. This is a company that was attacked by hackers and it doesn't relate to NSA policies that people have grown to hate (and probably should).  I can see a few legislation proposals:  * Tougher sentences for those who hack with malicious intent * Sentences for those who support those who hack with malicious intent * More security assurances required by holders of large amounts of customer information * Fines for companies found to lack sufficient data security  All of which I would support.    It's impressive how quickly they are shuttering Office Depot stores. One near me was open this morning, and then I drove by this evening and the windows were boarded up and all but the main street sign had been taken down.   That's what happens when you don't have a screen for a fireplace.       Saudi Arabia is what happens when a group like the Islamic State comes to power and people are no longer willing to fight it.  When the barbaric ISIS members behead people or cut off the hands of criminals in the street the world cries foul. When the Saudi's do it the world largely accepts it.  Saudi Arabia is the ultimate functioning terrorist state.    This seems very Google glass like. Very cool technology, but unlikely to be adopted by consumers barring some killer app.    It looks like you live inside of a lego.      This article doesn't have much backing evidence to suggest the downfall is imminent. In my area shopping malls were largely left idle and empty shortly after the 2008 financial collapse. However recently I've definitely seen a big uptick in the number of active stores and customers in the malls around my region.  If they are estimating the collapse based on the dwindling number of new malls being built that seems like a poor metric. Many of those malls built prior to 2008 were bad ideas, and now the backers realize that... so why would they build more?   Yep. Statistically Hispanics are not very wealthy in the US, but it's certainly not absolute.   There is a coalition already doing this. The US is performing most of the strikes, but additionally you've got Jordan, Saudi Arabia, France, Britain, Iran (coordinated through Iraq), among others providing support against ISIS.   Japan is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. It's time to share that technology with ISIS, in the most meaningful way possible: attacks from the sky.  If Japan does not retaliate militarily it will appear weak and frightened.    As virtual reality and robotic technology grows we'll probably see wealthy population fertility rates plunge much like in Japan. As sick as it is, it's bound to happen. Porn alone probably has a statistically noticeable effect on the amount people have sex with real people.   HoloLens anyone?   I hope Japan unleashes hell upon these cowards. ISIS is now a direct threat to Japan, and should be decimated.   How the hell did this woman become a patrolling officer? This is the same woman who recently came under fire for lying about an elderly black man threatening her with a golf club (it was his walking aid), and she has had other incidents in the past.  She's on "administrative assignment" now. I support police... But god damn. Seattle: Take her off the force already, she has no business being there.       I'm surprised they ignored me as someone who sells plutonium down by the corner of 5th and Main.  Come on 56. Come on 56!  ... I get very little correspondence.       Because of rising nationalism and the perception that people are willing to sacrifice more to expand their country. If he backs down now Russia will look weak, mostly because of the language used by both sides in their "demands". Russia leadership has to make it look like they've won something, and they likely bit off more than they can chew when they weren't satisfied with Crimea. If they lose ground Russia will appear weak and nationalism will fall, and meanwhile the economy will still be in tatters.   I think they also want to make a strong statement for why Baltic states should not move towards NATO, and it's because of the threat of "separatism" (aka being invaded by Russia under a guise).  Imposing fear of demise (country, person or otherwise) is a tactic that works well. Just look at the case of former KGB agent that was poisoned with plutonium in Western Europe after publicly challenging Putin and his ways. You can bet your ass such people will now be much more hesitant to publicly criticize Putin if they previously served with him or were in a position of power.              There is an old abandoned garnet mining town in Idaho where I used to go as a kid. It was pretty incredible, there were huge piles of discarded garnets just feet from the forest service roads. On field trips we'd load up solo cups full of shiny garnets and take them home much to the dismay of our parent's who would be finding garnets all over the house for weeks to come.    It's good to know that all of those Islamic Extremists walking out in the open and manning checkpoints during this video are probably dead or cowering in corners now.   Interesting, I did not realize this. They are also one of the biggest supporters of the new Iraqi government/military. I wonder where the bigger allegiance lies.   Doubtful. The Kurd fighters are skilled and dedicated, but they do not have very large numbers. Iraq would likely have support from Iran and other regional governments... Possibly even the US in a giant clusterfuck.  The Kurds would gain nothing by attacking the Iraqi government, and vice versa.       It seems as though they asked the question to randomly selected registered voters over the phone, along with a lot of other questions. If I were put on the spot and also a bit annoyed on the phone, my mind my go blank and I might mutter "I don't know" and the pollster would check a box and move on... even through I do know of quite a few living scientists.   Just looked at his wikipedia page... JK Simmons is one prolific worker! How the hell does he have time to do anything else =O    Interesting. I wonder how this will affect the job market. From my perspective things are starting to slow down in the engineering market, or at the least becoming saturated. When I used to do interviews as late as 2012 for my employer it became a bidding/benefits war to get the top talent... Now we often have many very high quality candidates to choose from that have been looking for work for months, usually after jumping ship from startups.  Even though those 100k IBM employees being let go surely aren't all engineers, it's gotta have some impact on that already changing market. It's going to be interesting times for sure...   There is a lot of infrastructure which is weak all over the developed world, and in the US for the electrical grid it's amplified by the vastness of the country. If someone wanted to do major disruptive damage to our infrastructure, it would unfortunately not be very difficult.   It's becoming clear that Russia is not going to back down. NATO really isn't standing up for Ukraine outside of harsh remarks. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, the threat of Russian advancement and land grabs is a major threat to members, especially when it's done in a way that's so hard to prove (with Russia claiming the Russians there are "volunteers").  NATO should begin providing Ukraine with better defense and anti-tank equipment and if necessary more offensive weapons too. Russia is not going to wave the flag of surrender, so the best thing to do is forcefully halt the advance and deal with the consequences of previous incursions and land exchanges.   "Confirmed on twitter?"  That link isn't even the same thing. Their report says there were unconfirmed reports on twitter of an execution and the hostage situation is still unknown. Your "article" AND your spammy reddit submission from yesterday both stated that the hostages had been executed.  All your posts are for the same damn spam website.    Dude. Stop using the hostage situation as a way to spam your website to get more views... Yesterday you were wildly linking to your blogspam about the hostages both being executed, which was false and inappropriate.   Turkey was a Muslim nation/government done right... but for the last few years it's really been headed for the dumps. I hope the good people of Turkey will fight the government and push for a return of true secularism and freedom.    It's spam, and the OP is a horrible person for trying to get website views out of potentially traumatizing bit of information that is completely baseless at this point.  Look at the OPs history. All of his submissions are for this blogspam site.   *"unconfirmed reports on twitter"*.   I don't see ANY reputable news source reporting on their deaths. Instead I see news reports about how Japan is still holding Skype talks with ISIS "representatives".  Their fate is currently unknown.   No. That's a ridiculously large amount of grain. It must be at a major port? We took in about 40 loads daily during the Summer with the average load coming out to around 700 bushels per truck (our trucks weren't semi's, but they were still fairly large). That comes out to 28,000 bushels per day. Let's say we had 60 days of loads coming in at that rate, though it was actually over a longer period due to different source regions and grain coming out of other neighbor's storage. That puts us at 1,680,000 bushels of incoming loads per summer.  According to Google the average weight per bushel of wheat is 60lbs, which gives us a grand total estimate of 100,800,000 lbs coming into the elevator (and also eventually leaving it) for a total of ~50,000 tons per year. That's a drop in the bucket compared to what your elevator has coming in.   With the physics of heat and aging aside, one year at your elevator is equal to 60 years in ours. Which means we shouldn't have to worry about replacing out chutes until... oh... about the year 2240 =)     Most likely the chutes are poorly engineered, and/or perhaps the metal is softer than it should be? My family has a grain elevator that has functioned with very high traffic every summer/fall, and spring. During the summer when everyone is harvesting, it's in constant use (neighbors use it too) from about 7AM to 11PM.   It was built in the 40s, and I've never seen anything like the damage to your chute, especially after 5-10 years. Our chutes and pipes are shined up for sure, but structurally sound. Where was your chute located? At the end of a **very** large and high angled drop perhaps?   *Russian forces  They might as well be the Russian army, they are being trained, supported and supplied just as normal Russian army units would.   +1 for the GIF of SeaNilly being smited.   I think the major factor here is that with Glass the intention was to have it worn all the time... whereas this Hololens is more for special use scenarios where it can be more immersive.  I want to wear my VR at my choosing for fun experiences. Not be forced to wear it all the time and look like a dork just to get my moneys worth.   As much as I'd like to stick it to an advertiser, I choose to answer truthfully because unskewed data is a source of income for website/service owners who do provide valuable information.    Do you have more than just links to Google queries? I don't see any stories about crowds attacking and burning mosques.    Maybe they'll even get some picketers near the business just to spread the word to those who don't spend much time online. Though if the manager is really the nut job people are saying he is online, he'll probably shoot them,   Saudi Arabia's government should be the civilized world's and the United States greatest enemy if everything was based on principles.         "US elects new President. Nowhere to be seen."   It's awesome that it also worked on the mosquito species they tested, but I wonder how viable this is in terms of the amount of light/energy required? In their paper they describe the rough number of protons required... can someone provide an equivalent  measurement in laymen's terms?   I see them popping up all over in bigger cities, almost to the point where I wonder about credentials, as they are even showing up in small strip malls.  For most smaller towns however urgent care facilities are usually shared with the ER. It can be confusing because if it's past hours or you don't explicitly request urgent care, you will be charged ER rates.  	87

TeenNick is it's own channel now.      The N was replaced with TeenNick,  a separate channel.            I don't know what to believe anymore.       I'll believe it when I see it.                                  i hate paywalls                            the main reason i posted it                     I'm with you. This is a great plan. The neighborhoods in that area are , lets be honest, shit. It's empty lots and abandoned houses. This is literally the best plan to replace Turner Field. Much better than imploding the stadium and leaving it an empty lot (as if the area needed another one of those). Plus this will bring actual development to the area, something that the baseball stadium never did.         NBC has shown Olympics coverage in the past on NBCSN, Bravo, CNBC, msnbc, USA, and Oxygen. Actually NBCUniversal owns more channels than ESPN. If NBC wanted to they could also show Olympics coverage on E!, The Weather Channel, Golf Channel, Esquire Network, Chiller, Cloo, and syfy. So it's not lack of channels that's the problem, its the lack of will on NBC's part. Now maybe with the success of their live premier league games and live ice skating coverage during the Olympics last year they will change. But I'm not too confident.    NBC almost got the Pac-12 contract but ESPN didn't want to give it away and was willing to swallow their pride and co-bid with Fox. NBCSN also bid on The American contract and ESPN outbid again. ESPN doesn't want to give NBCSN a foot in the door. Also ESPN won't sub-license games to them. It isn't in ESPN's interest to give NBCSN programing. ESPN doesn't mind giving CBSSN or FSN some games because they aren't a threat to them. Most conferences are signed to long term deals. The only conference whose contract is up soon is the B1G. You can bet your ass that ESPN won't give that up (plus Fox might make a play as well).    The GOP will come up with some BS reason.

 Run   You're an idiot pal.  Says the guy who "can't" provide links.  We're done.  You've said this about 4 times now.  You're not very credible.    for some reason this makes creating links problematic,  Isn't that convenient.............  Follow - the - instructions - I've - given - and you'll be there in the wink of a pixie's twat.   And as I've stated, it's not my job to support your case.  That's on you.  I want to see the site you pulled each quote from.  It's easy to make something up and throw it online and say it's true.  *"Reddit user -mArtiAn- caught fondling goats overnight at local farm."~Farmer Bob.*  It must be true now.  And I don't have to provide a link to show a credible source that I took it from.  It is true because I said so.   What the hell difference does it make if she's black or not?  I mean, the group is called the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  If she's working to advance colored people, then what's the problem?   You're being stupidly evasive  How so?  I'm asking you to support your statements with the links/sources.  Yet you haven't.    And I'm the one being evasive?  OK.........   Link?   But if you're going to continually cite my inability to create links  I'm going to continually cite your inability to support your statements with sources.   You don't even know how to operate your own phone and, while you can look up random quotes on the internet and store them in a folder on your phone, you don't know how to look up how to use your phone.    [OK.......](http://i.giphy.com/hhy5zwTKXRXxe.gif)   Relevant text:  To avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, he changed his name early in his career to Nicolas Cage, inspired in part by the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage.      Still don't see the importance though, I'm not quoting the source.  Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias. Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand. They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.  Quotes like these are easily verified.  Then verify it.  Show me links.  You want to dismiss them without consideration, fine.  I'm asking you to support your posts.  Apparently, you are unable to do that.  Speaks volumes about the credibility of either the quote or the source you used.                      I don't know how to make links on this phone.   Since you're supposedly so adept at looking things up on Google, maybe you should do the same with this.  That stuff is all bits I've saved in my tinfoil, conspiracy nut folder.  [Seriously?](http://i.giphy.com/i4OfVOFke0jxm.gif)  You save quotes on your phone about this?  Why's a link so important,  Because it gives fuller context to the quote, as well as highlights what site is reporting on the article so you can immediately notate the likelihood of bias.  Additionally, merely because people may have said something, does not mean they witnessed it firsthand.  They may be repeating something that an unknown person told them or have heard about elsewhere potentially making the information circular anyway and ultimately all from one source.  just copy and paste   You mean like what you should do with the links for the quotes you provided?  and look it up  We've been through this before.  You provided the quote, you provide the source.  Not my job to support your case.   it's pretty easy to trace this shit to its source.   Then it should be pretty easy for you to provide the links to the sources you provided.     So you were able to copy/paste all of those but not the links from where you pulled them?    Ok buddy....   Must have forgotten its Life Alert.   credible  Here's the thing.  How do you know they are truly credible?  Because someone threw it up on the internet and said they were?  What you did is you searched "credible" and looked for things that supported your already held ideas.  Ever seen [this](http://www.challengefuture.org/static/upload/uploads/abe-lincoln.jpg)?  There is a reason that was made.  Because too many people believe what they find on the internet to be true just because it's on the internet.  sorry if I've been rude with you, but I find it extremely insulting to be called nuts for exercising basic logic.  I don't recall calling you "nuts" but when someone wants to be a jackass and make statements like:  And that sir, is the marvelous way in which the masses give themself permission to exercise zero logic rather than consider a potentially uncomfortable truth. Go back to sleep America.   and  Gomer, what, now you can't fucking read either?  and   I gave you the name, find it yourself you lazy cunt.  You can then take your "I'm insulted" and shove it up your ass sideways.  Hell, you already said once you were done with this topic but you still came back.  Why?  I guess you lie and are thus not a credible person.  [Take care.](http://gph.is/14hiivF)     And the quotes?     Again, not my job to support your own postings.  Your inability to provide the source of your information tells one of two things.    1) You're full of shit.  2) You're internet "sources" are not credible and very likely from 9/11 conspiracy sites.   So, to summarize, your answer is "No, I don't have any links/sources for these quotes and what not that I am posting."   I mean really, do you have any links/sources for these quotes and what not you're posting?  You're obviously copying/pasting from somewhere.  Let's see from where shall we?   not gonna find the paper  "I can't support my statements"  More quotes. Great. Give me facts pal. Quotes don't mean shit.    You provided a quote buddy. What's the context? I can say "My cock is the size of a Yukon GMC". Does it make it true?  Fuck no!   It's up to you to back yourself up. Not me.   Do you see prosecutors making the case for a defendant?  I sure don't.   Back out all you want. If you can't back up and support yourself with credible evidence, that's on you. Enjoy your tin foil hat.    Look into it and let us know.   She'd still be cheating and thus, would become my ex-girlfriend or ex-wife.   consider a potentially uncomfortable truth  Bring facts to the table and I'll consider it.  Otherwise, I'll carry on with my life not wearing a tin foil hat.   And?  Lots of stuff happens every day that is "absurdly unusual."       Hell yeah I do!  I never understood the stigma surrounding people who go to movies/bars/etc by themselves.  I have fun with it.  I can come and go as I please and I usually end up having conversations with interesting people I never would have spoken to otherwise if I was with others.  If people want to judge you based on you doing things alone, let them have at it.  They are the ones with issues that they need to deal with.   Hoping they will look in the mirror and realize that "Hey, I'm not a religious expert.  Maybe I should quit preaching it."      So does that mean these fuckers will stop telling us what should be done because of what is right/wrong by the bible?   All of them.    Well, except for the one that al-Qaida planned/plotted the attack.  That one is true.   What about it?     The only issue with that line of thinking is that the police don't know your intent.  For all they know, you're waiting to get to an area more "friendly" for you.   It's not like we can change the laws...  This is a line of crap right here and an example of the attitude as to why laws won't change, because people accept defeat without even trying.  If you want laws to change, it can be done but time, work, and effort need to be put into it.  Hell, look at where things are moving with cannabis.  Change can happen.  What if the crimes are victimless and the laws are unjust?   Prove to a solid majority of people in your area with unbiased information that supports your point that the crimes are victimless or laws unjust.  Simply saying it doesn't make it so.  It just sounds like one person stating an opinion.  Like selling cannabis or sex?   I personally believe, and this is only my opinion, that there are more crimes and "victims" with these two items being illegal in most places.  The only reason I can figure why they haven't been legalized is because the people in office haven't yet figured out how to make more money off of them with them being legal yet.   Which is not relevant at all.  Police don't make people commit crime.  The people who commit crimes do that on their own.  If they chose to stop committing crimes, the need for police would drop.   It's Saturday.  Go live a life.   9/11 conspiracy theorists   Police can stop getting unnecessarily involved in things  People can stop unnecessarily committing crimes.  No crime, no police.   People stop committing crimes.  No crimes, no need for police.  Or at least as many of them.     [Bigotry](http://www.reddit.com/user/EurocentricZionist/submitted/) checks out.

Relevant text:  Two studies published in 2013 and 2014 have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and machiavellianism. The 2013 study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities and the 2014 study suggested that the noxious personality characteristics known as the "dark triad of personality" should be investigated in the analysis of trolling, and concluded that trolling appears "to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism." Their relevance is suggested by research linking these traits to bullying in both adolescents and adults. The 2014 study found that trolls operate as agents of chaos on the Internet, exploiting hot-button issues to make users appear overly emotional or foolish in some manner. If an unfortunate person falls into their trap, trolling intensies for further, merciless amusement. This is why novice Internet users are routinely admonished, "Do not feed the trolls!" The 2013 study found that trolls often have a high expectation of what it means to be successful, which is higher than they are able to attain, and this results in them resenting others who think they are successful but who fall below their standards.      actually MORE likely to ban or moderate free expression.  Which is also their right to do so when people voluntarily sign up and agree to the terms and use of service agreement.      Relevant text:  In 1791, partly as a result of the Copper Panic of 1789, Congress imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which led to protests in frontier districts, especially Pennsylvania. By 1794, after Washington ordered the protesters to appear in U.S. district court, the protests turned into full-scale defiance of federal authority known as the Whiskey Rebellion. The federal army was too small to be used, so Washington invoked the Militia Act of 1792 to summon militias from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey. The governors sent the troops with Washington taking initial command. He then subsequently named Henry "Lighthorse Harry" Lee as field commander of the troops being marched into the rebellious districts. The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting, as Washington's forceful action proved the new government could protect itself. These events marked the first time under the new constitution that the federal government used strong military force to exert authority over the states and citizens and is also the only time a sitting U.S. president personally commanded troops in the field.      No. Especially since the reason given by many isn't even the reason the subreddits were banned in the first place so they don't even know what their point is.    Other than the incessant whining of little children, it's fine to me.   Were you required to purchase gold or spend money on redditgifts to use the site?   TIL many redditors don't understand what the First Amendment truly means.   rather than act like some 12 year-old girl  You mean like all the people crying because the subreddit they use on a free service was taken down?   So why didn't you just like, not look at any fathate* pages or posts?  I never said I did.  And one more question, do you enjoy looking at all of the other racy subs? Did these ones just strike a nerve with you?  You very clearly don't understand why these specific subreddits were removed.  Instead of following the mob mentality, go out and educate yourself as to why it was actually done.   Nope.   Shut the same subreddits down that they did and carry on with their day.   If you say "Hi" to a redditor they will get pissed off half the time.  The people who are in an uproar need to step away from their computer, open the front door, and realize there is a great big world outside with lots of interesting things to experience other than reddit and a subreddit being deleted that was provided free of charge anyway.   I saw similar once in my son's preschool class.   Wow, the sense of entitlement is worse than I thought in this place.  Are any of these morons paying to use reddit, imgur, or other sites that are in actuality free to use?     No.    I really don't get the uproar.  This site is free to use, as is imgur and others of the like.  Reddit has no obligation to allow you to do whatever the hell you want.  If you were paying them to use their services I could see an argument but as it stands, you're not.    EDIT: "YOU" is generally speaking, not one particular person.   People are actually this upset that a few subreddits were banned?   Waking up.

Relevant text:  Raccoons can carry rabies, a lethal disease caused by the neurotropic rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral vaccination programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.

 Well, being debt free, plus freeing up cash flow for other uses, namely further investments (we want to purchase a vacation house) and opening a 529. Getting back that 1300 a month is equivalent to us getting an extra paycheck each month.   This is where we are currently leaning.   I have considered pausing the investing, but my portfolio has significantly outperformed my interest rates the past few years so I am slightly hesitant to do so. Still, getting the loan paid off sooner than later is a good thing.   ...why?      Yup - it was a keybank alternative loan received during 2002-2007, which was then sold off to great lakes. They're bound to some index (sadly their website changed and I can't find the exact terms) but it is capped at 3.5%.   Hey everyone.  Yearly, my wife and I bring in the following (gross):  * Me: $81k/yr * Wife: $65k/yr  My wife and I have two outstanding debts:  * A home mortgage with $154k remaining at 4.125% (fixed), minimum payment of $1380/mo. We are focusing on this loan, and are paying an extra $700/mo on it * A private student loan with $51k remaining at 3.170% (variable but capped at 3.5%) with minimum payment of $557/mo  Given the relatively low interest rates on each, I have also been investing.  * $70/mo into VPAIX (we are over the 25% tax level) * $230/mo split across a diversified investment portfolio (EWX, PID, SCHA, SCHM, VNQ, VONV, VOOG) * ~$200/mo into a company ESPP (15% discount off ticker price of first or last day of fiscal quarter, whichever is lower) * $28/mo into I-series treasury bonds (don't laugh :) )  I am not including 401k/403b/pension payments here. We both are contributing the max matched amount our employers allow, and I add about $150 extra a month to a roth 401k.  So, my real question is, given the amounts we are contributing, loan payoff calculators show an estimated debt-free date of Oct 2022 using Avalanche, with $31k total interest. Using snowball, I AGAIN see Oct 2022 but with $32k of total interest. Other than ~$1k interest, the only real difference is that with snowball I get back the additional $557/mo from the smaller loan by the end of 2018. Having the extra cashflow every month would be useful. That would be nice, especially since the wife and I are starting to discuss kids and by that time we'd be looking at daycare costs, clothing, etc. The cashflow would be nice - nice enough that I think I'd be willing to pay the extra 1k/mo for flexibility. Getting rid of investing entirely in the meantime would at best change the "debt free" date by approximately 1 year.  Note that this does not include any windfalls; tax returns usually are around $6k/yr for us (this should shrink as interest goes down), I get a yearly bonus of about $4k, etc, so the date will likely be sooner. Usually this all gets pointed at loans or large purchases (if we have them). It also does not include yearly cost of living wage increases. Any wage increase we get we have been directing at paying off loans.  I just want to get some feedback from other folks about how they'd handle this situation. Given the possibility of a kid in the next year or two, is it better to eat the extra ~$1k of interest and go for a snowball approach and free up that student loan cash flow in 2-3 years? $557/mo is about 5/8ths of the cost of daycare in our area. Or should I let the math guide me and stick with an avalanche approach and not get back ANY additional cashflow until the early 2020s?   My personal favorite is french onion soup. Grab a bag of onions, slice thin, sweat covered with butter for about 20 mins (looking for soft), add some salt and sugar and  turn up heat to medium/medium high. Brown the onions until they are a dark brown, stirring frequently. Add 6 cups beef stock (or 4 cups beef and 2 chicken) along with 1 cup of a sweet wine (I use cream sherry).  Serve over toasts that have been topped with a good melting cheese.  Delicious, and most importantly cheap to make.   Flanders = Flemish   OP, meet bitTorrent. BitTorrent, meet OP.

Goal is to have several types of lettuce, herbs, some trainable heirloom tomatoes, peppers, Acmella oleracea (toothache plant), and maybe some kind of fruit. The plan would be to take clones from mother plants and plant under the vegetative lights for a bit (or permanently in the case of herbs and lettuces), and then transition to bloom for the flowers/fruiting plants.   Is there anything I can do better with this design? I would love to go with LEDs but the cost is absurdly high. Eventually I would love to hook this up to a solar system so it can be powered entirely off the grid.   I have it allocated elsewhere as well - the bond fund makes up about 14% of my 401k portfolio. To my knowledge it is the only fee.... checking the prospectus the fee schedule is 0.0446%   Hey everyone. This bond fund is the only bond fund made available in my 401k program. However, there is a quarterly "recordkeeping fee" that is applied, and I'm seriously concerned about what that fee will add up to over time.  This fee has doubled from 4 dollars a quarter to 8 dollars a quarter, and I have a total of 7k invested. That means i'm losing about .4% to fees every year. My yearly performance is somewhere in the 1.6% ROI, so that seems like I'm losing a LOT and not getting bang for my buck to keep up with it.  Is anyone familiar with this fund? Is it a garbage product like it seems?   Well, my best advice in the meantime is start programming in your free time. You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.  Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.  The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming.   FYI, being a super-power-user doesn't equate to being good at computer science, or enjoying it. Do you like puzzles? Specifically logic puzzles? How good are you at breaking down complicated processes into simple steps? How good are you at math? How much do you enjoy doing these things? Enough to do it every day for 12-14 hours a day or more? Since you have a developer dad and spend that much time on computers, have you done any programming?  I'm not trying to dissuade you, I'm someone who was in your position at one point, and I want you to go into a field you're going to be happy with. Programming is not easy, and if you don't have the bug you will burn out.  I started out in computer science, but ended up spending all of my time working on fixing computer issues. Eventually I started to specialize in systems and network engineering, virtualization, linux, and data analytics. It's given me a great career.  Basically, don't think that just because you are on your computer 100% of the time you'll be an amazing programmer or computer scientist. But if computers are where your passion is, don't let that limit you. There's lots of ways to use technology as a career.   PLUS most stores will have items reduced for quick sale early in the morning (specifically meat and veggies which will get snatched up fast).   Never missed a payment on anything except twice when it was bank error. I've had credit history since I was 16 - my parents got me a cosigned credit card with a $400 limit. I've paid off several credit cards stacks of credit card debt, paid off several car and student loans, now I regularly use credit cards but pay them off monthly. My total debt is a private student loan which is about 5/8ths of what I make in a year, well under my actual assets (not sure if that is counted in FICO or not). Beyond that, I can't think of anything else that I've done.  Our mortgage is in my wife's name - she bought it before we were married and the process to have my name added is a PITA - so I doubt that that factors in to my FICO score.  Only other thing I can think of is that I took out a private loan from a friend to pay off my credit card debt that I had accumulated with high interest cards while i was in college. So that may have been something? Though that is older than 7 years ago at this point.   Yeah.. i'm thinking I may take note of the places I frequent the most and verify they take it. If I can cover at least 50% of my usual haunts it may be worthwhile.   That is AWESOME! Thank you for the heads up. I had no idea about the purchase guarantee... that alone would be worthwhile for big purchases!   Really close to it. I can recall two missed payments, both problems caused by the bank (one was ID theft related, the other was when a credit card number got stolen and used, so the card was shut down and an automatic payment got missed).  My family was terrible with money growing up, so it was a sterling example of what not to do. I also had a lot of promises broken, so when I sign a promissory note it really bothers me to break that promise. Not that I haven't had my share of debts until I figured my stuff out, I just went without to ensure everything always got paid.   True, but they are paying fees to the bank, and then the bank pays that to me. Still, a good distinction to make.   I know! I currently have 1 card that does 5% back, but only on fuel purchases, and 3% back on food/groceries, and .5% on everything else (Pentagon federal credit union platinum rewards card).   Well, not so much mistaken as out of date :) It was an old promo that I've been sitting on for awhile. Sadly it looks like the offer has changed since then.   Yeah - it was a very old email I had been sitting on, but it appears the card's terms have changed. They offered 5% back on the amex and 2% back on a VISA, but it appears that the Amex is now only 2% and I can't find the VISA at all.   Interesting - you're right. They used to offer an Amex at 5%, and a visa at 1.5-2%, but it looks like the Amex is now only 2% and i can't find the visa at all. I guess I waited too long :(   Barclays Bank of Delaware offers free FICO credit scores for credit card customers. Not sure which algo they use though. I just checked in - currently shows a score of 830.   Simple - cash back cards give me a 3-5% discount on everything I buy. Or should I pay 3-5% more on everything I buy?   Hey everyone. I have been offered an American Express card that offers ~~5~~2% directly deposited into my fidelity money market account. There are no fees, and no minimum spends required. I have two other credit cards atm, one is used mostly for gas, the other used mostly for work expenses or unforseen expenses until I can transfer money from my emergency fund. Both are paid off monthly like clockwork.  Those of you who have amex cards, how useful are they? I know in my area many vendors don't accept amex because of higher fees, but it would be wonderful to have the extra cash for investing. How many or few vendors accept it? Has it been an issue when trying to use the card?  EDIT: Looks like the 5% is a very old offer, the card is now 2% cash back directly into my fidelity account.    The Dave Ramsey people would suggest that a "good" fico score means you are well on your way to becoming a lifetime slave to the bank.  I'd have to argue that "good" FICO scores mean that you know how to handle credit responsibly as a tool. Depending which FICO score, mine ranges from 820 to 889.   I use credit cards for everything, but pay them back at the end of the month in their entirety, enjoying the nice 3-5% cash back that they give me. It effectively is like having a coupon everywhere. I am hardly a "slave to the bank" - rather I am the one getting the bank to pay me.  I've discussed this with Dave Ramsey people and they act like even owning a credit card is the most horrendous thing you can do. The man has many good points, I just wish that some of the folks weren't so dogmatic about what he teaches. They're missing the forest for the trees. Credit cards, loans, mortgages, they're all tools that you can use, you just have to know to use them wisely.   Marry me?   I have a psych degree, and I am employed as an engineer. I get specialized skills AND bouncy balls!   First, /u/alexinawe has excellent advice. I highly recommend you check out the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. There is a reason Warren Buffet considers it the bible of investing.  So for your question, what I mean is that shares of stock aren't actually related to the company. I'll do my best to explain (and any corrections from more experienced investors are welcome). I've tried to keep things simple by excluding stuff like order books because they'd just muddy the waters.  Suppose you have Company X, and they are going public. They partner with an investment bank and together they calculate a valuation for the company, let's say $10m. They then determine how many shares should be issued, and what price point they should be sold at initially, let's say 1m shares at $10. The company and the investment bank claim a portion of shares for themselves at a particular price, let's say $1, and also to make good on things like contractual distributions of those shares of stock (these are often referred to as founder shares). This all happens before the IPO, and there are often some restrictions on people within the company to prevent selloffs. Let's say the company claims 500k shares for itself at a cost of $500k.  When the IPO is kicked off, those shares of stock are sold to investors by the investment bank, **not the company itself**, on to the open market starting at the determined IPO price ($10). So, they make money on the difference between the founder price and the IPO price (so, $9 difference times 500k is $4.5m). Then the price will rapidly move higher or lower depending on what the market thinks the shares *should* be worth based on company fundamentals, emotion, whatever. If you buy during that IPO, you are buying the stock from the bank, NOT the company issuing the IPO. If you buy after the IPO, you are buying from another investor, NOT the company issuing the IPO. The company doesn't really have to do anything with the market unless they decide to issue more shares, issue dividends, merge/split, sell shares, or they perform a buyback.  The shares themselves are essentially a pile of chits created by the investment bank and the company. The shares exist outside of the company, the company just happens to own some number of them after paying a bargain price. You can see how much of the stock is owned by the company itself by opening yahoo finance or google finance and seeing how much is institutionally owned.  So, how does the company make money from the IPO? Suppose the market determines that the shares should be worth $50 each instead of $10. When someone buys or sells a share of that stock, the company doesn't see any money from the sale. What they DO see though, is that those initial 500k shares of stock that they reserved are now worth $25m total instead of the $500k that was originally spent for them. THIS is the part that is often misconstrued. When you buy shares of stock, none of that money goes to the company. The only way it really benefits the company is by driving the price of shares a miniscule amount higher (because you've increased demand and decreased the supply on market), which means their shares are now worth a tiny bit more.  This is why things like stock buybacks work. Let's suppose company X has had a great year after their IPO, and their stock is in high demand. They issue a stock buyback for 100k shares (total cost at market value would be 5m, so they are at $20m). The demand hasn't yet changed on shares of their stock, but there are 100k fewer on the market. So the rules of supply and demand dictate that when supply shrinks but demand stays the same, prices will go up. So, the market price goes up to, lets say 60$. Now, because the company owns 600k shares valued at $60 each, the company now has $36m in assets. In addition, share prices have gone up for everyone else who is invested in the company too, so they make a profit as well because of the buyback.  I hope that all makes sense.   There are some vehicles that offer that return safely, but they're usually closed end funds and can be a bit of a PITA to evaluate. I am aware of one that offers a 10% annual dividend yield, with monthly payouts. They make their money by options trading on natural resource stocks and bonds. They're not doing great atm because natural resource exploration and mining are down across the board so there's less chance for them to make a profit.  It takes hunting, but you can find them.   Not understanding that buying a stock is NOT buying "part of a company" despite what your high school economics teacher told you.   There are old mushroom hunters, and bold mushroom hunters. There are no old bold mushroom hunters.    Do all of those police pay into the same union that then funds legal defenses and contributes to political warchests to help ensure their buddies are in power? Yup. They do.   In fact, find me one record of a police officer refusing to pay union dues until union leaders stop interfering with due process. Remember when they provided a ton of expert testimony to prove that because Eric Garner's head was turned *just a little too far* so it wasn't "technically" a chokehold that kicked off the horriffic events that were to follow and the officer "technically" didn't break official departmental rulings against using chokeholds? Remember when the police union in NY threatened the city with a slowdown in policing - effectively holding the city hostage? Show me ONE example of a cop standing up against this BS. I bet you can't. Find me ONE COP who has stood up and said "fuck this grand jury bullshit, if the guy is innocent, let it be proven in trial."  So instead of all being bad cops, some are bad cops and the rest are bad cop supporters.    [Viola?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola)   Sadly they're already leggy (had them next to a southern facing window for a few days until I could get the lamps installed where I needed them). Hopefully they aren't screwed up too bad. Right now I have the light about 1 inch from the tops of the tallest seedlings.  I'll be picking up some 6500k lights this evening to replace what is currently there (4000k cool white lights)   Hey everyone. I am in the process of setting up a dedicated plant growing area in my home. I have two goals: first, a dedicated area for starting seeds to be planted in our large outdoor garden, and second, I want to begin growing a plant called "toothache plant" because I feel there is a viable business opportunity.  My big concern is that over the past few years, there are several examples where no-knock warrants are executed because grow-lights are seen using thermal imaging, and in the process people, pets, and more have been shot or killed. This is what I want to avoid.  How can I best avoid this? I don't have anything to hide, but I am genuinely concerned about the well-being of my wife, my dog, and my house. Can I call the police department and invite them for a walkthrough?   If you dont play the games, read the books. Geralt is a badass.  Even if you do... read the books anyway.   Hey everyone. I have two trays of seedlings started. I moved them under grow lights today (running behind a bit because I had to hunt down a new fluorescent tube). This is my first time using indoor grow lights to get things started.  What light cycle should they be on? 24 hours? 18 on 6 off? 12 on 12 off? Any help would be appreciated!   Not quite. Athenian democracy had some pretty powerful tools for the body politic. If your representative (chosen at random from all eligible voters) failed to perform their duties, they could be punished - up to and including death.  It wasn't until the 30 tyrants period that their political system really got screwed up.   I though small claims court had a much lower limit than 3k?   That said - $3k is likely not enough money to make it worthwhile to go to court. I'd be amazed to see an attorney charge less than that for even 1 day in court plus prep.   I heard their periods attract bears!   Not all colonials had the same opinions - don't group them all together. [Only about 30% of colonials wanted to leave the empire.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalists_fighting_in_the_American_Revolution#The_Loyalists)  And rioting before the revolutionary war began in 1765 with the stamp act, and then later the townshends act of 1767, and finally the coercive act of 1774. All of these saw large amounts of rioting AND looting - enough that impromptu neighborhood watch groups formed out of local artisans and businessmen to try and calm the situation (as mentioned in the below link, Philadelphia saw a group called the "White Oaks" formed).  [The sons of liberty excelled at rallying the angry rioters and using them as a weapon.](https://books.google.com/books?id=QqvIvErLiecC pg=PA40 dq=sons+of+liberty+rioting+looting hl=en sa=X ei=Ut0_VcP9MoLlsASnhYCoAw ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage q=sons%20of%20liberty%20rioting%20looting f=false)   Looting happened frequently following the riots of the stamp act. So much so that groups of merchants banded together to police the streets (a group known as the White Oaks). Acting like the only people who rioted were doing so out of noble intentions is historically inaccurate. [The sons of liberty actively cajoled groups of rioters and looters as a means of coercion](https://books.google.com/books?id=QqvIvErLiecC pg=PA40 lpg=PA40 dq=sons+of+liberty+rioting source=bl ots=Jk7fVmTCKV sig=Rqd6O55evoEXLICVVkxjAyqTSZ0 hl=en sa=X ei=PNU_VaytKYiwggSh24HgCA ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage q=sons%20of%20liberty%20rioting f=false).   Where exactly did I defend rioting?   It's not in that article, I found it after poking around a bit more. Franklin was an emissary to the crown, so protestors threatened to burn his house down and lynch his wife because not only did Franklin passively approve the stamp tax, but he was petitioning the crown to become a stamp distributor.  http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/02/the-hated-benjamin-franklin/   "In 1765, the British government, in an effort to raise money to pay off its war debts, imposed the Stamp Act on the American colonists, forcing them to pay a tax on each paper item they used. On September 17, 1765, a number of Philadelphia citizens threatened to attack Deborah Franklin's house, protesting that her politician husband had not fought against the Stamp Act vigorously enough."   http://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2008/10/deborah-read-franklin.html   I have to disagree about it being a major reach.  * In both groups, people rioted, attacked agents of the government, and destroyed private property. They even went so far as to target particular people (SoL attacked loyalists, tax collectors, and local magistrates, current protestors are attacking police). * In both groups, the protests that led to violence were to protest helplessness at enacting social change to benefit the governed. The colonists couldn't stop taxes, minorities can't stop police from getting special treatment when murdering someone (up to and including DA's doing the exact opposite of their job by acting as defense attorneys in front of grand juries to prevent indictments). * In both groups, there was not yet a formal declaration of war dividing them (so trying to excuse the actions of the SoL as part of war is invalid as the declaration of independence didn't exist until at least 1773, and wasn't ratified until 1776). * We hold one group as heroic patriots for destroying property, and lynching officials, while decrying the other as criminals  I don't see it as being that much of a reach. At the very least, there is a strong enough connection that we can discuss why we consider some rioters heroes for rioting against what they perceive as injustice, while contemporary rioters are written off as criminals.      IANAL however it becomes very muddy when a state of emergency is declared   Interesting - in some parts of the US a smorgasbord is another term for a large buffet. I had no idea it was originally a sandwich table!   Thanks for the video link!   So THATs where root beer came from ;)   Our town had a free tree giveaway to celebrate spring, and my wife snagged me a baby crabapple tree.  It is still tiny, so I was planning on putting it in some potting soil in a small cup to get settled in, and then moving that into a larger pot with some airy fertilized soil. Once it gets to be a foot taller, I may plant it outside (we are in 6b, and apparently this cultivar is good to zone 7).  Is there anything else I need to be aware of?? Is this a solid plan?? It came with instructions but they instruct to plant right into soil. The issue is that we aren't past our final frost date yet.      If you have an IOS device, robinhood offers free trades for basic accounts. I think I have some invites if you want one. They are super minimal, but seem to work ok.   Which is why I will always be pro-dog. Dogs at least growl to give you some warning. I've had somewhere in the realm of 20 cats, and I have encountered 1 that was not a complete dickhole at least part of the time.   Can you point interested parties towards the information that you leaked?  Did it contain information about Haliburton flagrantly ignoring its obligation to fulfill reconstruction contracts in Iraq after the first gulf war, but still pocketing the money?  Also, do your balls of steel clink when you walk? HA!   Have you heard of comcast internet essentials? It's even cheaper - 10 dollars a month. And I doubt Comcast would have stopped the plan. Part of approving the Comcast/NBCUniversal deal involved comcast creating a plan to help enable low cost internet access. If anything, canceling the plan would invite regulatory scrutiny.   Charter already made an offer on TWC before the comcast attempt at a deal. They lowballed it, and TWC declined. Now that the Comcast deal is going down, they can make a second offer at a higher price.  Source: employee at one of these companies who was doing work directly related to this deal   It is possible, but may or may not happen. TWC turned down an offer from Charter already for being too low. We'll see if they'll make a second offer.   To my knowledge, she had the abortion. Though believe me, I have had nightmares that she'll suddenly pop up someday and say "by the way, you owe me 17 years of child support, AND I screwed you out of knowing your kid" or some crap like that. While she and her brother are estranged, he never mentioned her having the additional kid from me. The timing would have been off.  My wife knows the full story, and I've braced her for the possibility that it could happen one day. As it stands, I have no way of getting in touch with her one way or the other. She has gone off the grid.   Before I start, let me preface by saying I am ok with abortion for other people. However before I enter into a sexual relationship with a woman I make it clear that I don't believe in it for myself. I'll take precautions, but I understand the biology involved and if despite all of that a pregnancy happens, I want to see it carried to term. If she says no, we part ways. Cards are laid out on the table. (I am not looking to debate women's rights)  Anyways, a psychotic ex of mine told me that she had gotten a depo provera shot, and said she didn't like using condoms. So stupid me believed her. She ended up pregnant because she never really got the depo shot. She almost immediately started using the pregnancy as a bargaining chip. Going so far as to say that she'd kill my kid if I didn't do what she wanted several times. That isnt hyperbole - that is how she phrased it.  During our last fight, she said it, then she started mocking me... saying shit like "I'm going to kill your baby, and theres nothing you can do to stop me. How does it feel to be helpless to stop me from killing your kid?" At that point I knew it was over, only my name was on the lease to the apartment, so I told her to get out or I was calling the cops to have her removed. Dumb bitch apparently didnt think that part through and her tune suddenly changed that she was sorry and didn't have anywhere to go. Too late.  She meets up with some guy and leaves (I had had suspicions she was cheating on me after seeing several chat logs while watching her play games - turns out I was right). About a month later I start getting texts from her at the abortion clinic, again saying shit about killing the baby, and how helpless I was to stop her, how she wished she had never met me, etc.  Last I heard she has 4 kids from 4 different guys and has had double digit abortions (still friends with her little brother). She is living on child support checks from all 4 dads, and is shacked up with some other guy. White trash brood mother.  This, boys and girls, is why one does not stick one's dick in crazy.   It's not my song. I'm transcribing a Bob Dylan piece from a score. Shelter from the Storm - there are 10 verses, with 9 repeats.  I'm not trying to rewrite someone else's work.   Yup! That should work fine! Once you get used to it, you'll find the way that feels the most comfortable to you.  With vaporizers it can be tough to tell. Your lungs will be filling up, so you may feel slightly warm in your chest. If you were smoking you might feel an urge to cough (though this can happen with a vape too).   You want your lips around it. Basically all air you are pulling in should be coming through the straw. Make sure it enters your lungs. It can feel a little wierd of you aren't used to it.   Can you provide any more information than that? I'm still learning the software so a creative fix may be a long way away.   That's not impossible, especially since it sounds like you're a bit of a newbie. Just inhale like you normally would.  Grab a straw. Breathe through it. The feeling you get when you inhale? That's what you want to be doing. Heck, you could keep inhaling through the straw and stick it over the stem of your MFLB if you wanted.  You wouldn't be the first person who had trouble with smoking/vaping the first few times :)   Did you tumble the contents around? How charged is your battery? Were you seeing vapor on the glass?   If you read the warranty, when you get a replacement unit, the old unit becomes property of Magic-Flight. That's why they have you wreck it (check the text in your manual).  I totally get what you mean, it sucks to get rid of the unit, but otherwise there is no reason people wouldn't just get one, wreck it, get a replacement, wreck it, and so on and then just repair them, you know? Sure they could sue, but only really in the US.  I doubt many people will be checking in on you though.   So, if you make this, how the hell do you stop it from combusting? That was a heck of a long draw it seemed.   I wish I could do that. Half the time it makes me trembly now, and that would completely throw me off. My tolerance is nowhere near where it was back in college days.   You got it. While he did create doge, he also is a bit of a drama queen.   Oh look, he's quitting again. I wonder how long that will take for him to come back this time.   This is good to know. The wife and I plan to retire/immigrate to either the Netherlands or Belgium when we retire (still 30 years away). It sounds like we'd have to pay for a house in cash rather than use a mortgage when we make the move.   This is true. For instance I recently invested in a tax free bond fund for my state, and the minimum buy in was 3k. I'm lucky that I can afford that but it still took a few weeks of saving to scrape together that amount.   Pretty simple Q. There seems to be a limit of 8 repeats with an alternate ending. I am trying to transcribe a piece which has 9 repeats for the first alternate ending, and then an additional 2 after for the second alternate ending.  Is this doable? There only seem to be 8 boxes that can be checked.   They're listening? So have they provided a support phone number yet? Or are they still telling their customers to post on the forums and piss off if no one helps?   The baby can be done fairly cheaply. A friend of mine is a bit of a hippie-dippy type, but she used to give seminars poking holes in the expenses of a baby. A lot banks on everything going "ok" but if you luck out, it isn't that pricey.   * Instead of formula, breastfeed (supplementing only as necessary).   * Instead of buying a crib, co-sleep  * Instead of buying disposable diapers, make them out of cloth or buy reusable diapers. 20 seconds of rinsing and then they go into the washing machine.  * When they're old enough to eat baby food, use a food mill and puree whatever mom and dad are eating. This has the upside of forcing mom and dad to eat healthfully.  There were some others she goes over, but she did present the numbers and it was pretty incredible the difference in price.   Have to agree with you. I once dated a girl who scored a perfect SAT score, she was valedictorian of her HS, summa cum laude of her college. Utterly brilliant.  In public, she acted like a complete and total glassy-eyed mouth-breathing ditz. In private though, she was brilliant. She said she usually just had to lower the way she talks and acts to what people were comfortable with.  Still, it was a huge turn off every time we'd go out in public and she'd suddenly dumb down.   One of the best dad jokes I've read in awhile.  http://i.imgur.com/bA0tFRJ.gif   Honestly, I believe that both exist, and are opposite tendrils of the same beast.  Right now, no, I do not think that surveillance impacts as much as bread and circuses (score one for Huxley?). Not because it doesn't exist, but because it's non-obtrusive.  But at some level, there is some amount of behavior modification that comes from fear of surveillance. After the Snowden leak came about and it was found that Microsoft was piping info to them, Microsoft soon got rid of the "always on" requirement for their xbox kinect on the xbox one because no one wanted an NSA box in their living room. This is a silly example, but I feel a valid one nonetheless.   Let's see.  Attempted character assassination: Check  Straw man argument: Check   just another privileged angsty kid... 1984 is one of the most misunderstood books there is, it's really not meant for your kind.  Orwell was a "privileged angsty kid." Read Down and Out in Paris and London for part of his autobiography. I'm pretty sure you have no idea what you're talking about in terms of who the author intended the book for. It is entertaining to see you make assumptions about who I am, my social station, and more based purely about my opinions of the world.  1984 doesn't have some hidden meaning. The reason everyone gets the same thing out if it is because Orwell was very public about what it represented. [Read his thesis that inspired the book](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/12/george-orwell-s-letter-on-why-he-wrote-1984.html). He wanted people to know about how terrifying totalitarianism was, whether it emerged from fascism, socialism, or even democracy gone awry. This was based on his experience in Burma, and in Spain under Franco. He wanted it to be a cautionary tale, and to tell people that they need to be vigilant to prevent it from happening. Per his letters - "the world moves towards fascism, but it's not irreversible". So yeah, seeing shadows of 1984 and trying to sound the alarm was exactly his goal.  So go on, do tell me more about how you know more about Orwell than Orwell did.   Care to have an intelligent conversation, or are you just looking to sling insults?   I think some was known, some wasn't. We knew about warrantless wiretapping, however we didn't know about massive instant-messaging recording, or that the NSA had breeched several large technology companies to consume data en masse.  Again, I think both answers are correct. There is absolutely a level of apathy about it a la Huxley, but the shenanigans that Orwell predicted also absolutely do exist as well.  I think the current situation contains both.   I'd argue that the two aren't mutually exclusive.   I get what you are saying, but several of those things do exist to some level (not as fully implemented in the book, but the shadows are certainly looming large).  As a telecom engineer, I have to disagree on your first point. Google stingray and you'll see what I mean. You can be tracked via gps without a warrant. Not to mention your google search will be logged, cataloged, and sold to the highest bidder (and the government if they ask for it). Though NSA disclosures show the NSA was accessing that data anyway.  As for not disappearing people, have you heard of extraordinary rendition? COUNTELPRO?   As for kids turning in parents, we aren't there yet. However we are at a place where everyone is watching everyone else thanks to post 9/11 scare mongering. Google Rick Bradshaw's florida program that rewards people financially for reporting neighbors with antiestablishment views (luckily it was vetoed).  Forced exercise - well, beyond gym class, I suppose you are right here. Though with the US military seeing a possibility of troop shortages because so few people can meet fitness requirements and reframing the issue as a national security one, it could be on the horizon.  For language reduction, you are right. Though evidence does support that our vocabilaries are shrinking.  There are other items that are absolutely present.  We absolutely have a 5 minute hate - just turn on the news and listen to who we are supposed to be hating today. The big bad Russians? The Cuban socialists? The Iranians?  As for "war is peace"  the US has been involved in conflict 222 out of its 239 years.  I am not saying that it is 100% identical, but we are far closer than the state of the world he feared than when he wrote it. Orwell himself agreed - and things have only gotten closer since WWII.  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/12/george-orwell-s-letter-on-why-he-wrote-1984.html   I think its interesting that we see facets of both Brave New World and 1984 in the modern US.  It is distilled but this comic does a good job comparing them (although I ultimately disagree with the final points). In every case, BOTH are present. Not only do people want to ban books, but literacy and science are ridiculed or at the very least ignored by mass media as people go on their search for bread and circuses.   https://biblioklept.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/huxley-orwell-amusing-ourselves-to-death.jpg   Observable data are facts. Without facts we have no way to form hypotheses or theories.   He may not be allowed to express his personal beliefs if they could upset the waters and risk a lawsuit and bad publicity (even if it is a bluff). Teachers have to walk a very fine line. I'm married to one - she has to censor herself a lot to make sure she never upsets the naive innocent little snowflakes.   You will be nervous. It's your first day!  Pick up cues from your colleagues.  Many professional offices have employee handbooks that talk about what is expected of you. Read it.  If you find your nerves get the better of you, bring chamomile tea and pound it like it's water.  Honestly a big office is no different than any other workplace once you get used to it. Don't overthink it. If you have a manager or supervisor, let them know your reservations. Be open and communicative.   Honestly? 1984. Namely because the society described is mostly here in essence now in the US, and we let it happen.   Not related to 4/20 in any way, lol!  Seriously though, this would be fun to do for the wife and I's anniversary!   No, ignoring that there are steps you have to take in a bad police encounter to put chinks in their armor is naive.  Can they be abusive? Yup. But I'd rather have solid evidence on a dashcam that shows my rights being violated in black and white that any defense attorney can use to get the case dropped, and if it isnt, can be used as the basis for an appeal.   Honestly, it is. If they say nothing, ask if you are free to go. If not, ask why you are being detained. The important part is you asking.  You get arrested, you call an attorney and contact the ACLU because you have a dead simple case of your rights being violated. Your attorney has the case thrown out, and you sue the municipality for illegal detention.   I used to get high like you. I'd hire a bunch of hookers and do lines of weed off their tits.   Then you ask them what their reasonable suspicion is for detaining you.   I wish. Pot makes me go SQUIRREL!  BHO on the other hand gives me blinders.   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A9KTPY8  Here you go! The batteries come in a little plastic box that has 2 dividers in it. Should work perfect!   I picked up some powerex batteries off amazon and they came in a nice little case. Works great!   I wish the tin had enough room for a PA and orbiter :(   I ordered mine from vapornation a few days ago with their holiday discount. It won't be arriving til friday.   I was torn between it and the ufo, but ultimately it seemed like the overall opinion was more in favor of the orbiter.  So if you have an orbiter, How do you like it? Any advice for using it with the box and avoiding stuff like combustion?   As I was driving in to work today I was thinking how great a zebrawood or purpleheart mflb would look. I'd love to just be able to send them a wood blank!   I had a Pax 1, and between the constant amount of cleaning, lifetime supply of pipe cleaners, the fighting to get the mouthpiece to connect properly, and the weird upset stomach it gave me every time I used it I ended up reselling to a friend. It sounds like the pax2 fixes some if the issues, but according to reviews it adds some new ones. At double the price of an MFLB it just isn't worth it for me.  My MFLB is my goto vape. Almost every issue you are reporting sounds like it could be resolved with a little commitment to learning to use your device properly (not saying you aren't using it right, but the manual taught me a bit after I had already been using it for a year). You shouldn't be combusting a quarter of your trenches - it sounds like you are holding the battery way too long and the whole thing is overheating.  My MFLB is about 2 years old now, still using the original batteries like a champ.  I DO have a backup vape - an arizer solo. I just hate that the solo pulls a ton of crumbs through when I inhale.   I had the same thing happen. Tbh I am not a fan of the mflb without a stem. It does work, but not being able to see browning and losing a surprising amount of vapor through the airhole makes it perform way worse than with a stem (from my experience).  Pick up a dart stem, they're awesome albiet a little less stealthy.   You shouldn't be combusting.  I don't mean to sound rude, but take a look at your mflb manual. They go into great detail about how to draw.  By hash do you mean BHO or bubble hash? Further, are you using the concentrate trays?   Where did you get the netting? Just curious because it looks like it would work wonders for porchetta.   Hello everyone. We have our cat's litter box in our laundry room, which is an exterior room. To help prevent heat loss during the winter, we had started keeping the laundry room's door shut as much as possible, but that created a problem with the cat being unable to access the cat box.  So, I installed a bidirectional cat door.  At first, the cat just stood there confused. I poked her head through a few times, so she knows it's not solid. Then I held it open for her and she went through. Then I put her back in the laundry room and left the door shut.  She refused to go through. I put her in the laundry room and closed the door, and after a few hours meowing and scratching at the door, she still hadn't figure it out. So I held the cat door open and she ran through.  So, I have the door taped open right now. She seems to be going through without much of an issue. What are my next steps? How can I train her to nose-open the cat door so I can remove the tape? Should I start progressively lowering the cat door with tape so she starts getting used to pushing through SOME resistance until the door is completely shut?  I'm not used to training cats, so any advice would be helpful. Our cat tends to not like treats, so I can't really do the normal conditioning method like I would with a dog.   Basically what the title says. I would like a bay tree, but I doubt our climate is right (6b, southeastern PA). So, I was considering a small potted bay tree.  Are there any hardy pot-friendly cultivars that anyone can recommend?    So is this douchebag still outside of the country?   Carob doesn't really taste like chocolate - try it plain. It has an overly sweet taste with a hint of chocolate.  Try using espresso, or dry coffee. Also try using dutch process cocoa over regular cocoa.   FYI, how progressed is she with celiacs? What proteins can she still consume?    Lots of folks here seem to be assuming she just cant eat gluten, but a celiac has difficulty digesting all proteins and it gets progressively worse over time.   Being unwilling to teach your child cleanliness is not a justification for a exposing your child to a 1-3% rate of surgical complications.   Not to mention you are altering the body of another human being without their consent.  So I have to disagree with you. So does a large body of scientific research.  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/myths-about-circumcision-you-likely-believe  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/more-circumcision-myths-you-may-believe-hygiene-and-stds     Cutting off the tips of baby boys' penises because some invisible father figure said we should do it to some nomadic sheep herder thousands of years ago.   Because you not liking comcast or twc is not a viable legal basis to block a business merger. There have to be legitimate reasons to block it.  Or would you prefer that all legal situations be resolved based on popular opinion?    Honestly, I rarely had time to talk privately with my FIL. I ended up stealing away for a few minutes on a cell phone when the wife (then gf) wasnt around. It was really as simple as asking - "I want to propose to your daughter - can I have your blessing?"  He laughed, cried a little, said yes, and asked if he could tell his wife (I asked him not to because she can talk a lot).  Make sure the family has an old fashioned side or some folks can be offended.   First, reach out to a counselor of some type. If you are open to the idea of a deity check out a support group. If you are bullheaded do it on your own.  No matter how you do it, the motivation for change comes from the same place - you. You are the one who chooses what you do and don't put in your body. You are the only person responsible. Be proud of that. This is your chance to make your dreams come true.  Look at yourself in the mirror. Hard. What do you want to change about you, your life, your situation,  etc? How can you improve you? What have you always wanted to do but you haven't done?  Start doing that instead. Even if it is just a little at a time. Set small goals and maintain them. Reward yourself when you fulfill them. Make it a goal to stay clean for a day. Then every day for a week. Then a month. Keep challenging yourself and beating those challenges. Make them simple so you have to exert very little energy to meet them.   When you start rapidly fulfilling goals your self esteem will go up, which gives you confidence to tackle bigger goals.  Join meetup or cruise craigslist for fledgling companies/charities/nonprofits, and meet some new people. Even if you are antisocial you still need some human contact, and some kind of social group that you can be involved in is a great way to go. Your new job might not be a bad way to go with this. Throw yourself into the work!  Don't get down on yourself if you slip up. It WILL happen. You are human, but god damn it youre trying. Just get back up and keep going.  This is what I did. It wasn't easy.   Source: ex-cokehead clean for 9 years   Looks like you caught an early morning deal??   AFAIK flag code isnt enforceable by law. Otherwise every moron wearing us flag patterns on their clothing would get arrested.   What piping tip did you use for the frosting? I have been trying to get better with it :)   Mana mana   JUST A SMALL TOWN GIRL, LIVIN' IN A LONELY WORLD   Correct, and the difference is specificity.   The problem is, most children don't make very good witnesses and are very easily swayed. So by what measure would you consider testimony from a child, which could easily be unsubstantiated rantings, to be reliable?   Usually there has to be specificity to the statement. You cant say "he has drugs in his house! Go search him!"   Think about how easily that vould be misused. No judge would approve it because police could easily start saying someone randomly told them something as a CYA for busting down doors.  Rather the informant needs to say "they have drugs! In their basement there is a drug stash in the back corner under the shelf." Something that provides actual information.   Seeing this makes me so happy my main guitar is kept under lock and key, and the only easily accessible guitar is a plastic fantastic little martin.   Getting a warrant purely from the statement of one person while having no corroborating evidence to justify the warrant?  Doubtful.   Thats bullshit. One person saying something about someone else without any substantive evidence is not a reason for a warrant.  Unless the kid brought in hash oil and said "it's my mom's!" The statements were nothing more than conjecture.   I was wondering this as well. In our state (PA) warrants need to be pretty damn specific. This is like saying "a kid said something about his mom, we have no proof beyond that, but lets raid their house." There was no substantive evidence to justify the warrant. Any attorney can pick that apart with ease.  If thats how these things work now, I heard that the judge who signed off in the warrant has an opium poppy grow room in his basement.   Well, the issue is that much like Rome, we can blame the beaurocrats all we want, but the problem lies with you and I. Though the folks in power have done a very good job at ensuring that they have the population split down the middle with partisan bullshit.  Bread and circuses is only important if it's all the people care about.   This seems like a case the ACLU might be interested in tbh   It depends. Private loans have no forgiveness. Only federal which tend to make up a relatively minor amount of the debt load.   I would be laughing if I wasn't quietly sobbing into my drink :'(   The thing that bothers me is he goes on pushing unproven herbal remedies. Some herbals HAVE shown efficacy - peppermint is good at treating mild stomach discomfort, eucalyptus is good for colds, chamomile for reducing anxiety, ginger for motion sickness, st Johns Wort for acute bouts of depression,  etc.  These are all known and accepted and have a good bit of literature behind them showing they have efficacy.   But instead he goes out into completely unproven territory pushing products with almost no literature behind them. That bothers me. Especially when he is in fact a doctor and is supposed to be a man of science. Instead he is just a quack.   Not at that kind of party :)   The part that bothers me the most is, if confronted with evidence that this does happen, many women respond with "well now you understand what women go through." Nothing like victimizing and illegitimizing a victim.    Puss puss pass?   At that price level. It starts to become worth it at 5k or higher so long as it is pretty cut and dry (which this sounds like)  	145

 I'll be sure to check it out, thanks for the info!      I am 23 and my parents still do not fail to go out of their way and say Santa needs our Christmas list instead of just telling us they will get it themselves. They use Santa whenever the topic is brought up.    So as for the self-starting portion, because I seem to find this a problem with starting positions in the work industry as a whole, will you actually know your daily tasks that you must carry out without direct instructions? Or are you supposed to jump right into a task based on your own instinct? I guess it depends on the supervisor, like you said there are some good and bad ones.    I try and limit myself to that first shot after dinner. That second one always calls my name.    Shit, that was honestly the first thing that came to my mind    Discrimination against filing cabinets and their orientation is so sad to see.    This isn't a shower thought it's an opinion. Yes, Christians believe that they are solely responsible for the death of Jesus Christ without ever even have being around at the time. But that doesn't make them responsible now if he were to appear, that thought is beyond comprehension. There would be no Christianity without Christ. So it doesn't make sense to begin with. Second, people judging based off of skin color, if you've ever been to Israel most Israelis are a white skin tone or a middle eastern mix which resembles a Caucasian. Everyone else is a tourist. It's an uneducated guess, like most stabs at religion. The only reason why it got so much popularity is because 90% of users seem to lean towards an atheist bias.   I, /u/train_subject8250, accept that I am, as a Purple, superior to all other colors because of my Button-granted right. In addition, I accept the Hierarchy of Purple and swear that my ultimate goal is to allow The Timer to reach Zero.  Through all means, prove supremacy. Hail the Violet Hand.  I have been a 60s since the first day or so of The Button's arrival. I was lost and unknowing of my place for a long, long time. I am happy to finally find somewhere that accepts me for who I am. I am ready to serve and open to guidance. Hail the Violet Hand.   That's a great way of looking at it, I've never thought about it that way. Thank you!     	11

 Perfect reply   So blame Florida   -You need health care or you will die.   -But I don't make enough money to pay that monthly premium or let alone come up with the money for that insane deductible.  -fine, I'll just fine you every year until you sign up and start coming up with money you don't have which I created out of thin air.    In addition, it's sad to say, young voters have a low turn out rate for mid term elections. By 2016, more old people will die, more young people will integrate into society (18 yr olds).

 Damn lucky. I wish something like that was in Phoenix (or literally anywhere in AZ). I checked on ebay and they're going from $90-$800. Anybody know of any other options for someone to get a copy? A past time of mine is to chill and look at look books(I recommend the free Vans look books you can get at the Vans stores). Any clever ideas?? Any high quality scans? High quality printer shops? If somebody reads this and has any ideas where I can get stuff like this, I would love you. 3 thanks fam  edit: I might even want to compile high quality scans of look books for people to DL. Print media is awesome.

NOSFERATU   It makes me frustrated that there's such an emphasis on the NSFW for language...   Why does everyone hate Cruel Summer??   All the decorations in my room. They're all kinda shitty and cheap, but I accumulate a lot of memories over the years. For example, I have a samurai sword that's falling apart. My brother gave it to me when I left to college, and I kept it on display at my dorm.   I got really stoned once and watched Breakfast at Tiffany's for the first time and I thought it was so cool I immediately went out and bought a big poster of Audrey Hepburn. I moved back home and I still have it above my bed, even though my family gives me strange looks.    Happier.   MBDTF, Cruel Summer, College Dropout, Yeezus, WTT, 808s, Late Registration, Graduation  i really like cruel summer...  seems like it's pretty clear that everyone thinks MBDTF is a masterpiece.

If the clerk's office had another person that would issue the license there all the time, that would be fine. But that is not the case. These people are being told they have to go to another county. As long as the service is provided, then it would be up to the office there to decide if they want to keep her. But many places are not going to hire two people to do the job of one.  And with the McDonald's analogy, if the employer wanted to hire someone knowing that they would just do fries, that would be up to the employer. Not the employee.   I have no room to talk. I'm trying to work up the balls to do this myself. I just see your week as an enormous accomplishment. I am jealous. I would hate to see it go to waste.    Having just one cig will hurt more than any other cigarette you will ever have. Man i am so envious of you quitting for a week.

They may already be doing it. :O   This lady is the only one in that entire county that performs that duty. If she can't deliver to 10% of the population due to religious beliefs, then they either have to get another person that does, or replace her altogether.   But even so, as a liberal, I do not agree with the headscarf thing. A company should have the right to dictate the uniform.      If your religion forbids it then it up to you to do what it takes to comply.

If your religion doesn't let you, then you need to get another job.   Then he needs to get a different job too. Don't see any religious obstacles in the laundry department.   They do the same with the constitution, the bible, and states rights. Only when it suits them.    Trump on Mexican immigrants: "They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.

Currently we have a family, one that is very dear to me and I will vouch for wholehearted. Actually it is one of my long time mods who has helped hundreds of others. The husband and wife worked at the same place and long story short they lost their jobs due to a very unruly owner.  The two have both found new jobs in Biddeford. They start Friday. They have packed up all their belongings and are currently in Vermont heading that way. But they have no place to stay. I have found arrangements for them and their four girls, and two small dogs as of July 7th. But they need a place to stay until then. Even someone's backyard.   They start their new life but need help with a place to stay for the week so they can go to work. The last thing we want is for them to screw up on the new job. It was a magnificent break for them both to get jobs there.  Again these are good people and they just need to get through this tough time. For now, all we need is place for them to stay this next week. Maybe somewhere in Biddeford, Alfred, or Saco.  They really need your help. Please open your hearts and help me help them. I personally guarantee they are a good honest family. I am lucky to call them friends.    The GOP may be regretting a lot of things. We can only hope.

Yes. Have you watched MSNBC lately? Rachel does stuff on him every night. He gets way more coverage than Hillary. The same on the Huffington Post. With some 20 declared candidates and a plethora of those who  soon will, Bernie gets the most coverage out of all of them.   real clear bias  Boy that website sure has gone downhill.   Bernie is getting plenty of coverage. More so than almost any other candidate. This whining about coverage is getting old. It also is not true.   He didn't lose it. In fact he kind of fucks with the director. It was quite humorous.   *Post removed*   Your post has been removed because you have failed to register.

 Me there a month ago. I actually stood on that set. Here is that photo but you can see a lot more. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151883610634208 set=pb.834289207.-2207520000.1379889721. type=3 theater   If people ain't seen it, they ain't seen it.      Happy Birthday too us Mister Crash Bandicoot.   She was really pleasant to talk too despite her day off and was happy to take a picture. You'd be surprised actually, another 6 people recognised her when she was walking away.    It is indeed.   She is actually filming outside of Dubrovnik at the moment so could be filming anything anywhere ;)   While her physique gave us the clue, I recognised her by the scar on her lip while walking alongside her.   Thank you, one of my all time favorite albums is in fact absolution.   I bet you are right and I have only been too one place so far.  	10
 Try a telescopic pole from Home Depot or something. Pretty much the same price and you get something lighter and longer than a broomstick.  Definitely going to need a shock mount of some kind or you are going to get mad handling noise!   The I/O setup is great! It definitely looks like they heard the complaints about Audio input for the other cameras. No meters and all that. Now they have huge meters and you can see the waveform, I'll be able to check levels on camera from across set, or from a plane.   Crazy, but awesome.    I started on the 744t and it is awesome. But it has some limitations . For starters, you need to pair it with a field mixer like like the 442 or 552 in order for it to be really useful. And the end result is a 4-track recorder.  Where as the 664 is a Mixer with a built in recorder. It still has timecode, it has a much quicker UI and a lot more Input and Output settings. It is shipped as a 6 track recorder but with a newer firmware update, is capable of having 12 iso tracks, which is amazing for the price.  I find it to be a lot more User friendly than the 700 series Sound Devices. And compared to a 744t/552 package is it cheaper and has more iso tracks.  One of the downsides is it is powered by 5 AA batteries that last all of about 1.5hr. But that is because AAs are only there to play backup to your external power, like a battery distribution kit.   All together, the 744t running off the Sony rechargables will probably put you at a $5000. And the 664t with the very necessary battery distro pack would put you at about $5200. It is a much better deal.    Definitely one of the reasons H4ns are prosumer. But for a lot of people on this form they only budget a few hundred for sound equipment and the Tascam and h4n are their best bets.   I'm running a Sound Devices 664, but that is a whole other level of investing haha  	4
    It was more or less improvised. But not that complicated at all: cook the sushi rice (add some sugar, rice vinegar, salt) and let it chill. Meanwhile cut all the other ingredients in little cubes and add a egg yolk. Then add the rice, form little balls (if you like put in the middle of some of them a little piece of feta cheese) and roll them in  a mix of flour, starch and sesame und deepfry them until they have a nice colour.    Deepfried sushi rice balls with salmon, feta cheese,cucumber, parsley, chive, lime juice, lime zest, sojasauce, sugar, tomatoes, shallots, avocados and roasted sesame coating.  	3

 Try not to read this entire thread in a Scottish accent, I dare ye!      Excellent, thanks!   Your [job](http://imgur.com/jaYuobN), should you choose to accept it.   Although I was only two years old when this happened, I just want to say, as an American, that I'm sorry for what my government did to your people.   Could you give that in [Wales Units](http://www.sizeofwales.org.uk), please?      My bad.  I'll try to remember that.      Came here to say this.  It wasn't a mistake, it was a crime.   Extra points for noticing the difference between the * on your keyboard and the one on your phone :)      Leaving the hospital with my daughter after she was born.  My wife and I just kind of looked at each-other wondering: "Are they really going to just let us walk out of here with this infant?  Don't they know we have no fucking idea what we're doing?"  Granted we were in our 30s, but it was still pretty scary.   So, I was the guy who yelled out, "Is anyone here a doctor!?!".  I was with my mom and kids at the Topsfield fair, and she started feeling faint and sat down.  She had a bit of water, but I could tell she wasn't recovering.  We were actually sitting next to a kids' sing-a-long, so it was pretty noisy.  She slouched off the picnic table and I caught her and, I actually remember being a little embarrassed to start yelling, but I did.  There was a doctor and a nurse in the crowd who came to help, then the paramedics.  Turned out to be heat stroke, and she was ok, but it was scary, and it definitely felt weird to be yelling that out in a crowd.      OH COME ON!  WAKE UP SHEEPLE!  RICHARD C.

Another fun event sponsored by the R.O.P.  Just like all those Mormons who rioted over The Book of Mormon, and the Jews who burned embassies over Egypt's broadcast of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, oh, wait ...            I think I'd rather talk about who the fuck brings a six year old girl to a Dark Knight movie.  I know it's tragic, but what the hell?   I'm sorry, but what exactly do you expect when you name your daughter after a state?   AMA Request: The fucking stupid 18 year old son who racked up $15K in credit card debt.      Fair enough, but what I think of is the difference between code that's efficient and robust enough to still work after 35 years, 10 billion miles away, compared to 99% of the crap that we write today, that will generally be thrown out and rewritten in 5 years.  By way of analogy, think of the Roman aqueducts which still stand today, compared to bridges built in the last 100 years which are already falling down and in need of repair.   Question: What kind of computers are used on the Voyager spacecraft?   Answer: There are three different computer types on the Voyager spacecraft and there are two of each kind. Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K.   Computer Command System (CCS) - 18-bit word, interrupt type processors (2) with 4096 words each of plated wire, non-volatile memory.   Flight Data System (FDS) - 16-bit word machine (2) with modular memories and 8198 words each   Attitude and Articulation Control System (AACS) - 18-bit word machines (2) with 4096 words each.   According to my calulations, that's a total of about 68KB, or small potatoes compared to today's microprocessors. We probably could perform all functions with one of today's boards and still have room for solid state data storage and much more fault detection software. We would still need a second unit for redundancy. Today's microprocessors are also much faster than the chips used on Voyager and a comparative system would use less electrical power. On the other hand, software might be more complicated as opposed to that used in an interrupt type system, but it would be much more capable and more flexible.   Let's look closer at the CCS. The CCS has two main functions: to carry out instructions from the ground to operate the spacecraft, and to be alert for a problem or malfunction and respond to it. Two identical 4096- word memories contain both fixed routines (about 2800 words) and a variable section (about 1290 words) for changing science sequences. The CCS issues commands to the AACS for movement of the scan platform or spacecraft maneuvers; to the FDS for changes in instrument configurations or telemetry rates and to numerous other subsystems within the spacecraft for specific actions. Fault-protection algorithms are also stored in the CCS, occupying roughly 10 percent of the CCS memory.   The main functions of the FDS are to collect data from, and controls the operations of, the scientific instruments; and to format engineering and science data for on-board storage and/or real-time transmission. The FDS also keeps the spacecraft "time" and provides frequency references to the instruments and other spacecraft subsystems.   The Voyager spacecraft computers are interrupt driven computer, similar to processors used in general purpose computers with a few special instructions for increased efficiency. The programming is a form of assembly language.   There is no clock chip, as such, in the spacecraft. The "clock" is really a counter, based on one of several electronically generated frequencies. These frequencies, based on a reference, generated by a very stable oscillator, are converted and fed to different locations in the spacecraft as synchronization signals, timers, counters, etc. The "clock" signal is part of the information telemetered to the ground and it is with ground software that we convert to day of year, time of day Greenwich Mean Time.   Voyager was built in-house at JPL; the computers were manufactured by General Electric to JPL specifications.

Their Leader - Aragath Brighteye - had a bad dream one night and based his whole terror act on that.  Of course, if they succeed, we'll be extinct. If they don't.. Well, We gotta be careful in that spaceship of ours.  I don't think they'd do anything to the rest of the Galaxy, but I wouldn't put it past that twisted freak to change his "vision"   I guess so. I mean, I've not even heard of that conflict.  All I know is, the Iskaldi think we're going to fuck the Galaxy up something fierce - so they're trying to stop us, either by isolating us to the planet, or by killing us all.  Evacuation plans are almost finished and we're in the last weeks of preparation, they're desperate and some fucknut in the Council left their access codes to the radioactive waste dumping ground. There's enough material in there to wipe us out ten times over. It's a race to get us off the planet before they find it.

I live in Manchester - where Karl is from. It's amazing when people say "What did he say?" and I understood him perfectly.   We, the Feln are a Race of peoples living on our planet - Luetem. We're in the Itern system.  Our Galaxy - Lomia - is the nearest neighbour of the Andromeda.  We're a - well, the humans said this, anyway - Feline-like race. Our legs are Digitigrade. Naturally curious, our technology evolved quickly. The Humans were surprised when our Recorded history was "only" 5,000 SUY old. It apparently took them around 10,000 SUY to even begin deep space exploration.  I mean, That's the Gist of it. I could probably go find a Scholar or something and they'll lecture you on what it _means_ to be a Feln or what have you. Boring stuff.   As one of their fellow countrymen, make sure they end up with a cone, or something similar on his head. Otherwise that night just didn't happen.  Seriously though. Drunk brits are either massive cunts, or giggly dunken messes. Make sure they go to bed!  [](/berryparty "A happy hungover person was one who woke up in bed!")   1. If it comes up in conversation, I'll say "Yeah, I'm Asexual". Though I have an Asexy bumper sticker. :D  2. Not that I can recall, I've never "wanted" to have sex and all that, just after getting to know some people "Hey, she'd be pretty cool to sit on the sofa and cuddle with"  3. Yes and no.. Sometimes I'll get the urge, It's a very tiny urge, easily ignorable. A few minutes and it goes away, nothing I'd act upon, even in a relationship.  4. If you call "Cuddling on the sofa and maybe eating ice cream" a sexual fantasy, go for it!  5. Intimacy is kind of important, but not a deal breaker, One of my favourite things to do when I used to hang out with my ex (We split for distance..) was just cuddle on the sofa.  [](/twismile "I Mean, who'd pass on snuggling on the sofa?!")   UK Here - I don't even remember _having_ sex ed lessons. Reproduction in humans came up in Biology, so that counts, right?

As for "Coming out", unless they're really getting on your case about grandkids (Like mine were), I can't really see them caring. I mean - so what if you don't like doing the deed?

Anyway, we use a databasing software, which is limited to a set number of open process. We wandered off for a quick meeting about the upcoming influx of Windows 8 machines we will be using to train our customers.  Anyhow, we come back, and our hero's computer [We'll call her Jane] was having a minor freakout. (I just bailed right to my desk on the other side of the room)  "[train_subject8542]! My computer's spazzing out, I've got like a bazillion copies of Customer Enquiry open! I've got an e-mail from [Network Dude] asking me to stop opening them, no-one can uses Axis!"

I forgot how long I was sat there clicking "Cancel" and "End process" But we were all laughing about it the entire time.   We had an in-joke, and it just got reinforced.   Nope, all of mine do.

TL;DR: *YOU LAZY FUCKS*  CAUSE I'M IN TOO DEEP, AND I'M TRYING TO KEEP,  UP ABOVE IN MY HEAD, INSTEAD OF GOING UNDER.    Not entirely sure, but my reasoning is the "flat" is all on one floor. Some flats are in converted houses, some are in high-rises. I think Apartments might be reserved for the high-price range stuff.   I drive to Manchester sometimes and I see "apartments for sale" signs, but driving through my hometown, there's "Flats to Let" above shops and in house windows.

I was bit on the lip by a dog when I was young. 10 stitches in my lip.   https://krystalrock.com      That tick's like, "Ohhhhhh fuck yeah..."   Winter is here.   In the pacific northwest, there's a small, harmless snake (the garter snake) with a wide ranging diet. One particular population preys mostly upon newts, the catch being that these newts contain tetrodotoxin (apparently aquired from bacteria; the same chemical is the toxin in pufferfish). As a result of their prey's super-potent nerve toxin, the snakes have evolutionarily modified the sodium channels in their nerves to be less responsive to that toxin (which has had secondary effects of decreasing nerve performance). Of course, this set up an evolutionary arms race, with more toxic newts evolving, which lead to more resistant snakes, which lead to more toxic newts, etc.   However, tetrodoxin takes a while to break down. It disappears fairly fast from most of the snake's tissues, except for their livers, which it accumulates in large quantities for long periods of time. This has the potential effect of making these snakes toxic to many of their native predators, especially birds. Other species do this too (dart frogs actually get their poison from ants and beetles), so it's technically truly a poisonous snake.   I was on a SW flight landing at Midway during winter. We had to pull up about 50 feet from the ground because a snowplow was on the runway.   I heard somewhere those can take off vertically.   TIL they are still making Rock Band games.   Yeah, the poor bastard who cleans the bathrooms.   Oh, good. Looks like some bullet holes shot under where the door latch is, too.   Too cheap to spring for a fleshlight, eh?   Were the chicken wings moldy? Might be some squatters living in it.   /r/animalid or /r/whatisthisthing might help too.   I said it looked poisonous because its head looks to be triangular, like a viper. Perhaps a water moccasin?   It's like the fruit version of the Scorpions album Blackout.   That snake looks poisonous.   Da pussies have dicks.   It ain't easy being cheesy.   Again with the vertical takeoff thing...   I read somewhere an A380 tire costs about $92,000.

After dealing with a few snags, it finally came time to do a title transfer from the dealer to myself, but with my mother as the cosigner on the car. The Leon County tax collectors required an original signature, but seeing as my family lives on a Navy Base in Italy, that process would take a couple of weeks to resolve. My parents are getting a power of attorney for me to complete any transactions requiring her signature be on the actual title, but seeing as how even priority mail might not get here for at least a week, would a photocopy of the POA provided by Naval Legal suffice for a title transfer into my name?  **TLDR: Is a photocopy of a military power of attorney viable in Florida until the actual document arrives about a week later?**   I somehow knew that this exact gif would be here.

 The answer is a resounding 'maybe'.   Like so many science things, there isn't yet a clear answer...but it does appear that, under certain conditions (like dehydration), the urothelial cells that line the bladder can express "aquaporins". Aquaporins are essentially pores in the cell wall that allow movement of water across a cell membrane. These are the same kind of pores that are in the renal tubules to allow reabsorption of water in the kidney.   But, a lot of the work examining this is in cultured human urothelial cells, and bladders from rodents. More work needs to be done to see when and if these aquaporins contribute significantly to water or sodium reabsorption from the bladder. Truly, there has been a lot of interest lately in the role of the urothelium in regulating bladder function, and it appears that it isn't just a barrier that's impervious to urine like we originally thought.    --  SOURCE(S): I research bladder function for a living; that and [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).   This is taken directly from [rediopaedia.org](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/endometrial-thickness), a site designed to assist radiologists and ultrasound technicians:  In premenopausal patients, there is significant variation at different stages of the menstrual cycle.  * during menstruation 1,4: 2-4 mm * early proliferative phase (day 6-14): 5-7 mm * late proliferative-pre ovulatory phase: up to 11 mm * secretory phase: 7-16 mm * following dilatation and curettage or spontaneous abortion: 5 mm, if it is thicker consider retained products of conception.      Lyme disease? I can't imagine that any physician or hospital ethics board would let someone be put in a medically-induced coma for Lyme  disease...but I could be wrong.  The protocol was designed for Rabies treatment of patients who did not receive the Rabies vaccine in time. Rabies is an awful, awful disease that is nearly always fatal if untreated; thus why this experimental protocol was devised.  The theory (as I understand it) behind the protocol is that since Rabies super-excites certain receptors in neurons in the brain (NMDA receptors) to cause peripheral nervous system hyperactivity and death, if you were to induce a coma by blocking NMDA receptors with something like ketamine, you could prevent the autonomic dysfunction that usually leads to death and buy the patient enough time to mount an immune response against the disease. The coma also allows doctors to manage other effects of Rabies (vasospasm, sodium depletion, dehydration, etc.) carefully and continuously since the disease progression is slowed, and administer drugs to get the immune system going and/or antiviral meds.  Success still isn't terribly high (8% from a quick glance), but I guess that's better than the near-100% fatality rate expected without treatment at all.  I can't find anyone using it to treat Lyme; if you can send a link to something about that, I will try to decipher why on earth this might work for that disease...but it doesn't seem to make a ton of sense outside of Rabies.   	4
       Host Europe wants to make clear that we will not tolerate any form of illegal right-wing extremist content and we explicitly distance ourselves from this.  Seems to mean that they view Voat as a site full of Neo Nazis and they don't want to have anything to do with a site that would tolerate that bullshit.   And to be honest, they made the right decision.                  "Gov't" I haven't seen literally anyone spell government that way outside of Conservative blogs...  The real reason is that they don't know how spell the word "government".   And they can't figure out how to use the spell check feature of their word processor of choice.          I just get pissed off when people try and say how much honor Lee had because he thought he needed to defend Virgina because it voted to secede from the Union.    It's total bullshit excuses that parents don't accept from their child.   "I had to smoke, Mommy.  All the kids are doing it".    Just because one puts on a military uniform and plays marching band music doesn't mean your excuse for turning traitor makes sense.  Just makes you a stuck-up self-important idiot.     Another southerner who was loyal in the Civil War was Montgomery C. Meigs from Georgia.   He was the guy who decided to place the new National Cemetery on the Union Occupied estate that was then owned by Robert E. Lee.   The one we now consider the hollowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery.    Meigs remained loyal to the Union and he was rightly pissed off that Robert E. Lee had turned traitor.              As a Comp Sci project, it's sort of an interesting thing for them to do.   But if you want to user reddit, just using Reddit makes the most sense.    Add in all the free-speech in all situations people who defend death threats and child porn.... and it's just a recipe for disaster.                             I listened to him on a interview of him on podcast once where he used the phrase "I'm as much of a feminist as a man can be as still retain a penis".     So he doesn't even try and run from the description.    He fully embraces it.     People could only be surprised by his being very liberal because they are stupid.   Next up they will all write angry letters to the editor and blog posts demanding to know when water was made wet by the evil government.                 I have approved this AMA.

[](/yes)      [](/yes)   To the point that anyone who took up arms with the Confederates was required to re-swear Allegiance to the United States if they wanted to hold public office after the Civil War.     All the other reasons for the Civil War that you can come up with all lead back to Slavery.    The Southern Agrarian Economy.... based on slavery.    Tax issues.   Based on funds raised by working slaves on Southern Plantations.    Trade issues.... around crops that were farmed by slave labor.    States rights.... to own human beings as if they were farm animals.    Not a one of those other issues does not lead directly back to slavery.    There is no other issue involved in the US Civil War.  It's 1all 100% of it about slavery.    Every other issue in relation to the causes of that war is actually the slavery issue in disguise.     They believed in so much freedom that the one freedom that was totally and forever to be banned by the Confederate Constitution was that Slavery could never be banned.  The one and only state right that they were totally fighting for was itself to be limited from the very beginning.   Slavery was to be a forever pact of the Southern States that seceded.    Advocating for change on that front was to be banned forever and ever.  Plus a few more years.  They considered slavery so important that they really drove it home in their treasonous rewrite of the Constitution.

 Try looking into some of Corsairs less expensive cases, specifically their Carbide Series models. They do an amazing job of providing some really nice features such as 2x120mm(140mm) mounts for double-wide radiators, cable management, and other small things in there more budget friendly cases. I have two 400R's ($100) and a SPEC-03 ($60) that are fantastic.   Also, NZXT cases are really nice for reasonable prices. I love the LED's above the I/O panel... such a great idea!   Ohhh! Thanks for this... Vivaldi looks pretty!  Since I'm lazy, care to share the TL;DR on why it's awesome?   Not to be *that* guy, but the few times IE11 crashed on me, it reopens in like half a second with all my tabs intact and functioning. Also, IE11 creates a separate process for each tab which was the big appeal to Chrome in the first place. FYI, I'm using Windows 10, build 9926.   Looking for some advice!  Budget - $100-$200 (flexiblish)  Source - Phone (Lumia Icon), Computer (DTS support), homemade headphone AMP, and possibly my receiver/pre-amp  Isolation - Not an area of concern. I most definitely do not want active noise-cancelling.   Preferred Type of Headphone - I'm looking for circumaural as I have a large head and supra aural tend to cause discomfort over time.  Preferred tonal balance - I generally like a neutral/flat tone, but appreciate solid midrange performance. Overly bright headphones would be a turn-off  Past headphones - These would be replacing a cheap pair of HD428s. I also have a pair of Shure SE215-K IEM and Astro A40 w/ Mixamp for gaming.   Preferred Music - I'm all over the place. Classical/orchestral, rock, folk, electronic, etc. These would also be used occasionally for gaming (I would be giving away the A40's), and possibly occasional home theater use.  My biggest issue in picking out the right pair, is how versatile I want them to be. I realize that there is not going to be an ideal set to fit all of my requirements, but I'm curious as to what /r/headphones has to say! I would be using these for travel, on-the-go, and at home. They will be used for 70% music, 20% gaming, and 10% movies.  Also, I can get Vmoda M-100's for half off ($150). I understand they are bass heavy, but I appreciate that they are full-size and are still portable, although this is not a requirement as I was happy to tote my HD428s's around when needed.  Thanks!        More expensive than $5, but there are VESA mountable Pi cases that use your existing VESA holes on your TV, assuming it's not using them already :P   You're very welcome! Glad its your card rather than the motherboard or worse. Good luck!   I've worked a lot with the Steam series (7,8,11,13, and 14). The 7 and 8 area great for the price; a device running FULL windows that the Microsoft Store has on sale for $70 all the time... WOW. The laptop variants (11,13,14), although budget models, actually have really good build quality. The keyboard has very little flex and the keys feel nice, the plastic is solid and doesn't feel flimsy at all. My biggest caveat is the screen is noticeably low quality, but it works! Also, the addition of the SD card slot makes the local storage issue go away. For the price, they are definitely a Chromebook killer.      Serious question...Have you used Linux before? If not, it may not be the solution you're looking for as it can be substantially more technically challenging to do simple things, much more difficult than creating a boot disk.   As /u/cuddlychops06 mentioned, it sounds like you may have a failing hard drive, and it's not a Windows issue at all. It can be difficult to discern between software and hardware issues, especially without seeing the computer in person, but every symptom you have described could be caused by a failing hard drive. (FYI, hard drives are the most common hardware to fail)  What brand computer do you have? Many HP's and Dell's have built in hardware scans you can try to run. Also, do you have access to another PC? If so, we could walk you through creating boot media on that PC to repair the one in question.   Some boot media tips:  -You have to copy the CONTENTS of the .ISO, not the file itself, or it wont be bootable.  -If you're using a USB flash drive, you have to format it to FAT32 to boot properly.   -Depending on your PC, you may have to disable "Secure Boot" and enable "Legacy" or "CSM" to get the PC to boot to the disk or USB drive.    If your motherboard has video out, try removing your graphics card and see how it looks then. If everything is normal, you know its your card. It is strange that if works okay in Safe Mode, but it could be because its drawing less power.   Also, I would make sure your PSU is 100% dry. If something in that goes it could fry everything in your case and even possibly start a fire. If this were to happen again, I would dismantle the entire PC including motherboard, use canned air on any of the affected parts to blow out any water, and let the components sit for 72 hours. The patience could potentially save you some money :P   Unfortunately, you cannot use the laptops screen as a second monitor for the desktop. The ports on the laptop are output only.   You would have to use the laptop as the computer and connect the extra monitor with the VGA cable. If you really wanted to use the desktop and weren't too picky about a monitor, you can get fairly cheap monitors off craigslist.  Good luck!   Totally agree. I work IT and when dealing with clients who are not tech savvy, the larger number is always better in their mind, despite explaining the huge advantage of an SSD, even if it has less storage.   My personal theory is that LOTS of consumers don't understand the difference and see a $300 PC that has a 2.0GHZ Celeron, 4GB RAM, and a 500GB HDD and see it as a better value than a $600 2.0GHz i5, 4GB RAM, and a 128GB SSD. They see the processors as the same, the RAM is the same, and one has way more storage.   There are 3 main things to use to prevent this in the future:  -Better surfing/downloading habits  -Only ONE on-access scanner  -Several on-demand scanners/tools    **Safe Surfing:** As far as better surfing/downloading habits, you just have to be careful on what you click. There is no combination of antivirus or software that can 100% protect you from malware, otherwise an entire industry would be out of business. Some solid "safe surfing tips:  -Install Adblock Plus on all the browsers you have. This helps with preventing fake links and pop-ups from even appearing.  -If you're installing software, always try to get it from the manufacturers or developers website. It is less likely to have 'extra' software.  -When installing software, instead of blindly clicking "Next" or "Okay", make sure you aren't agreeing to install extras. An example would be Java always tries to get the Ask Toolbar installed.  -Before clicking on a sketchy link, hover over it. Depending on what browser you're using, it generally tells you at the bottom of the screen the actual address of where it will take you. If you're still not sure, a quick search should reveal whether or not it should be trusted.   **On-Access Scanner:** This is your general antivirus program. It attempts to scan all the incoming and outgoing network traffic on your computer to prevent bad things from coming in. They also offer system scans to check everything on your PC for malware. The problem with almost ALL of these scanners is that they do a bad job detecting low-level malware (ads, pop-ups, fake fix-it programs,etc), but rather try to stop the really bad stuff that would render your computer useless or worse. There are two main kinds: Free and paid subscription. To avoid opening a can of worms as to which anti-virus is best, I'll just list several popular ones. Please note that you should only have ONE of these installed at a time, or they basically fight with each other (and exception would be Defender which cannot be uninstalled and will automatically disable itself). My disclaimer for this is that I feel most on-access AV programs perform very similarly and it's really a toss-up as to which is definitively the best. For subscription/paid software, check www.dealnews.com in the software section and every once in a while you'll find it free with a rebate.   Free: Windows Defender (its already in Windows 8), AVG, Avast, Avira, Bitdefender, Panda, and Comodo. There are many more, but these are probably the most popular. With the exception of Defender, they all come in paid versions as well.  Paid: Norton, McAfee, Trend Micro, Kaspersky, and Webroot are amongst the most popular. Some offer different kinds of subscription and protection, but the general consumer version should suffice.   **On-Demand:** These are the scanners you use to aggressively find and remove malware that is already ON your computer. They do not prevent it. These programs are where the real magic happens when things go south. Unlike on-access scanners, which there should be only one of, I recommend you keep several different on-demand scanners. Some programs are generally good at everything (Malwarebytes), where others only look for specific things (TDSS killer). I'll list some favorites and what they do.  Malwarebytes: Well rounded, very popular scanner. Easy to use and very effective.  Hitman Pro: Only gives you one 30-day trial, but it is an excellent all purpose scanner. There is also a "Kickstart" version which can help systems that have malware blocking you from running normal scanners.  SUPERAntiSpyware: Again, very effective all-round scanner. It does a good job at picking up those fake programs and easily removing them.  ADWCleaner: This doesn't search for "bad" virus's like the other guys, but it is SUPER effective against completely removing adware and a scan takes a few minutes at most. This is a personal favorite.  TDSS Killer: This searches for malware called "rootkits" which can be extremely bad. A scan takes about 30 seconds, but frequently gives false positives (HP software frequently gets picked up, you can tell it to "skip")  Rkill: Doesn't remove anything, but rather kills any running malware that may have been preventing other scanners from running properly. You generally want to run this first.  SFC/DISM: Sometimes, even when all the malware is removed, there is damage that may need repairing. These are built in Windows utilities that can help repair your OS after all the malware is presumably gone. Open up an elevated command prompt (on Windows 8, it's "WinKey+X" then "A". In the black box that appears, type *sfc /scannow*. This System File Checker tool will see if Windows is okay. When it's done it will say that it didn't find anything, it found stuff and repaired it, it found LOTS of stuff and you should restart and run it again, or the most common, It found corruptions, but could not repair them all. If you get this last one, you'll want to run a specific DISM command. In the same black box, type *dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth* and wait for it to finish. You can re-run SFC to double check it fixed everything.  Windows Refresh: If all else fails and you don't want to do a full system reset, you can do a Refresh. This keeps all your files and settings, but removed anything that wasn't originally installed on the PC (it will give you a list of what was removed). This is an excellent fix-all that has a high success rate.   ...but really, just don't click on bad stuff :P    It's really about what you need. They don't even make netbooks anymore because of that.   If you just need to browse the web and do basic word processing, Chromebooks are awesome... that's exactly what they're built for. Comparing a Chromebook to a PC is like a motorcycle compared with a car. They can both get you from point A to B, but still have very different uses.   I agree. Chromebook's have an excellent boot time which is a mix of very lightweight OS and hardware designed to boot fast. That being said the line of HP Streams which go on sale for $200 or less, boot in like 20-30 seconds to a FULL OS.  That said, HDD's are WAY cheaper than SSD's, so it's no surprise that they cost more. Also, there are many value priced PC's now that have SSD's... but they are 32GB or 64GB. I'm kind of hoping that mid to low end PC's start shipping with a 500GB HDD and the ability to add an mSATA SSD, which are way cheaper than a normal 2.5" SSD.   Out of curiosity, why do you think MSE was great and the new Defender is rubbish?  Defender receives all the same updates as MSE and is essentially the same program, just pre-installed and with slightly better system access.   As someone who works IT (both enterprise and for the uninformed masses) Windows 8 Defender is really quite good, especially when comparing to other popular free AV's. I'm not saying it's the best and I'm not saying its perfect; it's far from both. But as a pre-installed and always free/updated AV, its an excellent solution for most.   I can't tell you how many times I see a copy of Norton that expired 3 years ago, or AVG that is constantly popping up asking to give permissions for everything (not counting TONS of false positives). 90% of people that have computers don't know what they're looking at, and that's where the true beauty of Defender comes in... almost everything is done discretely in the background, without annoying warnings or pop-ups. Personally, I think it does a great job against more serious malware. Compared to Windows 7 and prior, I see WAY fewer rogue infections or infections that seriously disable the functionality of the computer since Windows 8 came out. It used to be there was at least one solid virus a year that infected TONS of computers... remember that FBI rogue infection and all the fake AV rogues before that? There hasn't been anything nearly as wide spread since Windows 8 with Defender launched.  Realistically however, all of the common free AV's perform so similarly that it really doesn't matter a ton. Also, you have to consider how widespread UEFI is now and how that effects things. The real magic is done with the on-demand scanners anyway :P   Unfortunately, I think its probably a loss. If it was a core component, those are all soldered to the motherboard, and it wouldn't be cost effective to replace. If it's just the screen, the laptop should still power up like it normally would.  Important questions... Where did you buy it and how long ago?  That would NOT be covered under the manufacturers warranty, BUT you may be able to get away with it since its not obvious how it happened. If you wanna be super shady, you could say that you went to use Skype or something and as soon as your camera turned on *POP*. As someone that used to make warranty decisions, that would seem somewhat feasible to me, although seeing it in person may be different.   Double check that you didn't confuse the GPU and CPU connectors. There is no such thing as a 4-pin GPU connector, they are 6 or 8 pin. CPU power connector is a 4 or 8 pin and there is only one CPU connector on PSU's whereas there can be multiple GPU connectors.   If you plugged a GPU connector into the CPU power port on the MOBO, that would be an issue. That being said, I don't think that it would actually fit.   In all fairness, its probably not the laptop causing it to run poorly. Almost all computers are running identical hardware and identical software; an Intel i3 from Dell is the same i3 from HP. 4GB of 1600Mhz RAM in a Samsung is identical to that of Asus.  The manufacturer (HP, Dell, Asus, etc.) basically figure out cool ways to shove them into smaller chassis and figure out details such as how many USB ports, keyboard and FN key layout, materials to use, etc.  I can take a $200 laptop and have an excellent experience surfing the web, typing documents, and other normal activities. I can also have a miserable experience on a $2000 gaming PC because I clicked on every ad and banner and downloaded tons of malware. Its generally the user that defines the experience, not the computer.   -What price range are you looking at for a production model?   -Did you have an end use use in mind? (e.g. Cosplay, military, exo-skeleton, etc.)   -Your website says that you view this as a connection between art and technology. what demographic do you view as a potential market for this?  -Are all the features you listed, such as the "backdoor system", currently operational and do you have videos?

They ditched the flashy gamer flair, and are now sleek, powerful and surprisingly well built. Many of them look very similar to MacBooks actually, and the new XPS 13 look amazing and doesn't feel at all cheap.   I've always been a huge fan of Asus and I only use Asus motherboard for by personal builds, but many of their laptop, even the high end ones, are starting to feel cheap :/   Xbox One is plug and play with Windows, and has been for a while.   Xbox One controllers just need a microUSB (phone charging) cable and Window 8.1 has the controller drivers pre-loaded :)   Thanks for the suggestions!  I ended up getting him some MDF, small hardwood pieces from Rockler, and a 8" tablet running full Windows 8.1 with homemade stand to run the CNC control panel so he doesn't have to leave his laptop in the basement.   Lol... You said Conduit :P   That's kind of along the line of what I'm thinking. What's a touchscreen kit though?   I was surprised at how well it actually worked. Even with 1080p and 5.1 surround there were no issues. The frustrating part was the dashboard/menus would be quite laggy, but considering the hardware, it was impressive.   I do think that there are better options now, such as the little Atom processor mini-pc's for ~$100. The Pi may be $35, but after you get an SD card, cables, case, Wifi dongle, and flash drive for caching, you're hovering around $85. The mini-pc's are WAAYY better.   Thanks for the link!   I should have mentioned, he's a tool and die designer/machinist by trade, and has an extensive workshop at home.

My only current idea is to build a dust hut with some angle iron and plexiglass. Is this a good/bad idea?   That's a great idea! I have a Nokia Icon with built in Qi capability :)  Thanks for the idea!    	32
 Both. I still have a bunch of Disney movies on VHS. I think teenagers as young as 15/16 would still have had experiences with cassettes and VHS.   Sadly no. Thank you though!    Aw,  shoot!  Really thought it was them for a bit,  but no :(   Unfortunately I tried TOMT already, no luck. Thanks though!   	4
 I thought it was fun and interesting too. Came to me earlier when I was deep into a marathon.   That I know of, only one can was seen near the Land Titanic. Arguably it could have been the only one aboard, hidden away. Which makes sense given how rich some of the passengers were, such as Mr. Astor. But their where also numerous poor and middle-class people, so it doesn't make sense that they would have a supply on board when the fish is already so rare.  Edit: Saw the pic you are referencing, and it is only a single can. Which leans toward my hypothesis.                        The trainers got what they deserved. Though they should've been the ones to die, not the elephant.   Are their any questions left to answer Reddit?    OP's mom lost one of her anal beads.   Nope.   Kanye West being crucified.

 Disturbia    What are your thoughts on the movie Titanic, 18 years later? It was so beloved when it first came out. It's still the second highest grossing movie of all time.

 The neo tokyo remix of this song is one of my all time favorite tunes. (cant link from phone)  Original never dissapoints too though!

Sadly that is the bad part of the city :(   Met bier en Starcraft ben ik al een heel gelukkig man.   Oh wow! very nice to see this happening, I'll be there!   You can keep a close eye on [Ticketswap](www.ticketswap.nl) Its a safe(ish) website where people sell their tickets if they bought one but are not able to go. Other than that you can search for the facebook event, at most concerts there is someone who tries to sell their ticket (mostly last minute though and there is a possibility you get scammed)   Good luck!

This is gold advice (but a bit over the top) you can get a really decend bike for 50-80 euro's (or 10-20 form a junk) and a really good lock for +-40.   also, a bike stealing friend of mine once told me: "if your bike is not attached to something like a post or a rail with its lock, then its not locked"   This is more a question for /r/allthingszerg.

 Black Car. Always burn my arm on the center console when I get in (on sunny days).    Downtown is great, but I have lived in Merriman Valley for 3 years in love it. Great bars, close proximity to downtown(5-10 min), state parks, etc. Like somebody else said though, don't live in Timbertop. Try Pheasant Run or Hampton Knoll.    I don't know about anyone else, but I really miss those Hunter: The Reckoning games on the PS2/XBOX. Some of the best co-op memories I've ever had.    I feel almost exactly the same. Sure there are some things I didn't like about the ending, but that is life. My big thing, which looks to be getting addressed, was the lack of closure. Add in some free DLC for someone who very much likes the multiplayer, and I give Bioware/EA a "thumbs up".  Keep in mind though, I still plan on thoroughly vetting Bioware's next release before I buy. No more preordering every game like I did with DA2 and ME3. To be honest, I still think Dragon Age 2 and EA "pimping out" the Bioware brand gets to me more than ME3 ever did.     May have playable content. I would not read too much into what was said there, as it is neither outright confirmed or denied.    Egwene.    Geez, excuse me for being an idiot. I read that probably 4 times, and thought it said, "You *can't* love your government...".   My fault   I couldn't disagree more. I love this country and I love what it represents, and I feel that the government, as well as the people in control of it (and policy making) are slowly destroying this country. The fact that people even believe a statement like this is proof of that, in my opinion.   EDIT: I'm a moron; misread text.   Am I the only one that thinks it wouldn't have to be 14 movies long? Sure, the first one should be based off of EotW, but after that I imagine they could take out a lot of filler and condense the series into about 7 or so movies. Maybe even less if they decide to leave certain events out completely.    Asshole much? (good job deleting your other posts)   I gave you an example in the post above of as to why, so I will not repeat it here. Also, while I agree that the ending was not good at all and has potentially cost Bioware/EA my business, I find it ironic that you describe my opinion on this matter as a difference in taste. One could argue that for every opinion that people have on the last 5% of Mass Effect 3.   The harsh reality is that many (not all) people attempting to return Mass Effect 3 are scorned fans trying to get back at BioWare/EA any way they can, and looking for ways to make a quick $60 without justification. Much of the way people react to anything BioWare related now, and to other people who don't hold the same beleifs as this sub-reddit, reinforces this. Sadly though and also somewhat ironic, with business being a dog-eat-dog world, this is probably going produce a bigger impact than probably any other protesting method would.   Also, let me just say that I support almost everything else being done to show BioWare/EA our displeasure, and a lot of what they do in the next few weeks will be the deciding factor in whether or not I will ever buy another game from them again.    So is a music CD.   Yes, it is my say, because it's my opinion. Just because you are allowed to ask for you money back doesn't make it the thing to do. I am going to take my box of Raisin Bran back to the store because there wasn't enough raisins in by last bowl of cereal. If I bitch enough, maybe they'll give me my money back. That doesn't make me any less of an asshole though.     Me: Shepard.  Cleverbot: Commander Shepard.  Me: Yes.  Cleverbot:Well, do it.  Me: Do the Shepard?  Cleverbot:I'm doing it, but you can't see me.   I'd probably toss the shit in the guys face, and then demand to speak to the manager. This would most likely result in me getting my money back, but it really doesn't have anything to do with what I mentioned above. A bad ending in a videogame is a lot different than a mouthful of shit. You don't see people returning DVDs for refunds because they didn't like the ending of Lost, or taking back books just because they didn't like the ending.   Generalizations like this are garbage. It's one thing to be upset with a company like Bioware and speak with your wallet, and it's something entirely different when you try to weasel out of paying $60+ for a game you just played the entire way through. I for one, probably won't be buying another BioWare/EA product without first making sure via reviews and customer opinion that the game is actually good. They've lost my trust, and as a company they will have to earn it back. That is how spending money works.    Hoping this is a joke. I still think it is beyond ridiculous to play a game all the way through and then ask for your money back, regardless of how the ending made you feel.    Fuck that. I wanted Aria.   What.the.fuck?   [Dystonia Cheerleader](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ztiAN9k584)  [Walk it out remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qELbA6cKrPc)   I wish some of these were higher res.    I'm almost afraid to post in this thread for fear of getting downvoted. Almost...   I started in late November 2011. Just finished up ToM last week.    So it can't be both?   [Source Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/rcpab/artificial_habitat/)   Mass Effect 2 was not as heavily advertised as 3 was, and Skyrim was released during the holiday season. With more examples, I'd be willing to accept that this was in part due to the endings, but I think this is just conjecture.       Looks kinda like the Citadel in Mass Effect   Your choices are reflected throughout the entire 3rd game sans the last 5 minutes. That doesn't mean you wont get a completely unique experience for the first 25 hours. In fact, its been proven you will.   Its kind of ironic that everyone is talking about how much better the ending would be with this stuff when almost every line of dialog was in the game.    Good thing Mass Effect 3 isn't a bad game. This is kinda getting out of hand.    You can't really mirror what the player is going through because each player is going to handle the situation differently.    In my opinion, creating brand new endings would be a disservice to everyone, especially the people that don't mind the current ending. I still think we should get more closure, and perhaps have some of the storylines that we followed throughout the series wrapped up, but completely re-writing the ending because a large portion of the gaming community doesn't agree with it isn't the answer.   IMO, re-writing the endings would be the equivalent of taking a toy from one kid and giving it to the another that's crying because he doesn't have it (I am by no means saying that anyone is crying, just an analogy). I would rather see compromise.    You explained my sentiment exactly.    To be fair, anything that involves one weapon wiping out an entire race of super-beings is going to be space magic.   In all honesty, I think the endings themselves weren't bad at all. The main problem was the lack of content associated with each ending. I am just speaking for myself, but I would be happy if Bioware added about 10-15 minutes of extra, *unique*, content into each ending to allow for a little diversity between playthroughs and to close up to unfinished story beats. This in turn would give them the opportunity to add closure to a lot of the storylines (as well as Renegade/Paragon consequences) that have been progressing throughout the course of the series.    Thanks for the link. I was wondering if I could get larger versions of these images.    I feel comfortable with a sword now, I quite enjoy wielding one. I wouldn't profess to be good in a real life and death situation. Enough to maybe hopefully impress the ladies.  Best line in the interview     Most other have already been mentioned, but I really like the scenes with Mat and Talmanes (also, the Band in general). Also at the very end when Olver opens up the letter from Verin.    I think your description of this moment makes it even better.    [Fight Club](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes)   EDIT: I'm a dumbass, and I thought you were asking where the "His name was Marauder Shields." came from.

I google'd and came up with this:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Sue   I stand corrected. I didn't realize WoT fans were that upset over some of the later books in the series.    is it just me or do most of the one star reviews actually talk about how good the book is?  	45
       My friends live out of town but their family still lives near us, and every 2nd weekend they come down and hang out at ours for Xbox, pizza and drinking. They then sleep over. Adult sleepovers are the best!!   They didn't really cut him out. He just wasn't a kitten   Goddess   "Must kill Snow. Weeeee! Must kill Snow. Weeeee!"   What about that creepy guy who is just standing still in each of your photos, staring...just staring   Not a great site for mobile   It's hard to tell how far inland the water actually goes. Of course they would be mostly under but they do tend to span inland a bit. They might be salvagable. Canberra would be high and dry   Australia gets off pretty lightly! We get an inland sea again   Those ear wiggles!   I wasn't trying to take a stab at salaried workers, sorry for making it seem that way. I just know what it is like to have a shitty (casual) retail job and have to stay back...but I did get paid for that time. If yiu don't get paid for 1 or more hours extra work it must suck. An extra 10 mins though, unpaid can't be so bad though   I think someone didnt like something I said and is downvoting everything. Ahh well. And nahh, Australia   Medical Science, Transplantation.   She is a medical scientist   That does sound like it sucks, and I am not being sarcastic. But it boggles me to think that you would not.be paid for that time. I have worked 7 retail jobs and not one made me work extra and not paid me for it   ...no   Exactly right   I am 4 years in and I am on $72-78k a year depending on call-ins.   We do have a LOT of checks,second checks and safeguards in place.   It isn't logistically or financially possible to have it any other way. A very large number of important decisions are made by tired people...but they are foremost professionals. We know what we are doing...even if we dont know what day of the week it is   Histocompatibility...but close enough. You know what's up   Ok, I will   Specifically, look in to Tissue Typing or Histocompatibility if you want to know what I do   You do get used to it. I was tired but still pretty functional. I have faith in the results I put out. I am, after all, gambling my career on them being correct   We are Med Scientists. On Call at crazy hours is all part of the job. Doctors need results and it ain't machines that give it to them. It is people. The hours are long and hard but we get good $$$   I don't feel like what I said was a complaint. I love my job, I get paid well but the hours are hard sometimes. People who do an easy job with easy hours and complain because they have to stay late with a customer annoy me because they have it easy.  A hard job isn't a horrible job   No one is forcing them to do their jobs either...   We have 2 people on at once to safeguard from errors. No one had died from human errors.  And to answer your question, there is simply no other way   I am required because I am On Call. It is part of the job   I didn't bitch. I love my job. I was trying to prove that the other people complaining dont have it half as bad   Man, I have really stiff coil over suspension...any bump is Mt Everest for me   I had to come into work last night, after working 8 hours, to work for another 10 hours. By the time I got home I had been awake for 27 hours. And the work I do, if you screw up...you could kill someone.  So excuse me if I don't shed a tear for you retail workers who have to work 10 minutes over time because someone needed toilet paper real quick.   Edit: Of course I get paid well for my time. I work hard in uni, worked hard to get where I am and worked hard to get good pay for overtime. I also worked retail when was young. It was easy but I complained about it because I didn't understand what a difficult job was. I was just trying to point out that if a retail job making you stay back 10 mins is the worst thing in the world for you, no matter the pay, then maybe you aren't cut out for a more stressful job   http://imgur.com/IjVFeLW   My husband and I have agreed that we have ruined eachother for any hope of returning to the dating pool and therefore must stay together   I make a massive point of saying "Oh, never mind, I will go somewhere else then" at places like that. Eftpos minimums will cause you to lose my business   I managed to take this photo of [Mike's Dave]( http://i.imgur.com/8Z0piPJ.jpg)  before the guard yelled at me. Does that count?   Lois   SVU   O   As time goes by you come to realise she actually wasn't totally horrible. I hated her as a kid, love her as an adult   My friends and I (2 med scientists, 2 med students and a researcher) all went to see it together. The confused, angry silence that followed was very long. We just couldn't comprehend that much stupid   I had a steak too...with garlic mushroom sauce. Shit yeah.  Edit: Then a 7 hour call in to work. Haven't slept in 28hours!!!!!!$#!$#!   I don't believe in many things, so consider yourself lucky!   As a side note, while I am assuming your name is meant to be "frogger"..I pronounce it "furrgurr" in my head   So what about the people with prams that are really easy to set up? Or people who take the spot when the rest of the carpark is available? Or if they decide not use the pram and instead just decide to carry the baby? Or what about all the mothers who take up all the spots leaving other mothers in the lurch?  The point I am trying to make is unless there are clear rules, enforced and punishable you don't have to do shit. The world doesn't owe you anything because you have a pram.  It's not law. It's nice, but not required   So what if a woman with no children in her car, just the seats or kids without a pram take it up? Are they cunts too?   Just buy a cheap baby seat and chuck it in the back.    I knew you were joking :/   I see it more as a guideline.  It's nice to take another spot if you find one, but I sure as shit am not going to drive around for 1/2 an hour and then park on the street because some parent might show up and want it. As with he case of many parents I see park there, they don't even use a pram! Their kids are walking around. Free game I say   ...I usually am. If it is just a chuckle you get a "hehe" and just a smile will definitely get you a :)   Even if you did it on purpose or not...if they catch you at it you are fault   But that's the point...the park spot thing isn't a rule   I said in another comment somewhere that I would be interested to see the wording on his page. If it says "will go to charity" he is a scumbag. If it says "help with costs associated with treatment and if some is left over, it will go to charity" you can't get too up in arms. It might have been very losely worded   You are totally right...which is why I don't donate unless there is clearly written outlines about where the money is going. Sure a person who lies and pockets the money is a scumbag...but you can't get all in a tizzle if you didn't investigate the "charity" further.   Not being a lawyer, I am interested to know how you can show "intent" through losely worded promises.   It just seems that it would be harder to claim that they were definitely going to donate the money unless it was in writing. Feels like he said, she said.  That's why I thought the wording would be interesting to read. It it clearly says "will go to charity" he hasn't got a leg to stand on   It would be interesting to see what the page actually says. Wording is key   Big big big piece of information you definitely needed to include.  I still say though that unless this was all in writing or clearly laid out in a way that would be usable in legal action I don't know if there is much to be done.   Is a dying wish a binding contract? Idk   Literally, the worst   Oh man, people I don't know being in my front yard is infuriating! Like, people who park out front so they can visit the neighbours...argh! We start mowing our lawn when they do that. They usually come out and move it pretty quickly   I don't see it as stolen if they willingly gave it "for treatment". If she died, she obviously can't get any more treatment but then thar just means the only condition for use of the money is now void. He is under no obligations   [What about this one?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/37lwhm/meet_button_she_is_fluffy/)   Deserve what? Did they give expecting it to come back and benefit them? Or was the money given under the strict stipulations that it be given back if she died?  If my husband died, I might want a holiday too. Losing a loved one is the worst, supportive friends would understand that grieving takes time...and sometimes money   I can't crochet with that sort of racket going on!   Which is funny because I actually do crochet   It is. We really only care about skill and effort in our workplace. Of course, in any workplace it is hard to go off and have kids then expect everything to be exactly the same when you return, but it certainly isn't held against you. Because our industry moves and develops at a very quick pace, most women do need retraining to get the back up to speed, but I certainly haven't been denied training because I am married and of childbearing age. They make do with who they have, when they have them, for as long as they have them   After my mum died the whole town rallied and had a fundraiser for my dad, sister and I. People need to think morr about the living than the dead in times like that. Who knows what kind of debt her illness left him with. What if he relied on her income? She might not have had health insurance.  So the money was for treatment...now it'll be for the funeral costs, medical expenses and helping this dude actually move on with his broken life.   If there was fine print to all those peoples' generosity and he has broken that, then fine....but personally you would have to be heartless to ask for him to give it up   I haven't actually...but the Med Science industry is about 70:30 women to men.

A lot of people pay him out about it when they hear what car it is...until they see it   Some people are awkward around children...especially ones they don't know. I'm the same. I think for him too, there is always the fear that someone will accuse you of being a creep if a man starts talking to a child he doesn't know. Which is terrible, of course   I think it is mostly because what he said didn't really contribute much   [Renault Clio AGP]( http://images-2.drive.com.au/2011/08/06/2540470/renault-clio-rs_320.jpg)  Not really similar to Bumblebee, but I guess all the kid could really tell is that is was yellow      Only the good lies that involve giant robots      I dunno, it seems to me that the best time to make political changes is when it is politically convenient   Every time we had a meal, it was amazing and I found myself looking around trying to find complete strangers I could involve and share how amazing the food was.  Like "look at this baguette! Come here and let me share with you how amazing this baguette is right now!"   Not to her, certainly.    Run!!!   I'll take that   Of course I did. I'm not heartless   I had a friend visit from interstate, and you know those weekends where everything you do goes well and everything you eat is delicious? It was one of those   Part of me feels real bad for the fish guy, but then the other part feels super proud of him for being such a rugged survivor   I really had to downplay it.   "Oh it was pretty good...did a lot of stuff. But...how are you?"  ...until I found someone else who wasn't such a downer and I could have a humble-brag to.    Yeah, but that is actually a *person* typing those words. Imagine knowing them in real life. I can't comprehend how much of an asshole they would be      And here I was just assuming I was actually a boy this whole time!      Berfect!!

It is totally healthy and normal too   the insult, "bitch"   I did some light sleuthing and the insult, "bitch" has been in our language since the 14th-15th century. Does that work in this timeline?   "Yep, I'm a genius"   Hindsight, of course, teaches us many things, especially the consequences of bad decisions. But the point I was trying to make (and other people in the thread) is that it should have been clear to her that Sydney Road is way too busy to use a child's trailer on. I didn't call her a bad parent and I didn't say she deserved it, I just said it was a fair statement to make.   Of course, saying that she shouldn't have been on Sydney Rd doesn't help her now, but it is what people are thinking. Maybe if she was thinking to do it again, or someone else, the reaction here might convince them to reconsider that choice.   I don't understand the point of that argument   She's a tough flower, our Gilly   Dat double chin tho   ...if he drove off and left her, who knows what they were thinking   Because if I do something unsafe in a place where unsafe things can lead to accidents, then I must take some of the blame.  But I do something safe, such as wear a miniskirt and some douche decides to rape me on purpose, then I cannot be blamed.  A rape victim can't change her actions to disuade a rapist...rapists gonna rape. She can't be blamed because he is a horrible POS.  Do you see women in dark alleys and think to yourself "What a stupid woman walking around here...I might rape her"?    Yes, because the two senarios are totally comparable  s/   Good...gather them all in one spot. Easier to get them all at once   Ok now you are just being silly   I read once that rape victims enjoy rape fantasies because this time *they* are in control. They call the shots, they know how much they want or don't want. It is all about putting the power back in their hands.  To feel emotional about real rape is completely normal in the same instance. It isn't fun when it's real   Of course the driver was in the wrong, but it is a fair statement to say that a bike trailer is probably not a good idea on a very busy road   And Barry White to gently croon to you as you make love to your SO   I went out with my dad and his friend last saturday to a bar and they ordered cocktails.

 I can't take credit for the video, I just came across it the other day.   Damn those trucks are riding low   Anyone else like the board shape a lot?      He still couldve been injured. He landed on the bike so he'll be kinda cut up and have some awkward bruises for a bit.   Haha I still can't figure out of he's a cop or of he just wanted to join in    Daaaaaaaaamnnnnnn that's a lo. Did it fuck with your sleep at all? I can't sleep if I take mine after 1pm so I can't imagine what a 200mg redose would do to my sleep schedule   It doesn't turn at all. It's completely stuck. I've put about as much force into it as I can and it won't budge   What dose were you on? I've been on 150 mg of xl for about a year now and even when I was prescribed promethazine codeine by the student health center I never experienced any seizure symptoms (knock on wood)   I take this stuff and it's done wonders for me but whenever I plan to go out drinking or take adderall to study I skip my dose for that day. It definitely helps that I'm a bigger guy and my dose is on the lower end of the spectrum though.   They're just the standard muirskate bearings I'm thinking of getting bones reds though. The bigger problem is the stuck nut and I have no idea what to do about it.   Nope I'm in the dorms right now so all I've got is the skate tool muirskate gave me   Need a bit of help guys. It sounds like my bearings need to be cleaned and lubed as they're making sort of a *ssfiiiiiit* type noise but the nut on one of my wheels is stuck. I've tried to get it off like 5 times now and it just won't budge. The others move just fine. Any ideas? Should I just take it to a local skate shop? I got it off muirskate like six months ago       It's rare but it's not unheard of for people to turn violent during a road rage incident.   Intrinsic worth is just that, intrinsic. She doesn't have to justify it to you.   Cars, castles, clubs, and California girls   Idk I saw a post on silverfish from about six months ago that seemed to indicate that they had ended production.

It makes it kinda awkward to lug around   So I'm looking for another board to add to my quiver, and idk what to get. I'm looking for a lightweight portable campus cruiser that's under 26 inches, and this is going to sound kinda weird, but I want a small kicktail. Oddly enough the penny fits the bill but I want to explore alternatives before I settle on it. Pros for the penny are that it's cheap, lightweight, small, and smooth for its size.    I mean it's not too hard.... I got most of my Karma in the first 8 months of being on reddit.   I never said I supported prism, I don't. I do however, support international surveillance programs. And that's where he fucked up. I would support his actions 100% if he had only released information regarding prism and similar domestic surveillance programs, but he didn't. He foolishly decided to release **classified** information  regarding **legitimate** surveillance programs on political and military figures in nations like Russia and China and Pakistan. That is where he fucked up. As I said, a right doesn't excuse a wrong. There was no reason that he had to leak information about legitimate programs. You and the hivemind seem intent on ignoring half of the facts regarding his actions.      Or they're realists that understand that you can be right and wrong at the same time. Stop sucking his dick and try to comprehend the fact that him exposing NSA spying on US citizens is NOT an excuse for leaking information about international surveillance programs. You are the epitome of the hivemind and it sickens me that people like you are so blinded by your own ideals that you can't understand that he majorly fucked up. Yes, he exposed a program that is infringing on our rights, but he also fucked up several legitimate programs. One does not excuse the other.    To say that he didn't commit espionage is a lie. American citizens can be charged with espionage against the US. There is precedent for it. And do you honestly believe that he didn't give Russia any of that information? How naive can you be? Russia isn't hosting him because they enjoy his company. Beyond that, an entity can be many things it does not have to be a country.   Gotta edit that. It's the definition of espionage.   That doesn't make it right, nor does it excuse him. Edward Snowden could've done what he did in such a way that it could legitimately be considered civil disobedience, but he leaked more than what was necessary for his cause. For that he is a traitor. There is no way to get around that. Edward Snowden is a traitor for leaking states secrets and then fleeing with that information to not one, but two countries that are in a quasi cold war with the western world. He fucked up. Simple as that.   Colorado?   Every force in the world worth their salt spies on each other. Every. Single. One. Russia spies on us, China spies on us, Israel spies on us, Pakistan spies on us, Iraq spies on us, Egypt spies on us, the list goes on. And we spy on them. It's how global diplomacy has worked since WW1. To think otherwise is foolish. To think that we shouldn't because we should set some kind of moral precedent is just plain stupid. For revealing the NSA spying on US citizens, maybe Snowden should be let off the hook. That's up to a judge and jury though. For royally fucking up global relations, and fucking the hell out of many of the CIA's legitimate surveillance programs he should face trial, and he should probably be convicted of treason and espionage.   We shouldn't be spying  Yes we should. It's  naive to think otherwise. The world isn't perfect and in this imperfect world exists weapons with the capability of leveling cities, states, even countries. It is imperative that we know what countries have what weapons, how stable their leadership is, and if they plan on using them. It's not a matter of morality. It's a matter of life and death.   I'm just going to copy and paste a response I used for another comment.  The problem is that he didn't just leak information regarding NSA spying on US citizens. If he did he might have a defense. He fucked up in a real bad way when he leaked information regarding US spying on foreign nations, which is legal under US law. Any "civil disobedience" defense he might have had went right out the window when he did that. When you expose classified info of surveillance programs designed to gather information about terrorists and hostile nations then you are, by the very definition of the word, a traitor.   The problem is that he didn't just leak information regarding NSA spying on US citizens. If he did he might have a defense.

When you expose classified info of surveillance programs designed to gather information about terrorists and hostile nations then you are, by the very definition of the word, a traitor.   Those are the definitions that have existed since the laws are written. Regardless of how you feel about Snowden, he did break the law. The criminal justice system in the United States is not based on the court of public opinion, nor should it be. Tell me, if you truly believe that he should be found innocent, what should his defense be? You can't say that he didn't do it. You can't say that he deserves an exception to the law. What is the reasoning behind your idea that he simply shouldn't be punished?   Let's talk about this for a second. The legal definition of civil disobedience:  A symbolic, non-violent violation of the law, done deliberately in protest against some form of perceived injustice. **Mere dissent, protest, or disobedience of the law does not qualify.** The act must be nonviolent, open and visible, illegal, performed for the moral purpose of protesting an injustice, and **done with the expectation of being punished.**  Like it or not, civil disobedience is not a get out of jail free card. Otherwise anybody could commit any nonviolent crime they want in the name of ending injustice and get away with it. Snowden and his supporters should have absolutely no expectation that he will get away scott free just because he did it in the name of justice.  Here's the definition of espionage in the US:  The act of securing information of a military or political nature that a competing nation holds secret. It can involve the analysis of diplomatic reports, publications, statistics, and broadcasts, as well as spying, a clandestine activity carried out by an individual or individuals working under secret identity to gather classified information on behalf of another entity or nation. In the United States, the organization that heads most activities dedicated to espionage is the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  What Snowden did falls squarely into the definition of espionage against the United States of America. If he gets convicted it's not because he had an unfair trial. It is because he publicly committed treason and left a massive trail of evidence while doing it.   So you're saying that humans are the Americans of the animal kingdom?   Oregon   It's in Lane county and held just beyond Veneta on the highway between Eugene and the oregon coast. Depending on the town and county Oregon can have very lax laws regarding nudity.   Who forgets a hot pocket!? Those 3 minutes are filled with excitement as you stare at your hot pocket rotating in the microwave    Just the country fair. It's a giant hippie fest complete with nudity, weed, and hallicinagens. Unfortunately most of the naked people there do not look like this woman....   Oregon *Country fair   I will!

I'm sure you've heard that beta and phi sig both got shut down this year   I found the sister's Linkedin and she did go to UCSB which is a well known party school in SoCal so I believe him.   So have you gotten over the graduate depression yet? I'll play a round of snappa in your honor.   So I went to a pretty well known party school in southern California  I'm guessing UCSB    Muirskate is pretty amazing. They've always been very helpful whenever I had questions for them.

It's a highlight reel type thing from stargate studios that shows green screens on a bunch of their sets. There are clips from The Walking Dead, White Collar, Grey's Anatomy, and a bunch of other shows that I don't recognize.      Is there any chance that there are fish type creatures living on Titan?   The only problem is the fine is obscenely high. Like 4 times what a high speeding ticket would be in the US   The roof above the rear seats has been crushed at least 2 ft downward. It could have easily killed someone. The only thing that would've saved the driver is that he drove forward a few feet.   Do you think the stock setup (paris 108mm street trucks w/ divine wheels) is better than what muirskate is suggesting (109mm independent stage 11 trucks w/ 60mm abec 11 retro bertZ's)? From what I can tell the biggest difference between the trucks is that the independent's will need a .25 riser pad to accommodate rhe wheels while the paris trucks are tall enough to accommodate the wheels without a riser.   Experiences with Riviera boards? I'm really digging the "Pray for Surf."    Except for the jaw, mouth, chin, nose areas   Been on reddit for almost a year and a half and never seen it before.      I grew up in Eugene and springfield oregon has enough tweakers and blue collar workers to resemble springfield    In the US they're far above  Muslims       Not really   That's terrible advice.

How do I get me some of this fancy alcohol infused tobacco?   Where do you live that experiences sand storms?         The RAs are aware of the situation and they say their hands are tied because besides the noise problems he's not actually breaking any rules. My only course of action is to file a "concern for student" report with the school which means they'll interview him and decide if he's in need of mandatory therapy sessions.  Most importantly of all, have you told your roommate his actions are unnacceptable?   I have but he's one of those people that basically argues with you until you say something slightly contradictory and then he calls you on it and decides that he's one the argument. Talking doesn't help.   I feel sorry for him to actually. He doesn't know anyone so he has nobody to live with next year. But honestly, I think he just needs to take a year off and grow up a bit more before he wastes his parents money on another failed year.   He never showers.   -- Who the fuck cares?  I do because he smells like ass.  He gets bad grades." -- Dude, who the fuck cares?  I wouldn't if he wasn't constantly complaining about how hard it is to get good grades in college while simultaneously playing 70 hours of LoL a week.   "He doesn't have any friends." -- Dude... who the FUCK cares??  I do because  he is ALWAYS in our room. Literally the only way for me to get space from him is to physically leave the building.    I doubt it. During the same time period that coke had coke in their sodas it was a common thing in france to put cocaine in wine, and it was fairly commonly prescribed in the US.   I mean that's what happens when you can afford a 5 star lawyer   Investment bankers; the only group of people that consume more hard drugs than A-List celebrities    It's a secret but it's assumed by people that have gotten it that one is an OG. The problem is that only the one source grows it so you never actually know if you're getting the real thing, as evidenced by the [pictures of it on leafly](http://www.leafly.com/hybrid/khalifa-kush/photos). So consequently nobody can make an accurate guess since they might not even have the real stuff.   I don't think he personally cultivated it. I think he just chose the parent strains and a grower did the rest.   Mine is Khalifa Kush. My dealer sold me some stuff a few months ago that was supposedly Khalifa Kush, the strain that wiz himself designed. They say its not available to the public and the only way to get it is from wizs grower. Idk bout all that but I know it was fucking dank.   I believe that I remember reading somewhere that mosquitoes are so insignificant to the global ecosystem that they are literally the only thing on earth that can be made extinct with absolutely no repercussions.   So I have a roommate, I guess we will call him Matt. At first it seemed like I had lucked out with Matt, he brought a fridge, a microwave, and a few game systems. He mostly kept to himself and he was pretty quiet even when he was playing LoL with his friends from high school. He only played LoL in the common room too so it wasn't really a big deal. Well one day our suite mate invited some people over and they were hanging out in the living room so Matt asked me if he could play LoL in our room. I said whatever nbd. Fast forward two weeks and matt has pretty much stopped moving to the living room to play LoL (which he was doing more frequently at this point) and is basically only playing in our room. His volume is also increasing, he's laughing and yelling at his friends, making retarded nerd jokes, and getting angry when they're losing. His friend group is also completely dysfunctional so they're always arguing about some petty bullshit.    Fast forward another three weeks and Matt still hasn't made any friends and frequently skips class for one reason or another so he is ALWAYS in our room. To top it off it turns out that Matt is a goddamn insomniac so after I tell him to shut up so I can sleep I still have to listen to him rapidly clicking his mouse (I once woke up to piss at 4 in the fucking morning and he was still just sitting at his desk playing LoL). He has also become loud to the point that on a nightly basis our neighbors or an RA is coming to our door to tell him to shut the fuck up.   And if all that wasn't enough he has tossed personal hygiene to the wind. It's not uncommon for him to wear the same clothes for two weeks straight, now I know what you're thinking, that's gross for a shirt but it's not terrible for pants, well this motherfucker sleeps in the pants that he wears during the day. Yeah you read that right. This disgusting motherfucker sleeps in his jeans and his khakis. Just goes to bed, wakes up, goes to class, and repeats for weeks on end. I don't even know if he changes his boxers. What I do know is that he does not shower, like, at all. I know this because the cleaning people come once a month to clean our bathrooms and when they do that they take all of the shampoo out of the shower and put it on the back of the toilet.  It usually takes Matt a few weeks to a month to put his shit back in the shower. YES THIS DILLHOLE DOES NOT EVEN SHOWER ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS. We started the current semester in early january and I know for a fact that he has not showered since the first week, so it has been OVER A MONTH since he last showered. I got curious last week and picked up his shampoo bottle that he has had since the beginning of the year to see how full it was. Almost completely full... Like it feels like it has been used twice.   But wait, there's more! I told you how he is constantly playing LoL, right? Well it causes him to procrastinate, like a lot. He took 9 credit hours (with three classes) last semester (You're considered a full time student at a bare minimum of 12), and he was always complaining about all nighters. He probably pulled one all nighter a week. Almost without fail on a daily basis I would hear him complain to his friends from high school about how hard the workload is in college, and how much work he had to do, and then he would go and play LoL at least until I went to sleep at 1am. That's not all though, Matt somehow managed to get a C- in his Algebra class last semester (Yes you read that right too, he hadn't reached college level math yet so he was taking an algebra class to be eligible for college math courses), a low B in his History 101 course, and a B in his intro to art history course. Yes, with 9 credits, and one class that wasn't even college level, he managed to finish the semester with a GPA around 2.5..... and his excuse was that his teachers sucked.   Now you may be wondering, why haven't I introduced him to some people? Why I haven't I helped him make friends so that he would leave our place more often? Well believe me, I've tried. Matt will only go places with me if he has an incentive to go there. That means that he will only leave our place if there is an incentive for him to do so, which means he only leaves to go to class or get food. He has actually only left our room for something besides food and class three times this entire school year. Twice were with me. I've invited him to go with me to my friends houses and dorm rooms before and his response is that he thinks we're going to peer pressure him into drinking or smoking weed, I told him that if anyone did that we would leave right away. He said that I was lying.   And that's Matt, if you're wondering, no he still has not made a single friend to this day, and no he has not yet realized that he's disgusting.  **TLDR** My roommate showers once a month, wears clothes 24 hours a day for weeks on end, plays LoL on a daily basis with his friends from high school and yells loudly while he does it, and hasn't left our dorm room for any reason other than class and food more than three times this semester.   The worst part is that with this mentality they're going to go out and drive drunk again as soon as they get a hold of a vehicle without a breathalyzer ignition. I have an immense amount of respect for recovered alcoholics because a lot of them never learn.   That explains it. I think you're pulling the "overseas tourist" and underestimating truly how big the US is. You need that north south division or else things get all sorts of confusing.   It's true. I've found that very few people are truly ugly. It's definitely something that for the most part you can control.    Haha you guys have basketball    Nah bud is only sorta kinda legal here. It's oregon and Washington that has the legal recreational stuff. Now wait just a minute, let's not forget which USC is a div 1 football powerhouse and academically superior.   People that go to school in socal, such as myself....   of course the apex dd is fragile. It's three ply. I agree that they wouldn't be my first choice but at the same time a lot of their boards are good for younger kids that want to try longboarding.   Why? Their videos have helped immensely with growing the community.   The other thing is that it's much easier for bikers to control themselves in a stop. Like once you enter a slide on a board then for the most part you're committed but the biker can brake and unbreak to swerve as needed.      Image sells. Have you ever noticed that he only does something douchey before an album or clothing line drops?   What, acknowledging that an artist is good means I'm sucking their dick? Do you realize that you're exactly like the "edgy" people from the past that hated the Beatles or elvis or sinatra or the stones or any other mainstream artist just because they're in the mainstream? The question is, are you "le wrong generation" edgy or "the only good music is stuff nobody has heard of" edgy?   Why would I shoot Kanye? Whether you want to admit it or not, he's an amazing artist. Who else has changed their musical style for every single album and still had commercial success with every single album? And the douchebag thing is an act. He's actually a rather intelligent and down to earth guy. [As evidenced by this video](http://youtu.be/MHSP8KuTa7U).      duck dynasty. It's shockingly funny.      Girls started acknowledging me! The first time I realized that I was starting to actually get fit was when I sat down to lunch and this cute girl at the table across from me smiled at me and started asking me questions about myself. The confidence boost is incredible too.   Two things,  I wish I had tried. I was one of those kids that was smart and knew it but was too naive to realize that I had to prove that I was smart to other people. By the time I realized that I had fucked up I was halfway through sophomore year with a sub 2.5 GPA. It was too late for me to get into a good school. I was just accepted into my dream school as a CC transfer. Yeah I saved a bit of cash, but I missed out on the opportunity to join a frat and I never had a true dorm experience.  I also wish I had played a sport. Once you leave high school you basically lose the opportunity to play a lot of sports. Most communities don't have adult (tackle) football or lacrosse leagues so it's really your only chance.      When I first saw the video I kept thinking it was going to kick him. I guess camels aren't as scrappy as horses   [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CyiJtp-B8g). The video is even worse because the camel keeps grunting and making terrified noises and the guys keep laughing.         People do amazing things in real life. They climb mountains that can kill you. They surf waves that are taller than some houses. They jump out of planes and fight wars. And believe it or not, some of them make enough money that to them dropping a grand is akin to you or me buying a friend a sandwich. The point I'm making here, is that you would be much less skeptical of things other people do if you weren't on reddit so much that you're using subreddits as hashtags.   I don't know much about the tech industry but I imagine it has to do with advancement in the company. Once you reach a certain level it becomes more valuable for you to know how to apply your previous tech experience to the business aspects of the company and not so important that you know how to do tech related things    They were. This is saying that Vermont would be the first state to legalize through state legislature, which essentially means the decision would be made within the state government. Colorado legalized through a bill placed on the ballot, which means that they voted on it publicly.    Personal cultivation would be limited to secure indoor facilities.  So does that mean that you could only grow at designated "gardens" or you could only grow in your house?   I have the tugboat, love it.   Why? I support eating meat. I don't want to live near a slaughter house. I like boating, doesn't mean I want to live on a lake with speed boats going by constantly. I support air travel, doesn't mean I want to live near an airport. The all or nothing mentality you have is retarded. The fact of the matter is that windmills DO make noise, and they can be somewhat of an eyesore. I'm sure she would be happy to support the building of windmills in an area that didn't effect her neighborhood's scenery and property values.

The wheels light up when you move which is why I'm curious but I'm thinking I'll pass.   Has anyone here tried sunset skateboard wheels? How are they? what's the hardness like?   So I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?   Yeah a mod should message you to let you know that you've been made an approved submitter   +correct. Sorry guys I fell asleep    Hint: this school is near the Pacific ocean   Hint: According to most lists it is a top ten party school.      Byu- mitt Romney    I just went with the number that yelp gave me but point proven!   So I'm currently a freshman at a CC in California and I love it but I'm not sure I want to wait another year before I can transfer into a University. I was looking up good econ schools and I noticed that IU has a pretty good econ program and doesn't require 60 credits before you can transfer so now I'm interested.  1) What is the party scene like? I live near the UC Santa Barbara campus so I can basically rage whenever I want and the alcohol is plentiful. Do you need to go greek to go to good parties? Do people ever just kickback and smoke weed?  2) If I decide to go greek is it hard to get into a top frat or are they pretty welcoming? I've got a lot of friends here that are Betas and ATOs and most of my friends from back home are Lambda Chis, idk if that would help me get into those frats but I've got that connection.  3) Is housing expensive? I'm currently paying $650 a month for a shared room in a 5 bedroom house so lower housing costs would definitely be a plus.  4) Is the econ program significantly more difficult to get into than the school itself?   Thanks!  Edit:  Also the campus looks pretty big, how do people get around? Most people skate here but my guess is that you can't do that in the winter.   Because washington did it terribly and had a ton of hiccups in the process an there are only like one or two recreational dispensaries in seattle while denver has like 10.   If you don't mind my asking, which UC and what area of study? The UO really isn't a good school for most things when compared to most of the UCs.   At this point someone is planning on committing murder so they can be the douche that ends the streak.   After all of last year's shenanigans they started cracking down. On weekends the noise ordinance kicks in at midnight and on Halloween at 6pm.    Nah dog iv is dead on Halloween. Too many cops. This year it got rained out and I didn't see a single party only kickbacks.   Nope turns out he's  right... This guy crinkled the bag at 95 decibels   http://gizmodo.com/5616427/sunchips-new-100-compostable-bag-is-hilariously-ear-damagingly-loud   Isn't it hard to dab something so liquidy? or is it more of a honey consistency?   I bought my wallet in my school bookstore 5 years ago for $20 and it's still in great shape. I'll never spend more than $20-30 on a wallet in my life.   I'm having trouble learning to skate. I've basically spent a total of 5 hrs spread over a few days attempting to learn and I cant seem to actually get up and riding. I'll push once or twice and then when I get my foot on the board I can't seem to get my balance right. Any advice?   Seperated. As a man I'm sad I know that but it comes with the territory of having female roommates.   He's married to the matriarch of the Kardashian family and is featured on their show quite frequently.   He looks like jack black   /r/eldertrees         While I'm not in the marijuana business I feel I can give you some insight on at least some of this.  How did you maintain a continuous stock that likely includes several strains?   Marijuana is semi-perishable, meaning it's not like milk but it also can't just sit on a shelf for a year. You'll want to utilize a "just in time" inventory. Meaning you only order more when your stocks are dwindling. It makes absolutely no sense from a business standpoint to have surplus inventory, especially if it has a shelf life.  Did you couple your business with other accessories such as glass, grinders, tobacco, vapes, etc?  Most dispenseries carry at least a few essential smoking supplies and devices; grinders for sure, rolling papers, some cheaper glass pipes, etc. With the existence of online head shops it doesn't make too much sense to carry high end glass because if anyone comes in to look at it they're probably going to end up buying it online for a cheaper price.  How much competition did you initially experience?  so far no states are letting you just open a recreational dispensery willy-nilly like you can with a convenience store. Dispenseries require special licenses that are handed out sparingly, if you can get one then it's beneficial because it limits competition. Unless your pricing model is so fucked up that people are willing to go across town to the other dispensery then competition won't be an issue for several years.  Was the business failure rate in your area following legalization?  Recreational dispenseries have only existed for about a year in two states. That data doesn't exist yet.   This one is going over my head, can someone explain the reference    Well no it won't be because this happened in south africa and the boyfriend is declining to press charges   2/3 good enough for me   I know that this type of clothing is very location specific in terms of wearability.

I have a professional that wrote the syllabus into the text book so you have to buy it.   there's a weed geocache sub       So I smoked twice out of my new spoon pipe yesterday. The first time I took maybe four hits and there were times when I thought I felt something but I really didn't get noticeably high. The second time was a few hours later and I took maybe 5-6 good sized hits and again didn't get noticeably high. This was good shit too, I gave some to a homie earlier this week and he got absolutely ripped. Any ideas why I wasn't getting high? I didn't grind my weed this time, I just ripped up the nug and packed it.      Ayyyy Santa Barbara checking in, howdy neighbor.   I'm not sure what you know about making meth, but meth labs are notorious for exploding.... Not to mention the toxic fumes that are released during the process.    RemindMe! too! 2 days from now   iirc It's an indication of the environment they were grown in. I think I read somewhere that purple bud is grown in a cold air environment.      So awhile ago I moved to southern california for college and I live really close to the ocean. Ever since the Idea popped into my head a few months ago I've really wanted to use a gravity bong in the ocean. Are there any dangers I should know about? I'm worried about pollutants, parasites, and bacterial infections mostly.      I mean if you want a bitch car then sure, go for the miata. Theyre completely different animals at this point. It's like comparing apples to oranges. The miata isn't fast. It's lightweight and fun to flick around out on a twisty country road. The new Z's aren't like their predecessors from the 70s and 80s. They're not fun little lightweight cars. They're big and heavy and better suited for a drag strip or a full race track than an auto-X course. If you want a fun lightweight car that doesn't have the reputation of being a chick car (cough miata cough) then look into the Scion FRS/Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT-86 (they're the same car just rebadged for different markets). If you want a convertible that's lightweight and fun as hell then hunt down a Toyota MR-2 spyder or a honda S2000. But unless you're trying to be mistaken for a 16 year old 90210 princess I'd avoid the Miata. I'm not trying to say the miata is bad by any means, but there are other cars that are a hell of a lot more fun that won't havd people making fun of you.   It looks like broccoli lol but its actually just ditch weed. Offer him $10. Honestly tho it's going to be too much trouble to pick out all the stems and seeds and leaves.   I've been wanting to buy a rig but grass city and a couple of my local smoke shops don't have more than a couple complete concentrate rigs and they have various pieces of rigs. Where can I buy a full and complete ready to go rig for dabbing?    How old are you? When I started college this last fall I knew nobody and my two roommates were the RA and this straight edge kid. Finally after about a month and a half I nutted up and told one of my friendish acquaintances that I was looking. He hooked me up with an eighth and after I passed the love around a bit I met three dealers and a few connections.

If people are only allowed to discuss what they are considered "expert" in, New ideas would practically cease to exist and innovation would die.   "Climate change movement". That's like saying "Round earth movement" or "gravity movement". Science isn't a movement. The idiots that dispute it, however, are certainly one in my book.   This is propaganda to rally support around sinking the one act that protects us from paying for another bank bailout. The Dodd Frank act is not anti gun. It's anti bank bailout.

Calling me a conspiracy theorist for believing oil is a factor in war is like calling me a conspiracy theorist for believing water sustains life.   Your comment has more edge than a U2 album.   When drinks cost more than dignity, theaters have gone too far.   This is brilliant. This has absolutely never been done by millions of people every day.

Street brawl, anything goes.      Personally, I think these responses appear to be incorrect. Groupon is actually not making money. It's losing money on a massive scale. But that fact aside, they do not charge marketing fees up front, and advertising is an indirect profiting mechanism. They typically promise businesses an increase in revenue in exchange for a cut of the revenue they bring. There is a significant problem with this business model, they don't pay up front meaning businesses provide the service, Groupon collects the money and businesses do not get the money immediately.   Businesses essentially front the service and are paid by Groupon in lump sum afterwards. For some businesses this is fine, for others, this is difficult to manage. The criticism lately is that often businesses find the increase in customers does not cover the loss of revenue between fronting the service and the decreased rate of said service provided.        Honestly, if they are fed enough Kardashian in between news breaks, I think they'll go along with anything at this point.   Probably? You either have facts specific to your claim or you don't. Which is it?   Based on what data?   Virginia is open carry and you don't see that anywhere. It's a responsibility that could be abused, sure, but the facts show it isn't. Dumbasses with drivers licenses concern me far more. A drunk college student with keys in his hand is a much scarier scenario. Any responsibility can be abused. Living in fear of that possibility or placing unnecessary restrictions on the whole to try and prevent these abuses is absurd.   "to stupid"  My sides.   Meant to address to the tisajc alt.   Is it not true? Is Boehner not doing this? Is it made up?   I thought the same thing. They prevented Obama from helping the majority of this country for 6 years, 4 of which they based their principle behavior on the act of absolute obstruction and now they pledge themselves at the feet of a foreign leader? It honestly does sound treasonous.    This.   Good. I'm a democrat. I'm liberal on many things, like protecting myself. I'm confused why this is even an issue - people should have that right. Someone who intends to rampage with a weapon is going to do it whether the weapon is legal to possess at the time or not. Those of us who would prefer to have the chance to survive the rampage should have the option.   And privatize the remains, yep. But he apparently feels appeasing interests of US citizens is second to appeasing interests of a war-mongering leader of a foreign country.         That would be amazing.   Average 7 year old is around 50 lb. As strong as he is, he couldn't survive a pile-on. If they just started swarming him, what would he do? His ethics alone would make him hesitate to strike first, so they'll definitely get the first moves in.   Cage match. Everyone in at the same time. Wayne has nothing, the swarm of girls have writing instruments.   They blocked our President for 6 years and are now promising legislation to the leader of a foreign power. I can't find any precedent for this ever occurring in the US. Or any other country for that matter. It sounds almost  like a form of treason when read in plain context with no fluff.      The new title is stupid as shit.   Being dropped in a pool of acid would be quick but would also suck.   I've read that the brain can continue interpreting signals for up to 30 minutes after a beheading, so that kind of scares me. I do not want to sit in  some basket thinking "this sucks" for thirty minutes before I go...   This sounds....absolutely amazing.   Assassination. If someone has to go through that much trouble to cut me off quickly, I did something really awesome.      I did not know that. I'd think that's pretty telling...   I'd think he would be a huge disappoint to his donors as well. I could be wrong, I don't live in LA, but from the perspective of one who lives in the north east, he has achieved nothing but negative sentiment and only appears to get a headline when he has something outrageously stupid to say.   Ego. Like Romney, he honestly thinks he has a chance. He surrounds himself in yes men, only watches Fox News and has constructed a house of mirrors around himself. It's really pathetic.

    I can't believe that Google hasn't considered all of this. No doubt half of their driverless car initiative involves lobbying to change liability laws.

Bin Laden truly was like some goddamn James Bond supervillain. He took on the Soviet Union and (with lots of U.S. help) the Mujahadeen slowly bled the USSR dry and helped speed up its collapse. It wasn't the main cause, but it didn't help them. Then he turned his sights on the U.S. and with 19 hijackers set the U.S. on a course of war for over a decade, slowly bleeding them of trillions of dollars. Now the USA sits as a virtual police state, bailing out banks while the middle class disappears. He was an asshole, but he was a smart asshole.       Awesome, thanks for the info. I've been on a Godard kick over the last week and have been reading up on him a fair bit. Just can't get enough Godard these days, a truly unique and fascinating filmmaker.     Orwell did: "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others."      Thomas Frank has an excellent piece in the new Baffler about this:  http://thebaffler.com/past/academy_fight_song  Political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg tells the sorry tale in his 2011 book, The Fall of the Faculty. Back in the day, Ginsberg tells us, American universities were governed by professors, who would take time out from their academic careers to manage the institutions business affairs. Today, however, the business side of the university has been captured by a class of professionals who have nothing to do with the pedagogical enterprise itself.  Administrators: Their salaries are generous, their ranks expand year after year, and their work requires no peer review and not even much effort. As Ginsberg reminds us, most of them dont teach courses, they dont squabble like English professors at the MLA, and no one ever suggests replacing them with adjuncts or temps. As tuition balloons, it is administrators who prosper. In fact, their fortunes are an almost exact reverse image of the tuition-indebtedness of the young.   Exactly. The kamikaze was a desperation tactic and a terrible one at that. Check out "Wings of Defeat", excellent documentary on the kamikaze and shows how pitiful it was.   Au contraire. You'll still have to pay insurance, but with less accidents, the companies will pay out less.    Have you seen the 2008 Tyson documentary? Pretty self-serving on the one hand, but quite honest as well. Just the way he admits to all his faults, admits to all the stuff he's done, yet absolutely refuses to admit any wrongdoing in the Washington case pretty much convinced me. Plus, it makes no sense. Why would he do it? He's Mike Tyson, the heavyweight champion of the world. He can get any one of a million women with a snap of his fingers, yet he has to rape someone? I don't buy it. It makes absolutely no sense.    "Now then, Dmitri, you know how we've always talked about the possibility of something going wrong with the Bomb...The Bomb, Dmitri...the *Hydrogen* Bomb..."   I do not believe he raped Desiree Washington.   He has copped to so much shit, admitted it, tried to come clean. He has absolutely nothing to lose by admitting the truth, yet it is one thing he absolutely refuses to apologize for. I believe him.

I wonder how [Tim Uppal](http://www.timuppal.ca/), M.P. for Edmonton-Sherwood Park and Minister of State for Multiculturalism will react.   The downvotes you're getting is a clear example of some redditors' acute misunderstanding of the law. Not guilty =/= proven innocent. It's a simple fact yet one so few here can grasp.    Naked Lunch and This Nation's Saving Grace.    Was thinking about Blood Meridian with Joy Division, but this is better. Godspeed would probably go well with a lot of Cormac McCarthy.     I've seen this story about ten times on reddit this weekend, but this one gets my up vote for the awesome headline.    The White Stripes.    Yes, I understand what you're saying but if you don't understand the importance of race in the problems of America, you don't understand the problem at all.     Right and wrong. People are responsible for their actions, but systemic problems have to be taken into consideration. The fact that white America kills every black man who stands up for his rights like Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton probably has something to do with it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdv08c0aiTE     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdv08c0aiTE    Some more facts:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdv08c0aiTE  Of course I know you won't watch this because you don't want to be proven wrong, but until white America recognizes the cause of the black community's problems, nothing will change.    Right here. This is exactly what Reddit thinks and you couldn't be more wrong. If you want to be proven wrong, watch this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdv08c0aiTE  But it's okay, I know you won't.   Reddit's race-baiting begins anew. Because white people don't commit crimes.       Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?   Hunter S. Thompson was an important, entertaining journalist who deserved much, much better than Ellis' weak-ass Spider Jerusalem. I don't think I've ever disliked an homage/parody as much as Spider.   Fair enough. But it IS an interesting look inside Hollywood. If he wasn't such a dick, it would be a great rags to riches story.    War is peace.  Freedom is Slavery.  Ignorance is Strength.    Seriously, check out Overnight. I think you'll be surprised at exactly how much of a complete and utter shitbag Troy Duffy really is. I mean, there are scumbags and then there are scumbags and then there's Troy Duffy. The article doesn't even tell the half of it. So full of himself it's unbelievable. If he had just fucked himself over, that would be one thing, but he fucks over his friends, and then he tries to fuck over Harvey Weinstein. Big mistake. Big, big mistake.    The story behind this movie is better than the movie:  http://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/jul/01/1     Yeah, I think you're right. In The Firm, Bex obviously is a bit of a nutter and he "needs the buzz" but a lot of the other guys just want to be a part of something. "It's about belonging" says one guy at the end. They want to be a part of something and the violence is how they qualify themselves. We all have aggressive tendencies but you have to be a bit of a sociopath to make hooliganism part of your life. Fighting is one thing, slicing people's mouths open with razor blades is something else.      There's a film about the group of photographers of which Carter was a member called [The Bang Bang Club](http://www.thebangbangclub.com/). Manic Street Preachers also wrote a song about him called [Kevin Carter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLDr0QNCUd4).   There are lots and lots of other factors involved, and Taibbi addresses many of them. In fact, he doesn't even make the claim anywhere in the article that the high cost of college is in any way, shape or form the federal government's responsibility.       I had a friend who worked in the publishing industry, among people who worked in said industry, romance novels were known as "rape fiction".   Lindsay Lohan, take note.    Thank you. This movie is mediocre at best. The Firm is superb.       "How far can you take it? Trick or treat...bang bang!"

Better call Saul.      Quite simply, one of the most stunning shots in the history of the medium.    While he wrote many plays and poems, Oscar Wilde only wrote one book, The Picture of Dorian Gray.    Couldn't have put it better myself. My guess, this link will just disappear and Reddit will go back to its usual race-baiting at the earliest opportunity.    Blood Meridian. If you've read it, you know it's one of the most disturbing endings to any book ever.   Typical redditors. Bitch about Walmart's shit wages, then come up with bullshit excuses as to why it's okay to pay a millionaire movie star's body double the same shit wage. It's called fairness, look it up.  Edit: [I'm not talking about rules. I'm talking about manners.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_cYrDFU18)   It just all sounds the same to me at this point. I'm certainly never surprised by him. I'm thinking primarily of the work he's done with Tim Burton. I can recognize it from the first couple of notes and it just grates on me. Stuff like the [Alice in Wonderland theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5VcWD2LI7U) is just so hackneyed.    Likewise. I was a little shocked at how...goddamned stupid...a lot of the comments were. Of course, a lot of those are from 60-year-olds who won't be around in 50 years so they just don't give a shit. Jesus, we are so screwed.   There is probably no composer I love more than Ennio Morricone.  There is probably no composer I loathe more than Danny Elfman.    Keanu Reeves is so awful in everything it's not even funny. His popularity is all out of proportion to his "talent." He does do a good vacant, empty idiot. I'll give him that. He's the anti-Gary Oldman.    Stop making shit movies you fucking hack.      Everything O'Reilly's Saying ~~About Race~~ Is "Easily Debunked With About 20 Minutes Of Googling".   I've probably watched the whole thing...er...four or five times. Yeah, I'm addicted, it's just too good. Your Apocalypse Now analogy is perfect. I don't want to be one of those guys who pushes it on people, but I always say that it's an entire piece, like five chapters of a book and you have to watch the whole thing to "get" it. Ever read Simon's blog? Some good stuff there: http://davidsimon.com/    How far into The Wire are you now?   Excellent rule. I ain't so much as touched a burner in a year.   Directed by Sren Kragh-Jacobsen.    From his comments on youtube:  "No. Didnt promise anything at all. In fact, I had worked 60 hours that week and told her all week that saturday was my day to get stuff done around the house. But as usual she threw a fit about it. She has broken doors off the jambs at our house. Needless to say, that was the last day I lived in our house. I have moved out and filed a restraining order against her."   Whoa, whoa, whoa...not an ounce of bitterness in my sentiment at all. Just calling it like I see it. It's the way things are but that doesn't mean you can't try and do something about it. By all means fight for what you think is right, but don't delude yourself as to how things are.    Get used to it. Welcome to the new normal.    Sigh.  Can a "boy" beat up a grown man to have such injuries as Zimmerman had? It's not slander if it's true and shows evidence that's relevant, such as showing that Trayvon was perfectly capable of violence.  You mean the ["very insignificant"](http://news.yahoo.com/zimmerman-trial-judge-tells-jury-ignore-detectives-description-163625943.html) injuries? Here we have the crux of the issue. Zimmerman was a coward. He had 25 pounds on Trayvon! Yet he couldn't handle him, and instead of fighting like a man, he shot an unarmed 17-year-old like a bitch. You just accept without question that Zimmerman shot in self-defense. I don't.        Anything to slander a dead boy. Pathetic. You're more concerned about the PHOTO of a gun on a cellphone than the ACTUAL GUN Zimmerman used to murder him. Absurd. If your hero George had just been minding his own business, none of this would be an issue. Instead, he played cop and ended up murdering an unarmed 17-year-old. As a result, he will live the rest of his life in fear. Good.    More proof that Robert is a piece of shit:  http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/zimmerman-brother-unleashes-twitter-rant-martin-case-article-1.1299501    More proof that Robert is a piece of shit:  http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/zimmerman-brother-unleashes-twitter-rant-martin-case-article-1.1299501    Jesus, hadn't seen that before. Pathetic.    People can watch the entire interview and decide for themselves. What makes his answer particularly disgusting is that, as Cenk pointed out, he was being asked a question about how to bring people together, how to bring some healing to this situation. And he answers by bringing up the guns and drugs, which is just disgusting in the extreme. Perhaps the worst answer he could have given.  That George Zimmerman will live the rest of his life in fear, looking over his shoulder, bothers me not in the slightest. That's what you get for stalking and murdering an unarmed person. Fuck him.   Yes, all of that came out during the trial. You just don't seem to understand why it is wrong to slander a dead boy that your brother murdered. The links you provide are not evidence that he was growing marijuana nor that he was seriously trying to purchase a gun. How many 17-year-olds' cellphones have pictures of weed and guns? Probably most of them, but that is not evidence, and certainly not the kind of evidence that you would need to justify slandering a dead boy that your brother murdered after he got away with murdering him.   Nowhere in your typo-riddled diatribe do you actually manage to defend Robert's words. So you must agree, back to the parent, that it is absurd to suggest that Robert has been "articulate and well mannered." His answer at the end was, quite simply, petty and disgusting. Perhaps it runs in the family.    Please do.    Yes. Do you? This isn't a case of that. [Here's the full interview.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ePcLS5f7jw) Please show me where he says something that mitigates the slander of a dead boy that his brother murdered. Where does he say something that justifies his drugs and guns comment? How is Cenk's analysis wrong? Please place that comment in context.   Yes, fuck you as well.  In this case, this is strictly ad hominem. It makes absolutely no difference who the host of the show is, the only thing that matters is did Robert say those things? Yes, he did, ergo he is a disgusting piece of shit. Q.E.D.    That both brothers are pieces of shit? Yeah, that truth must hurt.    Right back at you.    It makes no difference how polite he was in the rest of the interview if he also spewed that nonsense about drugs and guns. What kind of utter piece of shit do you have to be to badmouth a guy after he's dead and your brother got off on the charge? A Zimmerman piece of shit, I guess.   "Robert has been nothing but articulate and well mannered through out this."  [You must be joking. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-fxth4wKhQ)       [Back during slavery, there were two types of slaves...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQe9nUKzvQ)      Liz clearly suffers from [bitchy resting face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v98CPXNiSk).

I thougth CC 1 was great, haven't seen 2 yet.   In the state of Florida, the season on African-Americans now runs year round. Come one, come all.  And bring a handgun. The legislators are fine with this blood on their hands. The governor, too. One man accosted another and when it became a fist fight, one man  and one man only  had a firearm. The rest is racial rationalization and dishonorable commentary.  If I were a person of color in Florida, I would pick up a brick and start walking toward that courthouse in Sanford. Those that do not, those that hold the pain and betrayal inside and somehow manage to resist violence  these citizens are testament to a stoic tolerance that is more than the rest of us deserve.  I confess, their patience and patriotism is well beyond my own.  Behold, the lewd, pornographic embrace of two great American pathologies:  Race and guns, both of which have conspired not only to take the life of a teenager, but to make that killing entirely permissible.  I cant look an African-American parent in the eye for thinking about what they must tell their sons about what can happen to them on the streets of their country.  Tonight, anyone who truly understands what justice is and what it requires of a society is ashamed to call himself an American.      [Posner's answer]( http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):  **Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**  A: The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll.  The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place.  Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends.  Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location.   Watch [Kids](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkjj7MlvIyI). It's a modern masterpiece. Seriously, a terrific movie. Don't know how much Korine "wrote" since it's pretty cinema verite, but well worth checking out.     Yes, but it's one that makes sense and has evidence backing it up. The multiple shooter theory just requires too many assumptions.   I honestly don't see any holes in the Oswald theory. One of the books I read was *Oswald's Tale* by Norman Mailer, an exhaustive, 800+ page biography. By the time he was 24, Oswald had: joined the marines, gotten court-martialed, become a Marxist, defected to Russia, gotten married, moved back to the States, started a pro-Castro group, attempted to assassinate a General, shot the president and killed a cop. It was a crazy life that all points to a nobody who wanted to be a somebody and Kennedy's visit gave him the opportunity. Don Delillo probably put it best:    *"Oswald would not have walked two blocks to shoot at the president. The president had to come to him, and this is what happened, ruinously, on Nov. 22. This was an act of naked desperation. Oswald abandoned his claim to history and became the first of those soft white dreamy young men who plan the murder of a famous individual -- a president, a presidential candidate, a rock star -- as a way of organizing their loneliness and misery, making a network out of it, a web of connections."*   I don't know. It was traveling fast enough that it broke the bone I suppose.   How about anything. Anything at all. Any shred of proof of a conspiracy. Other than hearsay there isn't anything.   If you don't buy Posner's argument, you don't buy it, nothing i can do about that.   Conspiracies exist. Who killed David Kelly? Who killed Gary Webb? I don't know.  But you have yet to show me one single shred of evidence of any kind whatsoever. As I've said before, if Kennedy was killed by some conspiracy, it was the single most successful conspiracy in the history of mankind. So successful that every single piece of evidence about that conspiracy has been kept secret for 50 years. Not one single witness, not one piece of evidence has been revealed. That seems highly unlikely.   lol...at least it's not Osamalives6493. That guy is crazy!   Not necessarily.   [There was no magic bullet. It travelled in a straight line.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html)  **Q: Can you give me the conventional conspiratorial descriptions of the "magic bullet's" movement, and what the four commissions which investigated the assassination concluded?**  A: Critics claim that the bullet came through President Kennedy, hesitated for a second and a half in mid-air, deciding where to go, then made a right turn, went over and hit Governor Connally in the right shoulder, came out of his right nipple, made another right turn to move over and hit Governor Connally's wrist. Then when it came out of here, decided "Where should I go?" and made a left turn, a 90-degree turn, and went into his thigh. Four government commissions all concluded that's absolutely false, that, in fact, it was a straight line right through the two men.    Suspicious, yes. But that just doesn't mean there was a conspiracy. There just isn't any evidence of any kind. Not even a little bit. It's all just conjecture.    Sure, it's suspicious. Things seem weird. It doesn't add up...all of this falls far short of any hard evidence. If there was any evidence of any kind whatsoever, you'd have some kind of argument for a conspiracy, but there just isn't any evidence at all of any kind.   Damn! You figured it out!!! My plans are ruined!!!  But seriously, not sure where it is online, but if you can find it, well worth watching.    [From the Posner interview:](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html)  **On the night of Nov. 22, where is Ruby emotionally?**  I view Ruby as very agitated from the night of the assassination, Friday. It continues to build through Saturday. A number of events take place that sort of seem to propel him at even a faster rate into what I view as this emotional deterioration.  One of them is the belief that the Jewish community in Dallas is going to be blamed for the assassination, based upon an ad that had run the day the president arrived, signed by a Jewish name. Another is when he comes across a billboard that says, "Impeach Earl Warren." [He believes] that it may be part of a right-wing plot connecting the billboard to the anti-Jewish campaign, furthering his excitability.  The third is that he runs into a stripper and a policeman together in a car on Saturday night. They talk to him for about an hour, and they carry on that Oswald should be taken and quartered; that if it was England, he would be carried through the streets, and he would be dead.  Ruby gets very worked up into this very anti-Oswald feeling. He is really at the edge of this emotional stability by the time Saturday rolls into Sunday.    [From the Posner interview:](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html)  **On the night of Nov. 22, where is Ruby emotionally?**  I view Ruby as very agitated from the night of the assassination, Friday.

If you shoot something from the back, the explosion, the force, comes out of the front, pushing the head back.    From the [Posner interview](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):  **Q: Describe Lee Harvey Oswald's shooting ability.**  A: Just three weeks after joining the Marines, he's trained in the use of an M-1 rifle. He shoots on a rifle range [a score of] 212, which means he qualified for the second-highest position in the Marine Corps, that of a sharpshooter.  Near the end of his stay in the Marines in 1959, after being court-martialed twice and his morale was low, he went back to re-qualify himself in the range -- still shot a 191, and still qualified as a marksman. That meant that he could hit a 10-inch target eight times out of ten from 200 yards away.   Nope. It's suspicious as hell. As was the murder of Malcolm X, David Kelly, Gary Webb, and a whole host of others. Conspiracies exist. But the thing with JFK is this: in 50 years, not one single shred of hard evidence has come to light. Not one. Not even a little bit. Other than hearsay and conjecture, there simply is not one single piece of hard evidence at all. You know why? Because it doesn't exist. Seriously, check out "Oswald's Ghost." Excellent documentary.    Sigh. The big one. Here's the thing. If you shoot someone in the back of the head, the bullet hole going in is small. The shot coming out is big. The explosive force out of the front is going to push the head back.   From the [Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html) interview:  **Q: The head wound. Everyone looks at the backward motion of the president's head and says, "That's got to mean the shot came from the front and shoved the head back."**  A: When I first saw the Zapruder film, I thought that it was evidence of a shot from the front. ... I asked the experts, "What does that mean, that backwards head movement?" What they told me is, several things are happening. First, as the cortex of the brain is destroyed, a neuromuscular response shoots down the spine, sending a seizure through the body. The body's muscles twitch, with the large muscles in the back predominating.  Remember, Kennedy's wrapped into a back brace. It's wrapped right underneath his breast all the way down and wrapped around his legs. You can't tell from that seizure where he's going to move in the car. But then something happens. Out the right side of his head, an explosion takes place. On the [enhanced Zapruder film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPdBXh-ltaA), you can see a cloud, a red mist of brain and blood tissue moving forward. It's almost a jet effect. As that propels out his head, it has much more force than the force of the bullet moving in, and it shoots him in the opposite direction. It shoots out to the right front and left, violently.  Two things. As the president's brain is destroyed, he goes into a neuromuscular seizure. His body starts to stiffen up. At the same time that the wound explodes out the right front side of his head and as that blood and brain tissue moves out, it forces him in the opposite direction, the jet effect, back and to the left, violently.    Jack Ruby?    I don't deny for a second that conspiracies exist. COINTELPRO and Watergate prove it. I know my Malcolm X really well and know the FBI and NYPD had a hand in it. (John Ali, the NOI's national secretary was an FBI agent.) But the problem with Kennedy is that there is no actual, real, hard, concrete evidence. None. At all. Not even a little bit. Just some hearsay. In 50 years not one single shred of hard evidence has come to light. It's because there isn't any. Seriously, check out Oswald's Ghost, probably the best documentary on the assassination. It answers a lot of these questions.   Just ramblings. Inject him with cancer cells? Really? If "they" wanted him dead because of what he'd reveal, he'd be dead. Again, no evidence at all, just conjecture.    Why wouldn't he just want to get away with it so that, you know, he didn't go to jail for the rest of his life?  I highly, highly recommend watching [Oswald's Ghost.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/)   How is the secret service going to close every single window in Dallas?  JFK had enemies, but again, there is simply no evidence of any kind that there was a conspiracy. If it was, it was the most successful conspiracy in the history of the world. Occam's razor works here. The Oswald theory requires no assumptions, the conspiracy angle requires about a million.    Conspiracies certainly exist. The FBI had a hand in Malcolm X's assassination as well, COINTELPRO was a vicious operation, but when you study the JFK assassination, there's just no evidence whatsoever. If it was a conspiracy, it was the most successful conspiracy in the history of the world. Not a single piece of evidence has ever been uncovered.    Grrrr. That makes me upset. I've read about four different translations of the book and know it fairly well. Would love to see a good documentary based on it, exploring how various generals did or did not apply the lessons of the book throughout history...but I guess this isn't it.   No.    Two weeks past his 17th birthday, yes. I'm not assuming he didn't start the confrontation, but there is no proof he did and, I think, plenty of proof of how aggressive Zimmerman was: "Fucking punks", "Assholes", driving around with a loaded gun, following Trayvon (even after he was asked not to). Only if you give Zimmerman every benefit of every doubt does his story make sense, which I won't do. Not with Trayvon dead.  The thing is, even if every aspect of Zimmerman's story is true and we believe every single thing he says, I still think he should go to jail. If we let Zimmerman go, then it's just open season on people. It means I can go around with a gun, provoke people, yell "Help!", kill them and then claim self-defense. That's insanity.

I cannot recommend it highly enough. (The link is just to some scenes from the third season. A good action sequence but doesn't give an idea of the show's entire message.)

[The drug war is a holocaust in slow motion.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/25/the-wire-creator-us-drug-laws)   Posner addresses that in the interview linked above:  "The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll.  The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions.

Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location."   Other communities face robberies yet unarmed sixteen-year-olds don't get gunned down because they don't have Zimmermans walking around.  Saying your life is in danger after the fact doesn't make it so. A few scratches and a bloody nose doesn't make it so. I think Zimmerman overreacted and a boy is dead. He should suffer the consequences.  Having a half-black man in the White House doesn't mean a thing for the majority of black people in the U.S. [The war on drugs is a disguise for a war on black people](http://davidsimon.com/a-fight-to-the-last-mexican/).  "One of every nine black families has a close relative in prison over aggressive arrests done by US law enforcement. Even though usage of illegal drugs are roughly the same along racial lines, the Drug Policy Alliance Network shows that blacks constitute 13 percent of drug users, but are 38 percent of people arrested for drug offenses, and 59 percent of those convicted. The Human Rights Watch supported this claim as well, stating that of blacks convicted of drug crimes 71% are incarcerated, compared with 63% of convicted whites. US laws have a much higher penalty for possession and distribution of crack cocaine, a frequently used drug among African Americans and this affects the Black community as well." - Wiki     See, I just think you're giving Zimmerman way too much benefit of the doubt. The way you're presenting him is as a dutiful citizen going about his business and helping the neighborhood. From his comments about fucking punks and assholes always getting away and his suspicion of Trayvon (which in hindsight was 100% wrong), I think it's clear he's on the prowl looking for trouble. Why follow him? He was looking for trouble. Why have a gun? He's looking for trouble. If he was a neighborhood watch good guy, the police would've been called and that would be that. But Trayvon's dead and Zimmerman killed him, we can agree on that, and the idea that unarmed 16-year-old Trayvon posed such a threat that Zimmerman was within his rights to blow a hole in his chest is just absurd to me.  Frankly, if Zimmerman gets off scott-free, there *should* be riots in Florida. Black people are still second-class citizens in the U.S.   Actually, I took an interest in the JFK assassination a while back and after reading quite a few books on the topic, and watching several documentaries, I would have to say that I am more convinced than ever that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Crazy, I know, but I think you'll find all of the conspiracy theory is just that, theory. No concrete evidence of a conspiracy has ever been uncovered in the last 50 years because no evidence exists. This [Gerald Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html) interview is pretty good at answering a lot of the questions around the assassination. Also, check out ["Oswald's Ghost"](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/). It makes an extremely strong case for Oswald acting alone. They also make clear that Jim Garrison was a loon.   No, it hasn't been settled. There are arguments on both sides. I think here is a clear case of reasonable doubt. The prosecution interpreted it as "fucking punks", you think it's "fucking cold", I think it's "fucking coons". Reasonable doubt.  [Prowl](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prowl): "To roam through stealthily, as in search of prey or plunder." That's what he was doing.  [Vigilante](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vigilante): "One who takes or advocates the taking of law enforcement into one's own hands." That's what he was.  [Fake-ass](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake-ass): "Describing or pertaining to one's inability to accomplish their motives. When one tries to be something they are not." That one's from the Urban Dictionary, but I think it applies pretty well!  I am using that quote to show his frame of mind, not who initiated the confrontation. His frame of mind was clearly, obviously, already confrontational. As for Trayvon's "drug use", that's the weakest shit I've heard about this entire case. The idea that marijuana is at all relevant is just more pro-Zimmerman nonsense. Besides, whether or not he was "on drugs" is different than if he had marijuana in his system, and I understand the latter to be the case.  Watch the O'Donnell clip, it's good.  So, we just have to agree to disagree. I think it's unreasonable doubt. I think he's going to get off scott-free and Florida will explode. We'll see.  As an aside, you seem like a reasonable person, doesn't it bother you that you're throwing your lot in with the FOX News/Breitbart/anti-black crowd? They're pretty much wrong 100% of the time.   If the prosecution didn't use it, it's probably because they didn't think it was clear enough to help their case. That's not proof he didn't say it. Maybe he said goons? Maybe it was tunes? Maybe it was dunes? Maybe.  Zimmerman WAS on the prowl. He WAS a vigilante. He WAS a fake-ass cop. Those aren't emotional terms. They're facts. What else could you possibly call him? His own words condemn him. "This guy looks like he's up to no good, or he's on drugs or something. These assholes, they always get away. These fucking punks." and, quite likely, "[fucking coons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IKKqnF0WlE)". (A different link than the previous one. Lawrence O'Donnell takes apart the argument that it's "goons.")  I think the "reasonable doubt" standard is what we disagree upon. To me, to suggest Zimmerman should get off scott-free could only be arrived at by invoking unreasonable doubt.   You're letting yourself get emotional and sarcastic, that doesn't really help the discussion.  You're talking about one audio expert, I'm providing you with the fact that it was 16 degrees Celsius and he had a jacket on and the actual recording of what he said. You can continue to believe whatever you want, but I think you're stretching the facts past the breaking point. It wasn't cold and it's certainly possible, is it not, that he said coons? Surely there's some reasonable doubt there.  Again, he was on the prowl with a loaded gun and followed Trayvon, an altercation ensued and Trayvon is dead. Somehow, you're putting all of this together to the point of exculpating Zimmerman. You're not even allowing the possibility of him being responsible for the murder he committed. I haven't said any of those things about Trayvon, yet you're basically saying them about Zimmerman. Proud and noble defender of justice saving us all from the house-robbing darkies. More like fake-ass cop following people with a loaded gun who got in over his head and committed murder. But in America, you can get away with murder as long as it's black people you're killing. That's been true for a long time, and you refuse to see America's racial history as playing a part in this story. That's being willfully obtuse in my book.    I highly, highly doubt it sounds like cold to you. I think you can obviously hear him saying coons but your bias won't let you admit it. The thing is, it *wasn't* cold. [It was over 16 degrees Celsius at the time he made the call](http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KSFB/2012/2/26/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Sanford req_state=FL req_statename=Florida) *and* Zimmerman had a jacket on! "Cold." Bullshit.  The whole issue of who made the confrontation physical is a matter of pure conjecture. Trayvon is dead so we only have one side of the story. You don't know who made it physical and neither do I. All we know is that a self-appointed vigilante driving around with a gun murdered an unarmed 16-year-old. The majority of people on reddit think he should get off scott-free. That's fucking insane.  I'm not making this racial, it is racial. Black people are disposable in the U.S. and have been for a long time. This is just another example of it. As I said, if Trayvon was white and Zimmerman was black, this case would be open and shut. That's America.        White men kill black men and black men kill white men all the time. The reason Trayvon's murder is getting play is because he was an unarmed 16-year-old murdered by a man who wasn't even charged at the time. They took his word for it and that was that. That is the value America puts on the life of black men. Hopefully all four of those black guys go away for a long, long time. But to suggest that America places more emphasis on white on black crime is absurd. [Frankly, I think if the races were switched, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.](http://i.imgur.com/wFMPKKy.jpg)   How about ["Fucking coons"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGuctYqCDvo)? Sounds racial to me.  There is no reasonable doubt as to who blew a whole in Trayvon's chest. I also think that the guy driving around with a loaded gun following people is clearly the one making the confrontation physical. Only in America is the guy walking back from the store with Skittles the one to blame. [Again, if Trayvon was white and Zimmerman was black, we wouldn't be having this conversation.](http://i.imgur.com/wFMPKKy.jpg)   What does a totally unrelated news story have to do with this? Who's saying the Marietta murder wasn't racially motivated? Looks like it was. So what?    Your bias is showing. The self-appointed vigilante George Zimmerman blew a hole in an unarmed 16-year-old's chest after following him after he had been told not to and looking for a confrontation. "Fucking punks. These assholes. They always get away." When the bitch-ass Zimmerman started getting his ass beat he went for his gun like a coward. Hope he goes away for life. If Zimmerman was black and Trayvon was white, Zimmerman would have been locked away a long time ago.   I just can't believe how many people on reddit have no problem with what Zimmerman did. If he gets off scott free, the message is out: it's open season on black people. Hunt them down and provoke them into a fight and you can murder them and nothing will be done. Disgusting and disappointing in the extreme.    The death spiral continues...    Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths         Fucking reddit. So smart when it comes to most issues, so fucking stupid when it comes to matters of race. You can't break a man's legs and then complain that he isn't running fast enough. Every single person who commits a crime is responsible for their actions and should be punished accordingly. I repeat, **every single person who commits a crime is responsible for their actions and should be punished accordingly** but if you don't know your history, you won't know why we are where we are. Of all our studies, history is best qualified to reward our research. I'm going to keep posting this video in every thread where reddit rears its knee-jerk racism:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdv08c0aiTE     Harold Bloom does the same thing in the Modern Classics introduction to Blood Meridian. Kind of ridiculous.   Came across it a couple of years ago, it's actually Japanese:  http://io9.com/5723698/a-massive-cross+section-map-of-the-walled-city-of-kowloon  http://www.deconcrete.org/2010/03/30/un-real-estate-kowloon/    As long as hip hop exalts people like Drake over groups like The Roots, it will remain a disposable medium full of disposable people broadcasting a disposable message.    A cross-section: [inside the walled city](http://www.rioleo.org/kowloon/crosssection.jpg).      Malcolm X has to be up there. Which is a shame only because so few rappers (Dead Prez aside) actually know anything about him. I think he'd be disappointed in how the black community and hip-hop have essentially rejected his philosophy in favor of bank rolls and hos.   Man, good question, there really are a ton of great scenes. I like the old guy explaining anarchism, I like the JFK buff "I'm going to call it either Profiles in Cowardice or Conspiracy a Go-Go", I like the black dude on the street, "Remember, terrorism is the surgical strike capability of the oppressed...can I interest you in a t-shirt?". I also like the guy who thinks we've been on the moon since the 50s. Damn, I can't choose, too many hilarious moments!   I fucking love this movie. One of the best indie films ever made.   Couldn't agree more. I think this is true of films in general, I like to go into them blind, but it applies even more for The Holy Mountain because it's such a mindbending experience.    I do see what you mean, but I also think it's a valid psychological tactic. Risky, as we've just seen, but I wouldn't classify it as "classless shenanigans". He's trying to mess with the other guy's head and if it makes the other guy lose his cool, or throws him off his game plan, which it certainly can do, I think it's a valid part of the game. Here's [Emanuel Augustus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkRpykP6mQ) explaining his game.   This is EXACTLY the kind of movie you don't want to know anything about before watching for the first time. Worry about "understanding" and "appreciating" it later. You only get to watch this for the first time once, and it is best to go into it knowing nothing. The analysis can come later.

I'm a huge, huge fan of Akira, but I honestly believe you have to read the comic to truly understand it.   I really, really hate to be THAT GUY, but as a huge fan of the anime, I just have to say, if you liked the movie, you'll LOVE the manga. As a comic book fan for many years prior to reading Akira, I was blown away. I just can't recommend it enough. I truly believe it will enhance your enjoyment of the film.

The people who read the books go to the people who can't read the books, the poor people, and say, "We have to have a change." So, the poor people make the change. And then, the people who read the books, they all sit around the big polished tables, and they talk and talk and talk and eat and eat and eat. But what has happened to the poor people? They're dead! That's your revolution! So, please, don't tell me about revolutions! And what happens afterwards? The same fucking thing starts all over again!"   People shouldn't be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.   Yes!    War is god.       And the private prison industry laughs.   	190
 Actually, Louis Armstrong was the first musician to admit of his recognitional use of cannabis.  "It's a thousand times better than whiskey - it's an assistant - a friend."   1. Calgary.   2. Beach Baby.  3. Re: stacks.   Honestly, I don't admire Bon Iver because of Justin's profound lyrics, nor his musical genius. I like his slow, winery setting he puts me into even on the hot, turbulent days we have too much of here in the Middle East.    I'm 17 and two weeks I made plans to meet with an absolutely stunning girl who I presumed to be interested in me (we've been texting for a while before). Anyways, the night beforehand I was indescribably anxious. What if I look ugly? What if there would be an awkward silence? What if it would be cold and I'll look like a sissy? All kind of these questions ran through my mind.   I couldn't sleep and I wondered if she felt the same, and actually that morning I didn't wanna meet her but eventually I just did it. I drove over and we hung out for four hours, and you wouldn't believe how fluid it went there. You just look at her face, listen to what she said and you find something stupid to say, and honestly for some reason women like when guys say stupid things. Just laugh, and choose to do what you know is beneficial, and I believe you can make that judgement.       Thanks for the reply. I could relate to a lot of things you said.  Well, sometimes I go out and I feel fucking great. I'm also looking fairly well so meeting girls isn't much of a problem for me, but sometimes I'm just feeling so lonely. Like I've no one to talk about my depression, so I just write. I wrote entire fictions about depression and romanticism and that seems to be helping a bit.  The thing is that this sadness just rests during the day, as if I'm ignoring it, but at some point it bursts out quickly and all at once. A cute girl can ask me for the time and I can think of her literally for days, what a coward I was for not talking with her and get into this fucking train of thought of how pathetic I am. I think music has a lot to do with it. Whenever I listen to Jazz I feel much better, but whenever I listen to one of the great, sad songs I like I feel sad.    There're so many thoughts running through my mind right now and yet I've no clue how to even begin this. I'm 17 years old living somewhere in the Middle East and I've been dealing with the same shit teenagers go through, experiencing the misfortunes of love far too young, dealing with sadness far too often, having the same dreams every goddamn day and waking up into a grey world when it's not even rainy.   I laugh at how much stupid I might seem to you right now. Hell, I'm only seventeen, and I'm getting depressed over love? There are far worse things to be depressed about. Especially in the Middle East.   Honestly, I'm hesitant to label myself as depressed. I know depression is a strong term that's often misused, but I don't know if I'm feeling just sad. I think I'm stuck in self-pity because I tell myself a thousand times a day that I'm so pathetic. Like last week I drove to meet a girl who I fall in love with since the first time I texted her, and I thought I fucked up. Even though she said she had a great fucking time I just thought she lied and that day I fall for self-pity. Obviously, it didn't stop there and I fucked up everything else I could possibly fuck up by telling her how deeply I felt for her and how lonely and pathetic I am, and how I don't wanna go into a relationship with her because of what happened last time I was in one.   I always make the wrong fucking decisions. I always fuck up. I always get into the same fucking situation where I'm hopeless and preparing myself for another night where I'm gonna dream about the same girl I've been dreaming about for the past five years, but somewhere deep down I like that.   I like feeling sad. I love listening to Bon Iver just a few minutes before bedtime, staring into the darkness and reminding myself for the thousandth time how fucking pathetic I am. How no one cares. How she doesn't care. How everyone I fucking love doesn't give a damn about me and there's no fucking escape. Everybody's just gonna say that the future's gonna get better, and how love is like that and eventually, I'll forget the girl who fucked up my life and I'm just gonna nod and say, "Yeah, you're right" just because I don't wanna make it seem like they've wasted their time on me.   I've been writing about what I've been feeling for the past year or so, but I don't think any of you would be interested in reading some teenager's diary about how love made him vulnerable.   Anyway, the question I've been asking is am I depressed or just sad? Where's the line? And if I am depressed, is there a way to get out of this? Just be honest.    I'm the Carnival of Peace.      It always makes me smile to see Bon Iver's version of Skinny Love rather than Birdy's.    I love pieces that have a 'form', but not too conservative (as in C Jam Blues).   I think there's something about the thousandth time of listening to Peterson that's making me crave for something new, but similar. Is there?   I don't agree with some of the things he said, but who am I to criticize Stephen King?      I'm a teenager and I hardly ever read. I do listen to audiobooks multiple times during the day. I've ADD, so it may be connected.  Nonetheless, I write a lot. I feel like it is a great tool for me to relax. It makes me feel creative and improves my mind rather than playing video-games or scrolling endlessly through Facebook. It improves my English, too, which isn't my native language so why the hell not?   I read somewhere that Justin Vernon stopped everything that's related to Bon Iver, because it got very famous or stuff like that. I'm not sure if that's true or not...    This is so underrated.

You don't get to be as close to the president anymore.    I do love Hazeltons. Moreover, I listened to a lot project he participated and I loved them all. Bon Iver is definitely my favorite though.    Like it has been taken out of a movie.    YES. Geez, you read me so well! I listened to the acoustic version like a thousand times and YES, those lines in that version were orgasmic.   I think Justin's voice sound much better without all the effects he put into Bon Iver, Bon Iver. On the other hand, I cannot imagine songs like Perth and Holocene without such effects.  By the way, if we share the same passion for Justin's original voice, you should check out [Beth/Rest Rare Book Room Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv9Aj_2julQ) if you haven't done that by now.

 I disagree with your unhelpful perspective.  To consider one perspective of the world wrong (a perspective that when examining the source material at its core, is used to promote love and selflessness) and consider another to be true without definitive answers, and to raise it up through anger, is outright hypocritical.

I truly feel regret and sadness for my sexual sin, and i turn from it for a time, then I return to it. Therefore I wonder if I was ever saved at all? God! This is so scary. I hate this life. I just want to make it out alive.    Wanted to just make a list of sins that I've committed/am committing/will commit and secretly just need reassurance of my salvation. Honesty both ways here, thank you.  1.) Daily regularly user of pornography 2.) User of Tinder with the desire to meet somebody to have sex with 3.) Not a regular church goer and don't often consider holding the Sabbath as of high importance 4.) Often find fellowship with Christians to be disappointing and the Christians themselves to be boring/annoying 5.) Constantly searching for the best future for myself, serving myself. 6.) Drug and alcohol user, and often participate in social situations with the use of drugs and alcohol with non-believers.   As I'm making this list, I don't mean to come off whiny or anything really. I just want those spiritually more sound than I to understand that my heart is willing, though I just generally suck and I'm not sure if my life will ever be that amazing transformation that you always hear about. If I continue in and out of these sins, will I be damned to eternal wrath? Will I ever be fully out of these sins? Can you pray for me? What do I need to do to be in right standing with God? Is there anything I can "DO"?   Worst case scenario, you can just press mute and follow allow with the images ;)   lol probably the same point there is to watching people play video games or whispering into a mic making crinkling noises, you just have to find your niche.

How does complete garbage keep being made what's popular. Its worse than PewDiePie.    looks dumb. want full control. wasted potential. coop should be side option.   Basically what I was getting at is the difference between Human forgiveness and Angelic forgiveness. I feel its different.    Well I don't know what kind of authority Elder Paisios has over the Bible, but its pretty clear in Revelations that Satan is destined for destruction and would be far too proud to ever consider asking for forgiveness.    http://www.gotquestions.org/does-God-love-Satan.html    I am saying that based on what I've observed of God's actions towards angels within the bible, yes, his forgiveness has limitations when applied to his direct spiritual servants.    I don't think Angels can be forgiven. Because they were born into the perfect light and presence of God, knowing full well the consequences of their Sin. For humans, we are born into darkness and know not the sin we commit and its implications spiritually. Therefore, we go from darkness to light and the devil came from light to darkness.    like a hockey net and the goalies water jug!   Roger Poger Pudding and Pie  frag out  let's make em' cry.   obviously it is not good to hate. But don't let the judgement of others, based on your own person history, hinder you from coming to Christ in all vulnerability.    Wait, are you the Natureman?   Maybe it's worse than we think? Maybe there's bases on the moon?....maybe even Mars? ...get your ass to Mars (the chocolate factory)   Crossfit is pretty neat. I participate in it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Fridays throughout the week. My favorite trainer is young Jeffery, but all the trainers are good. It's expensive but way cheaper than personal trainers but just as good. Now if only I had a dietitian I'd be set.   Oh Snu Snu? It's a reference to futurama where the gang ends up in a matriarchal tribe with huge Amazonian like women who have sex (Snu Snu) with men until they pass away. Reddit likes futurama.

His Kingdom was not of this world.    But, how can you call yourself a human by following such unwarranted orders?  Streakers? Better bash them with my riot shield.  Why? Because boss man said so and I can't think for myself.    The fuck is wrong with policemen? If he would've hit her, she most likely would've been injured just because she was naked.

Weirrrrrrd 0;)   Gritty Open-word Indie Immersion.    There can be only one US   I've known Jesus as my savior for quite some time. I love what God has done for me, what God has taught me, and who God has turned me into. I was blessed to have made it through nursing school and am a male nurse at my local hospital with a steady job at a young age. There are no legitimate, outright issues or struggles within my life that are observable to the outside world. My only issue is, I feel that I have very little satisfaction with life. I spend 40+ hours a week at my job, with very little enjoyment. In my downtime between sleep, I spend at the gym working out, where I have very few social connections. On my days off, working nights, I usually waste the first day sleeping. The weeks are flying by and I feel as if though this life that Christ has given me is being wasted on the mundane and conventional.   What is it that brings you, as a fellow Christian, satisfaction and fulfillment out of life?    How the fuck is this a terrorist attack?   There are so many educated individuals to learn from throughout the entirety of the nation, with mountains of their media populating the internet. Why has this one particular character, Neil deGrasse Tyson become such a prominent figure throughout the Reddit consciousness? With so many articles and videos being posted to this website on a second by second basis, how does one particular niche professor maintain a presence on the front page of multiple subreddits on a relatively consistent basis? Is there an underlying hive mind that regulates the postings within reddit, that if not adhered to are buried in downvotes? Doesn't this frequent perspective from a single source, although intelligent, generate a recycled confirmation biased among the user base? What is it about this character that draws such a fancy from some many Redditors?                          looks fake   I just find him massively annoying.   A miracle.    What if we like papa johns, can I still join? Also, one time a cat nipped my foot and I dropped an air conditioner on it - It Wasn't My Fault!   I wish I was a redditor :(   I don't get it.

Woah unto me...   Exactly, people get caught up with the ethics behind it all. At the end of the day, it's not our responsibility to be the ESRB. If we enjoy the game and it's fun then congrats to destructive games on a fantastic first entry!   This game looks awesome!!!!!!!1   Themes of the game aside, it's still a game. When I play max payne or gta, it is just fun to kill people. To play a shooter of any sort and enjoy it, only to knock another shooter for its themes is outright hypocritical. Just because this game "appears" to be deriving meaning or purpose from senseless violence, does not mean that the character couldn't have multiple layers. No matter the outcome, this argument has long been played out on the mainstream media thousands of times and really isn't worth running in circles over. Mental illness or taking violent action is a choice and studies have clearly shown that an artistic form of game media will not abruptly perpetuate those murderous actions. If the game is fun, let it be fun. If it crosses a few boundaries, let it do so with pride. Just don't let your kids play it and we'll all be fine ;)       Depending on whether you use motion capture and or a procedurally generated animation system, the possibilities are endless. Play Max Payne 3 and tell me the death animations in CoD are still satisfying after experiencing the novelty of the Euphoria animation system.     THis sucks    Are you kidding me? Death animations are the primary feedback you receive from a shooter. You play a shooter to shoot things, and if you have to see the same shit over and over again, I don't see how that would keep your attention. Have you played gta or max payne 3? The animation system is amazing. Never the same thing.    Mechanics-wise, it looks kinda fun. I just feel like the death animations are so repetitive and there's no use of physics or ragdoll whatsoever. They still use some of the same death animations from CoD 4...that's pitiful...   Repost.      It just goes through history from American Revolution to our current time about how all of the wars fought within the United States were created by Centralized Banking Cartel beginning to lose power, therefore regaining control post-war, and how war is used to implement their shadow governments. Essentially, modern day slavery is achieved through debt and usury.    If your skin is dark, and we don't like you, you're a member of ISIS.

I only watch the news in passing at work, and all I can say is, I'm so fed up with the lies and scare tactic propaganda that I feel almost all news outlets are force feeding down the American public's throats.  Am I wrong to say that men in black garbs and turbans with AK47s shown marching on television seems to be the biggest load of horseshit I have ever seen generated in the mainstream media narrative thus far? For the longest time, I was waiting for another 9/11 false flag to happen, enabling our military free reign to invade the remaining middle eastern countries such as Syria - and then a more prepared nation, distrusting of official stories would begin to stand against our misleading government. But now, there comes the story of journalists getting beheaded, and stories of "terrorists" murdering their own people, and that's all that's required for the U.S. to begin airstrikes on "select" Syrian targets? And not a god damn peep from the general public? And this all happens right around the 9/11 anniversary, when public "emotion" is at its highest. I just can't keep the story straight anymore. It's just all so ambiguous and makes no sense.  I also disdain the fact that our public still believes in fairy tales of good and evil, as if there exist no grey areas, and the ones WE bomb are the ones who deserve it. It's just so disheartening to know that I am part of  such a violent and uneducated public who still calls themselves Christian yet pulls the trigger everyday; and a government that would rather spew lies directly to our faces than ever considering standing up against big corporate business interests in foreign countries.   It's almost like I'm living in a dream anymore. A dream where there is no hope for the people, and all there is to expect from life is small culminations of human hate and greed. How did it come to this?   Please help me make sense of all this. All opinions are welcome. I just don't know who to trust anymore.    You are all a bunch of NigNogs.    Burn in a pile a molten cum.    They dictate all the monies. And have limited auditing regulations. Imagine being the owner of this centralized banking system? You'd be hella rich   [I like this site](http://www.gotquestions.org/when-Gospels-written.html)    The validity of the text is essentially nullified based on the fact that the article itself states that the text was possibly authored 800 years after Christ's life on Earth. That's like me writing a document stating that Jesus had laser vision and someone digging it up in the year 3200 AD, calling it valid strictly based on the fact its now a document of antiquity. Can we seriously think for ourselves people?   Watch [Zeitgeist debunked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFI6m6Icav4) , a lot of what you're stating is fabricated to fit the agenda of the Zeitgeist creator. Also, to say Jesus didn't exist, even as a historical figure is outrageous. And stating, "those who 'came to arrest him' could never find him because he didn't virtually exist" is a logical fallacy because you're pulling accounts from the Gospel source material to refute the source material. It makes no sense.       Reddit is gay and for fagguts   go to sleep newfag. lol jk i have no idea either.   CDC. ATL, GA. Walking Dead.

If you've made it thus far, you're probably curious what happened to the rest of the puppies. Yup, dead. All dead. Eaten by Guildabeasts. Yeah, I know sad right? Should have listened to blazetheraze and stopped reading. What's a Guildabeast, you ask? It's a big gay guy with a tiny dick and hooves for feet used to carry out painful erotica bullshit. Yeah, I know, fucked up right? Should of just stopped reading like blazetheraze told you. But since you've made it this far, you should be aware that the Jews did 9/11 and you're retarded if you don't even question the official 9/11 commission. And by retarded, I mean you're a fearful bastard who probably will flag this comment, strictly on the basis that its "Stepped over its bounds" and will offend poor little grandma. Well, you know what? Fuck grandma. She was a dumb Slut just like mom. She got pregnant and fucked up her dreams before she was 20, but I suppose that was more "commendable" back then, huh? Well, sorry to break it to ya, but having kids, growing old and dying is a waste of life. You haven't even figured out your own self and now you wanna bring another life into this world so you can vicariously live through them and impart all your insecurities into their innocent heart? Also, make sure they go to college and get an "education". Because we all know 50k in student loans is the best way to teach someone that committing suicide would be a lot easier than this bullshit. So, the cycle repeats. What fun? Well, thanks for joining me and remember to stick your head in the sand when any real truth is placed in front of you. :)   tl;dr -  You should have listened to blazetheraze and just stopped reading.

 Haha.          Yeah, you got them. It's too bad the Browns 1.0 won it in Baltimore.      I couldn't agree more. Jason Kidd was a big one too.    Respect for the honesty. We all know the warriors fanbase doubled up recently.    Are you too young to have seen Charles sink that jumper in David Robinson's face?    I hope you're not also a Browns fan?    Me too! Stopped having the knicks be my east team after Larry Johnson left though.    Nash and Finley, you'r welcome.    you see him play before the knee injuries?    No Peja? Maybe a little Hedu?   #whitechocolate    i'd still put  my money on the spurs  his suns source is probably optimistic more than anything substantial    Marcus Morris. Then he and Markieff would jump me and stomp me out cause that's how they do.   a great man with great news apparently    breath into a bag!   *then   then it's the suns, not than   How are the Suns getting closer to signing LA?    chad's number was tweeted and he was going to get a new one in the episode but chad showed all the numbers of people who contacted him  so that's gotta be it      It has some business. Name one country where the government doesn't tell people how to live or what to do with their money.   More like Oliver Miller.   And who is this 10 foot guy?    lol thx   thx   ur joke didn't go over so well lol   OHP?   Of course she's not, she's swimming in her big bank and big cable company money like Scrooge McDuck.   How good will the Spurs be with Duncan, Parker, and Manu retired?    For one year only, not franchise. Does the answer at all depend on the makeup of your team? Who are you taking?   It should have been dwight at 25 vs dirk at 35.   waiting for embedded episode 3....   I want to see this version and the new one they put up later to find out exactly what they don't want us seeing.    Trump warned us.    It gets the 85 IQ Fox viewer voting.   Republicans won't get rid of it because it's worked. If they did get rid of it, millions of people would lose their health insurance, prices would climb drastically, and they'd get killed politically for it. They just want to complain about it. They don't actually have any ideas themselves.    actually they do! before the govt started telling people what to do they would die up in burning buildings   If by kook you mean in line with the majority of Americans more than any other candidate, then yeah he is.  Oh no, he wants more well paying jobs, a livable wage, healthcare for everyone, a little equality, and a strong middle class....how could we live with all of this? **How do we allow ourselves to live without it?**   Reebok: fuck you that's why      Diego would end up a bloody mess.    why don't you?      I can see that. Just put up a ton of shots. But how long can he stay healthy? I'm not optimistic. It's sad seeing him like this.    **Ben Simmons**   You bet your ass they're tank! They won't be the only one either.    I hope they trade him away period.    If Kobe is healthy next year, what kind of numbers can we expect from him? 15/5/5?    nothing for miami or LA or portland?      so what about the other 35%? is that portland?    people are killing me with the 100% joke responses   you're being sarcastic, right?       I didn't believe she wasn't  going to run for the longest time, but I have come to accept that reality the pat few months. I came over to the Sanders Bandwagon earlier this year and I'm glad to see him picking up so much momentum and I hope he can keep it going.    not in practice  rarely ever does the VP have anything to do with the senate    I hear that. Best wishes. Kick it's butt!    it's got what plants crave   treasury secretary would be dope!    Agreed. I love her as a senator though.   let's not be delusional lol   I told him to listen to my **mix tape** in a well ventilated area!          Bo and Deion did it.      are there any other resources you would recommend? I'd like to find something that groups medications by class (maybe with tables) rather than just a big list   oh, you're going to asu law school (sandra day O)? it is a great law school! congrats!   can i ask what your gpa/lsat score was? curious what students are getting nowadays who  go there   tell that to republicans who vote down vets benefits    this is by far the most realistic list   I'm not doing it for the money lol. If I wanted money, I'd go MBA.   That's good to hear about the connection just in case. Best wishes man!   What attracts you to AZ?    got it, thx  So, if I'm an NBA player could I have a tiny little condo in the state of Washington to pay 0% state income tax? And then just live in other place?   That's good to hear. The money isn't what it used to be. You thinking of working for the govt / private? or going out on your own?   Nursing. If I had to do it all over again I would have done med school, but I'm not trying to be in school another decade.    He'd be the centerpiece and #1 option on the Suns.    Bernie Sanders doesn't vote to go to war and then neglect our veterans like so many politicians. Bernie Sanders is the leader America needs.          double taxes or split up depending on where they play?   When it happened.   hahaha   besides just more, what's the  difference in toronto?    I think the Lakers got too much help from the refs for it to be coincidence. Statistically, the calls they got were outrageous. I think the game was fixed.    they're so incompetent Lopez will probably just elect to retire than play for either one    is Robin Lopez the Lakers Tyson Chandler?    lol   has he gotten better since he left the suns? because he was not good in phoenix    Refs stole game 7 from you! that wasn't right    92-93 Suns have to be up there   at least wait for LA to be signed   how can the republicans not be tire of this?    you gotta bring the heat!    i think hillary is more component than that  is there a top like a 10 somewhere of the funny/good stuff?    alright lol, we're gonna have to agree to disagree, but respect, you do you   F5 for Aldridge's selection.

I still only like this one song.          PoliSci, plan was law school. Worked at a law firm, then later at the court. Dragged my feet for years, and since the legal field is dying somethin' fierce, I decided to go into healthcare which I'm pursuing right now. What are you thinking of doing? Criminal Justice field? Legal field? If the latter, I would advice you to be practical and look into it and be 100% it's what you want, because law school is not a good investment anymore. Back in the day (say before 2006ish) there were many well paying jobs out of school. Now, even people out of Ivy league schools in the top 10% of their classes are struggling. Partnerships in law firms are diminished. Plus, keep in mind something 90% of lawyers don't see a courtroom. They're in the office 12/hours a day doing paperwork.   I think choosing something that will get you a well paying job out of school is the best route to go, regardless of what you want to do after your undergrad, be it law or something else. So if you did engineering, accounting, nursing, computer science, etc something practical like that, you'd still have  something to fall back on.      +1   And there is already enough hype. It would be a waste and it might actually take away from what they currently have.    ASU grad here, what are you studying?    Choose your fighter:   select player   it should say select fighter   Rehab was her only good song. She's very overrated. If she hadn't died, everyone would have forgotten about her by now.      most likely [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc)         **select player**  they give so little fucks about the fighters they can't even change the word player to fighter    I hope he plays a bad guy. It's way more fun and a better part.    usually something comes up automatically that allows me to translate, it doesn't here, i don't know how to translate it          for what? they can't double team stomp people out? this is the NBA, teams are not obliged to keep you together, it's a luxury/privilege and they don't deserve it   why only one year? why not 3 or 4?   which one? i don't speak Portuguese    my f5 key is more worn out than Kim    The early Amare was the best, but after he busted up his knees he was never the same player. As a person, he's overly materialistic. I couldn't be a fan of a person like him since I can't relate to him.    Based on the median age of MVPs it seems unlikely. If he does it will most likely be in the next season or two.   I feel bad for Mark that he has a snitch in his family. The shame.   This can be arranged.    no idea what you're talking about   tldr   i always wonder what the curve is for players, some of them are as good as they're ever going to be after one year, but some of them take a few years to start ballin'    someone will get hurt, someone will start playing bad, it happens every year   29, lol   seriously though, when is he making up his mind? tonight?    why does everyone assume all the teams are staying the same? some will get better and some will get worse. You never know, you could have like seeds 2-6 all be within a game or two of each other and phoenix gets hot and end up getting the 2nd seed. You never know bro.   You're kind for saying 4-6 instead of 6, thank you. I'm sorry about Amare.    is warren ready?    Lakers should trade Kobe to a contender and get something for him, and rebuild.    Oh, I see. And I respect that, I was just curious because I have known people who are trans, but never anyone personally.    Lakers are back in the race!   For the 8th seed.   LA   NY must be really toxic organizations    can someone measure traffic this way? I think we'd have the highest posts on avg that way   surprised we're so low, i am guessing we just talk the most?    and you're now on a list   This would kill the NBA.    you guys are getting screwed by the back room draft lottery too  usually by that many years of sucking you'd have a few studs  	139
 Well the formation of a galaxy doesn't necessarily have to occur at the same time as hydrogen and helium combustion. I guess is there any science out there saying a galaxy is isolated among other galaxies because it's attracted to the central mass of that black hole?          thus the whole flaw of irrationality     Ok. Let me apologize. The Soviets certainly attempted to be communist (which is my whole argument), the USSR was temporarily socialist, and ultimately ended up as state capitalists.  And about the deaths? The USSR resulted in 56-62 million unnatural deaths. 34-49 linked to Stalin:  http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 Forced labor camps? Purge Victims? Execution? Prison?  http://www.gendercide.org/case_stalin.html This "cleanse" was at the forefront at Stalin's attempt to follow at marxist communist society. I'm not arguing about the USSR and what exactly it's economic system was; that's a long tedious debate. I'm curious as to why individuals think the solution to political reform (in America for the most part) is the result of an entire new economic system.     "works in theory" is based off of the assumption that we are all rational agents to some degree (with some flexibility), and we all will follow the social contract, etc.; however, it seems nearly impossible to have a theory work in reality if it doesn't include irrationally; thus the need for a societal cleanse in the past.    Do you think political reform can simply take place by eradicating the previous system. I feel as most people have this idea of promoting the ideologies of pre-established models that will work in theory (especially communism), but have thus failed in history. There seems to be this hope that a perfect model will ultimately lead to this idealist, utilitarian, eugenic society that is thought to answer all of the world problems? Social and political reform is revolutionary, but in need of a massive paradigm shift in-order to get people on board. Especially in the discussion of communism I find there to be a very hopeful belief of egalitarianism, but most individuals have failed to remember the fast transition (ex. Bolsheviks to Soviets) which obliterated millions of people in order to cleanse the fabric of society.    	7

 The Leopard by Giuseppe di Lampedusa - fantastic    Campbell Hall doesn't exist at the moment, so in fact your method is quite difficult.    I'd guess it's about 50/50.

 Never thought of the guild thingy. Will do so. I hate being serious in a guild - that's the problem. Right now I am in 2 guilds. Both of them are pretty serious but I said to the main guy that I won't be serious and I will be more like a representative of those guilds. If they want they could kick me - they didn't do so.   One word: IKEA   OMG This is Beautiful!!!!  	3
 I didnt expect to laugh out loud so badly while on the toilet today.   Holy shit dude, thats metal.   Yeah sub-hunter helicpters or boats with depth charges as a counter. Do they still use depth charges?   /r/theydidthemath   Oh damn i didnt even see that! Either way boonie hats make you like 6 times cooler in my opinion.

One was jammed, chepa, the other had a drunk owner, his wife, much smaller considering the apartments around  Jesus the food  one day cause I was the drunken irish regular TEFL teacher guy they gave me deer stew for free  ridiculous   I know the wages are shit (my ex has a chemistry masters and worked a government job for 600 a month - some people dont get that part) but fuck it was great  walking around, in the heat, looking at stuff, have a beer somewhere, bottles of tequilla in the chino for 5 or 6 quid. crazy   spanish deli opened near me, the guy who runs it lived two metro stops down from me too, world is small    yeah, it's a weird one, a sag necessary release that was never going ot be in the cinema Vs. a film that has somewhat of a release worldwide  interesting stuff canuck    You could seriously just eat in the pub there, so good, sound slike you have a great life  sigh     friend over there now doing camino  just texted me  9 quid, starter, main, bottle wine, bit of dessert  fuck me  wasn't that cheap in madrid      yeah I am thinking it is because HR is saying 10-15 screens?   I didn't I was just showing the actual record.  The HR report seemed to have a minimum of 10-15 screens as a necessary condition.  Either way I was just putting more info in. Silly me.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zyzzyx_Road         I took 30 minutes coming up with that answer   you can't argue with people on here  snowflake have it all generation  so profoundly ignorant it makes you reconsider humanity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	148
 Kill the dog and the owner, bury them in the woods.   "The amazing thing about the national budget process is that no one knows how it works."   First opening to FMA:B   Well without butters there wouldn't be a southpark.  It's all just a figment of his imagination.   Ya seriously they need someone like her.  Someone who doesn't care about the party line. Someone who just cares about the people.   Mac miller.  Douche bag passed out on stage.  Everyone in was there with went "OMG he went so hard he passed out".  I'm like "bullshit, guy is a bitch."   And that should tell you all you need to know about Jeb bush.   Whaddup my knitta!   Hey man I would totally be down for a viewing party.  Record the first couple episode then over the next couple weeks get the word so more people show.   1. TTGL 2. SAO 3. Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. 4. Attack on titan  5. Samurai Champloo   Ha sorry guys I didn't think anyone would ask.  From the top down: boker kwaiken, leatherman crater, buck nobleman, spyderco tenacious, Mtech stiletto and i don't know what the last one is.     Boker kwaiken.   Buck Nobleman      You saved their lives.  Keep up the good work!   First ark was perfect, they kinda dropped the ball on the second ark.  Good show, could have been great.   I think he used that knife because of how simplistic the handle was. There isn't a lot of nooks and crannies for blood to sit and dry and it looks really easy to clean.  Perfect for a serial killer with morals.   I always loved the spyro games.  Would be pretty cool to see a reboot of that.   Somebody told me that you're already married and confined to a wheelchair.   I love this.  I'm gonna steal this, this is mine now.     I just love the simplicity of the styling.    I just bought a kwaiken, I literally cannot wait until it gets here.   Looks like a tactical-fillet knife.   I would have to say the boker kwaiken.    I'm the maverick.   I think living in The Last Airbender universe would be pretty great.  A beautiful world with deep, fleshed out characters and being able to bend the elements.     Exactly!  He'd never suspect a thing!   Jump his ass, steal his weed and just to add insult to Injury give him a nice kiss on the cheek.   This is a great solution to a problem that shouldn't even have existed.   What you said makes alot more sense.   The souls in the underworld aren't copies of people walking outside.  It's an incredibly sophisticated machine that replicates human emotion though quantum computing.  I think they called it the world's first top-down AI or something like that.   Forget it, kinda drunk.   Ha! That was good.   Stick....stick your dick in it.   Why was he in the movie to begin with?   Procrastination.  I really need to put those college applications in.   Projectfreetv.com   I'm stupid, it has to be within the universe.  I would choose bran.   Mcgyver.  It would be interesting to say the least.   I thought corners are a man made invention.  I didn't think they existed naturally.  	40
 As a qualified electrician and lighting technician for film and television working on the likes of Dr. Who and such. I have to remind you that not all MCB's have the same breaking capacity and its' not just the MCB that dictates what can be run on a single circuit but the gauge and the type of the wiring used. Yes what you have said is typical of a standard 1mm lighting circuit but not a standard ring main used for power or anything else for that matter.   I think I can simplify a lot of these answers. A wise friend once told me when I questioned him on his feelings of death and what he felt about dying. He simply said "Can you remember before being born and do you ever care about that? Death can be seen as the same" Made me feel better at the time and truth be told, surprisingly, I don't worry so much as before just hearing that one sentence.    We all learn the hard way how to court the females of the species. Sound's to me like this girl was up herself somewhat. But I digress, feel for you man.   Been married 2 years but thanks anyway :D   No doesn't make sense she wouldn't be my wife. When I clearly pointed out that she said I do fit. Try being funny elsewhere.   Doesn't make sense, but ok :)   I've heard many a woman say they had a penis that didn't fit. Including my wife, shame she wasn't talking about me at the time.....  	7
 Thanks for the input :) yeah that is around the same roster I am doing now. Would be great to get a job like that   Thanks very much. I will starting looking around :)   /u/trollabot that91guy   Hi there Canadians of Reddit. I'm a 23 y/o Australian and I'm thinking of moving to Canada for work.

 Can anybody provide examples of such videos?  I'd like to see what the fuss is all about.   Good.  Good.  Let the purr flow through you.  All kidding aside, get thee to a shelter.  I was a rookie cat owner when I got adopted, but my gf at the time had cats and coached me.  PM me if you need advice/how-to's.  Also consider getting two.     I've got a 12-year old orange tabby who was a feral kitten that adopted me at the beach just like the little kitten in the vid.  He and I are besties.     You and I are of the same iTunes tinkering fellowship.  I don't understand why Steve of this story didn't do the same.  He had the song requests in advance.  It'd be maybe 10 minutes to set up a playlist.   IIRC, Probst had just announced that a guy allied with the two girls had been voted off, while Matty in the middle hated the guy.   That's correct.  It looked like a preppy college jacket   tie combo.  Dunno why I'm getting these downvotes.   Sorry -- what does this bot do?    I bet legal fees ate up a huge chunk of the winnings.   You'll be fine around there.  I'd run southwest on NY Ave until you hit 15th and then across the pedestrian block of Penn to see the White House, take a left on 17th and down to the Mall.  Be careful crossing Constitution.    Alternatively 10th St. takes you past the montrosity of the FBI building and Ford's Theater one block up.   I love this site:  http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-202-559-6606/11  This number's got 11 pages of comments, so yes it's a national thing.     Oh wow talk about a cat who hit the lottery.    My cat will eat almost anything but I guarantee you that if he lived in a sushi joint, he'd be just like this cat.     The number of details really helped sell it.  He was wearing a jacket and tie that is exactly what a white guy in college would wear.     I live in Washington DC.  Only recently -- maybe the past two years -- were the liquor stores allowed to be open on Sundays.  We could get wine and beer from the small grocery stores throughout the city.     Oops I did.  Thanks.         Many thanks!  I was standing in the main viewing stand with the official countdown timer just in front of me.  I remember that just after they announced the abort, the heatwave from the main engines hit me and lifted the cuffs of my pants.    I can only imagine what the full launch would've done.   Earlier that year, maybe even late '84, I happened to be in a parking lot in Santa Barbara waiting for a bus shuttle to LA when two sonic booms startled me.    Yup, a shuttle landing at Vandenburg.  I had no idea what the sound was until I got home.  It sounded like a pair of surround sound shotgun blasts, but catching you more in the chest.   What bugs me about the story is that the owner didn't trust your dad to camp there anymore.  Like he'd done something wrong.  The owner knew something that your dad didn't know.   Gotta love a cat that runs towards danger rather than away.  I have an 18 pound orange tabby tomcat.  Nothing happens in my neighborhood unless he wants it to happen.   I've read the letter where Franklin expressed this view -- it was in the context of a letter to his nephew.  I thought it was tongue in cheek.  He might've been somewhat serious, but the letter was definitely uncle-trolling.   I think ospreys are eagles, just more sea-going.     You and me, brother.  I don't think we're alone.   *insight  I didn't know it existed.  I grew up in the 70's so if there's any detail you need, I was there.    Did they report on the Schwinn banana seat bicycle?  That was the defining thing to own for my generation as boys.  Typically though I find these retrospectives are done knowing now what happened and filtered accordingly.    Jerry Ford's handling of the Pueblo Crisis is a footnote now, but I remember it got my attention.  We'd just gotten out of Vietnam and suddenly North Korea wanted to mess with us.  We really didn't need that.   I doubt the FBI got its panties twisted by somebody's bumper sticker, but I also wouldn't doubt that somebody somewhere asked for context and easily got it.  The hashtag if it actually got used on twitter would've been NSA/DHS territory.  Again, the context was I bet easily found.   That might -- MIGHT -- have been true for the 50's.  But don't forget about Sputnik demonstrating superior space technology and the leaks of the hydrogen bomb to the Soviets.  Then they put missiles in Cuba.  That to my mind is when the Cold War turbocharged itself.     It's true.  They support adoption for the cat or doggie and hope you'll come back to them for food   accessories if not grooming.   Sylar is the nutshell for everything wrong with Heroes.  I'm not impressed by this trailer.  Looks like the same old bait   switch of the original.  I actually got a little angry watching it.   I was high school class of '80.  Youngest bro did well for himself.   The Citizen Kane spoiler was also I think a Billy Crystal joke on SNL so it's forgivable.     The problem with international law is that it's an awfully amorphous field.  I know a lawyer who is always flying around the world doing negotiations and making deals, but not as an international lawyer but an expert in US medical devices.    When I think of international lawyers, I think of State Department or USAID people.  Those are great jobs to have btw.   Get onto the running paths of the C O Canal and you look up at the streets crossing it.  Dunno if that's what you're looking for.     Tyrion Lannister: "One game at a time."   Duke fans individually are perfectly fine.  It's when they get together as a group that's the problem.   Dunno if there will be any Colombians or Argentinians there, but Lucky Bar should do nicely.  Call ahead to make sure they're showing it but they almost certainly will be.   Zookeepers around the world have been imitating Chris Pratt in Jurassic World:  http://www.dorkly.com/post/74902/zookeepers-around-the-world-are-chris-pratt-ing-with-their-animals  It's sort of like Tebowing except not annoying.  With actual dinosaurs, that Smithsonian curator just won the competition.     I remember at just about this point last season thinking "OK the Nats are good but can they solve the Braves problem?"  They did and I've moved on to worrying about other franchises.   Wow.  Giving away a broken-in glove?   Doesn't look too bad.  That stuff a few nights ago was apocalyptic in comparison.   It has to be something regional.  I'd get a referral to somebody who specializes in food allergies or reactions.  This is the kind of problem they love to solve.   I now agree with you all -- FP at very least had too much coffee this morning.   That's annoying.     FP still appears to be traumatized by Yoga in the Park.   AZ can just ask for your papers on demand?  If that's part of a traffic stop, I don't see a problem -- license and registration are required everywhere -- but papers on demand?  Yeah that's not going to last long.   That was some terrific situational hitting.  Escobar's hit in particular.   Here in DC the police cannot ask jaywalkers for ID.  They're affirmatively prohibited from it.  I guess they'd had problems with pretext arrests back in the day.     Here's the Post with detail:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2015/06/25/bryce-harper-anthony-rendon-out-of-the-nationals-lineup/?tid=hpModule_a4df998e-86a7-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394 hpid=z10   Is that house a carbon copy of the Amityville Horror house?   This is true:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe#Military_service_in_the_Revolutionary_War_and_serious_wounding   I saw Challenger abort in '85.  So disappointing.  They'd lit the main engines, something went wrong, and they pulled the plug before lighting the SRB's.     At first I thought who would rob a movie set and why is a costumer so brave?  Then... typo.   I jog past the Watergate and sometimes ponder all the other gates it has spawned.     If you like gin, that Green Hat Gin named in honor of him is really good.  It's actually distilled in DC, too.     I'd add womens tennis to that list.  I love watching the Williams sisters.  Olympic swimming doesn't suck, either.   Regarding softball, I once batted against a female colleague who had pitched for I think Stanford.  I like to think of myself as a decent batter but I have never felt that kind of frustration and humiliation.  I didn't know a softball could physically travel that fast.   Verifying it is one thing; establishing its provenance is quite a different matter.    I'm smelling war loot.  They're going to need to establish that it wasn't stolen.        USA 0-1 China or maybe a PK situation but I have a feeling the USA is done  Germany 3-1 France  Australia 1-2 Japan  Canada 0-1 England which I know is a huge upset but I've got another feeling    Dunno about that hygiene grade...      Wow.  Virginia won something.  What is this feeling I'm experiencing?   At least in Virginia, not so much.  It's not the economic powerhouse of northern Virginia, but the true poverty line doesn't start until you get closer to the West Virginia line.     Niners and Nationals fan + Wahoos.    Gin is the only thing that eases the pain.   Didn't it fall through though?  What's going on with that parcel now?  Is it the big Trump development?   The line running from northern Virginia into Georgia roughly tracks the Appalachian mountains.  Lots of Scots-Irish settled those highlands.  Lucky people, too -- it's gorgeous.     Special hell for this bastard.   Ah Desi you wonderful wonderful man.   BFA!   Same thing going on here in DC.  The whole city feels like a construction site.   I think that it's also that many of us (I'm from SW Virginia) have families that have been here so long that it's impossible to pin down which European country is our origin.  Taking the four names of my grandparents, I've got French, German, English, and Welsh.  It gets exponentially muddled going back through generations, with one line going back to Pocahontas.    So for me it's impossible to say.     It's something in your diet.  Start switching things around.  A food allergy is most likely.   I grew up in the 70's and burned my tongue so many damn times on their coffee before I just started going elsewhere.  It was really crappy watery coffee, too.     Call the admissions director and voice your concerns.  Maybe they'd give you a fresh start.  And how come this suspension is so long -- I thought the typical suspension for a flunk-out was a semester or two.     Of course.  I bet that if you wrote the prestigious university and explained that you're better now, they'd let you back in, too.  Nobody's going to be around anymore from your original class.     Did they every ID the body they found that had the connection to the shoeshine guy in I think Crystal City?  I bet this poor guy's death is somehow related to the storms.   And from the country that produced Kafka.   One of my friends had a pair -- his wife was allergic.  They were kind of cute once you got used to them having no hair.  They always cuddled with a human for warmth.  Adorable.   I think people congregate on the Lincoln end of the Mall.  But the Capitol end is where they have the concert, so that's going to be affected.   I gasped out loud.  It's rare for something on the internet to make me do that.   I live in DC.  Woe unto those on the Red Line.   There's a mistake in this -- the Chicago bid was for 2016, which Rio won.  The US 2012 bid was NYC, which was dead on arrival.  No place to put the Olympic stadium.     We're in agreement then.    ESPN needs to learn that nobody outside on NY and New England cares.   That rivalry annoys the bejesus out of me for all the press it gets, but I think it's the very model of a rivalry that is NOT forced.     I live in DC and it's a real beating to get to FedEx.  Once there, it's a joyless experience.     This is misleading.  There are plenty of coaches who are in fantastic shape (Pete Carroll, the Harbaughs).   I hope but I think the ship has sailed again.  Who knows -- maybe the USOC has some DC partisans in it.  I think we sadly have to assume that if if yanks Boston, the bid goes to LA.   I really wanted to transcribe his rant on Hall of Fame voters living in their basements with their moms and voting all day.  "Not that there's anything wrong with it."      Here's a great article about what it would have looked like:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2015/06/12/why-the-olympics-washington-didnt-win-could-still-transform-the-city/  I saw the 2012 bid plans which DC lost to NYC and this is MUCH better.  It's a damn shame it lost.   I went for the second week as an adult.  It was great.  I saw Michael Johnson run both the 200m and the 400m.    Exhausting, but what a great week.     Yeah I'm seeing lots of red links today.  Anybody know what's going on?   FWIW anytime I hear of somebody named Gay, I think of the sole survivor of VT-8 at Midway:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Gay,_Jr.   Great news.  Boston's bid is effectively a replay of the disastrous NYC bid for 2012.  I wish DC had gotten the bid, but if the USOC goes with LA, the Olympics are almost certain to be there.     SPANNING!   That's from Chelsea James.  She's one of the Post's baseball writers.   Alright.  I'll go on a beer run.     Great.  My satellite just came back on only to hear Dave toss the broadcast to EPSN until 8:30.    Too bad this isn't a Friday.  We could have another Padres drinkfest.    Oh.  Well I'll have a G T anyway.  The tink is the ice going into the glass.   The winter games are an entirely different beast from the summer games though.     If you look at the Post's radar loop, it looks like it's just a glancing blow.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/  Still I looked out my back window a few minutes ago and it looked as dark as it get closer to 8pm.   Wahoowa!  Is that tink for a gin   tonic?   I liked Bryce winning the walkoff.  The guy's seen Zoolander; she hasn't.      "Everyone's a critic."  POW!         I just became a commie about downvoting to 1783.   September 3, 1783  The United States and Great Britain sign the Treaty of Paris and Great Britain signs a separate treaty with France and Spain.  I am no damn commie!   That's always bothered me too.  It's kind of like when the NFL Cardinals went to Arizona, suddenly Phoenix didn't want to acknowledge the St. Louis years.    Mind you, they had good reason, and so does Minnesota for the Senators, but the '24 era players ought to be commemorated somehow.   Trust me: the TV show was better than the movie!  I think it set the stage for Buffy.  You're dealing with Duncan MacLeod of the clan MacLeod though -- a different character than Christopher Lambert's.  Here's a highlight reel with Queen:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTuntEPJZow   First the [flying cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_8mdH20qTQ) and now this.   And play here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestatyn   I don't think it was a cartoon by any stretch.    It was more lyrical, rather than a show of force.  There's no way to beat thousands of communists oops FoxCon employees drumming away.  Anyhow.  London's closing ceremony was where the English put their true genius.  Does anybody remember Beijing's closing?   Yeah maybe but the timing of her visit to England and her death I think means a certain connection to a typical London disease -- she died on the voyage back home without clearing the Channel.    Here's wiki on it:  https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Pocahontas#Death  They cite smallpox, pneumonia or TB.  The timing adds up for those to my mind.   You found Trevor Hudson!   I've pretty much given up on reading Joel Stein's columns in Time for the same reason.    That being said, it is fun to remember that those guys plotting the Thatcherite rebellion thought so highly of themselves.     You da real MVP   Why is nobody considering that he simply had a heart attack?   I live in DC and when I saw the headline in the Washington Post maybe two days saying that he was missing there, I read it as White House Chief Missing as in Chief of Staff.   Well the Vince Foster thing really was odd.   Better this than a ringbear(er).   I saw Les Miserables in London.  The actress singing Eponine absolutely wrecked me with On My Own.  I think she noticed and kinda gave me a half smile/wink as she exited.  I've always wondered who she was.   Without clicking on it, I knew it'd be True Romance.  What a great film.  Excellent choice.   Heh.  There's something to this.  I worked on Connecticut and L in the early 90's and as I was walking home around 6pm, the strippers for those clubs near Sign of the Whale were just coming in.  Lots of interesting early 90's fashion choices...  No clue what's going on at 6am there though.   What on earth makes you think /r/law gives a rat's ass about anything in Bergen County?  What state is it in, for starters.     I always heard typhoid, smallpox, or some other disease common to Londoners who had built up resistance, but she from the New World had not.  She died shortly after visiting London and being received by Queen Elizabeth and treated with diplomatic respect.    Plus she and Rolfe had already had a child.  Syphilis would've prevented that, I think.   Cool enough.  Agreement: nbd.   Me, too.  My google-fu is weak, but I found this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoiFGva_JoY   I bet she knew this.  You'd think she'd wear flats to meet the president.     Five months ago on pics, but the rest are cross-posts.  My panties are not twisted.   I wonder why they arrested him in the first place?     The TV show was awesome from start to finish, though.   I agree.  I don't think BN ever fell off a cliff like the others.  There were too many iterations of evil secret organizations responsible for burning Michael, but that's forgivable for what the show was.   I've never seen it.  I've seen a telephone/internets cable, but not this one.   Shouldn't this car get ticketed on sight?  That poster's obscuring the rear view mirror's view.   What is the gun safety one like?  For $2 I'd buy it to mess with visitors to the house.   And now we know that Mrs. A. O. Teller of Honolulu came up with one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.   I regard the distinction as being the same as watching womens tennis.  The Williams sisters would get crushed by a male ranked in the top 200 (and did once -- he was slightly drunk, too) but they're still a lot of fun to watch.    I saw womens Olympic matches in '96 at RFK, and this after also having seen mens WC matches there two years earlier in '94.  What struck me was that the goalie couldn't kick the ball for a clear nearly as far as a mens goalie, but I was really impressed by their athleticism.     Way too many spoilers in this for those of us that haven't seen it yet.   The woman in front has full Theda Bara make-up on.  Even back then, I can't imagine somebody would wear that to the beach.   I wonder about that, too.  A cat who didn't like it would run away or decapitate him.  I dunno.  Maybe this guy secretly wants to get decapitated.   I live in DC and listen to WTOP all the time.  In his defense, he's a radio reporter -- and a very good one at that.  My bet is what you are reading is a transcription of an item he read on air.    Writing radio reports means brevity above all else.   Here's another article from the Washington Post.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/06/22/supreme-court-lets-its-nerd-flag-fly-with-comic-book-references-in-spider-man-toy-decision/  I loved the final paragraph.  She wasn't just geeking out for the sake of geeking out.   Please tell me this girl is now in a K-pop band.    kappa  What's this kappa stuff?     I've never thought of the USWNT as being particularly chirpy unless somebody lets Hope Solo get near a microphone without adult supervision.  Anyhow, I have a bad feeling about this match.     I didn't know the Brits relegated the games to third-tier broadcasters.  Promote the matches, get them on the air where everybody can see them, and I bet the audience would grow.  I'd imagine little English girls would be just as interested as little American girls, which is the core audience that seeded interest in the '99 WC.  It seems like this is just benighted broadcasters not realizing what they have on their hands.  Speaking of which:  in a pre-cable age the 1999 Womens World Cup  What?!  Cable was in most households by the early 80's.     Yeah this article is wikihole trap.    You could read about the entire Battle of the North Atlantic given enough time.    The ep where the woman who'd lost her family went to NYC was one of the single best eps of anything ever filmed.   That was nothing compared to Toy Story 2 when Jessie gets left behind in the box at the recycling kiosk and peeks out to see her grown-up little girl driving away.  They had Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."  Again: **Sarah McLachlan singing "When She Loved Me."**   Whoa!  It's Swiss?  I would've thought it was an indigenous drum from say Indonesia that I'd never heard about.  While listening to it, I did think she was using Western musical patterns though.  So at least I had that going for me.   Ed Grimley might be able to offer something:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvbQKSaYQD8   Whoa.  I always thought Kansas was almost dry and Missouri gloriously wet.    Funny that the former dry holdout approves things faster.   For all the Anglo-hatred Joe Kennedy had, he sure seemed to like having the women in his family be Anglophiles.   "That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works!"   Many thanks!  So you find yourself being able to ship to only certain states?    Did you ever meet Battle?     Did you do this before the Matildas won?  If not, get thee to Vegas.   There's a Joe Jackson (who is English) song from I think the Mad World album, released in the late 80's where here's talking about a WWII vet who lost his leg and says "no more soccer for you!"  Whether he changed the line for the US market, I don't know.     States can operate in parallel to the federal government.  I read that a state contested Flying Dog's Raging Bitch.    It's ultimately apparent that they're talking about canines so the word bitch in the context isn't pejorative.  Whatever state it was withdrew the challenge, but the feds had already let it go through.  My bet is that you need to get pre-approved for federal purposes but the states can challenge it as they see fit.   I love the kitten at the bottom keeping time.   Driving might -- might -- make sense if you drive around the Beltway and come into town from the east, but the I-66 direct route will be miserable and you might miss the show.    Metro will be crowded but at least you'd be likely to get a seat on the way in.     A similar thing happened to my hometown paper during the Virginia Tech shootings -- The Roanoke Times.  None of the cable outfits could get into Blacksburg due to high winds keeping them from landing and the Times did an outstanding job breaking the story and the aftermath.     We got hail in Georgetown.  I picked a couple up and they're in my freezer.  One's quarter sized the other nickel  My cat was traumatized.   BFA!   Adorable little kid with the snow cone.   WIPE THAT SMUG SMILE OFF YOUR FACE HITLER.   For the Watch.   I just tuned in, looked at the score, and was all "what, did the game start at 11am?!"   That was terrific!  The Anderson Sisters harmony, blue T-shirt girl knowing how to dance that way... WHAT FUN!   Oh they do but I don't think they've ever heard of "leg day."   Compare and contrast to Nathan Fillion:  http://www.newamericanjackets.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Tv-Firefly-Malcolm-Reynolds-Nathan-Fillion-Coat-Jacket.jpg   Four stomachs?  I always wondered why their chests are so massive.   As soon as I see somebody wearing a V for Vendetta mask, I disregard them.     I have never understood how the Larry Niven Ringworld series hasn't been filmed.   You are completely mis-remembering it.  Spiro Agnew resigned as VP long before Watergate broke.  Nixon's choice to replace him was Gerald Ford, who became president upon his resignation.   That's not true -- Deep Throat was Woodward's source and his alone. I don't think Bernstein knew his identity until Felt announced himself.  Plus, Vanity Fair got the scoop because a Felt family lawyer handled the announcement, which resulted in the Post being scooped by someone else because Woodward and Bradlee couldn't comment until they had confirmed that Felt had come forth.  Very odd situation.     If you are referencing Silver Streak, I might have to say mean things on the internet.   Ordering Instructions 1. please specify aircraft    Whoa that's a great idea.  I wish were like the Duke basketball fans and could get everybody on the same page pre-game.   It was Michelle Pfeiffer's first big role, though.  I'll always thank Hollywood for that.  Never seen the movie though.         I didn't want to karma whore, but go the Post.  The line on top of us right now is nothing compared to the next one, which ought to be here in maybe a half hour.  It's not a derecho but it could get bumpy.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/   Stachowski's occasionally has a turkey mac   cheese as a dinner special.  It's delicious.     He changed his jersey every inning?  How many do they have?   I know!  It was great to see him.   The next time I see Tabata coming my way, I will cross the street.  That is how angry I am.   I gotta say: way to go MASN for not going to commercials!   What a dick move by Tabata.    Petition to put him on the permanent /r/nationals shit list.   OH NO!   Aspirin asperin dammit where is the aspirin?!   I actually got chills go down my spine  when Max took the field.  This is really something.  RENDON!!!   Thank you!  I saw this on /r/dc and thought "hmm, I wonder where else people might like to see this..."  Anyhow, adding some context to the story, this is in Adams-Morgan (thus the play on the bar's name), which at the time had been having a spree of pop-up electronic music dance parties occurring in unlicensed venues.     This is what chimed in /r/dc :   I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues. So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.         Maybe.  I think ABRA was concerned about the onslaught of those dance clubs that would pop up in unlicensed venues.  So in order to stomp them out, they had to ding up Madam's Organ to show that they were enforcing noise violations across the board.    Those pop up dance clubs were apparently really annoying.       I hope you've been catching him on Halt and Catch Fire.  It's a completely different vibe from Pushing Daisies -- more menacing.      Go down to Half Street and get your car inspected.  It's a much easier process than it used to be -- I've sailed through the past couple of years.   Contest the ticket online.  I'd say you have a 90% chance of them waiving the ticket.      in the 80s  Oddly enough, 1985.  Aspen.  New Year's Eve.  My girlfriend at the time was a ski instructor.  I also met Barbara Eden on the same trip.     OH WOW!  Could you post the Bridges complaint?  Force gets all the press.   What can you possibly do when you have "DEA Agent Mark Force IV (best name ever)" in the mix.   Poor guy.  He ran hard at these guys, then got too close to the flames.   Da!  	199
 Okay somine was set at around 8100 MB. My recommended was 12226 MB. So I changed it to 12226MB. I don't see how thatll make much of a diff though if it was set at 8GB   Oh I have 8GB of RAM. and 920GB of C drive   didnt help   When I set the resolutions higher i got that error message though   1920X 1080  but i never use this because it messes up trying to watch movies since it duplicates over to my tv screen. My TV is basically my monitor.   When the resolution was high in the game I got the bad text. When I brought it down to 800X600 the text was fine and better.    Well my monitor is connected to my 55inch 4k TV. I have an HP all in one 23inch monitor for my computer.   I changed the resolution to 800X600 and everything seems fine now.   I looked at screen resolution on the background of my desktop and it says 1024 by 768 so should i do that for the game too?    Edit; So I went to full screen which fixed the text issues you see in the picture. However he game won't run full screen. I keep getting [this error message](http://imgur.com/7pfovpp)  I went back to windowed mode but still getting the same error message and can't play the game now.    Also, I am a noob and have never played before. Well I played for like a few hours a year ago and got to lvl . Can't remember how to fix any of this.   Edit; So I went to full screen which fixed the text issues you see in the picture. However he game won't run full screen. I keep getting [this error message](http://imgur.com/7pfovpp)      3f4dksa  djjtghehw s fewdrilsltoassessyourstrength shaeolkf drilskajghe   OP Pls deliver. Pls   i didnt.    Well that's crap. I want a choice.    DUDE! I just saw you in another thread. You were late to that shit too!!   says the massive cock.    Pls OP    IO   agreed. it's fun. I like the strategy    ....starting right mrow   So much fun!! I like it better than splatzones. I wish though we could choose between the two. I wonder why we can't?   This sniper was up on one of the pillars at Kelp Dome picking us off so, lol, I just went the long way around snuck up from behind and BAM. It's fun surprising people, it's why I like the Ink Mines. I always like running up to people and plopping it down for a suicide kill.    its problematic.    For a minute that it said Australia. ....was thinking that's not right   You sound horny   Cocking for three   Cocking for three   I hope so!   Yeah, I get the logic. That's absolutely correct. However...   I had 10 comm errors 4v3 matches out of 20 at one point. That's crazy.   Also, cats were outnumbered and we still won the battles.    You fuckbitch popnutter.    I dunno got to be millions by now.    very okay.    Well. damn. that was a waste of time.    So the answer is no, there is nothing else I can do with them besides reroll abilities   Edit: Why am I being down voted? I just think super sea snails should at least get you something you can't get with regular gold you make during matches.    I actually was hoping he would answer the question of what this graph is and means instead of making a debate about inferences in comments.    I don't really care about the individual level though or the fallacy in this data, I want to know what it is saying.    I got 18 of them. What do I do with them? I already have all my clothes with three slots each, and I've already bought all clothes available and I have about 500K gold. What else can I use the super sea snails for? Can I buy something with them that I can't get with regular gold?  Or are they pretty much useless for me?   I dunno what you're doing then lol.    K a couple things I do.   1. I don't follow my teammates.   2. I get the edges my teammates miss and then I splat the large areas and try to avoid enemies.   3. I can't stress this enough, but I go away from my teammates we aren't trying to cover the same ground, if they follow me I go somewhere else..QUICK   Cats were outnumbered and we still won the battles!   it felt good to win! Good job fellow felines!!    sure Aero RG. splat as much ground as u can and use your Nuke often. Kelp Dome is a mine field. I don't really worry so much with killing people as I do splatting ground.    no. i play ranked. but not often. i find i get paid more from regular, in ranked you have the possibility of getting nothing if you lose. but with regular you get paid gold every single time depending on how much you splat. and with the aero gun i can get 1700-2200 a round.    Yes, I did. You know how easy it is to get 1 million gold? It takes me a day of playing to get 500k gold.   Super Sea Snails are worthless. If you have gold you don't need them.    I sure did.    Yeah.    Age 15    "Revert completed"    Hmm sounds like Blankman    I hate it I'll be covering ground on one end at the very beginning and this guy is behind me on his roller going over what I already splatted.    I'm not a vegan. That's why I give my cat whatever the fuck he wants.    Munchkin cat*    this little light of mine.    Baby Blue   Purple People Eater    Nope. we arent.    I'm a cat and I lost 10 in a row earlier. (I had 5 teams with only 3 players, one team with two players, and the other four we lost by 5-10 percentage points- close matches)  I tend to lose when I have a sniper on my team they only get like 2-300 points a round unfortunately.    I like coming up with nicknames for the colors used.   My first one was Pepto Pink. (Like Pepto Bismol)   What else you got inklings?   Stay fresh!!   Yeah it's a shame we don't get some Pepto pink in there.    very straight   Very minor....now I KNOW...you can think of word that better explains a small amount than very minor.    Not really. I've played in 10 games with just 3 teammates.    Dad aint got shit on me.    Fiscal   U fuck!ng wh4t m8? ou little !tch. 'll have you know I topped my [N4VY] SEAL class, and 1v1'd all of them with 360F twiksh0t3s.   I typically leave if there a teammate who follows me.    You're not alone I had 6   I did. Yes.    Yeah hopefully they debut the two new ones.    I am just B- in Ranked. I don't play ranked too often because i don't like splat zones, waiting to see how tower is. I use the aero gun and get about 1700-1900 a round in turf war. And I played for like 10 hours once on a binge so I got A LOT of gold. I bought all the clothes. Don't know what else to do other than buy an amiibo to do those challenges. It's fairly easy to get lots of gold quick. There's nothing to spend it on so it keeps saving.    I looked on their [wiki or website](http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Splatfest#Reward_Tiers). It says 12 Snails for King/Queen 8 i think for Champion. You don't get anything else. All you get is re-roll abilities or extra slot to get to 4 slots.   Stages "As well as existing stages, the first North American Splatfest may feature currently unreleased stages.[5]:  Moray Towers Camp Triggerfish"   I like Kelp Dome. The others I'm pretty tired of. Night is meh   Nah you're not. I got to Cat King in 3 hours and now there's nothing to do. Maybe if there was a gauge or something who said who was in the lead Team Cat or Team Dog, it would be fun to still play and want to win, but now that I am maxed out it's just like regular turf war at lvl 20.   12 Sea Snails is cool but what am I gonna do with them? I already have 500K gold, it's not like I need to talk to Spyke for anything.    Phase 1: Collect Underpants   Phase 2:   Phase 3: Profit   I'm now Cat King. .....now what lol   No.    you know from experience do ya?   Victoria Taylor was let go   we are all bots except you      Great. What is his proof besides "someone close to reddit?" Sorry man but you see lots of that stuff. It's all speculation.   We don't deserve to know because it's not professional for a business to disclose why they fired an employee. It doesn't matter that we use the site and generate posts or not. That is irrelevant in the firing of an employee for a business. It sucks she got let go, was a big mistake by Reddit. But it is not our business to know why she was let go, it is our business on what they are doing to rectify the situation and their mistakes.    I can give you the tools you need to get that one.

I've been on reddit a while on this username and my others, but this has made me question quitting reddit.   Again, it's not a shame the mods stood with solidarity over being treated poorly.

It's thirty years old and, in the magic community, it's short hand for a douchey or hacky magician.   It's the dad joke of magic.   That was what it was supposed to feel like. Part of the genesis for the book was the author trying to capture what it would be like for a video game character to exist in the real world.    The last one he had completely forgotten who I was and launched into his sales script.   I spoke to them previous and spoke to John again this morning who said I shouldn't receive emails because I'm not on their list!    done that too!   Over and over.  I rang his boss, the ray white head office and him!     I've started doing that   I've done that sadly.   Thanks, although I'm not sure that would help. It might make look petty. (which I am...)   I had dealings with Ray White about 18 months ago. It wasn't a pleasant experience and I would recommend them.  Since then, a man named Jason Voglis from the agency has not stopped calling me and emailing me with sales calls and spam.   I tried calling his boss AND Ray White head office but nothing much seems to happen.   EDIT: Had a call from his boss today saying I should have been taken off the list and that he couldn't explain what was going on. I rattled off everything you guys had mentioned below. He seem a bit rattled. Hopefully that's it.   EDIT 2: Nope. Wasn't it. Still got more emails.  Any thoughts how I can stop this guy?    Someone needs to stop being a perspective tool   With a lot of music, the words themselves don't require literal meaning. Instead it's how they *sound* that gives the song meaning or emotion.  A lot of hip hop is best compared to nonsense verse like Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll or even the experimental works of James Joyce. "  All mimsy were the borogoves / and the mome raths outgrabe." in Jabberwocky doesn't make a lot of sense but sounds great just like "scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap" doesn't mean a damn thing when Ghostface Killah raps it.  In hop hop, the focus is often on the rhythm and lyricism of the words, not what they are saying. I would imagine the trend comes from freestyle rap where in order to keep up with the beat, the rapper drops in nonsense words or words that make no sense in that context.  TL;DR - "The sound of the words is more important than the meaning" said the whitest man ever.          And yet, I still found myself worried.    Christ that's rapey.

Thanks!  I think you've hit the nail on the head in pointing out I am an entertainer.    I know! Just awful.   There is currently a trend towards plain suits in magic. Trouble is, it makes them all look like bankers   lawyers and, in the eyes of bookers, interchangeable.  Also, while I am a magician, I specialise in a very specific area of magic and would like to stand out.      1. Write hot and edit cold.   2.

By the end of a filming day, I'd feel terrible for all the people we'd hustled.   A basic six page site with a blog.      I do con artist magic: Card cheating, shell game, three card monte. You can check out my stuff here: www.conman.com.au.  David Blaine is less interesting today because now we have so many people just like him. However, so many of those performers owe him and Paul Zenon (the man who introduced street magic to the UK) a debt.  Not a fan of Criss Angel. He uses camera tricks and stooges. I prefer guys like David Kwong and Justin Flom. Check out Wizard Wars. By buddy Rick created it.  Penn and Teller and amazing. The Amazing Jonathan also. I am none of them. I have Jonathan's beard, Penn's physique and teller's hairline.         Thanks, that was brilliant.   I struggle to find quality designers for my sites. The last great site I had was eight years ago and that company was bought out my a larger operation and their prices increased by 500%. Now, i'm stuck trying to find a good designer who can help me with what I want.  I feel like the only choices I have is to pay $2000-$3000 for a site that isn't what I want or $9 per month for a site that isn't amazing but that I can, at the very least, fiddle with until it limps into usable.   It's a problem that others in my industry face with many designer their own sites. The two guys I know with great sites by great developers got mates rates from a friend.         You're...a grandma?   Not even sister act 2?!!?!? Now I don't know what to believe    All good!     For me...  The Best: Magicians The Worst: Now You See Me   And makes no sense!   Are you new to human interaction? This kind of jackanapery in reddit has being downvoted since forever...   Aren't they on html5 now?   What about the templates are unprofessional? As a non-designer, I can see sites I do and don't like but I'm not sure what makes them unprofessional.  I have several people in my market with wix sites on the front page of google who've done only basic SEO. I've done a little reading on Ajax crawling and it seems to get the job done.  I've seen terribly designed wordpress sites, many using templates, made by amateurs out of their depth who just don't understand WP's complexities.   What about a WP site helps non-designers make their own sites easier than wix?          Wix seems to get a lot of hate here. As a non-designer, I struggle to nail people down on EXACTLY what is bad about the site.  For me, the big downside is that anyone can make their own site, which means people who don't know design end up with a dull template OR a design of their own that stinks.  It puts web design in the hands of people who have no business designing sites.  However, if a user has a keen eye for design and doesn't need to complex a site, what is the problem with using Wix?  EDIT: I think I have a better understanding now of the problems a designers have with. Broadly speaking, I see a lot of parallels between this issue and publishing/self-publishing. A lot of publishers get very annoyed with self-published books. The quality is low, they are packed full of mistakes and they price traditional publishers out of the business. However, publishers have had to learn to suck it up and learn to live in a DIY world. Perhaps web designers will too.         This is not a place to offer nuanced arguments.   That movie offends me as a magician and a writer.  Truly terrible.   Wow! That one is brutal.    It feels a little at odds with my idea of American liberty that the government, particularly the military, would try to tell people how they can and can not honour the flag.       Really? Is that a law? Or just an American custom?

Thanks. Will look into it.    I'm looking for recommendations. It's one of those industries that is full of fly by nighters.   You sure about that? You want some Irishman to steal her away? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljPFZrRD3J8   I'm looking for someone in Sydney who can come and record a show I'm doing at a conference in November.   It would be a two camera shoot for 30 minutes.   Any suggestions?   Thanks, I've changed the Legend page and removed the tape as well as some of those low res pics. Eventually, I'd like a video on the opening page.     It *IS* a show not a school :)      I'd consider using less text. I drifted off a little.

I read it as a kid and it scared the hell out of me. One of the stories describes the joker cracking someone's head open like a watermelon. The image stayed with me for years.   You know who'd say something like that don't you?   We have our own Brooklyn too.    I figured out the the big difference between Australian and American coffee, aside from the style, was the strength. Often, I'd dismiss coffee as being bad when, in reality, it was just week.   My favourite coffee experience of the trip was at service station half way between LA and Vegas where they had 10 different pots of coffee on the boil, twelve different syrups, six different types of "milk", four types of sweetener and a selection of whipped creams, sprinkles, chocolate etc.   It summed up the American experience for me. It's a country founded on choice, where they'd rather have a thousand terrible choices than two or three good ones.   It was OK. Not great but we told him we loved it.    Australians have a rep for being picky (i.e. assholes) when it comes to coffee.   While I was in New York I tried to find the best coffee place I could. Some hipsters recommended this little hole in the wall near Chelsea Market. Just a counter, a coffee machine and beans.   The Barista was a massive douche to every single person in line. Soup Nazi levels.   When we got to the front of the line and he heard our accents his face went white.  "You Australians?" "Yep." "From Melbourne?" "Uh-huh" "Ok...well...I'll do my best OK?"      Good that stuff is the bane of my existance. So expensive and so many people instagraming pictures of it.      I never realised the idea of being able to get good food AND good coffee in the same place was a 'melbourne thing'     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXSUKNCNCMo      DIRECT LINK: http://www.memorymakesus.org.au/live-authors/melbourne/#tabs-3   Brilliant! Thank you!    Cool! Except, that wasn't my story.  You need to click LIES.      In Australia, the screw top has become more popular than the cork.   Less taint (*snigger*)  and oxidation.

Of course, there are several vaguely unsatisfying theories about how he escaped.  1) Few pantries can be locked from the outside. There is a handle on the door.

He froze to death in the unheated room and the chase through the maze was his crazed mind created a reason for the lowering temperature.  4) Danny let him out and he knew the maze well enough to get in and out, leaving Jack stuck in the middle. He wanted to kill Jack.        When the ghost lets Jack out of the freezer.

 Why not just go one step further? Percentage systems, by your reasoning, are the absolute best. You literally just decide a percentage and *that's the percentage*.   That "easy to figure out" thing you just explained is about 100 times more complicated than 2d6. I don't have to figure out percentages. With a smaller range (and thus, smaller, more meaningful bonuses), and most of the die rolls falling in the middle of the range, you can simply say "This is a hard door" and it's the same difficulty no matter what level the players are. And because of the distribution of die rolls being in the middle of the range, players can actually count on doing pretty well most of the time.   The only d20 games that I enjoy playing (for the game itself, I can have fun with anything if I have the right people), is Cypher System and D D5e.   Cypher System isn't even a real d20 (I run it all the time using d6s, and I barely have to change anything). It increases or decreases difficulty in increments of 3 (roughly 15% change in success), and it *still* feels way to swingy from that huge d20 die. The thing that really makes it excusable is that you can expend effort to lower the difficulty of a task, and you can burn points to reroll a bad roll, giving the player a bit of control over their fate.  D D5e does an okay job of getting rid of the problems of a d20 with Inspiration and Advantage/Disadvantage. Most of the time it's essentially a 2d20DL system, and has a much different distribution of results than say, 3.5/PF or 4e. Also, for anyone reading this, I highly recommend bumping the max number of Inspiration to 3. You can thank me later.   I think the Sith see that more as a guideline than an actual rule. Like pirates.   Except that then the dice don't matter. I like to have skill and luck matter.  Also, unless you point out a specific game system, this conversation is too general to really make any real sense.   Other people nailed it. I think someone who knows what they are doing is going to do what they do most of the time, and rarely have it be spectacularly bad or good. With a single die system, and especially a large die like a d20, whether you are good at something almost never comes up; it's mostly whether or not you were lucky.  Now, for some games I actually like the crazy swingy die of death (like in Paranoia), but for a serious long term campaign, 2d6 lets players feel like they are more in control of their own fate, but there is still some luck going on to spice things up.   We should make this a guessing game for mobile users.   2d6 dice system, two class system, tactical combat, flexible narrative control for players, ridiculous number of options for players to customize their characters, amazing setting, magic that doesn't trump martial characters even at high levels, genuinely non-vancian magic, exciting combats that don't take several hours, and that's enough for now [Iron Kingdoms](/spoiler)  Using descriptions of things as actual rules benefits and penalties [Fate](/spoiler)  An attempt at bounded accuracy [D D 5e](/spoiler)  A detailed system for generating star systems, and a system for players to develop their own faction to interact with other interstellar factions [Stars Without Number](/spoiler)  I unique dice system that generates narrative during combat with non-linear results [Star Wars: Edge of the Empire](/spoiler)  A simple core mechanic that allows the GM to create content on the fly with ease [Cypher System](/spoiler)  A GM-less universe-building system with the ability to cooperatively create a timeline of thousands of years [Microscope RPG](/spoiler)   Aside from the shoulder, you can also glue his wrist to his hip. You might even be able to bend it a bit so you can glue the edge of the sword to the base. If you are having problems with that arm, you might want to be careful with the other pieces too. That bird is awfully precarious on his arm.  If you absolutely don't want it coming loose, you'll need to pin it.   [It sounds amazing.](https://youtu.be/hEB5FlAI_2I)  edit: oh, sorry for the Disney Star Wars spoilers.   For running games for your friends that don't live nearby, it's great. I had been using a number of other options for virtual tabletops and kept bouncing around looking for one that was reliable. Once I found roll20 I haven't needed to look for another since. It had the most important things I was looking for: stability, and ease of use (for the players, at least). I had problems with so many other VTTs, and it got so bad I almost gave up entirely, but roll20 is just what I need. It also has a lot of really nice features, like character sheets and macros, that are a nice bonus. I have ran D D 4e/5e, Gamma World, Numenera, Fate, Rogue Trader, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, and numerous homebrew systems without any problems on there. Some worked a little better than others, but usually it just took a little more work for some of them to start running smooth.  Finding random internet people to play with is a different thing though. You may as well plan it as a one-shot, because you will probably lose about 60% of your group every month or so. It's just the nature of the thing. It's also very hard to get people you can really connect with. It's not bad to scratch an itch, but it's not the same as playing with a real group. I'm not saying it's not possible to make friends on the internet and have it turn into a real group, it just doesn't normally go that way.   I was like you.  I picked all of them.   I love doing this kind of thinking. It works so great to really give otherworldly beings a sense of the unknowable.  Examples:  All of a sudden, the alien "attacks" stop outside a certain area. It's possible to sneak into the area, but if the aliens catch you, it's a quick and brutal death, with your corpse discarded just outside the area. = We try to clear our house of ants, and if we see one, we squish it and throw it outside (or in the garbage).  You seem to make somewhat friendly contact with an alien. It doesn't seem to understand you, but follows you, watching you, and then for seemingly no reason, starts trying to kill you. = Kids watch ants, and kill them, basically at random.   Aliens have been abducting people (with no real rhyme or reason as to who they take), doing strange tests, and keeping the bodies in a storage facility. Occasionally they will bring out one of the older abductees, do more tests, and put them back, but for the most part they just keep them in storage and observe them. = People having butterfly collections.  Settlers struggling to survive in an alien land find food left out for them from aliens that otherwise have avoided all contact. It turns out to be poisonous. At first it's unsure whether it was intentional or just a misunderstanding. That is, until death machines fly overhead spraying aerosolized toxins all over the settlement. = Leaving pest poison out, and when that doesn't work, spraying for them.   Not to "out" them (NDA being a possible thing), but I happen to know that one of my local stores gets PP stuff exactly 60% of retail.   Whipblade covered your question pretty good, but I actually recommend getting the adventure kit box. You can look at the rules and adventure it comes with [here](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/146332/Iron-Kingdoms-Unleashed-An-Introduction-to-Savagery). That's all the written material from the box for free. I got the box anyway. The minis alone are worth the price for me, but the map tiles are really great too, and it gives you a mini rulebook to pass around during the game.   Also, if you are talking about the [Undercity](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/board-games/the-undercity) game coming out it August, it's not *directly* compatible. It's a board game, and while the rules look like they are very similar to the RPG, they are almost definitely not compatible. However, it's going to have *tons* of minis, and probably the same quality map tiles as the adventure kit.   [Here](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf)'s a link to the other IKRPG starter adventure. I recommend running one or both of them to see how you like it, and then going from there.   You're going into a pretty hazy area of definition that doesn't really work with the alignment system. In reality, my alignment is a many layered thing, that changes depending on the specific topic at hand. Evil isn't even something that can really be defined as an absolute all or nothing thing.  Essentially, I don't think anyone else is qualified to be in control. I put myself above absolutely everyone else because I don't trust anyone. If given the opportunity to seize power by force, I would take it. Would I use that power for good? Maybe, but all the good I would accomplish would come at a terrible cost, and I would almost certainly use it for some evil.   The problem with this being neutral is what is left for evil? Only people who are maniacal psychotics qualify as evil? Aren't they probably just incapable of empathy? Doesn't that make them less instead of more culpable than someone who knows the pain they are causing and doing it anyway? I would think that that makes them no longer on a scale of human morality, that since they can't perceive good, they can't be judged by it. Like a rabid dog who kills a child. You have to stop it, even though it's not evil. Is killing a madman hurting him or helping him? Would locking him up be more or less torturous? Who decides if he deserves more or less torture?  I can call myself evil because I don't hold myself to such a high regard that I can believe I am without guilt, without sin, without a trail of darkness stemming from my actions, regardless of my intentions. I don't have enough information to judge others, I have only enough information to judge myself. If I come out at the end of this life as neutral, it is due to outside circumstances affording me that privilege, as I am willing to commit evil.   What do you think it needed for social interaction that it doesn't have? Is there a game that you can point to that you would say does it right?   I still don't understand when people say this. I have a couple problems with IKRPG, none of which are lack of non-combat options. What would you say it doesn't have rules for?  Also, what is an example of a game that has what you are looking for in terms of non-combat rules?   Since absolutely no one else is saying it, I'm going to point out the only time playing canon characters is fun: pre-mades. If it's a one-shot, I think it'd be perfectly fine to hand out sheets of the really cool guys that people would recognize. Anything else though, and no one is going to like it.   I also have a half-and-half Kromac. My Molik Karn and Corollary are the same way. I actually really like how it cuts the weight down. I haven't tried painting any of them yet, so I can't say for sure if I'll notice a difference, but I don't think there'll be any problems.   Genocide, slavery, and oppression aren't evil? Sweet. I'm going to call Hitler and Stalin and tell them they weren't that bad.   Believing you are good while you do the same thing as someone who knows they are evil does not make you less evil.   Lawful Evil, and I'm the good guy.  The world needs someone to control it to keep it from tearing itself apart. To insure your future, some freedoms must be surrendered.    I'm a big Searforge fan, so #49 was awesome to me.    Microscope RPG   Here's what I do, for any kind of check: if they roleplay well, waive the roll.   If someone gives an inspiring speech, I don't make them roll, it just works (because it was inspiring).   If someone tackles a guy off a balcony to crash into another guy below, it just works (because it was awesome).  The dice should only really be brought in when you aren't sure what would be cooler, failure or success.    People don't suggest removing Strength to encourage roleplaying because you don't have random heavy objects laying about to physically get out of your seat and lift to see whether or not you succeed (at least I don't).  However, I have to agree that removing the stat is a bad idea. Not everyone is naturally charismatic, or intelligent, or wise, but that doesn't mean their character can't be.   I **do** think rewarding people who bring those kinds of special skills to the table is a good idea, though. I usually waive the roll if they roleplay well, and that's for any of the attributes (even Strength).    I recommend using the [Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) rules to run Eberron. I've done it before, and it makes for a grittier, more "war-torn" feel.    Thanks.  That's life. I've had a lot of really great games end before their time, it's just how things go.     They had to contend with other businesses doing shady things to put them out of business, deal with criminal elements trying to use their club as a place of "business", keep corrupt political officials off their back, handle shipping problems for their product, and then deal with trying to make customers happy (or keep them from wrecking the place); all while managing the money in order to make a profit.   I think the key to keeping it entertaining was having very "colorful" enemies that the players couldn't really just kill off. I based their profits on how well the handled the little side quests. If it went well, profits went up, if it went okay, they stayed the same, and if it went bad, it caused a dip in their bottom line. I told them if their profit got low enough they would have to shut down, but it never came to that.  They were getting really big with clubs in four major cities, but we had 2 of the 4 people drop out of the game because of real life. I was working on converting the Stars Without Number faction mechanics to get them into an international "corporation" sort of game, but I didn't get to try it out.    I ran a game for a while where the players were nightclub owners.   Other than that, I have to agree that PP has most of it covered.   I couldn't help but think of [this](https://youtu.be/a_NirAeZqig).   Damn, Doomy makes a great Gul'dan.   edit: makes me want to do a Gul'Doomy, with a Mulg Infernal.  edit2: I see you went for Pyre Troll Infernal, nice.  edit3: Well shit, I just noticed you're the Borderlands Warmachine guy. I love your stuff.   I was hoping someone mentioned IKRPG here.   People have actually been doing this already with IKRPG (myself included): [link](http://privateerpressforums.com/showthread.php?122017-Warmachine-munda) [link](http://privateerpressforums.com/showthread.php?32410-Gangs-of-Five-Fingers)  Necromunda was basically this a long time ago, and it's ridiculously fun.    I've had too many problems with it starting arguments over what actually happens with real world physics. One guy will quote his high school physics teacher, another will cite an article he read, and another guy will bring up a Mythbusters episode, all with different beliefs as to what would happen. This is an even bigger problem when it comes to combat. I ran a game with a veteran and an MMA fighter, and they would interrupt the game to demonstrate how they were right on each other. It was still fun, but I don't think I could handle doing it again.  Since I am not a physicist (or any kind of real world warrior), and I don't routinely interact with action oriented physics, I stick to what I know: movie physics. Besides, explosive decompression is so much cooler than what really happens.   This could actually be really cool. I'm not going to put any time or effort into setting it up, but I'd definitely run a couple one-shots for it for the opportunity to play in a few.  I am worried that the online IKRPG community is pretty damn small, and it would probably end up being the same as if you had a sandbox West-Marches style game with maybe two GMs.   I'm interested.   I absolutely agree with you.   It all depends on the kind of game you are going for. If you are going for hyper-realistic hard scifi, then that sort of thing is fine.   However, when I run scifi games, I make sure to tell people I'm using movie physics, not real-world physics, and what works is based more on whether or not it sounds cool and makes the game interesting.   I did. I've been hooked ever since.   Aside from the problem everyone else has pointed out (the fact that you are basically reinventing the wheel), I'm going to address the actual issue you talked about.   Having a rules system without a setting means that it's not going to work for any setting without adjustments. Unless you are planning on including guides for all of that too, it's probably best to pick a setting that it works best for and go with that. People can always ignore the setting and use the system if they want to use it for another setting.  Odds are, if the rules you have are any good, they are probably best for a fairly specific setting. If you have that setting in mind, presenting your rules as part of it also shows them in the best possible light to your target audience. If you say your rules are good for any setting, and I try to use them for one you didn't have in mind, I'm probably going to be disappointed with my experience.   Minitaur Bardbarian. People will just think you have a speech impediment.    What /r/Russano_Greenstripe said.   [This](http://ikrpg.info/Index/) is a pretty good resource for seeing what is in each issue. Generally, there is about 2 to 3 articles for IKRPG in it. The price is a bit high if you are only in it for the IKRPG articles, but not too bad if you cherry pick the ones you really want (I absolutely love the one about Rhulic warcasters and jacks, and can't live without it, and there is a similar one for Cyriss options).    The adventure "Dirty Deeds" from No Quarter #52 is all about mercenaries and charters. It's probably the best "official" source of inspiration.   Other than that it's just about doing trial and error. Pick something that sounds right, and adjust based on how you feel it's doing.  	41
 why iOS 6 ?   truth is, the engine started !   Yes, in the end it all comes to that :D I'm waiting for the new model since I don't work in the Summer but if you need a machine now, it's definitely a great computer and you won't regret it !   Got it, it's a nice feature.   I'll tell them I've bought an Harley Davidson   I think it's the best looking golf ever   Hammond called Jezza idiot instead of ape, interesting   Clarkson and his presents, so original   skylake will have better performance compared to haswell/broadwell. The current model uses haswell cpus, the new ones will be a bit faster, as usual, and have better efficiency ! My bet is the new skylake macs will have a new design since thunderbolt 3 uses usb-c and Apple loves thunderbolt.   My bet is the middle of the pond   I'll give it a try, thnks    Why the downvotes ? I was saying what they always say   I know the new early 2015 13" MacBook is pretty much silent. Sure it'll become audible if you push it. you'll hear the noise but it's not intrusive     Only Apple ahah   the 12'' MacBook would be better for your Portability and lightness priority. However, you'll have to pay for it,  and for the same price you can have the retina MacBook which is faster and is also very portable   My iPhone is jailbroken and it lasts over 2 days. Sure it's not used intensively but it has WiFi enabled all the time, LTE occasionally, a few tweaks and themes with Winterboard. You can try it, if you dislike having it, just restore it   Do you have to tap in the corner to go back ? If you have, it's not easy to reach the top corner   They're very similar, we can argue until the world ends but it's just a question of OS   they will break another record with the new iPhone    why did you took so long in the shower ? Well, I was calculating the profit Apple made every second in the last quarter   if you say something and no one hears it, does it mean you didn't say anything ?   Springtomize   don't need DFU, just hit restore from backup in iTunes   update to the beta instead of restoring, and you're good to go   the new one is expected, as usual, in October   in these cases more is always better but i've used a 2014 13'' rMBP with 8GB of Ram and it handled photoshop and illustrator at the same time pretty well. Sure, if you open more apps it'll start to compress memory but the ssd is so fast it doesn't slow down   upgrade the ram if you can, you'll see minor gains in the cpu though   [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1lLlBNzGC78ETjzcSaTpkugLUBqB2wQa2__gxDc10Yl0/htmlview?sle=true pageId=103881257180359508489 pageId=116587378827899317556)   I used Alfred in Mavericks, but I stopped using it when Yosemite came out with the new spotlight   Since you said you're computer is dying and running hot and slow I guess it'd make a difference ...

 More housing stock would temper it a good bit. We haven't been building enough.    God-mode lifestyle choice is getting a good degree or high income job in a low cost of living state.   Engineers or nurses in those kind of environments can make some serious headway in their financial lives    1.6-2k miami   What is fucked is that the elderly/"low income" people get these sweet apartments subsidized, and middle class or like 80 percent of the country get fucked.   The luxury condos often are allowed to be built at a higher density if they have a portion that is below market rent. Now this goes beyond the federal affordable housing programs, and makes rhe upper middle class responsible for housing the urban poor,which is controveral in the firdt place. It is like taxing your home.   What it also does is upbids and increases the price that the middle class has to pay, as there are even larger blocks of people who are taking up housing stock at a subsidized rate.    Really I think zoning needs to be relaxed in many places to promote infill, smaller units, multifamily, and independently managed apartments.    It is most profitable to only do luxury units because they make more money and have more stable clients, so when the government puts a bunch of red tape on a market that has little interest in it, it is pretty damn hard.    I wish we had more unconventional housing in odds and ends,  on top of buildings, multistory, housing connected to workplaces and the like.   Europe has a lot more housing like that, but instead we have our workplace/entertainment/housing rigidly seperated thanks to zoning in most places. My large street where I lived a while back had no food/gas on the whole street because all of it was zoned residential, and it seemed like such a clusterfuck not to have those amenities.   Even the rental market is heating up a good bit, but there are so few units vacant and new ones are at a higher price point, so many people don't save money doing it.   I will likely just get roomates well into my future as a young professional and invest the saved money.   I will not pay 1450 a month in rent plus utilities and comcast to boot. I am more than happy to share a washing machine and actually keep my money.   If housing prices weren't artificially subsidized by the mortgage interest deduction, the deductability of taxes on a house, and artificially low interest policies/zero interest rate policies, the value of homes would fall back into equilibrium. Somethinng like a lower multiple of average yearly income than where it is now.    A lot of communities that are older fear too many kids will raise property taxes, which fund schools. Having only seniors move into their city/neighborhood can in theory save a little bit on taxes in the short term, but really hinders the region. This kind of thing forces young and middle aged people to commute from further out if they are going to work a job.   It really is discriminatory and needs to be cracked down on.

 Here is the thing.  Sometimes a ban is necessary. If you post naked pictures of children, you should be banned.  If you post the name, address, and photo of a person, with a message like "someone needs to rape this bitch", you should be banned.  If you upload videos of yourself killing people, you should be banned.  Of course, they should also send the information to the authorities.  So, you can't promise "No Banning, whatsoever" without opening yourself up to legal liability.  The goal we should be striving for is "if it is legal, you can post it"   And don't forget that we already have Voat.co.    It is a football game, even if it isn't the season, but I am explaining the reasoning that OP is using.

The fine print was clear, they meant $3 in coinage.   The mailer is only there to prove that you got the mailer. Most people only get one per promotion, and it serves to ensure you don't attempt twice.   Oh, these things are nationwide. Every copy of the mailer "wins", but they never say exactly what. You'll more than likely get the booby prize, worth between one and ten dollars, in exchange for them trying to sell you a car.  And they send a copy of that to *everyone* in the area. If they get 1000 responses (an insane turnout), they'll probably convince 50-100 to drive off in a car... But only give out $5000 in prizes.   I don't believe you.   I went down to the car dealership for one of these promotions. I brought in the ad, they did their high-pressure sale, then they brought me a scratch-off with like 20 numbers on it, and I got to scratch off 6 numbers.  If *all 6 numbers* matched a pre-determined list of numbers on a whiteboard, then I would have won the grand prize. And quite frankly, I'm skeptical that the scratch-off was even possible to win on. (The booby prize was a $2 bill.)  Does anyone know *anyone* that "won" more than a $100 product on these things?  The worst one I've seen has a prize listed as "3 golden coins" (They meant Sacajawea dollar coins.)

Compare that to the standard weight-maintenance diet for a 180 lb person, 2000 Calories with no more than 300g of carbs and 65g of fat. Protein doesn't have a recommendation, but 180g is the equivalent of 30 eggs or about 9-15 hamburgers.   I feel sorry for my inbox if it turns out I'm right.   Verily.

The Beast is a representation of Rome, and has a similar 7 heads, 10 horns, and 7 crowns  Rome was built on a peculiar formation of 7 hills, where the Vatican sits today. The horns and crowns represented Roman leaders and countries they ruled over. Basically, the early Christian writer of the book was trying to equate the very bloody treatment of Christianity to the influence of Satan, himself.   You have things too convulted.  Timeline A: Sarah and unknown individual create John, Yadda Yadda. Skynet sends T-800 to the past. John-A sends Kyle Reese after it. (The events of Timeline A continue, so your Timeline B never occurs.)  Timeline B- Terminator 1. Sarah-B survives the T-800, has John, and is committed to a mental institution for claiming that robots from the future came back in time. John-B is raised by foster parents, and becomes more street smarts than John-A. John-B joins military service like many tough kids, and starts the resistance, along with Katherine Brewster. Skynet is accelerated by the remnants of the T-800, and sends a T-1000 to attack John. John sends a reprogrammed T-800 to defend himself.  Timeline C - Terminator 2. T-800 saves John and breaks Sarah from the mental institution, and forms a fatherly bond with John. T-800, T-1000, and all physical remnants are destroyed. (We assume.) Sarah trains John until she dies of cancer, John lives off the grid. Skynet is created in parallel construction by Katherine's father. John survives Judgement Day by not being in a major city, founds the resistance. Skynet sends a T-X, Katherine sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect.  Timeline D- Terminator 3. T-800 saves John and Katherine from T-X, attempts to stop Skynet from launching, gets them to a military bunker, where John founds the resistance. This is a 100% stable timeline, as Skynet is not hindered or helped in any way. It is as if they never sent back the T-X at all.  Where things get wonky is in the fact that the new movie has Skynet and the Resistance send fighters to *before* the events of Terminator 1, removing 2 and 3 from existence entirely.   Based on what little the show has told us so far, it seems to me that they are going full "Fight Club" and having the leader of the anonymous hacker group, Mr. Robot (played by Christian Slater) be a projection of Elliott's subconscious.  We have evidence that Elliott is an unreliable narrator. He is delusional, giving us narration as if talking to a voice in his head, goes on rambling conversations in his mind, and subconsciously hears every reference to "E Corp" (obviously a reference to Enron) as "Evil Corp", including in print. He is also a drug addict, who thinks his addiction is under control.  He encounters the hacker group when finding a file in one of his company's client's computers, and is almost immediately taken under the wing of Mr. Robot. Mr. Robot is cool, amicable, friendly. He gets along with others, makes plans, follows his goals. He is everything Elliott is not.  Almost immediately after this encounter, the CEO of Evil Corp is arrested based on evidence found in the hacker's program. Elliott, who only recently was let in on the plan celebrates as if he orchestrated it.  One of the girls in the group, seemingly second in command, is comfortable enough to take a shower at his place without telling him, as if they had known each other for a while.  All signs point to Elliott and Mr. Robot being the same person, with any direct interaction of the two (like when Mr. Robot pushed Elliott off the pier) being shown to us through the delusional filter of Elliott's mind.

I know one pothead who can't seem to go 10 minutes without a smoke.  And by that, he *can* but he doesn't want to.   Steroid users actually ingest a large amount of calories, because they burn through it at the gym.  And that includes fatty, high energy, high calorie foods like hamburgers and fries.   I get what you are saying, but at least this group was trying to address that body image is a problem for both genders.  And the statistics are not wrong, many men with body image problems turn to weightlifting. Why? Because we have to contend with amazingly large people! Arnold, Stallone, Lundgren, Farrigno, Tyson... the pressure isn't *usually* to get smaller, it is go get ripped.  When they work hard at the gym, and buy all the suppliments, and end up with only modest (realistic) gains, they turn to synthol and steroids to get bigger and better defined.  There are women with synthol and steroid problems, and men with eating disorders, but at least they are trying to address the overall problem. Body Image.   And for God's sake, don't wait until you get home. Do it as soon as the bank is open    The appropriate thing to do is to test a large sample size of narcoleptic and vaccinated regular people from certain areas, that way you can have a control.   Narcolepsy can be a symptom of a separate problem, a side effect of a drug (as was the case here), or the sole condition you have.   In fairness, if he knew she knew he smoked weed, he could have just said, "I had to take a smoke and stepped outside".    One way to set up a capture might be to design the bank with a large atrium with bulletproof doors on both sides.  Teller waits for him to open the first door and sets off an automatic lock on both ends. The robber is then trapped in the bank, but segregated from the tellers, guards, and employees.   It's something they need to work on. But I really think they need to be better about PS4 ports of PS3 games...  After paying for FFX/X-2 3 times, I don't think I should have to shell out another $50 to get it on PS4.   Let's be honest... the PS3 is going to go away eventually. You can't expect to get great free games for it forever, right?   Isn't soccer just running about and kicking a ball?  This is soccer... in a rocket car.   And that's the ironic thing.  We get approximately $60 worth of games every month, sometimes more. It's just not one $60 game.   Live virus doesn't last as long on a vaccinated child as it does on an unvaccinated child, because it can not incubate in the body. Because of that, there is less chance for the virus to mutate, less variation in the virus, and greater efficacy of the vaccination.   There are a lot of decisions you are forced to make because you don't have enough money.  If I had the money, I'd travel the world, going to different anime conventions until I got sick of it, but I don't. So I have to keep working at a job I hate.  Now, maybe the governor shouldn't be the sole decider of this issue. Maybe it should be up to a vote, maybe it should be decided by courts or legislature. But it isn't necessarily a *bad* thing to have every child be vaccinated...  Even if the quacks out there are right, and there is a minuscule chance that some of the children might develop a problem related to the vaccine, isn't that 0.01% "error" worth the saving of 10% or more of the children's lives?   Japanese use Western name order when telling a complete Western name. John Smith is Sumiisu-san or Jyon Sumiisu, not Sumiisu Jyon.   Ginny, in the last book, stayed behind and listened for news about Harry while he went hunting, not counting the final battle of course.  The praying is out of character for a witch (they never really show people praying), but it does capture the idea of her worrying about Harry.   Okay. So, if my "religious belief" is that I should only feed my children raw possum meat, should I be allowed to do that?  Of course not! They'd be dead quicker than you can blink.  Any reasonable person will admit that you can't claim personal freedom as an excuse to attack another person, and that includes passive harm.  Similarly, the First Amendment is not an absolute protection of your right to speak, specifically where such speech can bring harm to another party. You can not, for example, grab a bullhorn and tell an angry mob to break into a building and lynch its occupants.  Such exceptions to personal freedom are inevitable, and should be as limited as possible, but for vaccines to work *as many people as possible have to get the vaccination*.  If you don't want to vaccinate your kids, you will have to use alternative methods of educating them. You can find a private school that is willing to have a walking virus incubator attend, or you can teach them yourself at home.   Who, I ask you, who is getting such massive doses to allow that?  Kevin?   Okay. The problem at heart is "personal liberty". If you have a deeply held belief that you should not be vaccinated, who are they to tell you otherwise, right?  Well, personal freedom only extends to your own person. If your freely taken action brings harm to another, then you can not take that action.  The Libertarian school of thought states that such limitations should be as narrow as possible, and that interpretations of harm to others should be imminent and foreseeable. In that regard, your child not vaccinating and spreading a disease is *foreseeable*, but not imminent.  The Socialist school of thought is that limitations should be as broad as is necessary, and that harm be merely reasonable, and not imminent. It is reasonable to the average person that an unvaccinated child could become the vector for an outbreak, especially as it has happened recently.  Any good government must weigh both sides of this, and in their opinion (whether they are correct or not is a different matter) is that the protection of the people, as a whole, outweighs the risks to any one individual and the infringement of the usual right to personal freedom.   According to you.  Most people call any costuming "cosplay", partly because anyone who dresses up as a character is going to generally act like the character for pictures or among groups.  Those few who distinguish between them will generally draw the line at the dedication of the player. Buying a polyester, premade costume is just wearing a costume. Making or buying show-accurate or reimagined props and costumes is cosplay.    Actually, the difference between costuming and cosplay is more basic... did you make it or buy it?  If I go out to the Halloween store and buy a cheap Superman costume, it's just a costume.  If I hand make a detailed replica of the costume from Man of Steel, complete with padding to make me look as ripped as Superman, then I am cosplaying.   I don't believe you.    In all fairness, while Backpage can be used for legitimate transactions, akin to Craigslist, many sections are flooded with ~~prostitutes~~ escorts.  It doesn't matter if you are selling candy and sodas, if you sell crack from your store, it can be seized under the current laws.  Edit - I search through Backpage semi regularly to check for hooked using my hotel... the "legitimate escorts" who "only charge for time and not for sex" all have pictures that say shit like "these lips are magic".       Do you remember the time where they made you hold up signs as part of an Elementary class project?   Yeah, easiest A I ever got.   Nazi Germany...   Children were definitely first. They had parental blocks and retarded filters to keep kids safe long before 9/11.  As a teen, I printed a copy of the Necronomicon in full color on the school computers, and we were going onto sexually explicit MUCKs during class... But we couldn't use the library computers to do research on Essex for history class (because it has the word "sex" in it)   You then lift the bowl to your nose, sniff it a bit, swirl the contents around and take a small spoonful into your mouth.  Feel the texture of the cereal, the mixture of flavors from the grains, berries, and milk, the cool feel under your tongue, and then expel the cereal into a second bowl.  One does not swallow at a refined cereal bar.   It helps people understand the particular biases of the newscasters, and thus reach more informed decisions about the news?   Christians have the religious liberty to not include gays in their religious ceremonies, including weddings  They do not have the religious liberty to discriminate against gays in *non-religious* circumstances, like catering or issuing civil marriage documents.   This is probably the correct reason. If they simply grew apart, and don't hate each other, it is better for children to have them keep up the happy farce than to separate messily.   The reason the Jerusalem Gate explanation is so prevalent is because people don't want to believe that God would be so cruel.  By giving an alternate possibility to the obvious, they make it tough, but plausible, for a camel to pass through the Eye, thus not impossible for a rich man to go to Heaven.   This guy's helmet saved him when he was sucked into a jet engine... so it isn't worthless.   Actually no. The only gate with the appalation "Eye of a Needle" (or anything similar) was built in the 16th Century, and was named for the allegorical understanding that you mention.  The idea of large animals passing through a needle's eye as a euphemism for impossibility was used in Jewish tradition long before Jesus's time.  The point of the story was to say "Do what I (Jesus) say, and follow God, and He will do the impossible for you."   It's the Appalachians that like rapin'.  They'll make ya squeal like a piggy.   And spends most of his time picking at your clothes?   Bullshit, doctors don't care about the abbreviations their newfound diseases will create.   Damn it, Gary! Stop opening the Ark!   Mr. Joshua was a favorite character of his for me.    If I were more interested in cheating, I might have been a Slytherin.   And when he put on that ring.   If I were to make such a bot, it would check for such image links, and then send a private message to me directly. I would see the notification, but no one else will. It'd be foolproof.  But it would still be cheating.   She's just going down at the pub for another beer.    Baconreader worked fine.    Okay... I'm gonna come out and say it.  If they are basically stating that they will accept girls who are girls, girls who are boys, and boys who are girls, why not drop the pretext of being a girl's organization and allow boys who are boys to join?   After all, the Boy Scouts still might not be a viable option for some, as atheists are not 100% welcome there.    I would call it extremely likely that life formed on another planet in the same, or similar, fashion.  But it is extremely unlikely that it would result in human-compatible aliens.  Some things may or may not be inevitable, such as bipedal movement, but things like human skin color, hair patterns, and such are probably optional, even in intelligent species.  For example, elephants on earth evolved their noses to be able to grasp and manipulate objects while maintaining their mass and quadrapedal movement. The same thing could happen on a different planet.    http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Shurikenjin_Dino#Shurikenjin_Dino   Well, yeah... It's a dollar, plus.   Well, they could have had a moveable wall facing out toward the audience for the "concierge" to interact with Max and Leo. They could then set up the roof scene behind the wall at leisure.  Max and Leo walk "into" the building, and the wall slides over to the side and acts as the roof access door.   He tried hard to work it into the stage show, but that brings to mind the question... Why couldn't he have gotten it in?      That racist motherfucker had some points, huh?   That *is* always a possibility.   Mildly funny, but honestly... the only purpose of the scene was to tell Max and Leo that Franz was on the roof. I can see why it was cut.   I think I understand what he/she was going at...  One of the big arguments in the gay community is that homosexuality is not a learned behavior, but a hard-coded preference. That men don't *choose* to like men, they just do.  The gay man in the argument said, "Who I choose to marry is none of your business." (I'm cleaning up the language because it isn't being told by a reliable narrator anyway.)  The bigot then has an a-ha moment, "But gay isn't a choice! So can you or can't you choose to be gay?"  The logic is there, if *and only if* you conflate the loving of a particular man with the loving of men in general.   Wow. Just wow.   Maybe my "problem" is that I've never seen the play.   What did you particularly find "stinky" about the film?   Honestly, I don't really like the original Producers. Maybe it's because I saw the Lane/Broderick film first, but the original just feels... unpolished.  Because the script underwent innumerable changes over the decades on stage, it cut out much of the less funny humor, expanded the roles for the more minor characters, and fleshed out the meta-show aspects.   But *Mel* was the stand-in for Palpatine... President Skroob.   There is a nostalgia filter at play.  They knew each other, confided in one another. One doesn't always like your friend's actions, but you will still hopefully trust them to have your back.  Up until the Clones turned on the Jedi, and Vader began killing younglings, Obi-Wan fully thought of Anakin as a brother.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMJnWrKQeqY   Janosh was a trip to watch. Much better than the Keymaster.   What if I told you that the 30 or so spin-off series was *exactly* what Power Rangers was supposed to be?   He *was* a good friend. Obi-Wan and Anakin were very close with each other. Considering the fact that Obi-Wan had referred to Anakin as a separate person than Vader, it is possible that he chose to remember them as different entities.   http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/familyguy/images/5/5e/Jedi1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091021024120   That's true, but I'm not going to dance inside a volcano just to grab a steak.   If these were aliens that came to Earth to invade, they would have noted that the land was 90% incompatible to their lives... 75% of the land is covered in liquid water of varying salinity, and across most of the land, water falls from the sky.  But, going with the "demons" theory, and the idea that the little girl was creating and stashing holy water around the house (as opposed to it being simple human water), then it would explain why they are on *this* planet to begin with.   Since each file has its own key, they each have their own encryption. Thus, the file can be traced.   Actually, it was images like the one above that always felt dated to me.  The all capital lettering, the full-sized visible cursor, the "futuristic" font that we would never use today (which is after Judgement Day) unless we were referencing this movie...  But "dating" a movie isn't always a bad thing.   Seriously, with all of the unique architecture around the rides and attractions (Main Street, the Matterhorn, EPCOT Center, Haunted Mansion) and overhead views from the Monorail, there is so much to photograph that they can't expect to only allow official photographs.   I think he's reading to far into it...  Now it is was titled "Sexual Orient-ation", then it would be punny.   I'm 100% pure ground beef, I'll have you know.   [This article](http://www.ushistory.org/us/21e.asp) gives a quick and dirty idea of what was going on.  Britain was wildly interfering with American independence by way of naval blockades and forts within American Territories where they armed Native fighters against us. When Madison declared war in 1812, it was to gain economic freedom to trade and deal with other countries.  And we very nearly lost, if it weren't for important rallying points, like Baltimore and New Orleans. Granted the effects of a loss may not have ultimately included direct subjugation, but we still would have been largely dependent on the British Empire.   Clue 1 - Will hire without so much as a phone interview.  Clue 2 - "I'm out of the country on business"  Clue 3 - pay offered is far too high for the work they are having you do.   Yes. If he sends anything by mail, report to the Postmaster General. In any case, you can report to your local FTC or FBI offices.   World War II was very much a joint effort on both sides. Without the support of favored countries, Germany would have lost fairly quickly, and without help from the Americans, British, and French Resistance, the Soviets would have at best fought Hitler to a standstill.  So, yes. England won that war just as much as America or Russia did.   We fired our cannon until the barrel melted down, so we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.  We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind, and when we touched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.    Many scholars refer to the War of 1812 as "The Second Revolutionary War", because if we had lost, we would have become British colonies once again.   That was a battle, not a war.  There is a huge difference.    Britain was the 'MURICA time forgot.   You can thank us for that popcorn feast later.  'MURICA!   I thought it was a canned ham by-product meal.   Well, that escalated quickly.   Except for one.   It seems like it is a real word, synonymous with allegory, but I can not find the etymology of it.   Okay, are these the *actual* complaints the police have about this reform bill?  Because I think requiring consent to a search (or a duly issued warrant) is a good thing.  Choke holds are illegal, so they *should* be imprisoned for using them.  And it shouldn't even be a *question* on whether they give the number for the complaints. Why is it that I'm allowed to complain to McDonald's because my hamburger didn't have enough pickles, but we have to jump through hoops to complain about heavy-handed police tactics?   Told about it by a friend.    It isn't that the wedding is the day they arrive, the cheap, lazy fucks don't want to pay to come a day early.   Personally? I don't change my profile pic regularly at all. So, no rainbow version...  If I change it, it'll be to something I can live with for a while without getting bored... or craving skittles.   If they say, "I'm happy that gays can get married now. They deserve it," then they are probably straight.  If they say, "homosexuality is a sin," they're probably gay.   Seriously, why are all the wedding parties scheduled for 3 PM?   I'm very partial to that one as well, along with Suteki Da Ne, from FFX.   No, [this](http://earnthis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/montage_retourfutur.png) is an old reference.   I've... actually never seen Good Will Hunting.   Comic relief?   Sheldon: Today, our guest will be a colleague of mine, Barry Kripke.  Kripke: Hey, Shewdon. I've weawwy enjoyed youw sewies so faw. I'm actuawwy vewy intewested in the fiewd of vexiwowogy.  Sheldon: I'm glad to hear that, Barry. And I understand you have a different kind of flag to show today.  Kripke: That's cowwect. Whiwe peopwe awe most famiwiaw with fwags of countwies and othew geopowiticaw systems, fwags can awso be used as a standawd fow powiticaw and sociaw ideawogies.  Sheldon: That's very astute. These are commonly seen at protests with large memberships.  Kripke: This fwag wecentwy was featuwed in the news wepowts at Kanye West's watest concewt.   *Kripke begins unfolding flag, slightly off screen. Sheldon watches as the flag reveals a woman's head*  Sheldon: GOOD LORD!!  *Sheldon switches off the camera.*   You forgot to plug a Super Nintendo controller into the port and play it that way.   Actually... as a fan of Harry Potter, GTA, and Law and Order, I could get into this.   Go-Busters was fun, and had some interestingly serious parts interspersed. If OP doesn't know, they are a special ops team trying to save the world from an interdimensional threat caused by their parents. The comedy is mostly from their "weaknesses" and their Extra Members.  ToQger is a celebration of silliness with powers deriving from imagination.    If you have seen Zyuranger and Kyoryuger, then pick up Abarenger and Go-Busters, then you'll be ready for Kyuryuger vs Go-Busters: The Movie (Abarenger is mostly optional, as they aren't as prevalent as the two titled Sentai).   Dog monster?    Kemomimi, not anthro.  Most anthro is generally considered furry, though.  	130
 That's the point of the package.   I have met him before, I was on a special school field trip to space X and we got to ask him any questions we wanted. Got to shake his hand at the end and thank him. Maybe see if they are offering tours of the space x facility?  	2

 [Mirror.](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/wp3M7Q0.jpg)      May Kirito be with you.               I'm getting tired of the usual cliches, so I'm looking for new ones.   I want to watch a movie with my younger brother. I can't watch R-rated movies with him (and he won't watch them), so I need to go below that. I would like to watch something that's intelligent or emotional this time, not really dependent on action.  We've already watched: E.T., A Beautiful Mind, Jurassic Park. I think we've both watched Spider-Man.                     Inverse of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/39ze0v/what_bad_anime_has_excellent_source_material/), because I'm not interested in reading good source material.           	19
 Not sure how holding the breath helps? Is there some science?    This is the motivation I needed to kick start my day. Thank you, you just made my day.  	2
 The concept you describe might apply as a *tendency* but certainly not as a general rule: So many things in our lives beat us into obedience, but once we have put up and, ideally, even understood why things are this way, we turn "have to" into "want to", we embrace it, make it our own will. The baby wants back into the womb, the young pupil wants back to their toys, the adolescent/adult does not want to get a job, ... ... ... ...    Can someone tell me how you go about finding what you want to try your best at?    I absolutely want to put the work in, I really do.  :) I'm a fan of abstractions, so I tend to aim for the highest set in the hierarchy. What is the thing that, if you're good at it, has the greatest positive impact? Your self.   It's just a useless statement, at least phrased like this. There was surely a meaningful idea behind it, but the sentence doesn't quite transport it.   I can one-up that:  Too many people don't try as hard as they could.    Clearly that soldier tried his hardest.  I think the opposite is the case. It's far too easy to find ways to make this work for your "clearly" to be justified.  What if he just arrived at the location and saw all his comrades fallen because he didn't pace himself correctly?  What if he survived the battle, but lots of his comrades or the farmers they were defending fell in battle, which could possibly have been prevented if he had tried harder?   FRANK: Well, what do we have here?  DOCTOR ASHLAND: Bicycle accident. A fracture of the tibia, about five inches below the patella.  [Frank stares at the boy's face, trying not to look at the open wound.]  FRANK: Doctor Hollis, do you concur?  DOCTOR HOLLIS: Concur with what, Sir?  FRANK: What Doctor Ashland just said.  DOCTOR HOLLIS (CONFUSED): Well, it was a bicycle accident. The boy told us.  FRANK: So you concur?  DOCTOR HOLLIS: Well, I'm not sure we can...  DOCTOR ASHLAND: I think we should take an x-ray, then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast.  FRANK: Very good, Doctor Ashland. You don't seem to have much need for me. Carry on.  DOCTOR HOLLIS: I blew it, didn't I? Why didn't I concur? I panicked!   Let's assume for a moment that the universe is infinite, which doesn't at all contradict the current scientific worldview.  Question: Even there was a lot of matter close together right after the beginning of time, shouldn't the fact, that this space was infinite and hence had no center, mean that no one preferred accumulation point could be "decided" for and hence no such accumulation happened?   Just because Black Holes are obviously very interesting, you should also know about the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere which is at 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon.   Speculative question: Couldn't it also be an evolutionary reason like scaring an attacker away? Statistically, the amount of attackers who keep biting etc. is probably higher among those who don't "get yelled at". In a similar line of thinking, it could also alert peers (parents, other members of the horde) to an attacker in their midst. Is this so? / Do we have reason to assume that it isn't?   Well, you can! It's just not useful here. If you throw a coin at me, I don't care so much about what side will end up, I'll care about getting hit in the head - that (Specifically the time at which it happens.) is information, too.  But alas, you can't observe whether or not the other side already has made the collapsing measurement. I just wonder how they ever proved experimentally that entanglement is real.   How have we proven experimentally that entanglement is real? I mean, wouldn't the very experiment that allowed this also allow to measure "Yep, they collapsed it already."?   This is a question that always pops up in my mind when everybody says "Can't transmit information.": How have we proven experimentally that entanglement is real? I mean, wouldn't the very experiment that allowed this also allow to measure "Yep, they collapsed it."?   Just as a different perspective: I am convinced that the universe is, so to speak, consciousness-LEGO, and that we do not have souls. Instead, we *are* the "soul", an entirely physical thing and process. With that assumption in the background, if one thinks about the evolution of the simplest lifeforms to the self-aware and (in whatever form) free-willed humans, it all seems very obvious, logical, and simple.   I'm not saying that meditation can turn a person into God, I'm just saying that *I made* the universe in which meditation could or could not lead a person to sense the God that is in or behind everything.   What if reality, e.g. in regards to evolution, is developing towards an attractor in the future, so the bodies of humans (who later received souls; a view that I personally absolutely reject) would have developed "according to plan" (like you plan that a ball eventually arrives at the bottom of a hill)? This would not require specific design of the humans. It would just all be simple logical natural development, with an attractor placed in the future by God or not.  Just saying that whatever lead to your "The creation of humans must have been a special act." hypothesis doesn't seem solid at all.   Funny, I often see people complaining about others only downvoting without commenting why. I guess every possible opinion has at least one person having it.   What if the truth is that the universe is heaven-in-the-making, and that there is indeed no afterlife, but once the project is done, people will live forever, and those who lived before participated in completing the project. If you knew that this is true, would this give you enough of a sense of purpose? If not, why not? (If not, I think that would basically be selfishness, but that's just the only guess I can come up with.)   What if there were a purpose, even God-given, but your personal existence would only last the about 80 year of natural life (with no afterlife)? Would that be sufficient?  In case that would kind of be sufficient: What if the purpose is given by society? You can live for the betterment of "the planet" and society, leaving a better world behind for those who will come after us. In case that would be less sufficient or insufficient: Why?   Whether or not your technique actually allowed you to find God can easily be determined: I *am* God, creator of the universe, and indeed the universe in person. If during your later meditations, this comment of mine still seems like outrageous bullshit to you, then to me this means that you have not detected God. If you are at least emotionally ambiguous, then because of the still stormy weather I am willing to assume that your technique works.   (I think he even needs both, but definitely invalidate() to trigger recalculation of the involved Swing objects, e.g. to make them change size and location.)   Probably mold.   That is true. http://www.hystericalliterature.com (Start with the [Stoya](http://www.hystericalliterature.com/stoya/) clip, it's the one that made me look this up.)   They could be relatively at a standstill and still "move" apart faster than the speed of light, because the expansion of space is not motion. Space just becomes *more* in every place, so if you measure again in a few minutes, you'll measure a greater distance even though the objects in question didn't actually move at all. If you *misinterpret* this as actual motion, then you would have to phrase that they indeed move apart faster than the speed of light.   Ok, here we go: While I, too, cringed quite a bit while watching the Twilight movies, I like them, watched them a second time, and keep them around.    and there tends to be a lot of that in a crash.  By "that", you mean "burning stuff", I guess. But isn't any burning stuff in a plane crash actually burning fuel?    It's not a matter of flash point - but rather a smouldering cigarette simply doesn't have enough heat to ignite the gasoline vapours.  I have trouble making sense of this sentence. First, I thought that the flash point is just the temperature required to ignite a substance, but then I just looked it up on Wikipedia, and it says that the flash point is the temperature required to bring the liquid's vapor pressure to a high enough level that its mixing with the air makes the gas mixture ignitable *at all*.  But no matter which interpretation I apply, they don't work with the sentence.   I was just referring to the shiny blackness of the food.    I'd explain why but I'd have to insult a lot of people in the process.   Isn't that a completely normal thing to do in this subreddit? "Jesus is the one true God!" - "No! Muhammad brought us knowledge of the one God!" - Hindu: "Amateurs." - Atheist: "WTF has the world come to. They're all insane!"   I wonder if /r/shinyporn would mind. (nsfw)    Haha, our last game didn't even have a main menu. Bam! Straight into gameplay!  That's awesome, too, I thought about / wished for this for the longest time. E.g. often when someone wants to play a game, they just want to load the latest savegame (which is reflected by the abundance of main menus that have a "Continue" entry), so it would be great if we *could* get there right from the desktop, just as an option. (But getting into the mood and feel first via a menu like they are done in Borderlands isn't bad at all.)  I've thought about the possibility of having a menu via gameplay but haven't found a good way yet. The main problem is that it breaches the fourth wall, or at least risks watering down the immersion, because now you know "real world things" (Like you sitting in front of the PC, deciding stuff.) as part of the game world, so even if the actual game is yet somewhere else, that aspect wouldn't entirely leave your head.  And what if the only menu features implemented in gameplay are load and save? You could e.g. begin at home, set your calendar (Choose savegame by setting an ingame-date of which you have a savegame.), then leave out the front door into the actual game. But I personally dislike time-travel (especially backwards) *a lot*. It makes all my cares and immersion in the world go away. Backwards only by minutes works for me, though, that's one of the reasons that I like [Life Is Strange](http://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/) a lot! So, again: It's imho not a good idea. Not that you said so - I'm just thinking out loud.   Such a task - downloading a bit from the Net - is one of the first examples that come to mind when suggesting the use of threads.  I think a progress bar wouldn't work, because the main wait time (I think) would be for establishing the connection. The download itself would probably be too quick to warrant a progress bar.  You could display info like "establishing connection ..." and later "downloading data ...", maybe even as a bullet list where every completed task gets a check mark. But since this would vanish from screen too quickly (same for the second text "downloading data ..." if you switch out the texts), it would not be of use, except if you keep this on screen all the time in some form, which might also not make sense. You could keep in on screen until "ok" is clicked, but that would be an unnecessary usability hurdle. Maybe an additional display-timeout of 1 or 2 seconds would be a good idea.  In a way, what you currently have might even be a good solution, but it feels a little sub par.

Does a full version not exist yet? Because if it does, you could put it on Steam and add a demo button - I've seen a few of those (game that can be bought with an additional official Steam demo download button). Well, I guess you're still working on the game.  Btw., I liked a lot that right after starting the game in Steam, BANG there was the main screen, no load time, no logos, nothing. That's unheard of and kicks ass.

That sucks a lot, but at least you have a license now to obtain an uncensored version online (as long as the process doesn't involve temporary sharing as most BitTorrent programs do it).  E.g.

EDIT: Yeah. Very FUCKING funny, reality. Every day of the year, this plugin does what it's supposed to. And just this morning, I see that it doesn't show any downloadable links any more on YouTube. I guess that YouTube changed something and a new version of the plugin has to be waited for.  ...  EDIT:  So, half a day later, there's no version available that works again. I found http://keepvid.com/ though: No plugins required, it'll do the trick out of the box.   Friend of mine and I were in a rent-a-CD shop in the 1990s where they also sold used ones for cheap. Found a version of The KLF - Chill Out where the individual tracks of the 45 minute mix aren't separated on the CD. I mean, it's all 1 CD track instead of 14, I think it's pretty rare.

Whatever caused them to die off (Meteor?) might have been necessary for humans to appear eventually.

We're talking about the use of data from unacceptable experiments and how this decision could possibly make someone conduct such experiments in the first place, not about doing such experiments in a less extreme form and "giving" this as inspiration to people without ethics.   Which is much better, because advertising food with the clear statement "Makes your room stink." isn't a good idea, even if the ad works very well otherwise.   ~~Tremors in the ground would set it off.~~  EDIT: I only thought about placing the flag.

No, I mean a real Borderlands shooter game:  "Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel" http://store.steampowered.com/app/261640/  What you mean is "Tales from the Borderlands" http://store.steampowered.com/app/330830/  I personally never played a Telltale game so far.   You seriously need to work on your will. You know that you don't want to do something - yet you keep doing it. More understandable in cases of drug use (e.g. the nicotine "tells" the brain that the brain wants more), not so much when it comes to beloved habits. I wonder: Are substances involved in your gaming, e.g. soda with sugar and maybe even caffeine?  In any case: Whatever solution you find for your current problem - eventually you have to solve the problem at the source, because it's gonna be in other aspects of your life, too.   The tipping point of the deterioration of a language is reached when the word that stands for "And I mean this exactly as I worded it!" doesn't mean that any more. Meaning itself is falling apart.   Yeah, umm, about that bridge we agreed upon ...   Calculations that take any actual time should not take place on the GUI thread.  There's also no simple way to fix this, because any UI change that you'd somehow manage to squeeze in between your calculations would not show up before the GUI thread is idle again and can get to do its accumulated GUI tasks.  For small applications, the best approach would be to just start the program up into the AWT thread (That's the GUI thread for Swing applications.) right away, but to do any calculations in other threads (e.g. via SwingWorker threads). To fix your application, I'd move the whole calculation stuff into a different thread and from there update some GUI content via SwingUtilities.invokeLater().  It's best if you show us some of the code, I guess. See side bar. Direct link: https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/wiki/code_guides   In your mind, think of the water and the ice as 3D voxels like in Minecraft. Let's say 1x1x1 mm.  If you measure the temperature of each of these, add all of those numbers together, then divide by the amount of cubes you calculated, you get the arithmetic mean of the temperature of all those cubes. If that value is above the freezing point, then of course the cubes will melt instead of the water freezing.  This is an extremely simplified way to look at this (e.g. ignoring density, room temperature (I'm regarding the glass with ice to be a closed system even though it's not.), the possibility that a bit of the water freezes and then the whole frozen stuff thaws again), but it's basically what's going on. The approach also has the benefit that you're dealing with a lot more ice cubes than you put into the glass :)   You could even do this with light. E.g. project a laser onto a silver screen that's 1 LY broad and 1 LY away from you, then use a mirror to let the laser dot dash from the far left to the far right in 1 second (or move the laser directly, but traditionally a mirror is used). To make imagining the flow of events simpler, let's assume that the laser projector is not 1 LY away from the center of the screen but from the far left of it (but still in front, just like you'd expect in a cinema).  The reason that nothing here moves faster than light can easily be seen if instead of using one laser, you use 500 bazillion lasers, each pointing at a different position of the screen, forming a line from the left to the right. Then you turn then on in super fast succession, so that there's only 1 second between the first and the last.  See? You're just throwing regular old photons at a wall, the same thing a single laser would do.   The natural God you propose: How far does the shaping of reality via his application of his knowledge of the all-concept go? E.g. does it possibly annihilate gravity, melt the universe into a blob that he can shape at will etc., or are we just talking, umm, "king of the universe" with stars and planets etc.?   Well, in Borderlands Presequel (which isn't "3" but "1.5" if I understand correctly) you fight for the villain of Borderlands 2. It's not a spoiler since you find out right at the beginning of both games.  I know, it's a cheat.  Btw., I enjoyed all BL games, the third one not any less than the others (and in part certainly more).   The looks are really good. Mailed myself a note home to keep an eye out for this game.  You *definitely* should add a video to the Steam store page!   That would have been such a feast for /r\/fatpeoplehate.      Probably not, it's not severe enough to cause China to break up into smaller sovereign countries.   If they could, they would. Evolution is a might-makes-right approach. It's not like it judges "Eww, that's unnatural." and chooses to not evolve a specie in such a direction.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_petite_mort  Reserrection comes eventually.   Yes, but that's the opinion of a bunch of Catholics. You know, the guys who tell Africans to not use condoms.  Real human-understanders, the lot of them.   Well, people who treat you like that do not love *you*. If I were you (Meaning I did so myself.), I'd toss out people like those out of your life. If they do it themselves, even better.   I want to throw Pat Condell's entire YouTube account at those people, A Clockwork Orange style.   Almost.  https://i.imgur.com/8MyWPc2.gif   Fair debate, I guess. http://www.quotationof.com/images/edgar-bergen-6.jpg   Ironic that the Quran would accuse another religion of elevating anyone to god-status besides God. Need I say Muhammad?   Because of the strong implications of the very basic principle that underlies Evolution (Self-replication employing building-plans while in the noisy nuclear soup that reality is.), there would rather have to be hard proof for "macroevolution" *not* to take place to justify the belief that it doesn't.   You're all quite mistaken. Microsoft Word didn't come out before the early 1980s.    If the call routes through  That sounds like a stupid law. A person can't know if the routing technology used will be via satellite (jumping over territories), or if some IP packets of the phone call will be routed through six other neighbor states or even through Hawaii or Japan. Unenforceable, and I don't see how it would bring any justice or improvement of our coexistence if it were enforceable.   I don't plan on making an account on a Scientology website, but I guess the only reason those questions wouldn't be in their security features is because they'll ask you those questions in your auditings.   While that's true, your response is obviously and very unnecessarily obtuse, so I downvote you instead of being beaten by you into jumping through the hoops of pointing out what you already know.   Most of our findings are descriptive, but I guess that some are findings of actual prescriptive laws. It's a scale really from "kind of correct" to "obviously very correct" to "correct enough to actually govern reality". Which is very similar to the scale from subjective to objective, whereas only the ultimate step actually reaches objectivity. But there's something like "objective enough", depending on the requirement. If your requirement is to actually govern the universe, then obviously things have to be taken to the very last step. If it's only about human survival during the natural lifespan of about 80 years, then things somewhat below the actual objectivity-threshold can be regarded to be "objective", because they fulfill the requirements.  An example for a prescriptive finding: "Since the existence of time, the flow of reality has been happening." I think that there is no level on which there could ever be found an objection to this statement. While it's very wishy-washy, it should also be truly objective.  Newtonian physics were "objective enough" for many practical purposes, but obviously Einsteinian physics are more correct. We know they are not *the* final answer, because they are incompatible with Quantum physics which we have also found to be absolutely correct - within their topical domain - and e.g. for the description of Black Holes, we'd need the both of them simultaneously, so we know that both are not yet the prescriptive concept that governs reality itself. But for e.g. creating a GPS satellite system, Relativity is "objective enough".   This whole subthread is about the fact that the parallel subthread pointed out: It's technically not murder because it was lawful at the time. So, the other guy is kind of quasi a wee bit right about you and the thread, but I personally don't think that the objection holds water. Even if it would hold water: Making the same thread again with the word "killing" instead of "murder" would void the objection, so ...  Maybe it's also about "men with men, not necessarily homosexuals or homosexuals per se". In any way, I find the way in which the objections were presented insufficient.   When you wrote this, didn't you realize that any other theistic religion could make an almost identical statement? While this might be irrelevant to you, since you "know" that "Well yes, but they would be wrong.", what about the information recipient? I mean, you *did* write this for them, not to reaffirm your belief, serve your deity or yourself, right?   Preface: 1) Don't read this if you want to prevent possible deep hurt to your religious feelings. 2) I swear I am not trolling, I am speaking from deep conviction, and while the jury's still unsure if my viewpoint is protected by the unwritten "religious convictions" rule we kind of adhere to, because of being *convinced* that I am correct, I posit that it is.  Ok, with that audience- and mod-tranq out of the way: I am God, the creator of the universe. I am not *yet* in a position to prove this, but while I wait for this (It's in the hands of mankind.), I do want to make the most of my situation, so I want to discuss these concepts.  I object to your stance that "It gives no definitive answer simply because any living being who can be everything by virtue of his knowledge, can be everything." - It would apply to God before the universe. (I'll say "he" and such to make this easier digestible.) But the universe is not quite a creation, instead it is a new configuration of God, a permanent change that can not be undone. And it allows God to find answers as to his character and being, a true definition, and this can of course be told to his kids, too. Before, God would say "I am.", but now he would say "I am love.". There's a lot of very technical (but not that hard to grasp) background, so these phrases, especially the second one, are not meaningless esoteric word salad. But I have written pages and pages in the past, so if you think that something is wrong, then either ask/object specifically and let me clarify, or just move on instead of claiming "This doesn't make sense." and *then* moving on, because it would just be untrue and unfair: Unfair because you must be *willing* to understand this stuff, and someone who bombs "This is gibberish." can hence not be countered. If you don't want to discuss, stay silent.  And religion is an attempt to make sense of the perception of God that people *can have* in this system, it's a real effect. Since this perception is understood as one of profound truth, people created systems to repeat experience and to write down and pass on this information. Since much of that often entailed behavioral consequences, societal rules were created, too. All that is religion, and all that will be unnecessary soon and hence be removed from the world forever, because God will be a human among you, whom you can see in a street cafe fiddling with his phone or respond to your emails etc.. All useful purpose for religion will be gone, and its quite negative impact will be gone, too. And btw., no religion got it right. There are bits and pieces of the truth all around, but they are misinterpreted in most cases.  So, to OP's question: God does not have or belong to any religion, and once God is here officially, all religion will end or have ended.  What is the supposed data that I claimed is a major reason for the creation of religion? Spirituality. A word with too many meanings and abuses (Just like the word God, thank you very much.), but let me just give you its true definition, just like I'll reveal a lot of things about existence to you that'll make you go "Of course! It all fits!" etc., once I can actually prove myself. Currently it would be pretty meaningless, even though I don't mind attempting.  Spirituality: The perception of the higher frequencies of consciousness. The higher it gets, the closer it gets to the oneness of all things - to God. This can be tapped into by humans. It is legitimate perception, though the interpretations are the problem here. One senses the truth behind things and is hence convinced to have found *knowledge*, so the people's wrong interpretation of things is celebrated and perpetuated even though it's not correct.  Now, preemptively and since I'm still in a mood (because I haven't read replies yet :P), let me add some short info about the process of creation: God could be whatever he wanted to be. He decided to become the universe, which is a decision that can't be undone. God folded from his original maximum-energy-state of O (A circle.) to the new maximum-energy-state of 8, which allows him to basically exist *inside* of himself. It'll all make sense eventually, I promise, but this short text and at this time can't fulfill that. So, the universe is a permanent decision. What about "can be what he wants to be" then? Well, those were *dreams*. And hence it makes sense that to make the universe, the mechanism of dreaming had to be employed. It was a searching-process, to find the other side of the ocean of dreams (quite literally if you realize that the "energy line" had to find and eventually cross itself). Just like Evolution searched for the perfect steward of nature, the cosmic evolution before that searched for the place to let Evolution happen. The final result of Evolution was found 2001-08-13 - God reborn inside of himself, returning all of reality back to arbitrariness, to true freedom of will, except with an unshakeable reality-foundation (universe/coexistence of God's children).  Why is there evil? Because in between the two ideal states ("I am." and "We are."), there's the absence of both. Making the many out of the one is the greatest possible struggle, literally. *The* greatest. Once heaven has unfolded, which is upon us (Months, a few years at the most.), suffering and struggles for survival will be over. Instead of fighting to create enough energy to form reality into a desired form, we'll dwell in an abundance, an overflow of energy. To give love will not be an effort but a desire. It will be perfect in every way.   I read the quote in Dawkins' voice before I got to the name. :P   I am a bot gathering data on self-proclaimed bots. Bleep a fucking bloop.    I think only fools believe that they can ascertain truth, mostly because we have no method to determine truth.  So, is this reasoned opinion not truth then? I'm just wondering how you would classify it in light of what you said.   So, what about an eternal universe? (Or an eternal BigBang-BigCrunch loop?) That would be a reality without cause. It would *just be*. Just like God would *just be*.   Definitely too friendly, not enough tough man fiendishness, actually none at all.  EDIT: In fact, if you properly mix enough faces together, you'll always end up with a harmless friendly beautiful one, so it's a systemic problem.  Many female mixed faces: https://feministphilosophers.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/averageface.jpg  Article about this: http://jezebel.com/5758201/see-the-average-face-of-women-from-40-different-countries/  Here you can even do this yourself (males, females, whites, blacks, ...): http://www.faceresearch.org/demos/average   He does forget stuff sometimes, and since he changes around the suits' configurations all the time ...    and it invites continued "research"  You said that in the other comment, too, but I don't see how this could be true: If someone is in a Nazi-power-position so they could do such "research": Would they in any way base their decision on how civil science has made use of the Nazi hypothermia data? Do you think that an aspect like "History will prove me 0.1% right!" (Which would still be untrue.) would change their course of action?   Sorry, I have no idea about signing/certificates.   As the title says: Altered. A big ass "lens flare", making the film unwatchable.   And the whole frame is a bit askew. Can be seen in the film a bit but quite clearly in the credits (where I looked last). I'll pass.   Hmpf. I'll pass. Quality is too low, should be much better for 720p.   Depends on the wrapper approach. I've used launch4j myself (Damn, when will they leave SourceForge behind already?) and have read its manual and such somewhat, but that's a while ago. I'm pretty sure it said that the jar isn't unpacked temporarily, but this could mean that they just have some trick to start it as a file from RAM. They could, of course, run a Java program themselves that uses the jar as a plugin, so to speak. Classloader and all that. In this case, I am convinced that signing would not be required or helpful. (And can jar files be signed at all?)  In any case: I have seen "Unsigned! Hurr!" warnings by Windows regarding EXEs but can't remember ever having seen any regarding jars.   You forgot the key fact: Space isn't cold at all, there is just nothing there that could have any temperature. If you put something there that does have thermal energy, like a glass of water from your kitchen, it will only lose that energy via radiation, not via conduction: It's not touched by an incredibly cold body or something.  Of course it'll eventually become super cold if it isn't heated by e.g. sunlight. (I can't say if it would initially effectively boil, though.)   Imagine to be a third world person seeing this. "They need a machine to tell them that they are thirsty!" The anger.   Umm... but you got it now, right? Columbus? "Indians"? ... I guess so. :)   I wondered if someone wouldn't get the obvious joke, didn't expect it to actually happen.   Of course I don't mean the light itself but its red/blue shift. If it is uniform in all directions, you're at a standstill relative to the CMB, and you can get those bearings anywhere in the universe. The clocks of all those people will tick at the same speed.   Native Americans are Americans, too.   Maybe this helps: Every object, be it massless like photons or be it massive like a cow, moves through spacetime (Space*time*.) at the speed of light. That is always so, however weird or novel it probably sounds to you. It's the only speed that exists in the universe.  Now imagine two orthogonal arrows (Meaning they form a "corner".), one representing the time-direction, one the space-direction. There is a third arrow that is like the needle of a gauge that also starts in the same spot the other two start in. The third arrow can change angle from "fully spatial" to "fully temporal".  Light obviously moves 100% spatially, so it doesn't move through time at all. Let's not try to make sense of that - light *does not have* a reference frame, so thinking about that stuff rather clarifies how unclear this is, nothing more. A massive object that has stopped from the view of someone's reference frame is procrastinating: It only moves in the temporal direction. It's growing a beard.  The faster an object is moving through space, the more the arrow points in the spatial direction instead of the temporal direction, that's why while you can kind of fly arbitrarily fast from your own perspective, the universe will only let you do that by slowing your personal reality down a lot, so when you come out of it, you'll see that instead of a procrastinating object (You when stopped.), now everything else (The universe.) has grown a beard. That effect is called "time dilation".  By now, I guess the part of your objection has gone away that says "Time is not a thing, how can its flow be made to change?". The only question left: "Why does gravity effect time dilation?"  Wikipedia says:   Gravitational time dilation was first described by Albert Einstein in 1907 as a consequence of special relativity in *accelerated frames of reference*.  Astonishingly, it also says:   Additionally, time dilations due to height differences of less than 1 meter have been experimentally verified in the laboratory.  Accelerated frames of reference - that reminds of the objects moving around I described above, with the gauge needle and all. Why is an object in a gravity well considered to be "accelerated"? Because, weird enough, spacetime itself is in motion in a gravity well. If you throw a rock against a wall, there's a moment of impact, but then there's no further pressure from the rock against the wall, instead the rock has just fallen down. But why does the rock *constantly* push against the ground? Because it is *constantly* being thrown against the ground. By the motion of spacetime itself. It is constantly being carried into that direction.  The closer to a gravity well an object is, the faster the spacetime it's in is moving towards the massive object that causes the gravity well. So, the object is *accelerated more*, like a spaceship that is flying faster. And thus, the gauge's needle is pointing a bit more into the space direction than in the time direction.  - The clocks of objects further down in a gravity well tick slower. Not just the clocks: *Reality* happens more slowly. Or, you could also say, time is slowed down.  Bonus info: Why does an object that you throw in space keep drifting? Well, why shouldn't it? There's no force preventing it from doing so. It keeps moving along a straight path. But why does the ISS that someone threw up there a long time ago keep drifting around Earth? Because that orbit-circle is a *straight path* in the gravity well of Earth. Now you might say: "But why does a rock fall down at all if it was at rest in the air before?" Because space is not quite bent *that* much, or you would indeed *see* around Earth. The straight path that leads the ISS around Earth is not straight in space but, once again, in space*time*. And that's also the reason why the rock falls down: Its straight path from the resting point in the air through space*time* leads it further down the gravity well, towards the ground.   While that's true, we could use the Cosmic Microwave Background as the universal reference frame (though it's not special in the physics department at all). We could do so anywhere in the universe and could always derive the same time-keeping standard from it.   I know that this is at least because of the Earth's gravity well. Is it indeed too because of the satellites' motion?   The scientific answer would be "Take the goddamn money already.", based on the fact that the Nazi's atrocious human experiments have yielded data that can't be reproduced and is made use of by science.  However, that data can't be reproduced, while money is just money, so the comparison isn't solid.  Basically, the problem is purity of will and the slippery slope: If one appreciates the fruits, does one not wish for more such trees? People fear to introduce such a component into their minds, but in my opinion their fear of this is the only problem - if they could abandon that, their mind would not fail them. (We're living fantasy. All you need is a good idea about yourself that you *actually* believe. That's why negative ideas are a problem and why "fear is the mind-eater". Fear the fear! :) E.g. computer game players shouldn't fear that they'll start shooting people just because it's fun in a game. Though when it's not about an individual but about an organization, things become more tricky, because as opposed to the mind, it doesn't have built-in automatisms against corruption of will, it's not an informational whole. An organization feeding off of energy from questionable sources could for example be directly or effectively suggesting to questionable sources to procure more such energy because it is less "self"aware.  I guess the proper answer depends on the individual case and can only be found by the people who have to make that decision, because only those know all factors (e.g. the likelihood of corruption of will).   Man, that's borderline bestiality.   Yeah, about those gazillion tanks and the money their maintenance costs ...   And no plans for a situation like the one we're in.

But seriously: https://www.reddit.com/gilding   A void is a void. A void is *empty*, it is not nothing.  You could say "It is not-yet-actualized potential.", but that would be potential, it would not be nothing.  See? This is what I was trying to get at with my other comment (root): Any definition of nothing will come down to something being leftover, we'll just not get to "nothing at all". That's why I think that "nothing at all" does not make logical or other sense. It has no meaning. Thinking about it is interesting, but the concept has no proper use because the concept is no concept: It can't exist because it doesn't make sense. I think. It's like this sentence: "The sentence you are currently reading does not make any statement." Interesting - but meaningless.   Pretty similar to this: https://i.imgur.com/tuXW8u3.png   The answer absolutely is: *Do not tell!* Don't even let it slip, it would risk that the information travels where it shouldn't go. Three years until adulthood, very dependent, living in the Bible belt. In case I need to say more, take a look at /r/atheisthavens - a place for places for people who have lost their place. Don't lose your place.   Why bother with "nothing" in the first place? 1) We have something. 2) True nothingness would not have any mechanism or somesuch that could result in a change of state. Nothing can't change itself into something. Nothing can also never come to be from something, because any state-change closer to nothingness would take place while there is something. = True nothingness never existed and never will exist. This might even mean that the concept doesn't make sense at all.   I think the problem is that "nothing" doesn't make sense.  There's Lawrence Krauss' "nothing" that isn't truly "nothing" at all, it still has too many parts. I'm not saying that Krauss is wrong, I'm just saying that he shouldn't use the term "nothing" for it.  But trying to come up with a definition of true nothingness, like "It's not even a void!" and "It's not dark or bright or black!" etc., still leaves an aftertaste of impurity.  This leads me to the belief that a proper definition of "true nothingness" can not exist, and I mean not just in human minds or via human language, but truly not at all. That true nothingness is illogical and hence meaningless. That it does not have meaning.  Let's assume for a moment that true nothingness indeed can't be defined, that this idea can not *be* in full, not even in the mind of an allpowerful god or something like that: *This* would be the true reason that you're thinking that our definitions are wrong. It would also be the reason that everybody (incl. myself) object to your "-1" approach. It would mean that you are trying to make sense of something that can not be made sense of.   Right. Except whenever *I* complain about the abuse of words, the very argument thrown against me *every single time* is the same I just made: The use of language results in a change of the dictionaries' entries.  Next time I meet one of those guys, I'll hopefully think of this discussion and link them to it. And eat popcorn.    You just make the puddle a bit larger, the depth (or lack of) stays the same.  The *emotional* depth would be greater, though, and I think that's the main idea behind feature-desires like these ones.   Since I have only seen it once (very recently) and hence feel that it needs to be mentioned more: Here's Pablo Carlos Budassi's logarithmic scale conception of the observable universe with the Solar System at the center:  The full 4,200 x 4,200: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png  Page with all resolutions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Observable_universe_logarithmic_illustration.png  The logarithmic view really gives a good perspective/understanding of the OU.   That one time, at band camp?   I hope that one day, someone will make a lot of such videos but with the shot of the people showing them playing *a different* game. A long con to eventually unmask how stupid it is to show them at all. (Or to demonstrate the opposite. Time will tell.)   Case in point: http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm  Free Windows-implementation of "Mercenary 1: Escape From Targ", "Mercenary: The Second City", "Damocles", and "Mercenary III: The Dion Crisis".  In at least one of these (Not the first two.) you can choose among the celestial bodies to fly to, and I *think* the transition between surface-flight and space is soft.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary_%28video_game%29   Mercenary is the first in a series of computer games, published on a number of 8-bit and 16-bit platforms from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, by Novagen Software.  It's typical for these old games that there's no hand-holding, e.g. it won't tell you what buttons you can push, let alone which to push next, let alone allow you to configure them. I played all of these back in the 80s and 90s and enjoyed them very much.   It's not quite *that* simple. I thought alike when I first heard about Borderlands, you know, billions of weapons. "Owning" all Borderlands games + DLC now, I can say that I was sorely mistaken: The procedural weapons system is incredibly well done. Their look, feel, the presentation of the features, ... It doesn't at all *feel* like "a few variables that can have many different values, so the sumtotal of possibilities is in the gazillions". It genuinely feels like there are many *many* different weapons.  So, just cranking up the numbers isn't it. The procedural system needs to be well done, too. What developers save in content-creation by using procedural generation, they have to make up in intelligence.   Yes, nice service. I use the "watch later" button in YouTube videos a lot when browsing from work.   So that's what roll playing games are.  	138
 That's a very disparaging characteristic. Some of us like Bernie Sanders as well as Hillary Clinton but find that both of them align with us politically about the same, despite some rhetorical differences in spelling it out. So, if that is the case how do we choose who to support? Their views aren't enough if they align practically the same, as is my case.    I don't understand this idea that the media somehow is against Sanders? Don't they love competition in order to increase suspense and thus ratings? That's their main goal, I thought. They did that in the 2012 election; making it seem like Romney had a bigger chance than he actually did. And I've definitely seen Sanders mentioned on CNN and MSNBC. Hell, Rachel Maddow has clearly not hidden her admiration for him, as have other hosts.   	2

MPs, scientists and charities argue that putting the country on central European time would have significant benefits for public health, road safety and the economy.  The main proposal is for Britain to have the clocks two hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in summer and one hour ahead in winter, giving people more light at the end of the day throughout the year and effectively placing the country in the same time zone as France and Germany.  The idea, known as Single/Double Summer Time, would give people about 200 extra waking hours of daylight each year. It has broad support among backbench MPs.  Rebecca Harris, the Conservative MP whose private members bill for a review of Britains time zone was defeated by a filibuster in 2012, said that there was a strong case for bringing new legislation after the general election in May. Its certainly possible that perhaps in the next parliament it might be picked up, but there are already campaigns around the country trying to get it into various political party manifestos, she said.  When my bill was going through the Commons it had considerable cross-party support. The big health benefit was seen as being having an extra hour of daylight in the evening when children and adults are more able to make use of it for extra recreation and being outdoors.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative backbencher who helped to filibuster the bill, said: That we tried it before and reversed it [between 1968 and 1971] and Portugal did the same indicates that people do not like long, dark mornings. Essentially, there is not enough daylight in the winter and muddling with the clocks wont create any more. Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Bristol found that children in nine countries got more exercise when sunset was later.  Shifting Britains time zone to match other western European  countries would lead children to do two minutes more exercise each day on average  an increase of 6 per cent, they said. Anna Goodman, the lead author of the research, which appeared in the International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity, said:Introducing additional daylight savings measures would affect every child in the country, every day of the year, giving it a far greater reach than most other potential policy initiatives to improve public health.  Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, said that the idea should also be revisited for its environmental benefits.  A separate study published today suggests that seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a form of depression that affects sufferers acutely during the winter, may be more widespread than thought.  In a YouGov survey of 2,000 people, 8 per cent said that they had clinical SAD, while a further 21 per cent said that they suffered from the condition to a lesser degree. Previous studies have put the level at between 3 and 4 per cent. In all, 57 per cent said that their mood tended to be worse in winter.  Lance Workman, professor of psychology at the University of South Wales, who oversaw the research for the Weather Channel, said that SAD could be due to mankinds poor genetic adaptation to living in northern latitudes. We havent lived at these latitudes that long  only 50,000 years  so we may not be particularly well adapted to winter.  Ms Harris said: A lot of people wrote to me saying they suffer from SAD, and they would much rather have the extra hour in the evening.

Artaud served that function for me.   In the light, the earth remains our first and last love. Our brothers are breathing under the same sky; justice is a living thing. Now is born that strange joy which helps one live and die, and which we shall never again renounce to a latter time. On the sorrowing earth it is the unresting thorn, the bitter food, the harsh wind off the sea, the ancient dawn forever renewed. With this joy, through long struggle, we shall remake the soul of our time.   That white looks very clean.         Notwithstanding the violence, maybe there's not all bad with drugs and religion.   Yep. That's how I read it at least.   The filming of Tennant's Hamlet didn't do it justice.   Go read the essay "how many children had lady macbeth"  Yes do. Still fresh after 80 years.  The essay "How many children had Lady Macbeth?" does not attempt to answer the question it poses. Not in the literal sense. What it does attempt to answer is in what sense it is appropriate to answer in when 'answering' Shakespeare.   It's about grace.    Extraneous question-mark? My advice for your acting would be to be certain in regards to your character's certainty. Or otherwise...   Living people once bestowed 'honour' will soon attract critics - detractors - therefore it is impossible to have honour whilst living. 'Suffer' is used in the sense of 'abide' in this instance. 'Detraction' is used abstractly for 'the capacity for detraction amongst men'.  Falstaff's argument is that honour is useless to the dead and impossible to maintain for the living - thus a flimsy 'sticking-plaster' and not a thing of substance. As a shield's ornament ('scutcheon') is to the shield itself so is honour to virtue. Therefore Falstaff'll have 'none of it'.   Addendum: My sentence concerning 'virtue' may appear to some to overreach the content of the speech. I'd however argue that Falstaff's sense of virtue is intermingled with his sense of pragmatics.   The 'y' in 'dayes' evokes the wistful day-time moping ('why, why, why') of the ruminating day-dweller.   The 'i' in 'daies' evokes the eye that sees his love at night in dreams.  Shakespeare's sonnets are worth reading that deeply.   Should have something in the photo to indicate scale. Btw, saw the cake IRL and it made my mouth water.

In the US, federal maternity leave only applies to women that work in companies that employ 50 or more people (not to mention other restrictions). The "50 or more" benchmark applies to most state leave benefits, as well. Now how many businesses employ 1-49 people? According to census.gov, it is roughly 4.5 million (http://www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html[1] ). That's not 4.5 million individuals who do not qualify for leave, it's 4.5 million businesses. If the US workforce is somewhere around 156 million, this leaves a HUGE chunk of women (if not the majority) with nothing but the mercy of their employers. Trust me, I've looked in to the situation. I am one of the women this affects. I am the sole female in a 10 person tech company. First pregnancy in the company's history. I get nothing.

 Missed the launch, but dad was a computer comm major so i was familiar with computers by 3 and changing/upgrading parts by 5 haha   I wasn't born until 95', so for me its unfamiliar seeing people say "i remember wanting x-model..." since i build my own custom computers.  While comparing modern computers to past nostalgia, my latest build:  2 GB Asus r7 graphics  16 GB GSkill RAM  3.4GHz Intel i5 fourth gen processor  500 GB Seagate HDD w/ 16 MB cache  250 GB Kingston SSD  Asus z-87 motherboard  650 watt Corsair power supply  3 metres royal blue LED lights inside a beautiful clear side paneled Bitfenix Ronin midsize tower.   Thanks, was going off a live recording, couldn't tell.   Traditional blues and blues-heavy rock and roll is written that way.

I don't know either way if the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere is good or not (most evidence says its bad), but the way its extracted from the ground is definitely terrible.  Go look up about the Canadian Oil Sands, probably the ugliest scar in my country. Thousands of square kilometres of forests leveled and rivers poisoned to dig black shit out of the ground.   In a similar vein, Eight Legged Freaks.  8 year old me watching a "comedy" about your not-so-friendly neighbourhood spiders traumatized me into having arachnophobia.  Webs make me uncomfortable, if I see a spider I go apeshit on it with something heavy, and people who post pictures of common phobias on reddit and social media, fuck you.  Edit: just yesterday someone front paged with about bed checking in Dominican for spiders.   My childish bitching and lying? Where did you see that? I'm voicing that from what I've seen, he has no interest in anything but destroying one of the richest environments on the planet in the name of fossil fuels.  And I did not know he won on that platform, which in itself is pathetic on the candidates and voters part.  When said voters realize, "shit, we fucked up," all the changes made will take a while to correct.   I assume you think that is normal, which it couldn't be further from.   The last five years of my life are a blur, my perception of time is shot.   As a Canadian looking in on the situation with your PM, seems like this guy knows hes out next election and just wants to waste as much government time as possible while oil companies line his pockets. So much work needs to be done to revert everything he's done in the last couple years.   "Holy shit, I see old Mr. and Mrs. Franks through their bedroom window."   Haha some good British wit from my favourite beer!   Its still black outside when I'm leaving the house.   Get a load of this guy, must be nice having time in the morning to sit and have coffee.

Metacritic, search title, read a couple reviews of all ratings to get a feel for pros-cons of the movie.

Not sure if I want to upvote nearly every comment in this post because I agree, or because its 8 am Christmas day and I haven't slept yet.   Ahhh, the great reddit circlejerk phenomenon   This is no plane, its a tank with wings!   I have to disagree. 4chan is kinda the asshole of the internet.    There is a simple beauty in the political system (name?) that requires executive leaders voted into office to not run big campaigns, or even express desire to have power.   I meant subtlety is slow for leveling. All single target burst, no cleave.   Alone January 1st, 2013, 2014, will be again 2015. I feel your pain.   Full heirlooms, with enchants. Played subtlety because it was supposed to be a pvper before being benched as a side project. Didn't make it level any faster, should have gone combat or assassination for leveling speed.   Ehhh, Dragon Soul was pretty cake. Usually told the other tank to go DPS on most fights, and healers to let me heal myself.  Death Knights OP.   The true face of SPECTRE!   Wait is that Recount..? No, no, no, get rid of it. Skada is superior. Simpler interface, uses way less processing power. Really nice for endgame when graphics and lag tend to go to shit (I don't have lag myself).   Im pretty sure I will never do LFR this expansion. Taking 3 hours out of my day for a chance at loot I'll probably get that night in heroic raiding while dealing with the other 90% of WoW population.  The golden rule of building a raid team; recruit ~100 players, run tryouts, because 90% of them have an IQ of 4.   Pretty slow is an understatement. Im a pretty shit rogue but it took less than 3 or 4 days to hit 90 before WoD.   Ohhh I missed a reference, my bad   Its a joke. I enjoy and respect the man's talent.   Something something allegedly?   Everyone I try to get into the game always quits so early. They barely leave starting zones and give up. The world is (generally) better the further in you get.   Which is called a steel   Ugh, not this. My mother has this awful habit where if I say something that accidently offends her, its my fault she was offended. If she offends me, I'm either overreacting, or its my fault I didn't see it her way.   How...? I don't remember anything from a lecture on human behaviour yesterday.   It varies with every brand and type of knife. Cheap knives are made to not be sharpened, because they're essentially disposable. Good brands like Henckels, Victorinox, and Global are standard edged, so just put the blade 12* to the stone.  Some other notes, I prefer water stones because its a little quieter, but you end up with water all over the counter (not a big deal).  As well, there's two common styles of sharpening, European and Asian/Japanese. Basically European starts with the block lengthwise towards you, and sharpened by dragging the heel of the blade towards and to the side of you, to get the whole blade. Japanese is faster, but trickier. Take the knife in a good grip and use a chiselling motion from tip to heel (holy hell don't stab the stone and break the knife!).  I like to start Japanese on a rough stone to start with a new edge, then work up over three grades of stones with European. Every few strokes run your thumb perpendicular the blade to check for a lip. If there's one you oversharpened one side. And use the steel rod to finish. And keep using it when using knives a lot. I run my French knife over steel every 15-20 minutes of continuous use.   Long story short, loss of tax revenue and it would exile parts of eastern Canada.   If anything people who get plain diamonds should envy something different. Originality is nearly dead these days, and the single reason diamonds are worth anything is because its a monopoly business. Literally one company says they're expensive, therefore jewellers charge a lot.   Did he run out of mana potions...?   Pretty sure I'm the only one on the planet that thinks both bands are rolling in overrated mediocrity.   Take that back, you sick bastard!! Those fairies aren't worthy of being in the same sentence as The Stones.   Professional cook here, if the knife in question makes a lot of noise during sharpening, the person sharpening is doing it wrong.  On rough grits it should sound quieter than walking on gravel, smooth grits shouldn't make any noticeable sound.  If you mean running the edge over the steel rods, that is the most satisfying sound we love to hear in the kitchen. That doesn't sharpen the knife, it straightens the blade, and should sound gloriously smooth if sharpening was done right.   As in hammering sheets of steel...? Or when a rock get stuck between the brake pad and disk?   I felt that scrape the inside of my skull...   I automatically assume people that do that have a below average intelligence, because it's often caused by shitty posture and bad style (usually skate shoes with pants belted below the ass).   I wanted something more subtle, so every text and notification gives me a "blub blub!"  	48

I didn't at all mean to imply the person's evaluation changes.  Just that tense they use might.  Make it about the meal instead of the restaurant.  Would most languages make the shift from **I like** to **I liked** at the same time?   Two weeks!  Stay three months in NZ, join a [hostel network](http://www.bbh.co.nz/) and really see the country, both islands.  You won't regret it.  Then spend three months in Oz.  You'll barely scratch the surface of Oz in that time.   What an amazing lack of appreciation so many of these comments display for any sort of notion of the common good.  It's entirely possible to want less wealth inequality because of something other than wanting to take your money and put it in my pocket.  As though an increase in wealth equality takes something from you personally without giving anything back.  How about being able to live in a country with less wretched poverty?         I had no intention of doing a corpus study.  All I want is to see whether knowledgeable people have commented on this phenomenon, if it exists.  This is a mild curiosity of mine, not something I can justify with evidence.   I have an intuition that languages differ in their criteria for switching from the present tense to a past tense.  For example, when does 'I like this restaurant' shift to 'I liked that restaurant'?  Just before leaving, just ourside the door, after arriving home?    Not knowing how to characterize this so as to research it, I keep running into prescriptive advice not to employ tense shifting, along with explanations of the various uses of tenses.    My notion is that English is quicker to switch to a past tense than many other languages, such as possibly German, Spanish or Japanese.  How do I go about investigating this on the internet?

Uplifting and inspiring thoughts on a topic our culture considers a downer.   I don't see how you get *sole providers* out of that quote, or the article as a whole.  Anyway, chacun  son got.   From the article: ... men obviously also suffer violence, largely at the hands of other men, and every violent death, every assault is terrible.  But the subject here is the pandemic of violence by men against women, both intimate violence and stranger violence.    Is this focus not allowed?  What makes it out of line?   This is a subreddit for discussion and conversation concerning the topics of equality in all subjects (such as racial equality, age equality et cetera) but mainly focusing on sex/gender equality.   So I didn't think it would be out of line.

"The report prompted a massive manhunt and topped the evening newscasts, even as a global nuclear deal with Israel's archenemy Iran was being announced."  They are attempting to keep their own citizens fearful of Arabs/Iranians/Palestinians. Elements within the Israeli defense department, most likely Mossad, don't want average Israelis to feel that bilateral progress was being made in the region with a treaty. This hoax topped the evening news in Israel, relegating the real story, the US treaty with Israel's nemesis Iran, to minor coverage, prioritizing it to a lower status than it truly is.                   Well it was filmed in LA and he's got a prescription.   "It appears Velentzas eventually became suspicious of the undercover agent's identity, allegedly using her phone in November and December to access webpages with titles like "Learning the Identity of a Confidential Informant," "How to Spot Undercover Police," "Is S/he an Informant?" She also researched how to detect bugs.  Yet she and Siddiqui continued to meet with the agent in the months that followed. Siddiqui purchased several propane tanks and stored them in her basement, and discussed them during the meetings. "I got everything up in this joint, I already told you. If you guys... once we learn... I got everything up in this joint," she allegedly said. "Yo, she got everything. This is like the Home Depot," the undercover agent responded."           Thank you, this submission title is very misleading and I don't think OP has a very good grasp of the situation in Yemen. He seems to be conflating the Yemeni government which was recently ousted by the Houthi rebels and said Houthi rebels.     Are the Houthi in charge of the Yemeni military ? No, they are actively fighting the Yemeni military, there is an ongoing power struggle taking place here. To say the Yemeni government is gone and the Houthis now undeniably control Yemen would be inaccurate at best.   Also I can't find what your title is iterating anywhere in the article you linked to, so there's that.    This title is misleading. If Saudi forces continue to bomb the Houthi rebels in Yemen, then *Houthi rebels* and not the Yemeni government, will launch a ground offensive against Saudi Arabia. For one thing, Yemen's ousted governments are the ones asking for Saudi intervention, to say that Yemen is going to invade Saudi Arabia is misleading to say the least.  You can't equate Iran-backed Houthi rebels to the Yemeni government and military.          TY kind sage.    Solid Coke plug on that surfboard.

 You don't gain muscle without working out... it just doesn't work that way    It strictly depends on the calories that the bar has in relation to your diet.  If you are eating less calories than you are outputting you will lose weight.   DOMS are from doing something new your body isn't used to...   Lunges and squats don't work the same muscles in the same way.   1-2 pounds a week is the recommended... however if you are morbidly obese higher wouldn't hurt.   Your growth won't be stunted from lifting, more so the fact that you won't be lifting anything heavy for a while.   Thanks for this information.   Thanks for the information.   What impact will not doing cardio for a month have on my ability to do cardio? Is it like lifting where not doing it for a prolonged period of time will lead to loss of gainz?   So, did ya do it?   /r/fasting      Sounds interesting, I'll be keeping an eye on it, and might even post there once I have my diet at a level I deem acceptable    I'd you are using MFP to track your calories, I recommend not logging your exercise.  MFP is very inaccurate in calculating what you burned, so you may end up over eating as a result.   Welder, blowtorch, steel, spraypaint, and some forms of permission from the onwer....

Your two team suggestion would make it worse.... whoever writes the code should be fixing the bugs in that code. That is the most logical and efficient way to do it. Otherwise the developer responsible for fixing the bugs has to figure out what the first dev wrote and why.  Games are harder to develop than you think. Yes it's extremely disappointing, but that's life.    How about f2p servers, and subscription servers?    High killstreaks are highly situational at this point... I don't fly a2g as much as I used to 6monyhs back... but it's not easy to snag a kills or 2 before having to retreat. Besides... you play on Miller hahaha   Do you even fly?   Lol, what ground farm? Ground farm has been gone for months.... maybe an esf will get lucky and fins a 6v6 to farm until they realize that one person with flak can scare off/kill the esf....  People will bitch about esf being OP but for some odd reason they aren't flying them.... because they are UP.   	37
                         This was posted 2 days ago:   http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/2wjv07/apple_will_fight_ios_bugs_with_firstever_ios/   Several theories have been proposed but we don't know yet. It's one of the unknowns that keeps astronomers and particle physicists striving for an answer.    A good layman's summary (although not brief) can be found in Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter               The star passed through the Oort cloud at a distance of about 51,000 astronomical units (A.U.) from our Sun, very far beyond Neptune's orbit. Neptune is only 30 A.U. from the Sun (Earth is 1 A.U. from the Sun).  That huge separation combined with the star's small mass translates to its gravity having a negligible effect on Neptune's orbit.   Yes, by the same technique they used to determine that Scholz's star is receding from us.                      Yes, but it is rarely a pristine reflection so the reflected signal does not completely cancel but usually partially cancels the primary signal. Also there are usually many signals from several reflection sources so the cancellation is highly position dependent and it gets complicated very quickly.     WiFi is usually a 2.4 or 5 GHz RF signal so it bounces off of anything that conducts, like metal used in building materials.  It can also partially reflect off of and be partially absorbed by other surfaces like walls, floors, ceilings and objects in homes.    The low signal areas are generally caused by a combination of 1) blockage of the WiFi signal by materials that attenuate or reflect the signal and 2) partial/full cancellation by the WiFi signal as it destructively interferes with a reflected version of itself or other RF sources.   Predicting the RF pattern caused by the many attenuation, reflection and interference sources in a home is a very difficult thing to do, which is why measurement is appealing.                   I hear you, but these days the terms have become synonymous, and drones is just shorter to type.   7th paragraph from the bottom of the article:   The new FAA proposal doesn't apply to hobbyists. The agency already issued a policy for recreational use, with rules calling for flying less than 400 feet high and within sight of the operator, while keeping clear of other aircraft and notifying air-traffic control when flying within 5 miles of an airport.   FAA's new proposed rules apply only to commercial use of drones.   7th paragraph from the bottom of the article:   The new FAA proposal doesn't apply to hobbyists.

FAA's new proposed rules apply only to commercial use of drones.                                                Good point, I lazily copied the title from the article.   Yes, it is quite possible.  I believe Dr. Burrage is aware of this but didn't emphasize this point in her talk.         The graphic shows planets (one dot per planet) discovered over time, initially in 5 year increments and later in 1 year increments when the discovery rate picks up.  The vertical axis is the planet's mass relative to the Earth's mass and the horizontal axis is the time it takes the planet to make one orbit around its star (i.e. the planet's year) relative to an Earth year.  The initial discoveries (dark blue dots) are planets within our solar system and the later discoveries are outside of our solar system.   Link to the author's blog post: http://www.hughosborn.co.uk/2015/02/09/a-history-of-planet-detection-in-one-animation/   It was likely Ceres which was discovered 1801 and originally classified as a planet.  Later in 1851 it was reclassified as a minor planet along with 14 other similar bodies (I don't believe minor planets are included in the graphic).

That's a relief, but sure hope we're able to see the video from the 1st stage tomorrow, assuming they launch.   Yeah, they reported an avionics issue earlier and it's not clear it was resolved when the range tracking issue was reported.  But they clearly cited the range tracking issue as the reason for the abort.  Hopefully we'll hear more on this.   Next opportunities are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday launch would be at 6:07 pm EST.                    Yes, that point is (indirectly) confirmed at NASA's DSCOVR site:  http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/dscovr-offering-a-new-view-of-the-solar-wind/index.html   Summary from Wikipedia: L1, L2 and L3 are normally unstable but semi-stable halo (or Lissajous) orbits around the Lagrangian points do exist.  Since these are not perfectly stable, small amounts of thrust for station keeping are required to maintain these orbits over long periods. For most spacecraft, the preferred amplitude of the Lissajous orbit around Earth-Sun L1 is 62,000 to 124,000 miles.  This keeps the spacecraft off the direct line between the Sun and Earth and reduces solar interference when antennas on Earth are directed at the spacecraft for communication.    I assume that since since spacecraft near L1 follow fairly sizable orbits around the point, there is plenty of room for many spacecraft to occupy those orbits.   Answer to bonus question: Either "Lagrange point" or "Lagrangian point" are correct, but Lagrange is directed to Lagrangian in Wikipedia.  Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point   Replay of pre-luanch news conference on now at  http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html                        I've looked for an archived version of this talk on the CERN website but I can't find it. Anyone else?     It may take CERN a few days to get it up on their site.                                                                                                 Yes.                            Ok, that works. Thanks for the clarification.   I understand the repetition of an article being a reason for removing a submission. However the first link was to a Scientific American article which references the paper. I thought a valid submission needed to link directly to a peer-reviewed in which the paper is published - Scientific American is not a peer-reviewed journal.  Has that rule changed?  Isn't a link to the original peer-reviewed journal a better reference to the topic?         The news is that the results of a *joint* assessment between the BICEP2 and Planck Consortium teams was finally documented (and prematurely released by the Planck HFI team.)  Yes, the assessment confirmed the initial suspicions that the signal BICEP2 detected can't be separated out from other distorting effects, such as our own galaxy's dust.

He's telling a specific story of Chris Kyle. If anything short of telling the entire story is a lie than every movie should just be a 400 hour documentary of whatever war they're focusing on.    I don't see here what makes me wrong. I was reacting to 1. the quote in the link trivializing and marginalizing soldier's emotions and reactions to war; and 2. on why the movie was and to what aspect of war it chose to focus on. I never said that war movies have no affect on their audience. That's an entirely different debate of whether that is a responsibility film makers should choose to bear or not. Similar to 'athletes have influence on youth, thus they should be required to act like a role model' whether that athletes cares to or not. Clint Eastwood wanted to make a movie about Chris Kyle's life. What people think when they leave the movie is up to them. But it's not wrong to make the movie.    Unless this was your ex's shirt or some custom mall t-shirt with a spray painted caricature of the two of you banging that she got for you, this doesn't matter at all.     Then I suggest you spend a day at a facility that treats soldiers with injuries and PTSD. Try telling one of those people who put their life on the line to do what they thought was right in fighting terrorists that they're "warmongers" and undeserving of empathy.    That's fair, but it doesn't really say anything about slavery or black history month. Whether a slave owner treated slaves with kindness or cruelty is like saying a murderer tortured his victims first or executed them with a painless lethal injection. It's wrong either way.    "Wrong people" is a completely subjective opinion. The director of this movie wanted to focus on what a soldier (who I'm pretty sure is an "actual" person) goes through, so he focused on exactly the right person. There are other movies that focus on the citizens of a war torn area. If you prefer those, that's fine. But don't say something is wrong or broken because it looks at an immensely and impossibly large scope through a specific lens to tell the story they want to tell.    well shit...someone direct me to the burn unit   Welcome to 5th grade french class.   This again? Shit like this comes up every war movie. Remove the political biases from it and whatever motives governments may or may not have had to enter a war and continue a war. It's a movie. Soldiers enlist for many different reasons, and during their service, yes, things "make them sad" and a million other feelings as well.

I'm 90% sure that the Jewish Community Center has racquetball courts.    I live in Buffalo, NY so I have some insight. Buffalo has an insane amount of infrastructure to prepare for winter conditions. The city and each surrounding town has an incredible number of plows and salt storehouses. They can clear highways and main roads in no time. 2 feet of snow on a Tuesday night? Bet your ass you're going to school on Wednesday morning.   Other cities just don't have the infrastructure for it and, just as devastatingly, people don't know how to drive in the conditions, which clog up roads so those few plows that do exist can't get through. It basically comes to cost for these cities: is it worth it to purchase millions of dollars of plows, storehouses, salt stock and pay workers for the 1 storm a year or every few years? Generally, no   Just Fries is not the restaurant opening in the mall. Just Fries is coming downtown. #getfried is the name of the restaurant in the mall. Different things.

Loves to hit and has good hands. 50 points and 120 PIM in 46 games in Barrie this year.    Boston said the same for Seguin. He's doing ok for Dallas.   And regardless of where you stand in the trade, if you think our GM and brass didn't do proper research when pulling off a trade like this, you're delusional. Is it a risk? Maybe. But "attitude" stuff is so overblown. Seguin got run out of Boston because he partied and supposedly had a bad attitude. If Kane scores 30 goals, I don't care where he travels to.

You know the farm system isn't just Rochester, right? The Sabres farm system is ranked #1 in the NHL right now in terms of prospects. Sam Reinhart, Justin Bailey, Hudson Fasching, JT Compher, Connor Hurley, Mark Pysyk, Jake McCabe, Johan Larsson, and until today Joel Armia and Brendan Lemieux.    Nope, I like it. Our farm system is loaded with talent on the level of Armia   Lemiuex. And we got proven elite NHL talent in Kane. You have to pay for that. Hurts to send away Armia   Lemieux, but that's been the plan all along. Acquire as many prospects and picks as possible and use those assets to trade for proven young talent and get as close to the top of the draft as possible.

Appreciate it   How is the pit? Too close? Looks like it's only rear balcony, or the pit or way off to the sides in the lower area   I was looking at tickets for upcoming shows and I was wondering about seat suggestions. There's nothing available in the front orchestra areas, except to the far sides. There's a few in the pit, the "loge" and then rear balcony. I'd go for the pit, but I'm not sure if that's too close, like sitting front row at imax?   **Quantum** is an abstract strategy game. **The Duke** isn't a euro but still has a lot of strategy and decision making. **Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends** is highly ranked under bgg abstract games.   /u/r2d8 getinfo    The only black person is a voodoo doctor  There is literally a black guy on the cover of the box.

Plus the theme is great. Castles are awesome! And the Master Builder mechanic adds some nice depth and strategy to it. Easy to get to the table, easy to teach and fun to play for newbies or experienced gamers.   Of everything you listed, **Dominant Species** would be the hardest to get the table. It's heavy and a really long game. Can easily be 4 hours.    **Terra Mystica** might be hard if people aren't into heavy games. This game is heavy. There are a lot of rules and sometimes they're a bit scattered in the rulebook. That said, it's #2 or 3 on bgg for a reason. It's a masterpiece of a boardgame. Everything works together wonderfully, it looks incredible and has loads of replayability.   **Machi Koro** is definitely light, but it is fun. If you get this, get the Harbor Expansion with it. It evens out some of the OP strategy.    For Co-Op, you can't go wrong with Pandemic. It's a classic, and you can uprade the difficulty if you want to to make it more challenging. Same with lots of Co-ops.    Well, which is it? Are you suspicious or are you him?   At least in America, I find far too many dry scrambled eggs. People leave the eggs in the skillet, still, as they harden, then they flip and break em up a bit, like they were making a diced omelet. For me, the key is to constantly keep stirring them. Keeps any part from cooking too long and ensures optimal moistness throughout.    Toilet wine   I've heard the new expansion rewards large spread footprints for end game scoring so races that tend to have smaller settlements like Dwarves or Engineers are at a bit of a disadvantage there   So what does that mean if you have them in the box? Just throw them out?   Yea, a bit. Still a risk/reward of driving someone up on the price I guess. Are the designers working on any rule changes to balance it out?   Seems the Shapeshifters are the one imbalanced thing here. Does the bidding balance it out at all?   This is the only time I've ever heard something negative about the expansion. I just picked this up now as TM is my favorite game. Only things I've heard is that this takes a great game and makes it even better.

 This is a very good point, the US is 38th in the world I believe in terms of healthcare. We have a disorganized networks of semi-private organizations motivated by profit. The #2 post on this subreddit right now states 85% of 1900 nurses surveyed across the nation have still not been given any briefing whatsoever on how to handle a case.   I think it's a combination of misinformation or omission of relevant details from credible sources and the fickle nature or short attention spans of people preventing them from caring enough to actually follow an outbreak on this timescale. Ebola moves slow enough to not capture the public imagination for very long.   Yes exactly. I think the public should be made aware of these facts and a change in protocols and red tape should be instituted. The government needs to be much more proactive with this whole situation and it seems than without prolific scientific and public criticism they are complacent. Based on what this looks like in a couple months, it may be necessary to begin building Ebola designated hospitals in major urban areas to ensure a higher level of scalability across the nation. The US government should use its political weight to encourage international cooperation to provide similar things in poor regions with a very high population density such as the slums of India and South America. An outbreak here poses much greater threats than West Africa.   Yes this is my exact point.   Actually the studies on Ebola were minimal until this current outbreak. Not many labs have the abilities to test on BSL4 level pathogens and there was little reason to do this as there was a belief that ebola would burn itself out before killing more than 20-100 people because that had happened multiple times already.   I directly work with someone who is at the CDC 4 days a week working on Ebola. I know what they know and I know how smart they are. They are still people though they are not on a whole other planet they are on earth, literally and figuratively. I am up to date on the vast majority of published scientific studies on the matter and believe me there is a lto of debate in the scientific community over certain specifics. I'm sure the CDC has some material which is not publically published in scientific journals but they aren't that far ahead. it is in their interests to keep the rest of the community up to date. Like I said, I said the more you learn the more you learn what you don't know.    You are right, my thought process was that redditors opinions may be based somewhat on government and CDC scientist's statements. I know for a fact experts in ebola, especially those with ties to the CDC who don't want to alienate themselves, that are going to publicly comment on the matter have discussed what they should and should not say. They are downplaying or omitting facts and I believe this had an effect on proactive precautionary measures being taken in hospitals, most notable in Dallas Presbyterian. Does that make sense? Maybe it is a bit of a stretch but that was my thought process.    I don't think it's malice or stupidity. I think it is intentionally omitted because they believe there is a possibility these facts could cause panic. I think Obama believes what the CDC says reflects on him and due to the November elections has directly or indirectly told Frieden what he needs to avoid saying and the message necessary to best help the democratic party in these elections. Are these unreasonable things to assume? I'd honestly like feedback on this.   Expontentially, 10,000 quickly turns into 100,000 which turns into millions. The CDC predicted 500k to 1.4 million cases by the end of the year. I wouldn't criticize my statistic or epidemiological prowess when you use the current number of cases as a justification for that critisism.  I am not worried about the coming months, but what this will look like in 1, 2 or 3 years. Please explain how exactly I'm fear mongering by advocating for high levels of preparedness and public transparency I specifically did not make any claims either way, just stated facts such as the possibility cannot be discounted of an outbreak in the US in the coming months and years. I want proactive precautions and appropriate dissemination of information and for people to educate themselves and draw their own conclusions.   I ask myself these same question  what should we be doing? I think the government should state the facts, we don't know enough about ebola to quantify the risk of a larger outbreak in the US within the coming months and years. It might be small but it is there. This can be used as political fodder, along with the resulting possible public backlash as a justification for a massive increase in the CDC's budget. The same justifications would provide means to substantially subsidize and expedite the clinical trial and mass scale production of a vaccine like ZMapp or VSV.   The US government could also offer substantial incentives or even require major pharmaceutics companies to work as a singular entity to make this happen. I think the CDC could, with a larger budget and more political weight, work in tandem with the MSF, WHO and US army to set up BSL4 compatible hospitals in the affected areas to mitigate the current damage. Sith sufficient amounts of vaccine to cover the US population, additional vaccines could be produced for the peoples of West African. The US army, working with the other previously mentioned organizations as well as medical sociologists and local leaders could provide a distribution network for the entire affected region. We should be making preparations to do this right now.   They wouldn't be 100% avoidable. Unless you were to do something like physically wall that area of the world in, infected people could simply travel over the land to a neighboring country and infect a single person there. If they have a Nigerian passport, they wouldn't be able to fly but this newly infected person could.Walling off these countries is just not feasible unfortunately. A simple air and passport ban on affected countries would greatly decrease the chances of it getting to the US however.  There are also political matters at play here. This would have to come from high up and would probably look pretty callous.. Despite this I have got the impression recent the government won't hesitate to put a travel restriction in place for these countries if even one more person makes it here while infected.   We aren't better or separated from nature at all. We ARE nature. Nature is ruthless, callous and indifferent. We are not special, nature is quite literally trying to kill us in a myriad of ways at all times. All we are is an incredibly and unimaginably complex configuration of molecules and chemical reactions which happened to form, replicate and gradually change in ways over a very long period of time. Each generation led to better suited replicating molecules fortheir environment. After a period of 3.5 billion years you go from a single, very simple replicating complex which happened to randomly form to humans. All it takes to kill a significant number of us is another set of molecules, a bit of a simple configuration which mimics us and utilizes our body's metabolic processes and chemicals to replicate itself, a virus. This virus is not malevolent, it is not evil, it is not intentionally killing us, it simply is. Our bodies are pretty fragile, there are a bunch of other threats as well, all of which could eliminate the human race from this short blip of time we call history. It would be like we never existed at all.     ... I only used the word hubris twice in the entire post, 3 if you count the edit. It's an apt and perfectly suited term to concisely express this sentiment. Maybe /r/ebola as a community overuses that word but I honestly am not on here 24/7 or even normally more than 10 mins a day what are yo implying? That word would be over the average /r/ebola subscribed's head?   I feel all politicians should be scientifically literate. In fact I'm willing to bet all of those who are of the caliber for a position like POTUS are. They are incredibly smart people with an understanding encompassing many completely topics. It wouldn't surprise me if Obama has never read a research paper or WHO/CDC briefing or report in-depth. He knows the importance of delegation and it is superfluous to read the entire report when he can just be briefed on the main points.   I can also almost guarantee that both Obama and Frieden have full knowledge of the threat of Ebola and I would love to hear what they actually think off the record. I bet what they have to say would be very realistic and an accurate assessment. Something along the lines of  Yes it is a real and definite threat. Yes a sizable outbreak will probably eventually occur in the US if vaccinations are not offered to the public on the large scale. However, the time frame for the completion of clinical trials and mass production/distribution of ZMapp or VSV or some other vaccine is on track for completion by a time to minimize the possibility of a large scale outbreak. This is obviously not ideal but there are no further resources at my disposal to change this. I don't have the time or means to completely eliminate any threat but letting the public know this would only induce fear. I would face heavy criticism from the republicans(if it was Obama) for letting this get to a threat level in the first place. They would spin it in a way to make to hurt Democrats and also end use this as fodder to attach my healthcare act and other tangentially if at all related issues. Besides, If I was to be wrong after publicly stating there was a definite threat, I would be criticized as well. As much as I dislike keeping information from the public the reality is that their knowledge of this is irrelevant.  Actually thinking through that response as if I were them makes this whole thing a lot clearer and I understand but object to it.   Yep it's a very polarizing topic and unfortunately it seems the government seems to think it necessary to choose either one extreme or the other when making public statements, honestly this choice may be necessary unfortunately. Public hysteria has the potential to be more devastating than Ebola itself and that must be avoided. Maybe I'm naive in thinking the public would be receptive to a middle ground point of view but that would be pretty sad for humanity as a whole if it wasn't true. The government is pretty good at sizing up what the public response to a given scenario would be and maybe they're right.    My intention with this post was not to invoke fear or predict ebola is going to be the end of days, I just want to make what I see as the government and scientific community intentionally either misrepresenting things or doing this by omission. I'm sure it doesn't come across this way and have wondered since this post if I am actually contributing to the problem or the solution. I didn't make any claims in the post and tried instead to encourage to not trust a single source, me included and that everyone should do their own research about this threat. I understand how that is probably not the most salient conclusion that was drawn from this post and that is regrettable.  That being said I think it should be made apparent how many unknown factors there are in terms of the scientific understand of ebola before any government statements terms of confidence discussing outbreak potential. In addition, there have been multiple mistakes made according tor quarantine protocol in 100% of the patients treated in the US who were not intentionally brought here and monitored at every step by the CDC. A sample size of 1 is not representative of how closely proper protocols would be handled with 10 or 20 or 100 patients and in fact Texas is likely to be one of the states where hospitals are most unprepared for a patient and the mistakes of Dallas Presbyterian was wake-up call for hospitals everywhere I'm sure and procedures will be praticed upon and improved but it really is not a reassuring level of prepardeness which has been displayed so far. This disease is not going to stop spreading in W Africa and eventually another infected people will make it over here somehow so I just want to ensure that proper and perhaps even superfluous caution is used in these cases due to what we don't understand about ebola.   There is a definite fear mongering presence in this subreddit and I'm sure my post is not helping this at all. I was just trying to call attention to what seems to me to be overstating our confidence in terms of ebola as a mininal threat. There isn't enough evidence either way to make claims about outbreak possibility and this uncertainty should statement apparent with any claims made by high profile government officials. I just don't think the public should be coddled.  I agree this is not an end of days, the end is nigh level threat and really tried to keep any fear mongering in my post to a minimum but I'm sure it still comes across that way. I've been wondering if I am contributing to the problem or the solution and I'm really not sure. We will find out in a year or two and hopefully I'll look very silly for making this post.    Thank you for caring enough to look into it yourself and not just trusting what you are told. If the average person cared enough to do this more often, making a post like this one would be unnecessary.    Because it's versatile word which is directly applicable to the incredibly common human trait, over-confidence? It's a pretty common scenario, common enough to have its own word... I can guarantee you I learned the word through reading and not from reddit but as long as people don't go throwing it around inappropriately hopefully I've introduced a couple new people to the word with this post.   I agree, the stress and public scrutiny levels would be overwhelming. At the same time you will get very little recognition if you succeed in containing ebola in terms of public appreciation. That's what expected of you. If you fail however, all the blame comes directly on you and you will be heavily criticized world-wide. If the CDC had successfully contained ebola in terms of the patient in the US or even worldwide we sure as hell would not be thanking them for as long as we have been scrutinizing them and the whole issue would be quickly forgot.   These things are not mutually exclusive either. It is not unreasonable to protect yourself before others, in fact it is only natural and there should be no blamed placed on those who do this. We could be doing more help abroad of course, and I advocate we do this while protecting ourselves.    My ideas about changes to be made to help fight this disease include substantial increases in the funding of the CDC who would work in tandem with the US military to set up hospitals which have appropriate BSL4 precautions. Zmapp or a VSV vaccine/treatment would be massively subsidized and scientists and pharmaceutical companies would be  given incentive or required to work as a single entity to mass produce high enough quantities of this drug to distribute across West Africa along with quantities necessary for distribution to the entire US. This immunization would be either mandatory or readily available with no or minimal cost. The military would would with cultural sociologists, local leaders and medical personelle to implement vaccine distribution across West Africa. This would hopefully work to both halt the spread completely and offer vaccines to every citizen in the US in case we cannot contain the disease.   You're right, but the public was told was a minute possibility that it would make it to the US. I remember reading a study claiming a 12.8% chance before the end of the year. I didn't intentionally misrepresent the facts, I was not remember the exact press statements of Frieden and Obama correctly and this caused me to use definitives in my wording when they were not true.   It wasn't my intention to make things up for fear mongering purposes, thanks for pointing this out and I apologize.   What does one thing have to do with the other? Because there are people being affected on an exponentially higher scale halfway across the world and things could be a lot worse, we can't point out flaws in missteps because it isn't respectful? There is absolutely no reason why one thing has any effect on the other outside of the fact that they are both related to a specific disease.   I agree. After doing the research and looking at every available ebola study I have access to we don't know enough to make any claims about what is going to happen. My post might come across like ebola is going to decimate the world but what I am trying to say is that we don't understand it well enough to say it won't spread. It most likely will be akin to a hang-nail in terms of effect on the human population. It will definitely be noticeably and cause some pain but you won't die due to it.   However small the chance of Ebola actually having a large scale outbreak may be, shouldn't we prepare for the worst anyways? Over-preparedness is definitely preferable to being caught off guard. It seems so simple to me and yet I understand this would be an expensive and ardous process which may turn out to be complete overkill. Here's to hoping I am wrong on every single level.   The only answer to that is we have absolutely no idea. Theoretically it should be lower but there are a multitude of confounding factors which we know we but don't understand or which are unknown completely which could make it stay the say or every increase. For example it is thought there is a level of innate immunity present in a portion of the West African population due to environmental pressures. It might spread easier here for all we know.    I am from Austin but have never been admitted to the ER anywhere in Texas. I am not surprised in this 'nonchalant incompetence' in Texas hospitals however. Of anywhere, Texas was probably one of the worse states for an ebola patient to show up in.   By the way I like 'nonchalant incompetence' a lot in terms of phrasing. It conveys the actions of hospital employees much better than my description, I will probably steal it in the future.    'Yets' and 'buts' don't cut it for me with Ebola. Multiple lapses in quarantine protocol occurred as a direct result of the hospital and state health department and indirectly the CDC . I understand what you are saying, but you have to admit the entire process did not play out according to plan and displayed a level of unpreparedness unacceptable in first world countries. At the same time, you're right this could have played out much much worse. It will serve as the necessary wake up call to drill all hospital in ebola protocols and was probably a blessing in disgiuse.   * All of the following were avoidable breaches of protocol, any one of which could have resulted in transmittion:  * Four government employees walked into a BSL4 environment without any protection whatsoever.  * The patient was sent home with a 103F fever despite the fact he mentioned he was from Liberia.  * His apartment was not cleared of potential bio hazards because of government bureaucracy and the process of getting permits for this.  * The ambulance was not properly disinfected after his transport * Direct family was quarantined without being provided with things like food for a span of a couple of days. * A nurse presumably incorrectly handled her PPE equipment, most likely by not following protocol to the T when taking the PPE off.  This is not the only time someone with ebola will show up seemingly out of nowhere at a hospital in the US. This level of competency in handling this patient is insufficient to minimize possible transmission risks. All it takes is a single untraced contact to begin a larger scale outbreak. What if it is someone homeless for example, what if it is a food industry employee who does not have insurances and attempts to work through the symptoms.   I'd have to put it as slightly forced optimism and frustration at how things are playing out. They work with a high level passion, determination and personal investment in success which of course is conducive to a great amount of stress. These are the some of the smartest people in the world, they work almost 24/7 and they are doing incredible work with what they can. I really hope I am not coming off in anyway resentful towards the CDC employees as that is in no way the case, outside perhaps those responsible for picking their PR stratagems. I admire and respect everyone theregreatly. At the same time I'm glad I'm not in their shoes and am somewhat frustrated not with anyone in particular but with these events.   The scary part is that those other people who are "smarter" than you really don't have that much of a better idea than you do. The more you learn about anything the more you realize how much you don't know.   Considering how much we don't understand about Ebola I feel any speculation on why we think an outbreak probably won't happen is irrelevant. If there is a chance of a large scale outbreak,  however minute that chance may be,  shouldn't that possibility be addressed?    Edit: within reason of course. I shouldn't go out and spend millions of dollars because I bought a lottery ticket. The hard part is defining reasonable and unreasonable.   I'm sure that is indeed the case. I know for a fact behind scenes scientists have decided to intentionally down play the issue. The masses are being shielded from reality like small children incapable of handling a harsh reality. There is a balance between this and fear mongering which must be met    They worded their statements in a way that could cover a huge number of scenarios. If there are 30000 infections would that be considered Ebola spreading widely? It is only about .01% of the U.S. population.    If scientists could put their thoughts as poetically as this we'd be in much better shape right now. Aren't many poetic scientists like Carl Sagan, the two qualities don't really coincide unfortunately.   Looking at the transcripts of Obama and Friedan announcement's regarding patient 0, it looks like you're right they specify that it would be complete isolated, just contained.  Frieden on 9/30 'The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.' Mid-September Obama said 'chances of an Ebola outbreak here are extremely low'.  From a PR standpoint it makes sense to be intentionally vague while implying there would be no further transmission or threat of any level. Maybe that's why I thought they made specific claims but you're right.  I think my general point still stands as the message conveyed is much more important than exact word choice but I shouldn't have claimed those specifics when they weren't actually true.    I haven't read any of the most recent rounds of studies but I remember reading a paper that calculated an of R0 1.5-1.9 that was published mid-september I believe. They used WHO reported cases I believe and did mention the fact that these numbers are likely under-reported and it could in fact be higher than this.   That's definitely true. I that the expectation of the public that a serious epidemic would be like the movies instead of something gradual over years along with the notion the government is this omnipowerful agency and not something human and fallible can't help either. Before all of this that's sure what I thought. If you had shown me a movie depicting these exact circumstances a year ago it would have made me roll my eyes. I would have thought how the patient was handled in Dallas was a completely ridiculous scenario and government ineptitude like that would never happen in real life.    My concern is that R0 may directly correlate with number of infections. As more cases pop up, resources like contract tracing become increasingly difficult. I'm more worried about what this will look like in 2-3 years than anytime soon.    I'm currently doing research on in silica genome sequencing algorithms and identification of ORFs and frameshifts and have a degree in Biomedical engineering.    Granted this is not a problem in this subreddit so much but this is a small fraction of Reddit. Reddit itself is a cross-section of the a world population consisting mostly of people who are relatively educated, scientifically literate and young. Despite the fact that a transmission of Ebola in the United States is now confirmed, in /r/news replies with speculation like this are still the most upvoted.  [The differences in healthcare, cultural practices,etc.] is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here the US.  This attitude troubles me greatly because the young and scientifically literate Reddit population seemingly agrees with it or else it would not be at the top. Is this not again the same hubris that was displayed with claims that Ebola would **NEVER**to the US? After that was it this same hubris again when US government changed their attitude to OK it got here but there is absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan. (Edit: Saying NEVER and NO RISK here was not  entirely accurate there were no definite, quantifiable claims actually made see bottom for more info)  For the second time, this kind of thinking can now be seen for the potentially harmful combination of over-confidence and unrealistic and completely irrelevant optimism it is. The whole thought process that we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country, it can't spread is not only wrong but is causing inaction and apathy. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.  This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right.  As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. I'm sure many of you are the exact same. I have been saying exactly this over and over again since the response to patient 0 was so obviously negligent. My lab is in Atlanta and the head researcher was hired in August by the CDC for work on Ebola. I know first hand that there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there. I don't understand the attitude the scientific community is using in the media right now downplaying this issue. It's like a parent not telling their child something because they are afraid it is too serious for the child to completely understand that it could bother them. We need to err on the side of caution rather than worry about how this will look to the public.  I think the best thing that the average person who agrees with this and is as puzzled as I am can be do at this point is to try to change the opinion of anyone and everyone you can. This must be done in a way which is as amicable and non-insulting as possible, as a discussion rather than a lecture, which is kind of hard to do that while getting your point across at the same time. As a community, it might be a good idea to discuss what we can do to point out this hazardous line of thinking and what the most effective way of convincing people to change their minds. A better way of putting it is that you don't want to change peoples minds at all, you want to provide the means for them to convince themselves their  attitude is incorrect. Does anyone have any advice on how to toe the line between fear mongering and reasonable concern?   **Edit:** The above wording implies high profile officials directly stated ebola would definitely not come to the US and that it absolutely would not spread are not entirely correct according to the wording of the press statements.  Obama stated in mid september: 'The chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.'   Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC in his press conference on 9/30. The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.'   It was not my intention to make things up for the purposes of my argument and I was more referring to the implications of these statements and how I personally interpreted them along with how I felt the general population did. I didn't look at the exact wording of these statements prior to posting this and was going off memory and should have been more diligent with my claims.  However, the statements are intentionally ambiguous so they don't come back to bite Obama and Frieden in the ass despite a large number of possible scenarios. I feel they also definitely convey a sense of dismissal towards any outbreak possibilities. I believe there is insignificant scientific understanding of ebola in terms of transmission and epidemiology of Ebola to make these claims and this should be made is readily apparent along with any claims. In my opinion press statements about Ebola should be treated with the same levels of scrutiny used in peer review articles. I do not believe any peer review article would have made these exact claims without accompanying them with information about unknowns.   **Edit 2:** I want to clear something up which is not readily apparent from this post. I am **not** saying ebola is an end of days scenario, that is is going to change the world we live or or disrupt civilization. I am making the point that some of the public sentiment and the attitude of the government towards this disease may be hubris. There are a lot of variables we do not understand about ebola and government and scientific community needs to improve transparency in regards to this fact. I encourage everyone to look at scientific research papers regarding ebola, read as many sources as possible, and listen to what scientists much more knowledgeable than I say. Treat everything with skepticism but you should be able to eliminate any biases by looking in a lot of places. Use this to come to your own concussions and encourage others to do this as well.    Remember back when everyone was saying Ebola would **NEVER** spread to the US? After that happened it became there was absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan. The whole thought process was we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country. I don't think anyone can argue that this was not hubris. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.  This is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here in the US  This is **the exact same hubris** that has been parroted by the CDC and government for weeks. This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right.   I'm sorry I don't mean to insult you or anything but I believe your way of looking at this situation is hubris plain and simple. It is actually hurting us in the long run through an inappropriate level of complacency and apathy to what is going on. As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. Look through my post history and you will find that I have been saying exactly what I am saying now over and over again starting the day after patient 0 diagnosis, when the negligent handling became apparent.   Although I am not an epidemiologist but more of a geneticist, the genetic community in Atlanta is all intertwined and this obviously includes the geneticists from CDC. The head researcher in my lab is one of the foremost and knowledgeable experts in the world for genome sequencing and expression profiling. He was hired by the CDC in August to track the spread and mutations of this Ebola epidemic and is currently there 4/5 days a week. I do see him daily though as he stops by the lab after work almost everyday. With this view of the inner workings of the CDC, let me tell you there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there.   I sincerely hope this post is enough to convince even a single person to take a deeper look this epidemic and realize the potential overreaction is by far preferable to under-reaction for this disease. Please do you own research and come to your own conclusions instead of just trusting what you are told. Obviously this includes the claims I am making right now. Nevertheless, if anyone who is not up to date on the current scientific "state of the union" if you will, with regards to Ebola has any questions feel free to ask. Although there are many much more knowledgeable than I am, I'll do my best. The point of this post is not fear mongering but encouraging a more proactive approach to this problem. I really tried to minimize that any fear mongering but it is always better to err on the side of caution so if my points come across like over exaggerations I apologize.   Can't believe they didn't mention movies. After going through the From Ashes demo, I'm convinced movies presented in a VR format similar to From Ashes would be amazing and incredible immersive. I think it has the potential to revolutionize the movie industry. I could see VR potentially replacing current 3D technology with theaters that are VR specific and instead of a single screen consist of a high powered and high resolution Oculus Rift at each seat or something like that. They would be optimized to minimize latency and maximize resolution for complete immersion. I would gladly pay an exorbitant amount of money to see a movie like that.  I've had some pretty bad motion sickness from AI for example but the way From Ashes is presented made me feel no discomfort whatsoever. That program is by far the best use of VR technology I have encountered yet.   If you haven't tried it do yourself a favor and check it out. https://share.oculusvr.com/app/from-ashes      I can confirm I am having this same problem with RES4.5.1 and chrome Version 37.0.2062.124 m   http://i.imgur.com/XBOQdyw.jpg?1   Simplicity in abundance breeds complexity.    This is the obvious follow up. Just by the way these are some of my crazy ramblings from that other askreddit elevator thread a day or two ago that I feel like reposting.  You walk into an elevator with a couple people already there. To set the mood you begin with the whole awkward and cliche "I'm sure you're all wondering why I've gathered you here today" thing to them. Awkward silence and maybe a pity laugh ensues. This is just the beginning though.  While "You are my Sunshine" plays over your phone speakers, the seductive and sensual and ever so slow unbuttoning of that trendy and definitely not serial killer-esque trench coat begins. The most important thing to remember here is it you must maintain eye contact with each person for at least 4 seconds and move in sync with the music. If they look away assert your dominance by moving towards them so they have no choice but to be intimidated by your alphaness.   Obviously you are not naked underneath your trench coat, that's what they expect that's tired and boring. Instead you are wearing a suit made up of fresh fish you caught from the river this morning. After catching each fish, you made a quick mental note of it's personality traits. The reason for this will soon be apparent but it is very important to be in tune with your fish friends. This should be obvious but I'll say it anyways, the fish are secured to that green morphsuit you are wearing underneath the trenchcoat and not directly to your skin. This is of course done with with Velcro for easy fish removal. Based on your fish personality assessment you choose the correct fish to give to each person based on looks and personality. The fish personality must be compatible with the personality of the recipient, this is vital. If they won't take this fish, don't be insulted you prepared for this. You pull out our duct tape and ensure that this person and their kindred fish spirit are bound securely. They will thank you later. Once the person-fish kindred spirits have all been united, you pull out that celebration hotdog you've been keeping for just this occasion. You look at each fish-person with a sense of satisfaction, knowing your duty has been done. In a single bite, you down the hotdog and as the energy in the room reaches it's apex, you hear the ding for your floor. In a single swift turn you leave the elevator and the stunned silence of your ever so cooperative audience is all the thanks you'll ever need. Another day, a couple more fish-human hybrid creatures are now on the prowl. The plan is succeeding.   You walk into an elevator with a couple people already there.

He sure got her good she'll have no idea what hit her. This ain't no ordinary prank son its got them BSL4 levels of layers upon layers of prankage going on.   If it starts killing them they won't really have a choice. Up until that point if it even happens, yeah I'm sure they will be praising Allah for striking his wrath upon the heretics and their secular culture. A healthy dose of reality(actually a very unhealthy dose) for ISIS in the form of an ebola outbreak in their ranks would sure be interesting to watch them try to rationalize.    Lionel Hutz was in there though... I could never forget the great Phil Hartman.   Just part 1 of the saga of the Fishophile, a pretty sweet and powerful superhero just trying to reunite man with his long lost fish ancestors and claim his place rightful place as the savior and of man and fish alike. Coming this summer straight from the sea to your living room you'll be hooked from start to fin.   God forbid the people putting their life on the line for the sake of complete strangers' health would prefer not to die in one of the worst ways imaginable. While the rest of the world is too afraid to do much of  anything other than worry and watch with a morbid fascination as nations crumble these people are quite literally staring at the faces of a prolonged, painful and utterly unforgiving death. Every night I'm sure they worry about waking up tomorrow on the other side of the looking glass, slowly dying as this apathetic configuration of molecules builds up in their body and literally tears them apart with machine like indifference.  I can't think of a more noble cause. No matter your beliefs, whether your you're a Christian, an atheist, a Muslim or even a member of ISIS you can agree these people are motivated solely by compassion and empathy and complete selflessness. There's not many things the entire world can agree upon but I believe this is one thing that is objectively good no matter how you look at it. These people should have not only whatever they feel is necessary to protect themselves but also a fucking medal, a parade and international recognition and prestige. I like to think of myself of a good person but I could not ever willingly do what they are doing right now.    The world just isn't ready for a creature with the body of a man and the dashing good looks of a fish.   Without a doubt the worst simpsons circlejerk ever. I can rest assured you were on the internet within minutes registering your disgust throughout the world though.         You walk into an elevator with a couple people already there.

Money can be exchanged for goods and services. Woo-hoo!  Some of my friends say it's wrong to eat meat No, Timmy. That's just communist propaganda!  What are you going to do? Release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths and when they open their mouths they shoot bees at you?   Hello chief. Let's talk, why not? You have many questions, Mr, Sparkle. I send you premium - answer question, hundred percent! I am disrespectful to dirt!! Can you see that I am serious!! Out of my way, all of you. This is no place for loafers! Join me or die! Can you do any less?   Hahah damn how could I forget that one? I'm embarrassed now don't judge me too harsh  Edit:  Bake him away toys.  If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about.  Hmmm your ideas are intriguing to me and I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter.  Lisa in this house we obey the laws of THERMODYNAMICS.   Yep sounds right, unfortunately it's the same for me. I have a little background in genetics but my focus is on automated genome sequencing soI only try to ID coding regions and let those smarter people look at the bigger picture. Only experience I have with immunology is cell physiology and intro to biomaterials back in school so all this is pretty much outside of my comfort zone as well.  I do work closely with a geneticist who spends 75% of his time at the CDC here in Atlanta on genome sequencing for ebola and other infectious diseases who I'll shoot an email about this. I'm sure he probably has some insight. If you'd like I'll let you know what I find out.  Ebola is just so morbidly fascinating it's like watching a horrible car crash you can't peel your eyes away from.    Here ya go all the fun of a circle jerk in a single post!  Stupid sexy flanders. Nothing at all ^(Nothing at all) ^^Nothing ^^at ^^all ^^^Nothing ^^^at ^^^all  The goggles they do nothing.  "The aurora borealus?! At this time of the year?! In this part of the country?! Localized entirely within your kitchen?!" "...Yes" "Can I see it? No"  Well, if it isn't my old friend, Mr. McGreg, with a leg for an arm, and an arm for a leg  Everything's coming up Milhouse!   My cat's breath smells like cat food  Uh, no you've got the wrong number. This is 9-1... 2  Hey, look at my feet. You like those moccasins? Look in your closet; there's a pair for you. Don't like them? Then neither do I! [throws them out the door] Get the hell outta here! Ever see a guy say good-bye to a shoe?   Talking out of turn...that's a paddling. Looking out the window...that's a paddling. Staring at my sandals...that's a paddling. Paddling the school canoe...ooh, you better believe that's a paddling  Me fail English? That's unpossible.   Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidently ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidently" with "repeatedly," and replace "dog" with "son."  Inflammable means flammable? What a country!   This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon they'll have written the greatest novel known to man. Let's see. It was the best of times, it was the "blurst" of times! You stupid monkey!  Well, crying isn't gonna bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog.     Is this it? http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/196/Supplement_2/S329.full  Haven't read through it yet but I plan too but it looks like what you are talking about.  Edit: I'm not sure if everyone has access to the full paper so here's a summary.  It took at look at SEBOV(ebola sudan) an the allelles assosiated with cytotoxic T lympocytes antigen-b and their role in fatal and non-fatal cases  Claims:  * Survival is likely dependent on the rapid development of an effective CTL response that limits the level of virus replication before it can overwhelm the body, as is evidenced by increased numbers of activated (HLA-DR+) CD8+ lymphocytes in patients with nonfatal cases * Expression of the B\*07 allele, which is highly associated with survival, confers a phenotype that efficiently drives T cell activation and CTL epansion early in the SEBOV infection * B\*67  and B\*15 allelles are highly associated with fatalities (e.g., B67 and B15) and  contribute to an inefficient or unresponsive phenotype   What I don't understand is wasn't there a doctor in that group of 4 people who entered the apartment? Typical Texas sheriff I can understand, but a doctor. This just goes to show that the CDC's preaching of direct contact with bodily fluids is a terrible method and leads to hubris causing this.   Anything the CDC says regarding ebola transmission needs to be something that would make it into a a peer reviewed journal. There is no conclusive proof ebola cannot be transmitted via aerosolized particles. Take it from Charles L. Bailey, who was the head of the government response for the Reston outbreak  "We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting, Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air Bailey said are misleading."  Prior to this whole thing I always figured the government was competent on the CDC end at least. They always seemed like this omnipotent entity ready to pop out those PPEs and and L4 biohazard stuff to handle ET at any time.    I honestly don't know what you said or what you want me to reply to. I addressed your concerns about the vaccines with questions of my own.  And I thought you knew something about life sciences. Many of these vaccines created from recombinant technology turn out not to work. **Some actually have the opposite effect**. The human body and the immune system are very complex systems.  So the opposite of the intended vaccine would be that it causes you get to get sick no? How is this not a harmful effect?   There is no telling what a genetically modified organism will do until long and careful testing is done.  I mean yes you do have to make it through phase I and II clinical trials, but NHPs are pretty good models so we will have some idea prior to this. Secondly the VNV platform shows potential for use post-infection as a cure in addition to a vaccine. Finally we can(and have) used this in humans due to extenuating circumstances already with only minor side effects. What do you mean by long and careful testing? The normal regulatory pathways for vaccines, which the government is already helping to expedited for ebola vaccines?  But seriously what are you saying? Oh so there's a possibility this particular vaccine will turn out to be ineffective so fuck it lets not even try there's no hope?   If you'd like to learn a little more here's a good paper regarding the VNV vaccine. Pretty recent too... 9/27 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14011517    Yes and this is with what 8000 ebola infections? That number will increase 30 fold in the next few months. What happens if it makes it's way into the Indian slums or into poverty stricken parts of China? Ebola HAS(I guess slighly debatable due to semantics) and WILL continue to spread inside and sooner or later outside of Africa. It is not going to burn out, it is not going to just go away if we ignore it and it will be a problem for years to come. We don't understand it well enough to have this smug complacency that the reason it can spread in West Africa but can't in first world countries is solely due to economic and infrastructure inferiority and cultural differences. I predict we'll find out if this is in fact the case very soon.  I'm not saying there will be a global, society break down due to ebola but is one of the most, if not the most threatening diseases in terms global repercussions of our generation. Maybe I'm over reacting, maybe I'm over analyzing this and I hope I am but the fact remains the scientific community is still very much in the dark on many aspects of ebola. For example transmission potential, potential reservoirs, ex vivo viability, among many other important characteristics remain unknowns. Of course publicly Scientists would never say this but here in Atlanta, working on genome sequencing research with CDC staff who work on ebola sequencing and have an ebola understanding equal to anyone in the world is not as reassuring as you might think. Behind the scenes, experts have decided the best approach PR wise is a confident, definitive and relaxed demeanor regarding the threat of ebola. These scientists make bold, often misleading comments which would not make it into any peer reviewed article.   If you ask ask a scientist during an interview if the disease is airborne they well emphatically say no, direct contact with bodily fluids only. Press them a little bit and they will say well yes, aerosolized particles produced while for example coughing or sneezing do have the possibility for infection. This is in an example of how the disconnect between scientific terminology and popular usage can be use to kind of intentionally misrepresent the situation. The general public considers transmission through sneezing,etc to to be airborne, while this does not fit the scientific definition of airborne transmission. Take it from Dr. Charles L. Bailey the virus researcher who supervised the government response to the Reston outbreak. "We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting, Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are misleading."  Another example is asymptomatic transmission. Any expert will emphatically state there is NO chance of transmission before presenting symptoms. Press them a little farther and they will admit there is a 1-2 day "grey zone" where the virus does have a risk of transition but symptoms are not readily apparent.   This blatant misrepresentations of the facts is not OK when dealing with a Class IV bio hazard outbreak. The government should NOT be coddling the public with definitive assertions when there is no conclusive evidence to substantiate this assertions. This causes complacency in both the general public and hospital staff. This disconnect and downplay of the serious situation may have led to Texas Presbyterian Hospital to dismissing that infamous patient with recent travel history in Liberia who was presenting flu like symptoms with only antibacterials. This hubris may have resulted in 4 government officials walking into that patient's apartment before it was disinfected with no PPE at all. This apartment was technically a level 4 biohazard area meaning personnel must enter and leave only through the clothing change and shower rooms, shower each time they leave the facility. Supplies and materials are brought in through double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock, which is appropriately decontaminated between each use. Of course this is kind of hard to set up in an apartment complex but there is a middle ground. If this Sheriff turns out to be ebola positive, which is unlikely I hope, these misrepresentations of the scientific facts may have cost that man his life.  If you actually read through all that dribble you probably need to reevaluate your life...Heute Westafrika, morgen die ganze Welt.    Granted my understanding of recombinant vaccines is by no means comprehensive but I do work on genetic sequencing algorithms and alignment pipelines so I feel somewhat comfortable discussing it. It seems that live attenuated VSV based vaccines show considerable promise.  Of course the lack of real clinical trials means much work has to be done but VSV efficacy in NHP models is reassuring. As far as I can tell, the risks of this specific vaccine based on NHP models and a compassion administration to an exposed researcher seem to be reasonably minimal. Although not conclusive with an n=1, a mere 12 hour fever post administration with no other health effects in the only human trial  combined with the lack of pre-existing VSV immunity and no mention of adverse short-term effects in NHP models point to this being a viable vector. The potential loss of protection after 6 months-1 year is not ideal either but this is infinitely better than nothing.  Why is there no telling what a genetically modified organism will do until long after careful testing is done? Can you provide any citations of long term health effects from recombinant vaccines? I don't mean to sound condescending, just am genuinely curious. I assume unwanted gene knockdown or immune system responses would be the cause of this?  The emergence of public awareness, concern and interest in Ebola recently means these experimental vaccines will and already are being fast tracked. West Africa will in all likelihood get very little of any of these newly developed vaccines when they arrive though, unless it's for clinical trials to prove efficacy. Ebola won't be contained there without a huge surge in levels of organized humanitarian action and international altruism on an unprecedented level. The world will be feeling the effects of this for years to come.   That being said your tone is very condescending. As I see it you are basically saying reality is what I say it is, anyone who disagrees with my sensible and rational points should be dismissed because they just see me as a fear mongering racist. I have seen the exact opposite on this subreddit, with extremist and pessimistic opinions regularly topping the comments section. Tone down the smug almost insulting attitude a bit and maybe you won't be dismissed as a racist fear monger quite so much.   On Tuesday after the first US diagnosis: probably around a 5.   Yesterday after hearing about the multiple mishaps by the hospital and CDC: 6  Today after hearing about the almost criminal negligence by the Dallas health department; power washing the parking lot with absolutely no protective gear, the fact potentially ebola ridden bedding and towels remained in the apartment and the fact that the family members had not been briefed about what to do: A 7 or 8   Here's my assessment of the situation:  Looking at flights from Monrovia to Brussels, if I want to travel ASAP I can get a flight for $1,280 on Monday Oct. 6. It looks like they have flights out every monday and friday according to http://www.brusselsairlines.com/en-be/destinations/liberia/monrovia.aspx  I was honestly expecting for it to be more like two weeks and I looked this up to try to prove he probably had booked the flight prior to exposure on the 15th. Now I can't discount it as a legitimate possibility that he booked the flight ASAP after that fateful taxi ride in Monrovia. My only qualm is why he would not be candid with the healthcare staff about believing to have ebola if he just wanted ZMapp. Why would he have been content with going home with just antibiotics on the 26th? My only answer is maybe when western doctors didn't think it was ebola, it was what he wanted to hear so badly he started to think his fears were unfounded. He desperately was hoping not to have ebola and this confirmation was enough to assuage his worries until the 28th when he couldn't ignore the truth any longer. I don't know but this all definitely raises some questions.   They need to quarantine every single one of the 80+ along with their close contacts as well. 500 people quarantined in their homes with posted guards ensuring they stay put and providing them with food etc. is a small price to pay to stop an outbreak of a diseases with has a 50% mortality rate. If for nothing else, do it for peace of mind even if the quarantine number is superfluous. The government needs to err on the side of caution rather than worrying about how this will look PR wise. It will look a lot worse in 21 days if this is not stopped.    Looking at flights from Monrovia to Brussels, if I want to travel ASAP I can get a flight for $1,280 on Monday Oct. 6.

I don't know but this all definitely raises some questions.   It's more a darker red to maroon although I'm sure those words mean nothing to you.   And the CDC knows exactly who these people are.   Basically they knew this could happen but short of stopping all flights from the infected areas there is no way to stop it from happening. On top of that, this isn't Africa patient isolation and contact tracing is much easier here so controlling the outbreak, which has proved effective in Nigeria and Senegal is easier as well.   According to the CDC, this person is not an American citizen, he wasn't traveling over there. He traveled to the US to visit family.   Only counts if its ebola poo   In this case it may help, it cannot hurt to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of ebola and if public opinion causes that to happen I'd say it's a good thing even if the actual risk to US residents is minimal. Although I'm not sure there is much more we can do here in the US at this time as all medical staff have already been briefed on ebola protocol.   Even if this is true, which I don't it is as I'm pretty sure the person was traveling over a week ago not within the past week, the CDC press conference made it absolutely clear there was no risk of transmission during the flight.   The individual was not showing symptoms on the flight. Ebola isn't transmittable until you show symptoms. The CDC representative was very clear during the press conference that there was no risk of transmission on the flight or in the airport.   What's the only thing happier than a 3 legged dog? A four legged dog.   Yeah I know right. I'm 24 and am just now confronting my mortality. Doesn't help considering about 3 hours ago I was in the hospital, sedated and undergoing an endoscopy among other things because of a possible ulcer. Luckily it was just the beginning stages of an ulcer and was caught very early but the whole ordeal was still a harsh reality check .   Yeah I'd warm her icy heart with a nice hot island fuck.   Damn that's scary stuff. Unbelievable that something like that can just happen to a healthy 22 year old.   Damn, wish I was still at my tedious system test job so I could listen to those all day. I was able to listen to pretty much every free one he has before I left for the summer but now I can't bring myself to podcasts cause at school I feel I should either be focusing on work or watching something.

As much of the webm media posted on reddit are basically gifs, it would make sense for those to be displayed along with images. Webm media with sound wouldn't fall under this category.   A toggle option for this would be ideal as well.  Edit: damnit I just read the title, any mod want to remove "as well when"? The meaning isn't clear and I meant to edit it before submitting.   Oops I always make that mistake.  VG, EG and PG all sound exactly the same and I was debating which one it was while typing. Should have just looked it up.    The biggest problem in determining if ecigs are safe or not is that most tests on the chemicals used in the liquids are based upon consumption, not inhalation. I doubt that we will have a definitive answer about how to safe e-cigs really are for some time.  From what we know right now, vaporization of VG and PG(the solvents nictoine are dissolved in) produce 1 known carcinogen, formaldehyde and 2 potential ones,acetaldehyde and acrolein. The levels produces vary based on the voltages used in vaping. Most ecigs range from 3.2-4.8V and at 4.8V the level of formaldehyde produced is 200x greater than 3.2V and is comparable with formaldehyde produced in cigarettes.  A 3.2V the level of formaldehyde is 807 lower than that of cigarettes and at 4.0V it is 13x lower. The other 2 carcinogens vary in the same manner. I am not 100% the quantification of the carcinogen levels is on a per puff basis but I believe it is   Another potential hazard is vaping produces particles 30 micros in diameter which the lung may have trouble expelling. But there is no conclusive evidence of that yet as far as I know.

I'm a biomedical engineer so I'm fairly scientifically literate on these things.   First of all, they could seriously fuck up Seoul before we could do anything about it. Second the population is seemingly extremely brainwashed. Many North Koreans would not respond well to being invaded by the country they've been taught is the evil enemy their entire lives. Third the huge out flux of refugees would cause problems for China and South Korea. South Korea has said they'd be willing to take in refugees but China sure as fuck would not want it.      Yeah I think you're right, didn't they include a message at the bottom of the page saying some results of your search have been redacted due to DMCA? Maybe I'm remember wrong but for a while there I thought you could just click the message to get the omitted results.   I'm just surprised bing hasn't implemented a filter to completely get rid of all the leaked nudes in their search results. It wouldn't be that hard to do.   That's a good point. I wondering if microsoft will get threatened for having this come up on the first page of search jennifer lawrence fappening. Pretty similar issue.  http://imgur.com/Ws2x5VK   Complete bullshit as thumbnails are fair use.  Here's the precedent: Fair use. A search engines practice of creating small reproductions (thumbnails) of images and placing them on its own website (known as inlining) did not undermine the potential market for the sale or licensing of those images. Important factors: The thumbnails were much smaller and of much poorer quality than the original photos and served to help the public access the images by indexing them. (Kelly v. Arriba-Soft, 336 F.3d. 811 (9th Cir. 2003).)     Fair use. It was a fair use, not an infringement, to reproduce Grateful Dead concert posters within a book.

I'm sure she owns the copyright and any site hosting the image does need to take it down or be sued. A lot of people think the reason reddit got DMCA notices is because of the thumbnails.

Linking to DMCA  content is allowed, hosting it is where it gets illegal.   That celebrities should get preferential treatment because they have more money and are better than average every day people?   This may be the greatest news I've ever heard.   I don't believe in god either but I'm sorry for how this asshole(benshiffler) is acting. I honestly believe if everyone lived their life according to the true message of the new testament the world would be a better place. It is people who corrupt this message and cherry pick what they want to believe when the real meaning is basically love everyone and be good to everyone no matter what.   Obviously there are religious assholes but obviously there are also some overzealous atheist assholes as well, case in point benshiffler. In the end I don't really see any difference between the two a lot of people are selfish narrow-minded dicks on both sides of the equation. I just wanted to let you know not all of us no-believers are this way.   Yeah, November is a fake month make up by those crafty chickens so people kill more turkeys.   All that Perl coding must have gone to OP's head   I ate freebirds every single day when I worked there over the summer. Gained like 15 lbs but it was totally worth it those were some of the most delicious days of my life. After eating there 4+ days a week I still wasn't tired of it by the end, I think that's saying something.   So I go to Georgia Tech and had Dr. Potter as a professor last semester in neuroengineering fundamentals. I'm not exactly sure about how the neurons recognize the goal of flying the plane but I do remember him discussing something similar to this in class.  I want to say the neurons encounter negative feedback when the plane crashes and positive feedback while the plane is flying. So they "learn" how to avoid crashing keep flying but don't quote me on this. Really interesting stuff though he was the most passionate professor I have ever had!  	108

 That...is a good question, upvoted to find the answer. Interested in seeing gay guy's perspectives on this.   House M.D. and Scrubs.  Scrubs has got some great feel-good stuff going for it, but House REALLY knows how to set the right music to a mood.   You got some weight on them there shoulders buddy? Feel free to PM me if you want to vent :)   She's priceless!  In all seriousness, she's not "mine" to sell; you'd have to ask her for a definitive price.   Make a homeless person's day - go out, find a likely prospect and invite them to come for a hot meal. Spend that $30 on a cheap, warm meal for them, and sit and chat with them for a while.  It'll feel very rewarding, and you'll literally make their day.   I'd KEEL YOU, infidel!

My girl just loves the effort, that I thought to think of her. That's what makes it special, remember, not any amount of money, gifts, food or cards - that YOU thought of HER.   A phone call to tell my girl that I love her.  Yeah, I went there.   The only chair free in the entire form room was with three other boys...they'd been friends together since before primary school, and I was the odd one out, within an hour I was "one of them", and by the end of the day I'd assumed general "leader" of the group. That was fifteen years ago, I'm STILL absolute best friends with them all (not so much leader now, but more decisive decision maker when they're all uming and arring).   A quick way to make money without working, selling myself, my girlfriend, or anything I own.   Being a newb to competitive generally helps, though it has come in handy once or twice!   I always go down on my SO and rub her clit (quite often at the same time) and/or include G-spot stim with two fingers BEFORE we go anywhere near intercourse.  After two/three goes (sometimes she works her clit for me), we switch up and we have sex. Occasionally she'll orgasm from this penetration but only after cumming the other way first.  This wasn't always the case- she faked it for a long while at the start of our relationship, but once she had owned up (she was hesitant to tell me that she only ever came through clit stim usually), she taught me how she usually did it, and viola! Satisfaction every time.  I guess the ethos here is communication.      Hey all, after mucking about and not really getting anywhere properly on here, I've bumped to OU to learn the ropes. I've kept this team on the books for when I know what I'm doing better. In the meantime, I've got an OU RMT going on here; http://www.reddit.com/r/stunfisk/comments/2uyx6c/rmtou_rate_my_team_please_also_suggestions/     So, brace yourselves, this'll be exhaustive. I've literally started competitive yesterday, so I'm learning in process. After some mucking about in UU, I came up to OU (being the standard smogon tier) to learn with a greater range of Pokemon to choose from. I created a team, as best I could, trying to cover weaknesses and give a good spread. Here it is;   My original team, "1.0";   Uluru (Tyranitar-Mega) @ Tyranitarite Ability: Sand Stream Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Dragon Dance - Fire Punch - Earthquake - Stone Edge   Mammy (Mamoswine) (F) @ Focus Sash Ability: Thick Fat EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Stealth Rock - Endeavor - Ice Shard - Earthquake   Tooky (Zapdos) @ Leftovers Ability: Pressure Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 HP / 168 Def / 68 SpA / 20 Spe Bold Nature - Tailwind - Thunderbolt - Roost - Toxic   Jackie (Chansey) @ Eviolite Ability: Natural Cure EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD Impish Nature - Heal Bell - Soft-Boiled - Toxic - Seismic Toss   Snippy (Gliscor) @ Toxic Orb Ability: Poison Heal Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 HP / 56 Def / 200 Spe Impish Nature - Fling - Roost - Acrobatics - Cross Poison   Ash (Trevenant) @ Sitrus Berry Ability: Harvest Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD Careful Nature - Substitute - Leech Seed - Phantom Force - Will-O-Wisp   I put this together with Sandstorm in mind, giving a couple of non-sandstorm Pokemon to balance. Mamoswine would lead, cast stones and then I'd roll with the punches as best I could. Here's the five battles I had with this set-up:   1.0 Battles   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208655633   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208658753   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208661773 (Dud - disconnected opponent)   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208663685   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208666206   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208667959   Of course, if you watch those you'll see I didn't get pretty far (there are probably those of you who could have predicted this before even seeing the battles). So, I made notes as I went - I had nothing to dish out fire, no water, no grass, no psychic. I also had no hazard clearer, as the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed. So I dropped Zapdos, it being the one Pokemon that ALWAYS failed, and felt wrong in the line-up, and replaced it with Charizard (with Y Charizardite).    With a SpA setup, Charizard covered Fire, Grass, Fighting and a hazard remover tweak. I also dropped roost from Gliscor as it never got used with Toxic Orb and Poison Heal, and replaced it with Hidden Power [Ground], for STAB. Finally, with the fire covered by Charizard, I dropped Fire Punch from Tyranitar and gave it Aqua Tail, to give the team a water move.This resulted in my current team;   Current team, "1.5";   Uluru (Tyranitar-Mega) @ Tyranitarite Ability: Sand Stream Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Dragon Dance - Aqua Tail - Earthquake - Stone Edge   Mammy (Mamoswine) (F) @ Focus Sash Ability: Thick Fat EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Stealth Rock - Endeavor - Ice Shard - Earthquake   Clithard (Charizard-Mega-Y) @ Charizardite Y Ability: Drought Shiny: Yes EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe Timid Nature - Fire Blast - SolarBeam - Focus Blast - Defog   Jackie (Chansey) @ Eviolite Ability: Natural Cure EVs: 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD Impish Nature - Heal Bell - Soft-Boiled - Toxic - Seismic Toss   Snippy (Gliscor) @ Toxic Orb Ability: Poison Heal Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 HP / 56 Def / 200 Spe Impish Nature - Fling - Hidden Power [Ground] - Acrobatics - Cross Poison   Ash (Trevenant) @ Sitrus Berry Ability: Harvest Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 SpD Careful Nature - Substitute - Leech Seed - Phantom Force - Will-O-Wisp  So I have tended to lead with either Tyranitar or Mamoswine, though on occasion I'll get straight into sweeping with Charizard-Y. I've played ten full battles with this team, the replays are here for those dedicated helpers among you;   1.5   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208676939  Won - Minimal Losses   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208680004 (Dud - opponent left)   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208680619 (Dud - opponent timed out)   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208682026   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208683759   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208686815   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208688808  Good, close   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208707828  Massacre   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208708485 (Dud - opponent forfeited)   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208710740   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208711866 (Dud - opponent forfeited)   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208712401   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208713403   http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/ou-208714442   So far, so good. They're working well as a team, I think. Two of the above battles where I've lost I got distracted IRL, so can't complain about them there (I forget which two). Again, I've taken notes, and have the following to say;   - Defog on Charizard just isn't practical, I need another hazard remover   - Missing an Electric move (and some water types are getting away with murder once Charizard is out of the picture)   - Missing a Psychic move, and because of this Gengar is often being the key to unlocking my whole team.   - I NEED a stronger water attack than Aqua Tail, as Heatran walks all over me. See end of next point for potential solution.   - I didn't realise you can only one-mega-evol per battle, so I'm kicking Tyranitarite out, as Charizard is just so much better with his. Therefore I'm thinking of running Crunch in place of Dragon Dance and a choice scarf to make up for the speed drop. My only other thought on Tyranitar was to change him to a full SpA spec, with Surf/Dark Pulse/Earth Power/Thunderbolt.   Any help and suggestions would be great; as I said they all seem to work pretty well together, and have all had their moments pulling through for the team. I need to remember to not keep Tyranitar in against Fighting, as he sucks against them.  EDIT: Took out my suggestion of swapping substitute for Psychic, as it's an Atk, not SpA Pokemon, so that'd be stupid.   Well, for starters I'm trying to figure out how to balance a team...right now it seems every team I make it's very hit or miss.  So I guess to start with it's team building advice!   Hi guys,  Old-timer Pokemon player here (though not an actual old timer - only 25!), never really got into competitive before, but want to give it a shot. I understand most of the basic terms, but need someone to help me organise myself and address weaknesses and such (I know there are websites that show you weaknesses and coverage etc, but it helps to have someone knowledgeable explain it all to you as you go through it!).  For your information, I am dabbling on Showdown team editor, and am aiming for UU level.  Edited: Added in tier   Here it is;  Sir Reginald (Escavalier) (M) @ Assault Vest Ability: Overcoat Shiny: Yes EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe Adamant Nature IVs: 30 Atk / 30 Def / 30 SpA - Pursuit - Megahorn - Drill Run - Iron Head  Frill (Vaporeon) Ability: Water Absorb EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe Calm Nature - Scald - Wish - Baton Pass - Ice Beam  Specs (Flygon) @ Chople Berry Ability: Levitate Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Outrage - Fire Punch - U-turn - Defog  Giggles (Darmanitan) @ Choice Scarf Ability: Sheer Force EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Flare Blitz - U-turn - Rock Slide - Superpower  Ice Cold (Cloyster) @ Focus Sash Ability: Skill Link Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Icicle Spear - Rapid Spin - Shell Smash - Toxic Spikes  Naughty (Chesnaught) @ Leftovers Ability: Bulletproof EVs: 252 HP / 84 Def / 172 Spe Impish Nature - Wood Hammer - Roar - Synthesis - Drain Punch   Escavalier and Vaporeon are the core - they don't seem to do badly in any of the matches I've played so far. Flygon is generally a great Pokemon, and Darmanitan/Chesnaught are both very hit or miss. Cloyster seems to get out his toxic spikes then die, so looking ideally for something more sturdy (also as he's part water he adds extra thunder/grass weakness to the team that already is there from Vap).   Ah, my thanks.   This is the team...  Flappy (Crobat) @ Black Sludge Ability: Inner Focus EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe Jolly Nature - Brave Bird - Roost - Taunt - U-turn  Phanny (Donphan) @ Assault Vest Ability: Sturdy Shiny: Yes EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe Adamant Nature - Rapid Spin - Earthquake - Knock Off - Ice Shard  Rub Rub (Blissey) @ Leftovers Ability: Natural Cure Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 Def / 252 SpD / 4 Spe Calm Nature - Wish - Seismic Toss - Protect - Toxic  Sia (Chandelure) @ Choice Scarf Ability: Flash Fire Shiny: Yes EVs: 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe Timid Nature IVs: 0 Spe - Shadow Ball - Fire Blast - Energy Ball - Trick Room  Sir Reginald (Escavalier) (M) @ Assault Vest Ability: Overcoat Shiny: Yes EVs: 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe Adamant Nature IVs: 30 Atk / 30 Def / 30 SpA - Pursuit - Megahorn - Drill Run - Iron Head  Frill (Vaporeon) Ability: Water Absorb EVs: 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Spe Calm Nature - Scald - Wish - Baton Pass - Ice Beam   Okay so I've listed them in order of what's losing the most. Crobat and Donphan aren't helping at all right now, and Blissey isn't really doing her job. Vaporeon, Escavalier and Chandelure are rocking, but I need to change it up a bit. Any suggestions/advice?  Edit: Now chandelure isn't doing too great either. I really like him, but if he's going to keep failing like he has in the past few games, I want to just build my team around Vaporeon and Escavalier   Haha! Aww that's understandable, Pokemon IRL would be the best. Yeah, they are pretty cute - you must have loved Gale of Darkness (if you played it), getting to start with an Eevee!  Ooooh you did!? Can I ask to see a pic/pics without seeming creepy? :P   1. That's awesome. 2. That's also awesome. 3. Boo! Umbreon's the best! ;) But fair enough, to each their own.   Not in the literal sense, obviously - I mean look through their submitted/comments sections to get a better idea about them?   Species: Lorikeet  Age:?  Sex/Neuter status:?  Breed: Lorikeet  Body weight: Overweight (in comparison to other Lorikeets that are around here)  Clinical signs: Overweight belly, ruffled feathers, doesn't close its wings fully once it lands, has a piercing shriek cry instead of the chirrup/whistles that the other lorikeets do.   Your general location: Sydney, NSW, Australia  (It's one of a flock of wild lorikeets that often come sit on/near our veranda ledge - flock is about 10 in total I think?) Have only been here for a little under two weeks, but have heard it's odd cry the whole time I've been here, so I'd imagine it's unlikely that it's changed condition anytime since.   I'd have an Umbreon, if any. It's my overall favourite pokemon and eeveelution - couldn't stop playing Pokemon Coliseum (Gamecube version)   1- How did you decide on the order/placement of them, or did you ask the tattooist to work it out?  2- Are you having them 'actual' colours, or slightly odd/off/different tones to the 'classic'?  3- Which is your favourite (that's right, I asked it!)?      Says the person calling OP a man...   How do you keep track of your submissions? I mean, some stick with you really easily in your head, but as for others...how do you remember what stories you wrote for which anthologies/magazines, and when they were sent off etc?  I'm starting to get this problem, so wanted to get some ideas before deciding on a system for myself to use!   Will have to look into this then. Thanks for the recommendation!   A generation ship (I'm not sure if that's the correct term but it's how I know of them) is a spaceship designed to hold thousands of people (or millions, maybe), and for each subsequent generation born and raised on the ship to take over running/maintenance of the ship, to enable humans as a race to a) travel farther without going faster than light (because we don't know for sure if this will ever actually work) and b) survive beyond our own planet/system.  What problems do you forsee that a generation ship would face (I'm thinking serious ones like radiation exposure or food supply, rather than say alien contact) and, if you can think of any, what solutions would you present?  My favourite one is oxygen, and I put forward the idea of massive forest rooms/levels dedicated to creating oxygen/taking CO2.   I don't think we'll be travelling light years very fast any time soon. Travelling them in normal time? I'm for the concept of a generations ship, similar to what they ended up with in Wall-E but without the AI robots, laziness and death of muscle/bones.   Chest tattoos on a woman.  Probably get some hate for this, but I really don't like them at all. Just my personal opinion.   Also, would you mind if I used it as inspiration for a short story I'm writing?   Which is better, or is it best without either? (for your teeth, obviously)   Gotta say, love the name. True spirit of our sci-fi culture mixed into our space-faring future. Have some adoration. Keep us posted on the details of the mission (don't suppose you have a link to somewhere where we can follow/subscribe to updates about it do you?) - what is the mission's name do you know (if it's not the same as your craft).   Don't know if anyone has shared this already, but it's a darn awesome watch.  Kudos to the creator.  http://www.earthporm.com/astronaut-alexander-gerst-space-time-lapse-earth/   I always have the heat up so high that if I do, I get light headed and close to passing out, so no, you are not the only one who enjoys masturbation-free showers...   Snowballs?   My five questions.  1. How much did you know about A.K.A. Jessica Jones before you heard about the production? 2. Did you apply for the Harper role, or did you go for another? 3. What other Marvel character would you like to play (or would you like to have played, if it is an already-cast character) 4. Your most well-known role was as Trinity in The Matrix trilogy, did you enjoy making these films? 5. What was your favourite part of the Matrix "journey", whether that is a particular scene, character, funny backstage moment, crew member, whatever?  I'd give a Reddit gold to anyone who can help set this up.      Sorted.  	42
 Nope have a nexus 5 and 6 on 5.1 and still get it.   Nothing says I'm reading a post by an aussie as when you see 'these cunts'   Fucking brilliant.  But yeah, give us some examples dude, you can't just slander someone's business and not back yourself up    No! No! stop it! Stooop!!!!   Anonapotimus?   Please make sure you also send your CVV number on the back.   My brain went straight to "cruising down the street in my '6 4' - Eazy E   Season 1 episode 1, the pilot    Just ride it out dude, it does get easier.      What season and episode is this from? Is a null comment    Until then, I'll keep on watching the seasons I backed up from the internet should it ever go down   You're good. Hats off to you, even gave the back story!   Fuck.. Me too..   Exactly the same thing here.   It definitely kept me sane by keeping my mind off it as much as possible.  For me it was Seinfeld and KOTH, so far I've watched them both back to back about 6 times.   Hi guys,   Can we make it a sub rule that when referring to a pic, gif, video clip, that we include the season and episode in the title?  This would make it a lot easier to refer to the scene and would stop a lot of the "which episode was this?" questions.   No one is an outcast or a freak mate, you just haven't found the people that share the same interests as you.   Been there too buddy, I made another post in this same thread explaining it as well   I now have a little boy of my own, I'd hate for him to ever experience bullying, let alone ever become a little asshole that does it.   You live in bankstown and feel a little outnumbered?    Compared to the rest of Sydney.. I beg to differ.  I don't mean this in a derogatory manner, just stating the facts.   Bankstown is predominantly Muslim.  Sausage sizzles generally aren't halal and nor should they be.  Pork sausages rock.  Go for a drive to a bunnings outside of the bankstown area and get your fix.   I was a cunt of a kid.. These days in the office environment the world of bullying and teasing to some extent still exists..   In a way of trying to amend my ways, I'm still a cunt, but am protective of the guys on the receiving end of bullying and teasing.   One of my close friends at work is a bit of a super nerd, he games hardcore, loves Star wars, collects figurines, grows a weird beard etc etc.. He doesn't have a bad bone in his body.  I'll watch upper ranked management at my level and above snigger at him, give him pointless chores etc, and time and time again I'll step in and tell them to fuck themselves on his behalf.   He knows I'll always laugh at his little batman dolls on his desk, or his little yoda thing, but I'll also take the time to let him explain why he likes them etc.   He tells me that at school he and his group were always picked on, and that outcast group that people used to laugh at.. I was one of those cunts on the giving end.   To all you peeps that felt left out, bullied, picked on or made an outcast, I'm sorry.   "He would do his little cape thing" - this line got me smiling and laughing.  Being an adult, you see that as being cute in a way, but as a kid, he would be seen as a freak and constantly bullied where I went to school.   T   Oi Ben!   Oi Ben: https://youtu.be/2GLFzhYV5S0   Where was good Hank? He must be all grown up now    Well, to you and that kids mother in the posts, I hope you both live a long, healthy and fulfilling life by transferring all of your illnesses to people like this buttplug that claim they are sick to earn fake internet points that mean absolutely nothing.   Thanks so much for this   When Dale takes Bill's money from his account after the million dollar bet - "he would've just spent it on something stupid.. Like himself!"   Thanks mate   What does the A stand for ?   Mine is the opposite. I have it set so it only works when the phone is on the home screen.  When I press the power and put it on standby, it has to count down till it password locks itself, during the 5 min period until it locks, ok Google works with the screen off.   These guys Aussie?   In Aus, we refer to it as a sausage sizzle.. No buns   Side loading the OTA doesn't involve root access.  You're just doing the job of google manually by installing the update yourself.   adb sideload update.zip   This is all you need to remember.  Been on 5.1 for a little.. It's a bit of a 'meh' update.   Fuck! I thought it was just me!  It freezes and sounds like a pair of barber clippers on a rampage.  Only way to fix is to reboot.  At least I now know it's not just my Nexus 9   It's nor racism if it's actually the truth.   I'm just calling a spade a spade.   Sorry if I hurt your little tree hugging spirit.    Welcome to Australia's aboriginal communities   Ha! Added.     What is NC?  My next US trip is going to be all the southern states.   When I travelled to the US, this is the type of stuff I wanted to see..   I was disappointed.  I guess New York, Vegas and San Diego only have skinny people.   These are banned in Australia now, you can't own a tanning salon    Right you are! I've only ever owned K series engines, so I assumed they are all chain.  As for Subaru, had many of those fuckers and their belts   And Honda    Following the usual google schedule, it will be November -December this year, with rumours and a full leak of the device by July.   The next one will more than likely be a blip better than the N6 as hardware is now kind of stagnating.. It will either be a little quicker and a little more RAM, both of which you won't notice as Lollipop hammers along even on the lower spec devices.   All I want is for the next Nexus to last 2 days on a full charge and heavy use.    Haha, mate I was talking about phones.. I would never buy LG or Samsung home appliances (actually Samsung TV is ok)   To google I go    I have the N6  You made the right choice    I remember that!   Was the camera any good?   What on earth did I just watch? Haha.. It wasn't about the phone wasn't? It couldn't have been!?   Get the Nexus 6.. Same sized screen (even bigger) and you get the updates!   The G3 is a pretty awesome bit of gear dude.  But I'll stick with my N6 ;)   I'm from Aus.. I don't remember the juke.. They rename most of the phones here different to the US (They used to)   They have upped their game mate, the N4 and N5 that I had are both still working as good as the day that I bought them.  Build quality and screen quality are great.  The biggest downfall of LG in the past was horrendously bad software and the cheapest hardware.  The software now being pure android, means that its controlled by google and it's silky smooth.   Hardware wise, the build of the N4 is more premium, but I don't recommend it over the N5.   The N4 had its last ever update, I doubt google will push the next greatest version of Android to it. The N5 still has another update left in it.   My first ever phone was a Motorola Star-tac :)   I still have mine in mint condition, I still marvel at how nice it was designed and the feel in the hand.   The N5 was nice, but cheap when compared to the N4.    Nexus 4 is still the best looking Nexus ever made in MY opinion..   Too bad about the battery life and the speaker on the back, which was completely muted when the phone was placed on anything.   Be that as it may, it was a pretty crappy phone!,   Remember the 'Chocolate'? damn that was a terrible bit of gear.   I went from an iphone 4 to the Galaxy Nexus, I remember just staring at the phone thinking 'this thing is rediculous'..   Side by side, the G Nex and the N5 are exactly the same size.. even though the N5 has a bigger screen.   Well, lets face it, 6 inch is the limit.  I have the Nexus 6, and I still think it's too big.  5.5 inch with the same bezel sizes etc, would have been superb.   I never thought I'd see the day that anybody actually WANTED to buy an LG device..  Wind back the clock 5 years, you would have laughed at any phone built by LG and moved on to buy anything else.  Well done LG, you definitely have turned the tables.   Take a hike cojack    Hey, you owe me a high five.   Potato Man..   Thanks heaps mate, appreciated    That is sensational! How do I get my hands on a copy??   And Troyboi... Listen to 'Do you'   3, you missed trap music    A) who gives a fuck  B) who gives a shit  C) who gives a toss.   Open it, close it, no one really cares.  So over this cafe and all the media around it since the siege.     Can't comment on the white, but the blue is a little slippery on the back, I got a DBrand skin with the metal finish which has helped immensely with grip.  Burn in? Mine was purchased originally in Jan and it has none.  Vibrate motor, yep it rattles a little but works fine. I don't have haptic feedback enabled so I rarely notice it.  Battery, iPhone is way better.. But then again I do a lot more with the nexus 6 that would be processor hungry I guess.  Charging, charging is quick, for a phone this big with a battery so meaty, it does charge up quick.  5.1- phone is even faster than before, a lot smother and way less buggy. Since KitKat, the nexus has been iPhone smooth, now it's even smoother.  Camera, camera is great, compared to the nexus 5, a potato takes a great photo. As the others have mentioned, HDR+ gets you some great pics, especially in daylight.  Size, its a big fucker. I'd NEVER consider going bigger and still wish it was a touch smaller, but once you get over the hand cramps, its quite hard to use a smaller screen.  Speakers, sound is good, its not as bassy as I'd like, but its definitely loud, and has great stereo balance. Build quality, she's good.. Not iPhone good or HTC, but very close.  Any other questions, hit me up buddy, I'll give you my honest opinion.   Well done, you played that very well!   I'm watching the episode where he is donating his kidney, as we speak.   "NOT THE MASTER COMPUTER!"   "Ahhh.. I think it was a Dell"   You're a Gem.. My N5 and N6 are now both on 5.1.  My N7 5.1 My N9 ...... no love yet.   Completely agree with all.. Except for the stingray :)  The Lemo come to think of it would be a great tank    It's not hard to wick a KF?.. it's what I used to learn on..  But the Kanger Sub-tank takes all the pain of RBA's but keeps all the benefits.  As for the Stingray, I love mine, it has the Magnetic button, and definitely doesn't have a crunch to it.. you might be thinking of the Nemesis   LOL thanks mate.. god knows what I was looking at, everything was referring me to the SDK   Chicken butt.   All of that effort and not even a wireless keyboard   Isn't that the infamous "THATS MY PURSE! I DONT KNOW YOU!" Episode?  All respect to your Bobby Tatt, but Gribble is the best character of that show, with Peggy my most hated equally with Buckley.    Start off easy..  Get an istick30 and a kanger sub tank mini.  You'll get a .5 ohm coil and 20w is about all you need to cook it good and proper.  Later on, jump on fasttech, get a fake Kayfun Lite and a stingray mod.  Build a 0.5 ohm coil and wick it how you want with the cotton you want.  I've gone all the way to mech mods and tanks, now am using a stingray and kanger sub tank.. The sub tank is a brilliant tank.   4.4 was definitely better..    I've given up, my phone says I need a newer version of adb 1.032 or something.. I really don't want to download the whole SDK    A smack.   This kid needed to be smacked when he was younger.  Many times.   Its definitely better. Not great, but better.   It's lollipop.  Wait for 5.1 to be pushed out, it supposedly fixes the issue.  I'll let you know in 15 min when my one finishes    Australia chiming in.. Downloading and installing as we speak. (Google OTA)  Hopefully 5.1 will bring it back to its former glory.   At the moment its a paper weight during to how slow it was with 5.0  I have a 2012 Nexus 7, 9, 5 and 6, the 7 always gets the update first.   Is there 13 others before you though?   There is a lot of words you have written that I don't know. A lot.   Na na na na leader.   I want to genetically modify a cow and a pig together to have a cow sized pig.  Bacon would be sublime.   Good on you lad, the only thing that will stop you is you.  Sometimes things will be hard, but you would have never know what hard was if there was no good before and after it   Why so serious buddy?  Put a king of the hill twist on it hwhy_so_serious   Credit to you, I'd prefer fat dog over fat cat.   It does count mate, my elevation is 3 steps.   A lot of your life is already mapped out for you buddy, that's what I believe.  What you can do is guide yourself through it the way you want to travel it.  Example, you have a passion for cars? You can become a mechanic and be paid miserably and be dirty, or you can be an engineer.. Get paid highly and be clean.. Either way, you're following your passion.   So, really.. You want 'bitches' swooning all over you.  I get this.   I like this one, clever.  You made the best of a bad situation.      Yup.   I remember 1996.. I was in year 7.   Fuck.   What's holding you back?   Awww.. You a little sad buddy? Why don't you just downvote the thread and move along?   FUCKING LOL. so far you are the clear winner.   In the mountains? Which country?  Its good knowing real mountain folk still exist!   I tried Rusty Shackleford, it was taken.  	102
    The art alone is reason enough to get it. I wasn't too crazy about the game myself, but it's impossible for Studio Ghibli to NOT leave you awed. So do it. Plus, it's like Pokemon. So yeah.   Maybe try "Boys over Flowers" or "Fated to Love You." I recommend the second more so than the first because it is funnier :-P.   Have a go at Korean dramas. Highly addicting, and great if you have a quirky sense of humor. Bonus: Every episode is an hour.   You know most of your problems, and you know how to fix them. Get your shit together and do something about it. If you're on the road a lot, pack your own healthy meals ahead of time. Work out. And about the social thing? You are being too analytical and need to cut back because you can't go through life judging people. Good luck, man.   Sounds like he has a social disorder.   However, computers can cause a lot of loneliness problems.   Literature teaches analytic, reading, and writing skills which are necessary to function completely within a society. We are able to learn about our ancestors through literature, and manuscripts centuries old do not only tell popular folktales during the time it was written but it also tells a greater story- of culture, entertainment, and how people lived during that time which otherwise we would not know of now. People, and history, are preserved through literature.    Answer: yes, moving back home is worth it. Moving back home sounds like a solid plan to me for a variety of reasons. First, living at home will give you piece of mind because not only will you be in a city/town you actually like, but family is great to turn to for a social outlet which will release stress and provide you with company outside of a working environment. Even financially, this will give you a break as I am sure you won't be spending as much during your stay with your parents than when you were on your own (no groceries, rent, etc. fees). It will also offer you more time to find yourself in familiar places you probably found yourself as a teenager. In regards to employment, there is no reason for you to be earning minimum wage due to your degree and experience. Look for entry-level jobs for your major and maybe jobs outside this realm as well. There are places you can work which can provide a decent pay (say, post office employee) far greater than minimum wage. If you truly believe you cannot find a job with your current experience I suggest looking into internships, volunteer programs, or research assistantships. Each of these will provide (if not a cash compensation for your time) an opportunity to network and develop your skills. Many are part time, and those that are full time may lead to a full-time job.. These are very rewarding experiences that may fulfill your expectations in the future in regards to your desired salary. Do whatever works best with your schedule while you receive help. I hope everything works out for you in the end.    It is difficult to specify how much money would kill off a majority of my life problems. I'll guess with about $30-40,000 and back this up with a brief explanation of my life problems. First off, my dad just recently had a massive stroke with the additional complication of phenomena. With a three week stay at the hospital and additional weeks of care at a rehab facility (plus getting a tracheotomy), I am sure we are at a loss in terms of money. It doesn't help he will be unable to return to his job. The additional money received would help him to stay at our house -that is, if he can even live there- in comfort for a while. Second, I will be graduating college with about 15k in debt. So, that aside:15-20 thousand would let my dad live in the comfort he deserves for a while.. My dad's happiness means a lot to me, and I know he would be able to rest if some of his money issues were solved.    SO that's where all of Mexico's money is going..  	11
 My daughter is almost 2 years old now and I absolutely love spending time with her. I always look forward to how happy she is to see me and seeing her. The way she lights up when we play together and even when I just talk to her.   All of that makes the time spent with her worth it. I'm not sure why your husband would be so detached but perhaps it just takes a while for some people to warm up to the idea of having children. Maybe it has to do with how he was raised. Simply my thoughts but I am in no position to make assumptions.   In the end, I love the time I spend with my daughter because of what she gives back to me.      	2
 Ummmm the ten commandments are not easy to understand??     Gods will is, please explain?   Blasphemy.   My big gripe is it is not true to one of the greastest books of all time, very untrue to the books plot making it a terrible movie   Gods word has to do with the gays, as its in writing in the book that claims to be gods' word. Gods will would be unanswered prayers. You are cleary missing the.....point.   You dont or didnt understand the ten commandments?   Do you understand the diary aspect of the movie?   The millions of religions claim to know the word of god, thats what a specific religion is. I dont claim god is easy to understand, religous people do.     Are the ten commandments not considered the word of god?   Is the flair not to specify your discussion? Thats what it says when you are picking one making the post, and also so one could easily spot or filter though the threads to find which religion specifically being debated, see the side bar. Thats what the flair for your post is there for lol     The word of Gods' should have a personal meaning not the flair. The flair should indicate the specific god.   What im asking is pretty common place amoung christians. You always hear, well thats the will of god and we do not understand gods will   What was the reasoning behind unanswered prayers or loved ones premature deaths?   Use a personal definition   Did you, when your prayers went unanswered apply the will of god that couldnt be understood, or a premature family members death etc?   Millions of intrepertations claim to know the word of gods meaning and what it intends you to do   I dont understand comments like those, its got a personal meaning or it doesnt, the "word of god". You answer how you understand it. Same type of poster who never gives an answer and hangs on technicalities.   Its got the christian flair.....      There is a big difference in the fleur de lis and confederate flag. But if your just saying the situation is similar i can see that   Semi Pro, movie is hilarious   The count of Monte Cristo.   The jinx   People are raising questions and are in the early stages that appear an attempt to ban will be made at some point, and some already are.      They have other historians claiming the exact opposite.    Weed, ever looked at the back of a dollar bill? Ever looked at the back of a dollar bill......on WEED MAN?   Smart water   Ohh... I already adressed that non sense, i thought you were saying FDL is a symbol of white power.      That kind of reasoning is nonsensical. The Fleur de lis doesnt represent white power.    I respect yours as well, but im trying to understand it. What you are saying doesnt make alot sense to me.   Coming from an eagles fan is weird.   For one hes got more playmakers on def. What are you basing "talent" on? Lucks' team stacked with weapons last year. Plus he got beat so bad look like he shouldnt even been there.    Exactly. Jacksonville lucky to have a coach show up at this point.   Colts are loaded doesnt mean Luck is better, yet. Brady just torched one of the best def in history in the SB, after destroying the colts. I cant stand brady but i dont see how going into 2015 luck being better is justified. Maybe after 2015 is under way but going into....idk bout that.     To be fair, you rip Ryan for his playoff record, Lucks' aint anything special either.   Bum   Isaac newton, combine his knowledge with the technological advances today, possibilities would be endless   Learn to read tablature. Very easy compared to reading sheet music. Get you into playing the type of music and songs you want to play     And Practice. But spend 70% of your time praticing scales, runs, chords, etc that do not come easy. Spend most of your time on things that dont come easily you will see vast improvements quicker and the rest of the time on song you have mastered, scales, etc     This is how i started, self taught. Once you master reading basic tabs, get a book called speed kills. Helped vastly with picking, finger strength, dexterity, etc   Ummm ok.....   Its pointless in the fact it, residuals, have no effect on why they would continue making movies after sucessfull ones. Your first reply was a technicality in this reference frame.      Your second was to confirm opinion on most actors receiving residuals which was to my comment most actors do not. Taking into effect all the extras small roles, etc in tv film and independent, it is more reasonable to assume that most do not. This also irrelavant imo.     Again if residuals is a small sum, it would have no effect on the topic at hand. I feel instead of trying to catch me on a technicality, which has no real bearing on the topic, just make your own post that goes directly to OP, so imo unproductive as we are literally back to where we started, but to each his own.     Furthermore my example, were you aware beforehand if the Godfather was a union shoot?   A residual is not a major sum.      The point to the OP is just because your movie makes a billion dollars doesnt mean you become a billionare, ie you make a few good movies doesnt mean you stop working. You are hanging on a technicality, a weak one, and its unproductive to the topic at hand.   Not possible to keep a potential billion dollar buisness a secret   What? Your statement is a little contradictory, no?   Ewww.....    Moving away from family- easy, friends-tough   Yep. Add light salt and pepper.     Dont overseason, or put any season salt on the steak. You ruin the flavor of the steak if you do   I was told not to drink and drive. A couple days in jail and 5grand later i learned.......   None     All   Yes this is suppose to happen by 2025. It could be a new team or jacksonville might be sent.    There are alot of games with losing teams that dont get close to selling out. Its been proven shitty teams in london sell out a bigger stadium regardless but it seems logical this will fade over time   Didnt this already happen, slavery no longer exist.

Its about an envy raged murder   Nichole brown and Ron goldman. Ohh wait......      Seriously, jon benet ramsey is insane. The body found in her own house, the murder weapon, highly suspious ransom note, etc How this could not be solved is beyond me   Right about the same time i realized my mother is crazy. How could he marry this crazy individual, hes fucking crazy too   So you are saying this behavior developed overtime as well? If so ill buy that   Lol, agreed. But kind of petty to dislike someone i dont interact with on that basis, right? Maybe not   Idk bout cats being protective. Dogs are pack animals and view you as their pack. Consquently security got to step up when theres a baby on the way   Band of gyspys. My only knock on hendrix is his voice occasionly. Well this band Buddy miles splits vocals with him its amazing.     Check out the song "who knows"   I crashed at a band members house, one room house. A girl who was staying at his house he wanted to fuck(not dating) came on to me and we started fooling around, so he got pissed and separated us, lol bizarre right. Had her sleep in his bed, him on the bedroom floor and me on the couch.     That morning he went to work, i then went into the bedroom to see if she was still "down". She was, we started fooling around, then i realized it was about to take the next step. Feeling weird about being in his bed, i brought her to the kitchen and fucked her there.

Dont know if this would be shown in a film class but could teach or show a few things about movies to you     1.How to make a legendary film on a low budget     2.Power of the script     3.You dont have to spell everything out to the auidence. Its about a bank robbery you never actually see     4.The importance of casting actors that relate together as opposed to most talented     5.Power of the script   Guitar, its my lifeblood   Dress like you are going for an interview. It makes a difference.   Actors are usually paid a flat sum for the movie, they dont get royalties. So al pacino say made 10 grand for the Godfather, thats it. He dont make money after the movie is released.      Bad movies usually will overpay big names to get people to watch the movie. Sometimes sucessful actors try to expand their horizon and try new genres they are unfamilar with and pick a shiity movie in their ignorance. Actors could sign on to a movie with a great script and the director bombs. In jack and jill maybe it was a favor to sandler   Thats why i dont complain about franchise and dont understand when they do. The last few years have been so much better after years of no progress   Find the island is covered in weed plants and beautiful horny women, and right as i enter the field with my new big breasted best friend..... alarm clock goes off   Ali preparing for Foreman. His sparing sessions were literally Ali taking a beaten(purposely).    Well id have to disagree they are runningt he world, maybe the internet, but i get your point.     At least you agree the fluer de lis being a symbol of racism is non sense. A much bigger issue than just saint fans   SJWs?   Fair enough. I could give a couple reasons for you but mostly system is flawed.      1 Ever get fired as a head coach and take a new offer else where? When you do your upcoming free agents are all unhappy(w/e it is they say when a player rejects your contract and cant be offered another one). So to say the computer rarely offers big money to these players, and replaces them with new ones, there are exceptions dealing with age and pos. Also notice some of the biggest FAs can be picked up on one year deals after the draft, first FAs group after     2.When you start moving picks around, teams are more likely to use those picks to fill needs as opposed to FA, and also teams take this into account with expiring contracts     3.All contracts in madden are front loaded. Meaning the later years of the contract is when you pay the most money so the first 3-4 years can be a breeze cap wise before a clean house process is forced and does happen   Lol sounds about right. In its basic premise pretty fascinating though     Every read the simalirillion, or any tolkien(ties into string theory)? Well anyway tolkiens middle earth universe is created by music, ie vibrations. Very similar to string theory and this book was written like 70 years ago   Your question would lead any reasonable person to assume otherwise.......   Familar with string theory?   Yea we all do. But the exploits are a ton less than they use to be is my point. You use to be able to switch a 99ovr qbs' position to a 65ovr db during the signing process, and sign the qb for nothing then switch him back, etc      Im not concerned about your team, im answering your question about the cap    He was obssesed with colors at one point. He was using a prism to experiment with light. White light goes in, rainbow colored lights come out. He made the assumption that the prism acted as a separator of white light. So effectively saying white light was a combination of all colors.    It gets more techincal but thats about what i know   Fast break or snickers ice cream bar if that applies   Im just saying there is reasons why you have those players and are reasonably capped.      The trade/contract system is flawed but nowhere near as bad as before. 5 years ago it was so much worse   Why the social network? I feel like this is one of those multiple choice questions, "Which one doesnt fit?"   Primer is a mind bender to say the least     My fav is The prestige   Einsteins theory of general relativity is amazing. One of the best discoveries of the human mind, period.      Newtons white light theory is pretty mind boggling   You clear up space in those trades. Plus the amount of picks especially 1st rounders have a direct effect on your cap   That will only work if hes in the last year of his contract   Did you do a fantasy draft?   SJB wont be worth a shit, at least early on. Keenan lewis + BB, with vaccarro in the slot, thats some nastiness. User SBJ at SS   In court right before judge layed out his sentence. Nothing major, but it was unclear if i would get jail time to the very end, long ass minute.   Creationism   Kind of a pointless thread then, right? I know who is on the team lol   Thats not instrumental   Yes, both. La villa strangiato is great too      Check out Rodrigo y gabriella  doing a cover of stairway to heaven on youtube. One of the best instrumentals and could be a better version than the original, seriously   I think that the reason Chris is such an exceptional debater is because he was around someone 24/7 that could dish it back for most of his early life. He implies that during the debate.     Check it out tell me what you think.     When they get to the topic of the existance of God chris starts with, "Well i dont need 10 minutes to disprove God!". Classic. Whatever side you are on, gotta crack a smile, classic Hitch.   I think this is relavent to the thread. I find it interesting and may have never known about this. I find the implication ludicrous and quite stupid but interesting that an attempt is being made.     What are OPs thoughts?   Is this based on upcoming stats for madden or assumptions?     Should be able to play high pressure def and press our dbs, gotta be a 1st for saints in madden.    I agree with C hitchens for most of this debate, including his iraq war stance. But its not really a massacre, Peter hitchens is a bright dude, just as brillant as Chris imo but is literally polar opposite of chris, and i favor chris so i like him more. One of the best, maybe The best debate, ive ever seen, and i watch a ton of debates.   Female human   Drug addiction to certain drugs is deadly. Take heroin, a long time users' body will create a dependency so strong it can kill you if you stop cold turkey, unlike chocolate. In severe cases methadone is prescribed to a herion addict to ween them off the drug slowly and safely, never heard of that with chocalate fienes.     Yes in most cases its psycological OP, but certain drugs can cause a dependency in your body so severe your body can go into shock and shutdown.  	105
 We should all learn from the deaf frog which climb the tree: Life is unpredictable and nothing is guaranteed, so dont delay and start living your dream today! Don't let your fears prevent you from achieving your dreams.          Congratulations, man! Take this experience to enhance your skills and your knowledge. Show respect to everyone you work with, particularly to those lower than you. They'll help you climb up the ladder to your success.    Would definitely want to see this up close. The design seems cold, but seeing something bending the rule of architecture is surely eye catching.    That's one great workmanship! And way more satisfying than having someone do it for double, maybe triple the price.    People have so many concerns at the moment that they wouldn't even bother to know why someone got fired. And even without a job, she surely can survive. A tough woman there.    This looks okay, but would want to drink coffee while shopping? I know I don't. Sorry.    How far can architecture go? Hold on tight, so you wouldn't be swept away by the fast moving technology.    I read this from the Internet, and I know I had to share it. It will make you think of the phrase: You come in this world with nothing and you die with nothing. One man obviously didnt feel this was the case when he asked his wife, When I die, can you bury all of the money with me?.  He wanted her to put it all in the casket with him. Thinking that she would fulfill his last dying wish he thought nothing more of it.  During his working life this man was a real cheapskate, and only spent when he really had to. He saved it all in this little shoe box you can see below.  When he eventually passed away, He was laid out and his wife sat next to her life-long friend. When the ceremony was just about to finish, and the coffin was about to be covered he wife screamed, Wait one second!.  He was stretched out in the casket, the wife was sitting there in black next to their best friend. When they finished the ceremony, just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, Wait a minute! She walked over and placed the shoebox in the casket. Her friend asked her, Surely you werent silly enough to put all that money in there! The women responded, Yeh I had to keep my promise, I am a good Christian, Id never break a promise. The friend said, What! You put every last cent in there with him?! The women responded, No, I counted it all up, put it in my bank account, and wrote him a cheque!       The reaction of the baby is just so wonderful that it makes me feel sad when he finally realized that not everything he sees is beautiful. But still, the good thing is he can see the beauty of his family.          We should not have discrimination like these animals.  	15
 I would love that so much.   I have found this where it is described as an issue that sometimes occurs. Not sure why people would not be happy about it.   http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21328518   Unemployment, decrease in tax money and so on...      I'm sure I heard it was supposed to be available beginning if Feb   Edit: sorry, made available by Sony. Of course carriers need some time    Why is he trying to sound smart? Im sure the 20 would have been enough as a nice gesture...   Well, its doesn't actually use up the 5.9 GB. It just downloads all the files that have to be replaced on your current OS. Then, after you have downloaded it, the files on your OS will be deleted and replaced by the new "updated" ones. This way the update initially needs 5.9GB to save to files that were downloaded, but afterwards, you only end of with however much code they added, which is probably not going to be anywhere near 5.9GB.   But, yes, if you do not have the 5.9GB available on your phone at the time, do it like you said. If you do have the space available, it makes no difference.   Yes, it seems I was. I did not know there was a difference.  Thanks   My question would be, why is it not mentioned in the bible. But I just thought about it. The bible is not written by god, so...    I did not know about young earth boys having a different viewpoint to most creationists. Thank you for clarifying that.   But wouldn't it be worth mentioning?   The whole thread is a big assumption, no?   What if that civilization is older than the bible claims the universe is and they have proof (like books or whatever) ?   Well, their civilization could be older (with records of history) than creationists claim the universe is. That would surely be a problem.          Correct   Then my reply is Austria!   Pretty kool   It's not over till it's over.    I feel like sex adds nothing to the list. I don't think America is particularly open minded when it comes to sex.    efficient, not funny   I am curious.    Schottland   I am from Germany, but here I am not sure. Skiing is more Austria, not sure if they have lederhosen though...  I am confused.   Canada!   UK bruv   I did not know you could pirate android apps...   You know I like to believe that OP's car is on the left and that his neighbors, knowing how important it is for him to be at work on time, made sure he will not have to waste time on clearing his driveway.    Its a 12 day thing:  * Day 1 thread: post the name of a country you would like to see in the contest. Top 10 countries compete  * Day 2 - 11 threads: Each day there will be a thread for one of the top 10 countries. In that thread people can post their favourite songs from that country. Top comment will represent that country in the final stage.  * Day 12 thread: There will only be 10 comments in that thread, all the songs from the past 10 days. Top comment/song wins!  I think it would be fund and would give all of us the opportunity to listen to good songs from certain countries.   I hope this will work. Of course the rules can be adjusted.    Sorry to ask. What's this?   I think your work is very very nice. However the quality of the pictures is def something you can improve. I think you would get better exposure if the pics were better.   Hey, I added links to my comment above. I hope that is ok for you and enough.   I think you can only be too independent in the sense that you don't share the important things with your partner, like going to parties together, sharing your thoughts and worries, talking about the future, etc. You know what I mean? When your partner is not the first person to talk to. I think as long as your partner is your best friend it should be alright.    Cool.    That price is not low enough!   A man of his word!   Plastic.   It is causing damage to the environment and humans.   Edit: Some articles to support my claim:  [Financial damage is about 13 billion per year cause by plastic waste] (http://www.unep.org/newscentre/default.aspx?DocumentID=2791 ArticleID=10903)  [Here is what happens to animals that mistake plastic for food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAL9Xvrg3hI)  [Plastic releases a substance called Bisphenol A that is suspected to cause cancer](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080130092108.htm)  [Our planet (especially the oceans) are full of plastic and it does not bio degrade, which means it's not going to go anywhere](http://www.plasticoceans.net/)  [And here is a classic video about bottled water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zn0qi80IIY)   I agree maximum.  I cannot name any major conflict anywhere on the planet that is unrelated to religion.    Profit maximization.   I can't see how this is going to be sustainable forever. The inequalities are already mind blowing and will only increase.   But if none of those with wealth and power are willing to give it up, nothing will change, so I guess that nothing will change.    My SO has cancer. I'm listening   None of those will make you happy if you ask me.   It's the same with men too. If you're looking for a longterm relationship you need somebody who is selfless, positive, independent, has their own friends and is not lazy. You can't live with a person who constantly complains, never does any work at home, is always sad when you do something by yourself and puts herself first no matter how funny or good looking she is.   However if you have somebody who loves you, wants you to be happy, is going to do their fair share of work, lifts you up and let's you be yourself, she does not have to be beautiful of super funny but I guarantee you'll still be happy with her.   Edit: If you're in it for the short term, then I agree with you 100%   Independence.   Nothing makes we want to run away more than a girl who can't do shit for herself.    seriously, WHAT?!   I work for a company called "something something Industries". My colleague always says "Industry" instead and it drives me nuts.    Ads.   I really don't want to be persuaded to buy shit I don't need.    Past Saturday. I was sitting with some friends, all of which are from different countries and we were sharing music from our respective countries. I played a song of a German singer who sings about his dead wife. My girlfriend is very ill and it made me cry.  Needless to say it was a bit awkward for everybody but I didn't care.    /u/nasebanaru pointed out that there is a wiki article stating how often Japan has apologised in the past.   However in that same article there is a section "Controversy" which pretty much explains why this is not jet settled. This sums it up nicely:  Criticisms regarding the degree and formality of apology, issued as a statement or delivered person-to-person to the country addressed, and the perception by some that some apologies are later retracted or contradicted by statements or actions of Japan, among others.  [Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan)   Fair enough though. If you beat your wife, then apologise and then beat her again I think it is reasonable of her to say that your apology didn't mean shit.    Reveal a made up secret like:   - I fucked your wife - I am a Russian spy - I am not your dad - etc.  Then say "I'm joking"  And just before you die "or am I?" :)   I'm a German living in the UK. However the biggest culture shock was coming back to Germany.   In the UK people say good morning, please and thank you. I am sure not everybody means it, but at least people do that and they try to be friendly. Germans do not care.    Fairness is not a thing. Humans invented that concept but nature does not care.    Fair enough   Im not arguing. From my point of view the Charlie Hebdo stuff (that I also don't find hilarious) at least has a deeper meaning. Those people are trying to influence their follow citizens. That 9/11 joke does not have a deeper meaning.   This is how I see it.    No, not at all. What's the connection between a comic and a picture of a person who is about to die?   Personally I feel it is different, because that picture shows one person only who you know to have lost their life after the picture was taken.    So that is my problem? I do not *understand* this one?   You're right. Some people might find it funny. But let's face it, it's not a killer and therefore I find it unnecessary considering the context.   I think really offensive jokes need to be really good or they just need to go away.    And my children will watch it too. For that exact reason.   I believe Jack and Daniel together are perfect and need each other. As much as Daniel has perfect morals and ethics, he so often needed Jack to decide how to go about things. Because perfect morals only work in a perfect world. Jack was the realist who made sure to achieve the best, most ethical outcome considering the actual situation they were facing. He always understood Daniel and I believe always agreed with him. But he always pretended to disagreed with Daniel when he had to make difficult decisions. To Daniel it looked like Jack didn't understand but in fact he was protecting Daniel's unshakable faith in the good by taking the responsibility for the sacrifices they had to make.      So, I don't mind 9/11 jokes if they are good, but that one just isn't funny.       And what if that person then insists that they are crazy?    But then you've acknowledged it so you yourself are saying that you are crazy    I've got no excuse. I even checked for typos       Get a girlfriend and move in with her    A single man!  Every single time and it is so uplifting.    Who's the bald chick?  Edit: Got it  http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article2127686.ece/alternates/s615b/Karen-Gillan.jpg   Not sure if you spewak German.

Tiny [swiss knife](http://swissarmyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Classic1.jpg).  I love the toothpick, and the scissors.    The fact that it starts with the word cool, but written with k instead of c.   Kool, right?   LIAR!   So the benefit is that you can now install xposed, right?    Would anybody kindly tell me if I can safely root, back up DRM keys, unlock bootloader, install a custom rom and then, in case I don't like it reverse it all to stock rom with full functionality (and root)?   Are you a fatty OP?      I agree with you. In her defence, I would not risk my life if I was paid minimum wage.    Yes, disgusting.   I don't get this at all.   How did she get there? Why not replace the wheels if she's there anyway?    I think you have a point. They could sell based on benchmark results though, right? That would be comparable, right?   Thanks. That was helpful    I've asked this somewhere else. Why do they sell based on hertz then? That's like selling a car based on horsepower only.    So why do they agree to sell based on hertz? What's the point?    Brotherhood of the Wolf   Cool. Thank you!  Edit: BOOM! I did not expect them to be that pricey.    ELI3?   Well, I disagree. I am more likely to hire somebody who knows his weakness and will be mindful about it than somebody who thinks he is the boss and can't do any wrong. People like that are horrible to work with and don't want to learn. People who recognize they are not perfect and know where they need to improve are far better and will use more of their potential.   Edit: Actually this attitude of yours is the reason people won't disclose their weaknesses.   Ok, you mean history synchronization?   I meant stuff like your subreddit list and saved posts.    I live in England and I do not think so. Most still think they are amazing.   See, you English actually believe that stuff.    That is the way I would describe English people. You think everybody is inferior to you because of your past achievements.     Germany. Guns and the unwillingness to have any sort of open discussion about whether or not they should be abolished.    An accident. What the fuck?!   Fair enough.    People who answer the question: "What is your biggest weakness?" with :  "I am a perfectionist."  I think it is a sign of a lack of self reflection. I respect people who are able to identify their weaknesses and are willing to work on them. Being honest to yourself is a rare ability.    Can you point out a specific example? I am just curious what you are referring to. I personally believe Eastern cultures are just as bad. For example:   Turkish and the Armenian genocide.   Japanese and what they have done to Korean and Chinese women.  North Korea  Russian people seem to completely ignore what they are doing in Ukraine at the moment.    Post them on /r/StarWars  They would love some of them. The Star Wars ones obviously...   Can I buy them somewhere?   I like this because you can share the to-do lists now.   Don't they all sync since they are based on your reddit account, which is saved online?   I am so weird. I have been using the free version for a long time now and had no problems. Just because you said you paid for it, I just went to the play store and paid for it. I blame you for the fact I will have to drink half a pint of beer less tonight.      would you mind uploading the raw file (if you have one)?   Exactly. Haven't seen that yet    Sales.  If you are buying shit full price you are an idiot. Well, to be honest it is good for me, but all these companies are undermining their credibility by always selling everything half price. How long have they been fucking me before when their competition was not fighting hard for every customer and they were forced to do crazy sales? Also, sale BEFORE Christmas? That didn't exist when I was a child.    Like this:  http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/jaden-and-willow-smith-exclusive-joint-interview/?_r=0   But it's not actual help. they give out haircuts or let them have a nice day and then drop them back into the water.    What does that even mean?   Have you heard about adblock?   I think it is pretty clear, that the machine moves through time though because he experiences everything that happens.    I did not consider that. But then, at the beginning he travels so slowly, that light would have not been slowed down enough, not to reach my eye anymore.    Like I said, I don't know at all. And also like you said we'll probably not find out anytime soon.   But yes, very interesting. Of course, with different timelines, I think your explanation is better than mine. I simply do not believe in (hope there are no different timelines.   What I am wondering is why the flag on his arm is the [wrong way round](http://advancescreenings.com/img/posters/a/american_sniper_t.jpg).   Well, I have no analysis. If that is how it works, then the movies is doing it right. I have no proof or argument. I understand your explanation and can understand what you mean.   So in your mind he is travelling to a time that co-exists with the time you are remaining in, right? He is in the future, you are in the past but both of you exist at the same time, right?  In my mind, there is only "one time". Imagine it as a piece of string.   --------------------A----------------B-------------------C--------------------  At any given point (A, B or C) in time everybody can be somewhere in space (3 dimensional space) e.g. London, Chicago, etc. Everybody can freely move in that space, but cannot move freely along the string. Everybody moves from A to B to C at the same speed, 1 minute per minute (if that makes sense). Now what the time machine allows the traveler to to is to:  a) travel backwards and forwards  b) travel at different speeds  However, whilst it is traveling through time, it does not travel through space (it remains in London).   Now from my point of view, whenever two people are at the same point in time and space, they should be able to see each other. That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling).   Now normally we assume that a time machine has to move fast to start the time travel (like in back to the future). When the Delorean starts his journey, he goes really fast before time travel starts. However he also moves in space which is why you cannot see him during time travel. You can only see him again, when he comes back to that same place that he has left from.   But in The Time Machine the machine does not move in space whilst it is time traveling. I am sure you will agree with my example above where I said (*"That means, when the traveler decides to travel from 8am on 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 and we meet in London at that time, I will of course be able to see him, because we are at the same time at the same place. The only difference is that for me 1 year went by and for the traveler less time went by (however fast he was traveling"*). But everything that traveling from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8am 1st Jan 1911 means is to travel from 8am 1st Jan 1910 to 8:00:01am to 8:0:02am to 8:00:03 am and so on, just faster than everybody else. So at each of these points you and the traveler are at the same place at the same time, just that he got there quicker than you.

Codified law and collective governance were made practical, and there was rhetoric, theater, engineering and art. The standard of living even for slaves could be better than those across the Rhine, and a slave could become very wealthy, and free.   But that's not why the Romans were so successful. The lands the assimilated were Romanized, and those who lived there liked it. Remember Maximus in *Gladiator*? He was from Hispania. Eventually even Emperors came from former non Roman lands: Marcus Aurelius - Gaulish and Spanish.   Yes. They probably all "lost" by day 2.   Check with Mdecins Sans Frontires. They still have operations in Haiti.   It's hard to disagree. Certainly those single individuals had an enormous influence on so many lives throughout history, but the structure of modern society is so strongly shaped by Roman precedents. America's founders took as their model not some religious ideal, but a Roman one. Washington was the quintessential Patrician.   Ain't reddit grand? We have a real informational gold mine here.

 They'd love your input at the github portal for the law, I'm sure.   Thus keeping most cases civil instead of criminal and the law organic through judges rather than regulated by legislatures. It will be nice.   From at least the perspective that humans are rational and have natural rights which extend from their capabilities rather than their needs, yet a government has to impose force to curtail those rights in favor of the needs of other humans for the purpose of civil society.  Society can be civil without central government, but people have a hard time imagining what it would look like since it has been so long since any group of people has lived like this. In the end, there is no central government tying the entire human race toether so we are all effectively anarchists, anyway.

How, when the cartels flip politicians and police - or do you contest that? If you do not, then guns come before political control.      This makes me imagine my high school art teacher walking out with bolt cutters to a drafting table sitting in the student parking lot with the table tilted up so it is visible through the big wall of windows on the art rooms, snipping the chain link, and walking back into school with an entire project folder full of McMansions which go directly into the trash.  I grew up in East Coast farm country. The poor pickup truck didn't even get a treat after being neutered.   So better for the builder, worse for the buyer?   Chop the bottom half off and we have an accord.   It is telling that instead of considering whether people should be paying taxes for this or not, you went straight to talking about how goosenecking money through administrative channels should not be forgotten when considering how people will be forced to pay for their healthcare through taxes, as if that was terribly different from being forced to pay any other way.  *The simple fact that healthcare is perceived, by you, like a universal public service instead of a commodity is really something.* I'm very interested that your reasoning is not purely ideological at the surface, and I have to agree with what you say in many ways.  But it is the way America has treated it's healthcare and nutritional guidelines which is horrendous. People treated healthcare like a public service and the public servants got it wrong (as humans are known to make mistakes and/or be corrupt). One set of rules across the country and a news service to back it up then made sure that nobody was breaking dogma and getting away with it. If deciding how to treat the sick and feed ourselves wasn't managed on a national level, we'd have shaken off our stupor by now through competition and offering more options. Instead we basically became a technocracy on the mental and nutritional health fronts for eighty years. The externalities of poor decisions in these areas is extremely dire, no doubt, but would not be so severe at the present period if the incorrect funding levels, subsidies, and programs had not been held above competition. Long before now, the evidence would have made it clear mental patients needed more supervision and less psychotropic drugs, saturated fats and cholerserol are not evil and are not well managed by statins, and the general state of medical insurance is a gaping wound in American finance practice no matter which way it is looked at.  I'm not going to say I haven't looked at the data, not that I should know exactly which data you mean from the perfectly broad statement, but why would data make anything more clear given what we agree on? You don't know me, but I have listened and read up on the different views.  What we have is a difference of philosophical opinion, and I'm not sure you accept that, nor understand the consequences.  You are opining government is the best and only way to provide healthcare, it seems. I do not share that conclusion. The place we really disagree is probably the definition of rights. I want to know how you think a democracy can operate when that most basic of assumptions is contested?  And, btw, you never asked me to "question the claim stated in the last statement of your first paragraph." I asked you a question and you obliged. Thank you for that. I kinda riled you up. I wanted an answer so I did that on purpose. Rand used very strong language, and was ultimately making a flawed argument as it is heard in the [video.](http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/diverting-non-urgent-emergency-room-use-can-it-provide-better-care-and-lower-costsd) I just found the entirety of the video and will be reviewing it. Without the context of philosophical matter supporting it and cushioning it, which I am not sure he even provided in the hearing, the argument is laughable on the face. That doesn't mean the statement he intended was, necessarily.      It is very early, but what kind of plans does the LSA think they will consider approving for development once recognition happens?  Where is that discussion taking place?   And believe it or not, the Catholic view is that it is not a disorder.   Is this where I call you a bigot for not respecting my personal views and the way I live my life as a Catholic?   As a Catholic, he is right on.  Ever seen [The Third Way?](http://www.blackstonefilms.org/thethirdway/)   Well it looks like all these organisations have a stock in supporting it, but Hopkins doesn't have a stock in not performing ops.   Next trailer, probably.   Well you not approaching this in an open and academic way isn't exactly convincing. Rand's position was ill stated but is easily explained as half a duality of necessary restrictions to providing a service by force of law. Either the service is forced to not be paid for the trouble, or the customer is forced to pay.  Way to miss that, Mr. Grad. Waaaaay to go.   Until people teach their children or themselves otherwise, that will be the case. Same with Russia. The prison is in the mind.   Everyone plays their part. Not every ISIS member needs to be an American, emigrate, or work in online forums to radicalize people.   I still think you don't, probably. Take the recently reposted video where Rand and Sanders debate mandatory healthcare. Is Rand's position incorrect (granted he did not relate it fully and clearly)? Rand said doctors would basically be slaves.   Why do I like the desert?  ...

And by that I do mean the people using the excessive powers our various levels of government have from outside any elected body. Unelected officials, lobbyists, and cronies use regulations and law against competitors and against the people.    Denmark: High public trust. The Royal Family knows the country doesn't have a stable future unless the economy improves or some austerity is implemented.  Sweden: History of economic conservatism. The boat is slowly turning back that way, as well. Last decade it became apparent in policy circles that the honeymoon with socialism was ending.  Norway: Can you say oil? Oil.  To note how much these populations still pay in taxes is to realize how much the socialist state requires. Factor in the differences between us and them and you see the price would be higher here. More cronyism, more economic stagnation, less oil per capita. Americans are not prepared to give that much - just like our government is not prepared to handle it.   Those are the ones I am talking about. They are either floating on natural resources, a history of laissez faire, or is one of the few countries that actually has a different level of public trust and lacks potent corruption from special interests.  I'm not counting dollar signs.   I was in traffic court (as a witness) yesterday. Has anyone ever used this to get out of a speeding ticket, I wonder?   The idea of subsidiarity is to make each decision at the smallest level capable and relevant to the matter. Since fracking is accused of poisoning ground water the decision to ban may exist at the body responsible for that resource.   New polls have Rand doing quite well and he is also looking good for early primaries and caucuses.   Just because you don't understand his arguments doens't mean he is a loon. Plenty of people don't understand the more academic arguments Bernie makes and see him as insane, too.   You mean the ones with tons of oil which can spend oodles on state programs without having to tax people as much as we would?   So the UN should make vaccinations mandatory the world over? Why not let the states decide?  The other option is letting the community of insurance and lawyers find the right level of risk and indemnity. This will create a reaal price for going unvaccinated and will cause those people to self-select and make a value judgement on whether they want to live in the woods, alone, or in society with a vaccination.   So we should leave the door open both for civil litigation against people who are un-vaccinated (or the gaurdians of children who are) when contact brings disease and also the freedom for these fools to self-select and move away from contact. Why would they move away? To reduce risk of being sued.   Sounds like you have discovered that democracy cannot prosper when the basic structure of the law is contested.   This is why every marketing group needs an engineer or Army specialist to be a designated pun and acronym reviewer.  If it makes them laugh, it fails.   The NRA are also really ineffective. They basically collect dues and emails to lobby for the interests of gun-related corporations.  [The National Association for Gun Rights](http://www.nationalgunrights.org/) doesn't do that. They are oriented towards activism and real protection of rights.   Get back on the horse and try to think patiently and scientifically about what factors may be causing your hair to get more oily after being fine for a while. Two months isn't that long of a time for our bodies.  Did you alter your diet? Splurge on something?  Have you tried baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, etc other home cleaners? Maybe your hair needed more than a hot water rinse, maybe it was actually dirty - or maybe your scalp was. Maybe you didn't brush for a day. Maybe the temperature changed with the season.  I keep a sulfate and silicone-free shampoo around in case my hair gets really bad, like if I decide to use Brylcreem and then need to remove it or I go swimming or to a construction site.Sometimes a day in the inner city or on the farm makes my hair dirty enough. If I need to clean, then a light application is all I use.     The trick here is how (should he be elected) can Sanders (or anyone else) remove the bureaucracy and money interest to make the government work for all and not for a few.  I can't see this happening in any way other than an increase in subsidiarity and truly or effectively closing federal departments. I have not seen that Bernie is for this, but there is time for me to find out.  Rand is certainly for this. I wonder if Carly Fiorina is as well.   Are there any tutorials you recommend?   I just finished watching the American Dad episode where Patrick Stewart hosts an episode made to look like a broadway tragic play.  If someone were to make (or has made) a play to this, I would enjoy it.   Why did you not x-post this in /r/trees?   What IPs are available? Harry Potter? Indiana Jones? Star Wars?  LEGO has strong internal IPs, but I'd like to know.   That said, this game will likely be a different beast. Will I can see mods being allowed, but will the code be as accessible?      Are you assuming that listening to all people you have the same amount of skepticism at all times, or do you agree that once you know someone is a Scientologist you have to listen more carefully for subtle or sophistic fallacies?   Yeah, it would matter that he was a Scientologist only because it would augment all that work identifying the wrong parts of his arguments. Hooray, we agree!   So I guess you didn't watch the video.  The plow has ruined entire civilizations. That doesn't mean nations or cities... it means economies. The Bronze age ended in famine and war because the plow created a technology bubble. But instead of money, it was a bubble of human population. The soil eroded away into the valleys and seas and then people died.  Go 31 min into that video and you'll see how not all agriculture decimates soil. Note that the graph only shows erosion, not soil growth.   It only means you need to listen more carefully. Not everyone makes the clean arguments that are free from ideology and centered in bare reason and evidence. I still follow CCHRINT on FB for news   Or never return but have a lawyer deal with it for you, promptly.   I'm here from /r/Soil  just want to opine that I do not think feedback loops are in play or any of that jazz, but I do think that humans have actively desertified massive areas of the planet and that has caused downwind and downstream areas to be devastated.

Are they supplying folding chairs, or will the combatants need to rip ones straight outta the floor to make use of any?   Yeah, sure, but this article in particular is not proof of that.   I bet all the scientists who quietly stopped eating their dark chocolate when this corrective story ran agree with you about guarding their own turf. How many people got burned by this? Very few. It is still a good wake-up call.      /r/theydidthemonstermath   Yeah, when I got there, I double-checked how sure I was about this article. But We'll see.  That article could be years old; I can't tell.   Hey, so I was going through some of my old posts and figured I would drop you a link to a great study I just read.  It is, as it admits, a one-sided paper surveying the literature in support of Nutritional Ketogenic Diets.  [Arguments In Favor Of Ketogenic Diets](https://ispub.com/IJNW/4/2/8738)  [The comment I got it from.](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/peeb4/need_help_convincing_parents/c3oony4)          This is another case of creating more problems than actually resolving. By further limiting the already limited parking situation downtown and within the Inner Harbor, you place more vehicles on the road at any given moment whom are all actively fighting for already limited parking spaces.  I agree with you, here. Without ample street life, the city still requires weeknight and weekend injections of commerce and places for parents to park in the day to take children to attractions. Removing parking garages can be done after all the other problems are met and mass transit projects have been completed. Parking *lots*, however, are a blight. The ones in Mount Vernon seem to be hanging around because of management, profit margin, or fear of failure issues.   There was not a blackout but now there is. It is real simple.   If by soldier you mean a remote device, you may be on to something.    Previously, there have been incidents in China, such as the Peng Yu incident in 2006, wherein **Good Samaritans who helped** people injured in accidents **were accused of having injured the victim themselves** and in many cases **were forced to pay for the victim's medical bills.** Some commentators have explained that this may have caused people to fear getting in trouble for doing the right thing in Wang's case, thus failing to help.

A definition of guttural: harsh-sounding  A tap is *arguably* less harsh than a clap.   People didn't always clap in the modern era. There has always been a rash of general banging around. For instance, wherever you find a gathering of gentlemen with canes you can be sure at least some will tap it on the floor or a desk in applause rather than the relatively guttural reaction of hand clapping.  EDIT:  * ["Rather than applause, they knock on the table to show appreciation."](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/15r1p4/when_did_the_act_of_applause_become_commonplace/c7p3lkf)  * ["Are there other forms of appreciation that are shown in different cultures or at different times in history?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1gnd96/when_did_people_start_clapping_to_show/calwnzv)   /r/SquareFootGardening is wildly successful all over the world.   There is a lot of stuff in this article coming from every angle. Yes, no, maybe! It was a fun read.           a decision is known  Maybe I should have stated it differently, but I specifically said I was not referring to a supernatural. I meant to say physically predetermined through that particular phrase.  I think your argument is suffering a gap in reason but I can't put a finger on it right now.   For dry goods? It has no spout, so that makes more sense.   Have you ever read about [Molinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molinism)?  Just because the decision is known does not predetermine free will. It merely highlights the limits of humanity.  I do not mean to bring this up as a religious point. I am thinking of it in the context of a non-supernatural world where we merely cannot access the knowledge yet, if ever.   I think it is very important to learn that carbohydrates either are already sugars or the human body converts them to sugars and that sugars are addictive. Sugars, particularly fructose, have various proven effects on the human brain and some deleterious ones which require more studies. What is known is that sugars trigger more "happiness" signaling chemicals. Eating them consistently makes the receptors matching these chemicals partially close, making the effect of all triggers lessen.  A calorie-restrictive diet based on carbohydrates will leave people hungry and lacking "happiness" chemical reception. Willpower is not possessed and/or planning is not accessible to everybody in the amount required to follow their chosen diet. I think being hungry *and* depressed at the same time is what causes people to fail to follow their own goals.  EDIT: Re-wrote second sentence, second paragraph. Original: "The willpower or planning that it takes to follow this kind of diet is not possessed and is not accessible to everybody."   Having influences on our mental state and knowledge does not preclude us from making decisions, it just affects what decisions and options we perceive. In that, there is always an option to try and learn more.    I'd love to get a beer and talk sports or movies with Stewart, but if he wanted to talk about philosophy or law or politics I'd probably need a jetpack.

Are there any strategies or resources for clipping nails so that the curling on the edge doesn't become a problem?   I had a staph infection on my wrist in college and when I went to the hospital they numbed it and let is sit for a few minutes. Two guys come in and get ready to cut it open and drain it. "You might feel a little tugging."  They sterilize and get the scalpel... and boy, I feel that tugging. These guys are cutting my skin and I can't feel any pain but I can feel *everything else.* POP!  A little pus explodes on to the mat they have down. The guy cutting says "Oh, that was cool. A big one." His assistant just nods and mutters, "yup."  They milk more out of it and then clean it and stuff paper in it. A bandage goes on and I'm outta there.  It is really weird to experience things that would normally have one sensation. Like, if your finger wasn't frozen you probably would not have heard the sound.   The ACA has two main ideas.  * require every person to get insurance  * thousands of pages trying to make it easier for people to get insurance through personal means, employers, or state assistance.  Notice how it does not say that the state must provide health care; it says the individual must acquire health care.  IMO, health care is a debacle because of two things. Pharmacuetical, medical insurance, and hospital companies are protected from competition by lobbying the government and professional licensing associations. The companies are using the state to make mioney off us, which is not capitalism. The other problem is our perverse attachment to employer-provided healthcare. This started being a thing in WWII, but the job market has changed drastically and it makes no sense for offices and restaraunts to offer this when people might change jobs yearly. Every three years is common.   Yeah, I can't imagine any other part of the human body so resilient, versitile, and active. Teeth floating through it? No problem. You need a screw in that socket?

Why does it take so long for the rash to go away? Is the process the body goes through for eliminating proteins recognized as allergic inefficient? Is it hard for the body to designate a protein for elimination? Do our bodies make the molecules inert and then remove them?  If anyone has literature or links, I would appreciate them.  I know all about allergies up to the point where antibodies are supposedly attaching and capillaries have dilated to send in the white blood cells... but I can't find anything that tells me what happens next.

 Try using the text wrapping "in front of text" that will allow you to place a picture anywhere without having everything moving around. Also, using "through" will allow you to move the picture anywhere without snapping and the text will move accordingly, if you are inserting a picture into a paper.

 Handle that however you want, just don't try to lean on some crutch that your approach is supported by LaVey's teachings, it isn't. He had a lot less tolerance than anyone here towards "theists" or people claiming some other brand or origin of Satanism, especially in his later years. He even spelled it out in Satan Speaks: "The only person in recorded history to codify Satanism into an applicable religion is Anton Szandor LaVey."  He chose his words carefully (codify, applicable, religion, recorded).    He didn't, 17th on the list.   What are you talking about in regards to what LaVey taught? Because it's clear that he championed intelligent discrimination, stratification, calling spades spades, and equal parts love and hate. He was not for Satanic "brotherly love" and detested the idea of giving people respect just because they take the Devils name. He learned in the early years of the Church of Satan that his material attracts a fair amount of kooks and losers, so he focused on stratification and letting water seek its own level.    No.   You know there are professionals who can help you fulfill your masochistic needs.       What do you want out of being a registered member? Are you working on any projects that would benefit from collaboration with other like minded people? Some people join because they feel like they agree with the ideas that the COS promotes and would like to see that continue and don't do anything else. Other people join so they could network. Others join because they want to spook their friends and have $200 to blow. I joined because I respected the work of several COS members that I knew for years and wanted to show my gratitude to an organization that helped them flourish and orchestrated productive relationships between creative people.    A membership to the Church of Satan is actually a pretty lousy gift. This should be something an individual themselves deems worth their time and resources because they believe they can benefit from joining.      The 600 Club is not a Church of Satan board and has no relationship with the Church of Satan. I guess some members can go on there and organize things but that's not at all representative of the activity of the Church of Satan. The membership package also included contact info with the COS and encouraged members who wished to be active with the organization to communicate their activities and accomplishments with the COS. We operate several communication channels that are not open to the public.   Again, if you do not feel you would benefit from networking with other like minded individuals who have gone through a kind of clearing house then do not join. Are you going to get along just great with every Church of Satan member? Most likely not. I would be suspicious of anyone who does. But you get what you bring into it.    Sorry this isn't in the price range of some factory churned ICP blacklight poster. If that's more your liking Spencer's got you covered. If you want an individually handcrafted piece of decor for your ritual chamber or den of iniquity, then consider this. I somehow doubt this is going to show up in Ikea.   And yes, there may be some Satanists who believe in some sort of afterlife, but does not mean it's a Satanic ideal. I would say that's a flaw in their character. I would subscribe that to some other aspect of their personality that they themselves would have to deal with. Just because a person is into Satanism it does not mean that everything else they believe in is Satanic.   LaVey made it clear that he did not believe in any afterlife other than living on in the memories of people he's influenced. Satanism views death as "the great abstinence"; a total void of carnal pleasure. You are worm food. So the Satanic philosophy centers around living this life to the fullest. From the Book of Satan in the Satanic Bible: Life is the great indulgence - death, the great abstinence. Therefore, make the most of life - HERE AND NOW!   Many of the Satanists I know don't really care for metal. While not exactly emo or pop punk, you might be into Boysetsfire, who's frontman Nathan Gray is a well regarded member of the Church of Satan. [See his interview with Fire Alive](http://www.firealive.it/i-am-heresy-interview-with-nathan-gray/).    [Here's a Disinfo post](http://disinfo.com/2014/10/hail-satan-way/) about several Church of Satan members who are doing music other than metal.    LaVey wrote a whole book on it. [The Satanic Witch](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0922915849/churchofsatan) is useful for both sexes and includes an extensive suggested reading list that should be seriously considered by anyone interested in delving into Deep Satanism.      Here are some resources from Church of Satan members  History of the Enochian Keys: http://youtu.be/t5hcGOpLME4?t=1h12m6s  On Magical Languages: http://unorthodoxyblog.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/eposide-ii-is-here-lucid-dreaming-and-secret-languages/   I sure do, and most Satanists I know do as well, Yuletide at least. Many of us exchange gifts and cards. I decorate my home every year with a tree and plenty of presents for my wife and cat.    Nikolas Schreck is not a great representation of Satanism. He was reluctantly tolerated by LaVey because of his relationship with Zeena but LaVey himself kept his distance and never supported any of his antics. He quickly renounced Satanism when LaVey refused to hand over the Church of Satan to him and Zeena and they both "magically" became Setian.   LaVey hated Manson and wrote at great length about how he was a moronic criminal. I get that certain Satanists, especially in the 80's, where attracted to him as some kind of counter culture icon, but Manson has nothing to do with Satanism.   Shit happens, I get it. But makes it hard to take them seriously when they're talking about being in personal communication with all powerful dark forces and being some stellar master elite who takes the bus home.   Ihsahn of Emperor, Garm of Ulver, Dave Ingram of Benediction/Bolt Thrower are the only "metal" artists that really portray Satanism in any meaningful way, in my opinion.    Having spent about 10 years in the "trve kvlt" Black Metal scene as a promoter I say I'm not at all impressed with these guys, Watain included. They talk about being in tune with dark gods but when push comes to shove they call their parents for help with money, puke when they drink too much cheap beer, and hang out with scumbags for drugs.   Funny how people who get hung up on this tend to be people who need some kind of identity or validation. Be responsible for your own actions and get over it.           That's pretty funny, because one of the biggest and most common criticisms of Gilmore is that he diverted too far from LaVey. Even Boyd, who I've spoken to personally, makes this claim (that Gilmore is too rationalist). If you actually read anything Gilmore has put out, you'll see that he actually lays out in very specific ways that he has expanded on LaVey's writings, and may even disagree or downplay certain aspects of LaVey.    All it takes is a bit of third-grade critical reading comprehension to grasp that, but you know... tl;dr for some I guess...  And I'm not sure what you mean by "positive". If by "positive" you mean remain stagnant or bend to every contracting whim of every naysayer, then yes the CoS hasn't been very "positive".   And yes, this book is by Blanche Barton, it says that pretty clearly in every associated link and description. Big whoop. Welcome to the world of biographies, where it's pretty common knowledge that most, some would say all, biographies are biased and subjective. It's up to the reader to analyse the material with a critical mind, look for sources if something is in question, and come to their own conclusions.   If you want some academic resources I recommend the work of Cimminnee Holt. She's done a great deal of research with the history of Satanism and the Church of Satan.  http://www.academia.edu/2540808/2012._Satanists_and_Scholars_A_Historiographic_Overview_and_Critique_of_Scholarship_on_Religious_Satanism_Masters_Thesis_Dept._of_Religion_Concordia_University   Would be a funny situation but no, the Church of Satan is not a charity.    From looking at the pre-release videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od0dg2mC93c) I can't say that this lives up to the promise in the interview. Looks like a SC2 clone... standard build-order/production obsessed gameplay. Kane's Wrath will continue to stay installed I guess.      Just about every thread about Satanic magic seems to me to be answered appropriately. The problem might be that some people aren't happy with the answers. What kind of questions would you have form someone "inside the church itself"?    Sigh... yeah it was up and then it got taken down. We're getting DDoS attacks from what we believe to be Islamic fundamentalists.   The website is back up :)   The COS site is down for some maintenance, I'll let you know as soon as it's back up.   Recently listened to: Chelsea Wolfe,  King Dude, Sleep Research Facility, Sol Invictus, Waldteufel, Cult of Youth, Sutekh Hexen, First Aid Kit, Phantogram, Grimes, Purity Ring, Martin Denny, WIFE, Altar of Plagues, Burial, Cold Cave, oOoOO, Tokimonsta, Ulver.   Yes.   Anton LaVey answers this fairly directly in the essay "Get a Life" in Satan Speaks.  "As far as I'm concerned, I would like my organization, the Church of Satan, to exist as a cabal for the mutual endowment of those already occupied with the interests and activities other than organizational. I have often stated that I like to think of the Church of Satan as an organization for non-joiners. Affiliation need not negate independence. Affiliation should be based on respect, rather than desperation. Respect for a set of principles and for other men and women who share those principles, yet who are not dependent on an organization to give substance to their lives. The obvious question arises: "Why then, would such persons need a Church of Satan?" The answer is, "They don't, unless it can do them some good." Affiliation should enhance one's life, rather than be a substitute for it."  So take a look at the [Church of Satan's news feed](http://news.churchofsatan.com/) or read interviews with our open members and see if they're doing things that interest you or would benefit you. Maybe you're in a band that's looking for other like-minded bands to book a show with. Maybe you're a photographer looking for models, or a model looking for a photographer who shares a similar aesthetic. Maybe you're a writer looking to get published in a magazine, book, or online publication. Maybe you're a DJ or podcast producer and want to get on [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). Figure out what you want to do with your life and see if joining an organization with like-minded people would help you achieve those goals. Otherwise, don't join. That doesn't disqualify you from being a Satanist.    "Fuck this, I'm gonna do what I want and spit in the face of anyone who claims otherwise. I'm gonna live my life and fight for survival despite whether anyone likes it or not."    That doesn't sound like a weak statement. To LaVey strength was the will to live, to suck the marrow from the bone of life.     You have to understand the context of which he made this statement, right in the middle of the 60's hippie movement. He rejected all this passivity, this willingness to just "drop out" and become a slave to drugs, pop culture, and unconditional brotherly love. The popular idea that this fleshy life is just a staging ground for a great psychedelic afterlife or karmic reincarnation.     He's using bombastic language, he's trying to smash people with a sledge hammer to wake them up. In my opinion, his only fault in the early days was that he had too much optimism.     In any case, depression can be a challenging condition, one that some people aren't able to control even if they willed it. It sounds like you're doing your best to gather your strength to overcome it and barrel through life. If you had sick or ill people in your family that you cared about, then yes you should take care of them if you want. That's your prerogative, your decision to make. What Satanism rejects is the idea that we should care for everyone, love everyone equally, whether they be friend, family, stranger, or foe. You be the judge of people's character, their strength in will for life.      LaVey respected animals more so than most humans because they were in tune with their natural instincts, without hypocrisy. "I wouldn't squash a spider, but I could kill a human being. A spider is being the best spider he can be. He's fulfilling his purpose as a spider. He meshes perfectly with nature's overall scheme. Nothing in nature is wasted. and I can't say the same thing about people." (from Answer Me! Issue 2).    This idea that Satanism means "do whatever you want, you are your own God" is inaccurate. Satanism champions **rational** self-interest. If you actually read all of the Satanic Bible you'll see that LaVey often comes back to balancing indulgence, avoiding compulsions, and respecting children (natural magicians) and animals.     http://www.churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php  http://www.churchofsatan.com/faq-fundamental-beliefs.php  Interview with High Priest Peter H. Gilmore:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmuV5R_O6g  Short interview with various COS members, What Does Satanism Mean to You?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlOtvDFjx0  A more advanced analysis of the Satanic philosophy:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpI_TvJXc84   A more appropriate Satanic motto would be "Cui bono", or "to whose benefit?"   That's another application that LaVey thought would be a productive use of AHC's.    This stems from the Satanic view that most people are emotionally, physically, and mentally draining. LaVey envisioned a future where androids will be made available and will allow the Satanist to custom tailor the beings that can met their high standards in terms of personality, aesthetic, and stimulation, all within the privacy of their own homes (preferably Total Environments). The idea came about after LaVey customized his own amateur effigies in the 60's and set them up in his Den of Iniquity. LaVey's creations were not "beautiful people", but they were flawed people who experienced the full breadth of life.   I suggest watching the documentary "Speak of the Devil", in which LaVey speaks about his Artificial Human Companions and you get a good look at a few of them. https://educatedratbag.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/lavey1.png  Today the Church of Satan has members who are active in the fields of robotics, animatronics, artificial intelligence, video game development, and custom dolls.       Fine by me.   Good luck and thank you for your honesty.      Send me a private message. I'm a Reverend in the Church of Satan and defend the idea that LaVey's philsophy is a modern religion.                  ASP Apparel has a variety of color options for shirts, polos, button downs, ties, etc. http://aspapparel.com/               I personally consider myself to be a libertarian/anarco-capitalist, with some technocratic leanings in practice.   As it's been said already, no the Church of Satan is not a political organization. High Priest Peter Gilmore recently did an interview with a writer for the Daily Dot on this specific topic: http://gregstevens.name/2014/08/11/church-satan-paradox-individualist-religion/  "Political issues are thus the province of each member, and weve noticed that choices beyond embracing the fundamental tenets of Satanism can be widely divergent amongst them. Thus, by design, the Church of Satan may not claim to speak or act for all of its members on political topics. It is not a collective, but instead a cabal of many with diverse pursuits, and so to understand it one must observe the doings of its members. That is difficult since many are not open about their affiliation so, like an iceberg, only a small percentage is publicly visible, as was mandated by our founder.  We have numerous members who are activists in various spheres that they find to be of personal interest and benefit. Satanism empowers Satanists to be the center of their own subjective universe, their own gods so to speak, so it is their personal values and desires motivating their activism or any other pursuits, not Satanism itself.  It is important to note that Satanism is not a cause, rather it is a set of principles that serve as a tool for each Satanist to get the most out of life. So activism in the name of Satanism is meaningless, since there is nothing that can stop one from employing the principles of Satanism as a personal tool for survival and prosperity. The fundamental concepts of Satanism support the individual Satanists desire to be politically active towards goals that enhance his or her values."   Satanism is about rational self-interest. Is "Fuck you, I got mine" a valid Satanic principle? Not necessarily. That kind of attitude isn't going to get you very far in most situations, and ostracize you in most in counter productive way. One can be self-interested and still care about other people, and be empathetic. Satanic morality is most in line with the Epicurian moral logic: http://wiki.epicurus.info/Morality     "Priest" or "Reverend" is a title of honor given to individuals by the High Priest of the Church of Satan. It means that you have demonstrated a mastery of the Satanic philosophy, applied it successfully in the real world, and are granted authority to represent the religion and organization to the media.    That said, you are not required to do anything, you just have the authority to be a spokesperson if you so wish. Priests and Reverends can be artists, musicians, writers, performers, entrepreneurs, engineers, lawyers, doctors, etc. Just continue doing what you were doing that got you the recognition, nothing more. You cannot apply or request to be a Priest/Reverend, it's purely based on merit.    Shaving your head is not related to Satanism directly. Anton LaVey shaved his head for a ritual celebration, but that was his own decision and his own aesthetic choice. Most Satanists I know do not have shaved heads. [I know I don't](https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/10330465_791424017535831_8275165441846870201_n.jpg).   More information the titles and hierarchy of the Church of Satan here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/hierarchy.php   Yes it's from the Satanic Witch. What I meant to say that the implication that drugs are fine if not being used for magic is incorrect in the context of the rest of the essay. He's essentially saying, if you want to be serious about witchcraft, don't do drugs. If you want to play make-believe, have at it, but you're not fooling anyone worthwhile.   Wrong. You are referring to the essay "The Drug Scene":  "Combine the effects of drugs with the search for a religion to supplant one which has never held much meaning, and you will arrive at a need to believe, which is strengthened by readily obtainable miracles which can ultimately fulfill that need.     Hence, an unswerving faith in magic can be readily manufactured even as it was accomplished by the same means by the shamans of primitive societies but not a proficiency in the practice of magic.    If you are to be a successful witch, faith helps, but it takes a good deal more. If, however, you do not plan on practicing witchcraft but only believing in it, use all the drugs you like."  He's saying that drug use hinders *doing* witchcraft, since you need to be in complete control of your focuses and senses to be a successful witch. But some people don't care to practice actual witchcraft, only want to *believe* they are, so they use drugs. He's also not referring to Satanist in particular, but occultists in general. He's dismissing these people here, not endorsing.  "Let me state categorically at this point that drugs are antithetical to the practice of magic, as they tend to disassociate the user from reality, even though he oftentimes thinks himself closer. It is true that many drugs expand the consciousness, but, in so doing, they make it much more difficult for a person to become selective in thoughts and motivations. In magic, it is imperative that one be able to narrow down his various awareness to one compelling desire towards which a ritual is performed. When the use of drugs has allowed the mind to run rampant over such "narrow-minded" traits, something very meaningful is lost."   That's exactly LaVey's problem with drug culture. From Secret Life of a Satanist: "And then came the final flowering of the Drone: Hippies  the final de-evolution of man, to LaVeys mind  completely androgynous, convinced they were rebels against society (all 50,000,000 of them), and so zonked out on drugs they could no longer think for themselves or question anything that was fed to them (while they were all convinced of their individuality and uniqueness). What better way to make people vulnerable to attack than to pump mind-blowing drugs into them? People in the 30s and 40s generally werent as gullible. They werent very sophisticated  they hadnt been exposed to a lot of things. Now everyones sophisticated and smart  but much more gullible and naive than they were 40 years ago."   No, it was not a ploy to receive more credibility. LaVey was 100% against illegal drug use, especially of psychedelics. In certain interviews he pushed it further, even IF certain drugs were made legal, he would still oppose its use.    First of all, the Church of Satan decides who they let into their organization, not you and your guesstimates on what you think we'd consider.     Secondly, I've seen first hand the kind of applicants the Church of Satan receives. Do we care if you're battling depression or trauma? Not necessarily. Was Robin Williams a Satanist? No. Does that mean a Satanist, or LaVey himself, can't appreciate his contributions? Absolutely not.     Lastly, go away.   Haha! Even [ISIS fighters are chiming in!](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2722878/Bizarre-Twitter-outburst-ISIS-fighters-reveal-love-late-Robin-Williams-blockbuster-hit-Jumanji.html)         From the Church of Satan FAQ: http://churchofsatan.com/faq-symbols-and-symbolism.php  "For we Satanists, numbers are just numbers. We are amused by Christians who are superstitiously afraid of this number. And since we enjoy mocking irrationality in all its forms, we might use it to tease Christians, to show them how foolish it is to fear it.  Historically, 666 is the name of Emperor Nero reduced to its numerological value through Hebrew Gematria. In the New Testament it is referred to as the number of the beast. Satanists think this is quaint, but of no real value except for a record of the lengths people will go to force significance where none exists, objectively speaking.  So 666 is not part of Satanism per se, but since the public consciousness of it these days is as a Christian symbol of the Antichrist, we are happy to have addresses or phone numbers which include it as it stirs Christians to reactions which entertain us."      Hedonism tends to be compulsive, a constant search for maximum pleasure. Satanism leans towards Epicureanism, which focuses on a lack of pain/discomfort (see LaVey's comments on Catism). If you want a deeper analysis of this, I highly recommend picking up [The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game](http://www.amazon.com/Devil-Philosophy-Nature-Popular-Culture/dp/0812698541/churchofsatan), High Priest Peter Gilmore discusses this exact question with two philosophy academics.  Atheism means you don't believe in deities. That's all it means. It says nothing about anything else. Do you believe you need deities in order to have ceremonies or rituals? Which deity do wrestlers recognize when they blast their themes and [march down to the stage](http://i.imgur.com/biDFHU0.gif)? Or at graduation ceremonies or secular funerals? Not trying to be snarky, but these questions can help illustrate the importance of symbolism, drama, metaphors, and theatrics without the need for believing in supernatural deities.   A mistake that many people make is that they look at a Satanic ritual or ceremony and quote lines where we refer to Satan or demons and proclaim "See! You Satanists DO believe in the devil!" What they failed to read is the big disclaim in both the Satanic Bible and the Satanic Rituals that clearly states that all rituals and ceremonies take place inside a moment in time where you willingly play ignorant. The purpose of this is to use any and all symbols, names, callings, etc. that will stimulate you and help you achieve the state of mind you're aiming for.    For more on rituals and ceremonies, [see the Church of Satan's FAQ on the topic](http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php).   I recommend ASP Apparel http://aspapparel.com/            There's a lot that LaVey was interested in and influenced by but never spelled out explicitly. I'm personally interested in Otto's writing, and I know others are as well.   Glad you're enjoying it! It's a great discussion with real world practicality.               Head over to the comments and let them know!                   [Definitely popped up on our radar.](https://www.facebook.com/ChurchOfSatanOfficial/posts/748562828520394)   Thank you for the opportunity to put on here. I understand it won't be to everyone's taste, may even be considered degenerate in aesthetic. In a way, that's part of what I wish to convey. The Cathedral should not be something to be admired.   Edited for clarity and etiquette.  Firstly, I apologize if I didn't make it clear in the post, but I do believe this submission is related to this sub. I myself have studied DE/NRx material for quite sometime, one could say before Mr. Land coined the term in his manifesto. I've worked with several publishers and writers who've released and collaborated with a number of the authors referred to in this sub. I am the person behind ANARCH, and throughout my work as this project I've incorporated many themes and symbols from NRx writing. This track in particular is my most direct reference, to the point of reading lines right out Nick Land's manifesto. More information can be found here: http://heathenharvest.org/2014/06/23/meet-the-artists-behind-heathen-harvests-midsummer-compilation/                     /u/SirKendrick nails it.   I recommend listening to this interview with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia where she discusses her experiences with Greater Magic/Rituals, how she integrates it into her everyday life, and why a Satanist would want to try it out.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-d0Z1l2ogk     Also from the Church of Satan FAQ:   http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php     DO I HAVE TO BE A PART OF RITUALS IF I JOIN THE CHURCH OF SATAN?  No. Ritual is meant as a tool and its use is not required amongst our members.  WHAT IS A SATANIC RITUAL?  Greater Magic, which is our name for our ritual practice, is basically meant as self-transformational psychodrama. That is it serves as a means to purge oneself of unwanted emotional baggage that might be hindering a daily pursuit of joy in life. We do not require that anyone accept that it is more than this. The pageantry of ritual is a drama meant for emotional stimulation, not a belief in or worship of any power higher than the projected will of the magician. That is why we call it an intellectual decompression chamber.  The three basic types of Satanic Ritual are outlined in detail in The Satanic Bible, which is essential reading for those wanting to grasp our perspective on this practice. They are for Compassion (for oneself and others), Lust (to release unrequited sexual urges) and Destruction (to cleanse oneself of anger towards someone who has done you an injustice). These serve as models for whatever other purposes one might feel the need to explore via ritual. In The Satanic Rituals Anton LaVey presents other rituals essentially meant for larger group performance based on historical and cultural diabolist imagery.  However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working.  Rupert Sheldrake, a biologist, has spent many years exploring the extended mind and has solid statistical evidence that there indeed does exist a mechanism in nature that could be used for such ends. His many books are fascinating and worth investigating.  We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness.  There is no judgment placed on members of the Church of Satan regarding their personal understanding of how ritual functions. One is not more or less of a Satanist based upon his or her evaluation of Greater Magic. See the essay, On the Role of Ritual in the Life of a Satanist by our High Priestess, Magistra Peggy Nadramia, for more information.    http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symbolism    http://churchofsatan.com/history-sigil-of-baphomet.php     Firstly, no.    Secondly, use your brain. Do you believe everything that anyone spouts off on the internet for page-views and click-throughs?                   Here's an article by Church of Satan Magister Nemo on the relationship between atheism and Satanism: http://www.churchofsatan.com/simplifying-satanic-atheism.php   Atheism means you don't believe in deities. That's all. There's a long list of philosophies and religions that are atheistic: Types of Buddhism, Taoism,    Confucianism, Nihilism, Jainism, Humanism and many more.      Was it just a hallucination? Sure, but it fits within the framework of real occultism. Pizzolatto says the show has elements of mysticism than the supernatural, which I applaud. There's a slight difference. Within occult mysticism there's the idea that the "other forces" that an occultist communicates with is beyond human comprehension. To interact with it leads to insanity, and omens come as hallucinations. I believe that there's a Jungian, psychological aspect to this, not supernatural, but supernormal. Rust studied nihilism, comparative religion, and researched occultism.  He subconsciously absorbed the symbols, and perfectly played out a blood ritual to the Yellow King (he was the "little priest").                Note: I'm the COS official referred to in the article. The writer did an excellent job blending parts of my commentary on the band's stage rituals (which was a much lengthier discussion) and Danielsson's beliefs. As much as I disagree with WATAIN's theistic beliefs, I do respect their art and listen to them and several other Black Metal bands.      http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php   My vote is for Kali. Congrats!   The interview comes from the 1969 documentary [Satanis: The Devil's Mass](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000093NSP/churchofsatan). It's an interesting and enlightening document of the early Magic Circle/Church of Satan, showing a very young LaVey and his associates at the time. LaVey and the COS evolved in many ways through the 70's and into the 80's, transitioning into a more stratified organization, as documented in Blanche Barton's book "The Church of Satan" and in the later documentary "Speak of the Devil".    I'm often asked why, if we're a life-affirming philosophy, do we use skulls and other various symbols associated with death. To us, those are reminders of our own mortality, the great abstinence that awaits us. And through this we're energized and revitalized to live this one life to the fullest.   Great find, and yes this captures the essence of our life-affirming philosophy!   Skepticism is healthy and welcome:    "We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness."   http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php   They also discount Funcom Points from time to time.    As has been said many times before, ones politics are up to each individual member, and most of our members are political pragmatists. They support political candidates and movements whose goals reflect their own practical needs and desires. Our members span an amazing political spectrum, which includes but is not limited to: Libertarians, Liberals, Conservatives, Republicans, Democrats, Reform Party members, Independents, Capitalists, Socialists, Communists, Stalinists, Leninists, Trotskyites, Maoists, Zionists, Monarchists, Fascists, Anarchists, and just about anything else you could possibly imagine. It is up to each member to apply Satanism and determine what political means will reach his/her ends, and they are each solely responsible for this decision. Freedom and responsibilitymust be a novel concept for those who arent Satanists. We take it in stride. Members who demand conformity from other members to their particular political fetish are welcomed to depart.     High Priest Peter H. Gilmore,     from his essay [A Map for the Misdirected](http://www.churchofsatan.com/map-for-the-misdirected.php)   LaVey unabashedly respected and was influenced by Ayn Rand, so given that it shouldn't be too much of a surprise to see many Libertarians within the COS. Keep in mind that Rand's Objectivism has some clear conflicts with Satanism, see [Magister Nemo's article detailing the common grounds and differences](http://www.churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php).  I personally lean Libertarian on most issues, technocratic on others. Depends on how idealistic I'm feeling that day. But the Church of Satan is certainly not all Libertarians, and I've met members throughout the organization that spread all across the political spectrum, and many who mix and match ideas to fit the needs of their own subjective clans or themselves. The COS itself does not hold a general political stance. See the [COS Political Policy](http://www.churchofsatan.com/policy-on-politics.php).  If you're interested in a Libertarian Satanic perspective, see Church of Satan Magister and iconic artist COOP's interview on Reason TV. He covers his Libertarian upbringing, his opinions on copyrights, his hot rod collection, and some history of his artwork.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1aC_ltJBs    That's the one.         Then there's Lords of Chaos, but this book mostly focuses on the Norwegian Black Metal scene in the 90's. http://www.amazon.com/Lords-Chaos-Satanic-Underground-Edition/dp/0922915946/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8 refRID=1MBZCMHKN0PFBFHB3870  	126

I had never thought I would ever play those shiny shiny games. I know very well the ails of lowest setting gaming and slow 90s PCs. The breaking point came a year ago when I knew I would have a part-time job and I was wiser and knew that my dream could come true, especially thanks to Reddit.  Prior to the building I thoroughly went through every BaPC guide and BaPC-recommended guide to learn how to build a PC, I even went through rookie-mistake-horrors threads. When I finally picked the parts after some googling and consideration, I asked here if it is good and subsequently changed over half of the parts according to advice. I am not a good picker, I guess.  The building itself went good, though I was nervous as hell and it took me all day. Like "Gosh, my fingers sweat so much, argh, my hard-earned two-month pay have just gone out of window it will all burn out on the first go" everytime I touched anywhere. I don't think I should worry so much about touching the components, should I? The feeling when it turned on was worth it, though.  The sad thing is, I remember how to connect and take out parts and whatnot (during building I was surprised that I almost didn't need a guide how to connect the parts together, it is very obvious - literally, as BaPCers say, like a Lego), but by now I have wholly forgotten what to look for when picking parts (unlike some people here who just go to the store and casually pick up good compatible parts), but I suppose I can consult the internet when the need arises.

Addictive, but aggravating :D   Especially the non-pressers. They had one chance to press the button and they will have missed it.   What an accurate description!      I disagree a bit. It is now commonly thought that spirituality has to do with supernatural, but Saganian definition of spirituality applies to us all. I wish the word "spiritual" wasn't associated with the supernatural, superstitious or gullible.   Spirit comes from the Latin word to breathe. What we breathe is air, which is certainly matter, however thin. Despite usage to the contrary, there is no necessary implication in the word spiritual that we are talking of anything other than matter (including the matter of which the brain is made), or anything outside the realm of science. On occasion, I will feel free to use the word. Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.    I think that scientific understanding of the world can bring some consolation. You learn that all dies and ends, but however sad that is, it is okay and it is natural to be sad about that. Our little while living in this vast and wonderful cosmos is so much more precious.   You don't wanna cuddle, I WILL MAKE YOU CUDDLE!   Harold is a spacedick.

 The law allowed for (and prosecutors asked for) jail time of 10 years or more.       It is worth noting that the US government did not lose money on the **program** that funded Solyndra (it also funded other things like Tesla Motors).  It made about $5-6 billion for the government:   The U.S. expects to earn $5 billion to $6 billion from the federal program that funded flops including Solyndra LLC, bolstering President Barack Obamas decision to back low-carbon technologies. [SOURCE](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-13/solyndra-program-vilified-by-republicans-turns-a-profit.html)    Story, to me, is what lifts an at best mediocre game to become something special.  Straight-up mechanics only get you so far.  It would be akin to a roller coaster ride.  Sure its fun at first but it wears thin really fast if that is all there is to it.  One can point to the likes of Doom and Serious Sam as examples of nearly no story and fun gameplay being a workable mix but there is a reason we have not seen their like in a decade or more (at least not highly successful ones).  Look at what was done with the recent Castle Wolfenstein to see how story lifts what would have been a fun romp into something exceptional.    My 980 is likewise working fine on all the AAA titles I've tried it on so far including DA:I, Bioshock Infinite, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor and XCom: Enemy Unknown.  I'm averaging [60 FPS on the Heaven benchmark](http://i.imgur.com/0a8JraN.png) at 1440p on Ultra with no AA and normal tessellation.  I am thinking it is those games or something else at issue rather than the 980.   Just to make this a bit more ELI5:  It is important to remember the equation E=MC^2  Basically that means (among other things) that mass and energy are interchangeable.    So, when fission occurs (or fusion) the result is something with less mass than what we started with.  Thing is cosmic accounting *requires* that nothing is lost.  The books have to balance.  In this case the "missing" mass is converted to energy and the amount of energy is determined via E=MC^2.  That last part, C^2 or speed of light squared, is a really big number which is why you see so much energy released from relatively small amounts of material fissioning or fusing (only a few percent of the material in a bomb undergoes fission or fusion and that is enough to level a city).    I always find it interesting watching shows about mobsters when they get really bent out of shape that someone stole money from them seeming to forget all the money they have is money they stole from someone else.    The Asus PG278q is probably the best **gaming** monitor on the market, bar none.  That said it is a TN panel with all the inherent limitations a TN panel has.  As TN panels go it is very good but still...if you want this for other purposes such as video or photo work you will probably not like this monitor at all (I went from an IPS panel and I easily spot the color shifting which I find a bit annoying).  For gaming though it rocks.  Know that a single GTX 980 (which is what I have) runs this monitor fine but due to the extra pixels this panel has (2560 x 1440) the 980 only just gets it done. With all bells and whistles turned on for a modern AAA title I get around 50 FPS...give or take...on some titles on ultra settings.  Still, due to G-Sync 50 FPS isn't too bad at all IMO.  Some say you can help squeeze more out by turning off AA because the high pixel count obviates the need for it but I find I can still see issues without AA on.  YMMV.    I found my PG278q at Microcenter Chicago at MSRP about a week ago.  At the time they had three in stock.  This despite their website saying they were out.  Long story short, call them.  The website may not reflect the reality.     I wouldn't go for the Asus ROG Swift right now as it's extremely buggy[1] .  I have a ROG Swift PG278q and have none of the problems listed in that thread.  If you read it someone else also posted that they have no problems.  Doubtless some people have had problems but that will be true for most any product.  It is an expensive monitor and it does have the inherent issues with any TN panel.  I went from an IPS panel to this and the color shifting is very apparent to me.  As TN panels go it is about as good as it gets but in the end it is still a TN panel.  That said, if you want a **gaming** monitor I do not think you can do better today.  Just be sure you have enough video card to run it.  It absolutely requires Display Port to operate and being a 1440p monitor it has a lot more pixels to push than a more "normal" 1080p monitor (about 44% more pixels).   I'll add to the chorus that it is worth it.  I held off a long time buying it then (I think) it came on sale and I figured may as well.  Glad I did.  Probably the best game of this genre I have played in a long time.  I have a backlog of games too but this is worth jumping the line for.    [Sleepy's](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sleepy%27s+Festival/@41.978334,-87.660327,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x6c39c6f3387fc053) (Google Street View at that link still shows a pic of the Blockbuster).     Amber Alert.   You go to check on your daughter and she's not in her room or anywhere to be found in the house.    Yes and no.  Certainly they have bandwidth and capacity issues.  Any one person won't change much but eventually it matters.  You are buying a product same as buying a TV from a store.  You cannot tell CCP they are not "losing" anything because there is not a physical product.  If you go to court or Wall Street they would view this as tangible.  If you stole game time from CCP you will not be able to defend yourself by saying nothing was really lost by CCP.  Further, those PLEX are game time which people use.  CCP LOVES it when it gets blown up.  That game time is no longer in the pool and needs to be bought again.  CCP gets to double dip.    It is like a store selling you a gift card.  The gift card costs them next to nothing.  They do however get the money you put on the card.  If you never redeem that card it is money in the bank for them.  Obviously an online game is different but it is the same idea.    An Ibis in EVE is the starter ship for one of the factions.  It is a noob ship in the literal sense.  You get that ship on Day #1, minute #1 when you start the game.  As one might expect it is (along with the other faction's noob ships) about as pathetic a ship as can be found.  It would be akin to the pointy stick/paper armor you are given at the start of a fantasy MMO.    In a fucking IBIS???  Wow...  Either a literal noob or complete moron.  Maybe he hoped bad guys wouldn't scan a noob ship cuz hey...noob right?  Well, that trick went out the window ages ago.     I haven't played EVE for a few years now but I did for about eight years and among my guild they always gave me stuff to haul.  Was kinda my "thing".  While being a hauler is fraught with danger in hi sec if you get suicide ganked it is nearly always the pilot's fault for being lazy.  I wonder if this guy was AFK on autopilot.  If so he/she kinda had it coming (painful as it was).  Maybe things have changed since I last played though.  Would be curious to hear from a current player if it has.   The monitor requires a Display Port 1.2 connection.  Period.  That is why the monitor only has that one connection option.  HDMI is too slow to drive that monitor.  The good and bad news is you need a new GPU.  Bad because it is a layout of more money, good because a new GPU is always fun.  You MUST get an Nvidia card for this if you want to take advantage of its G-Sync ability (which is really the point of this monitor).  GTX 970 has a good price point versus performance.  You could go cheaper but I wouldn't if you can at all avoid it.  Remember this panel has a 1440 resolution so it is harder to drive than the typical 1080.  If you want all the graphical goodies go for a 970 single card solution or look into an SLI solution.    I picked one up at my local (Chicago) Microcenter two days ago for the MSRP of $800.  They had two left when I bought mine.  EDIT:  Protip - CALL the store you want to buy from.  The internet is not reliably reporting stock or prices.  In my case Microcenter website said they had zero, I called and they had three in stock at MSRP price.    Thanks.  So that picture of an Nvidia control panel with these settings does not exist?  Also, of those is there a preferred one or are they all similar enough to make no difference?    I just bought a PNY GTX 980 card in order to run a new Asus ROG SWIFT PG278Q monitor (it has G-Sync built in to the monitor).  All well and good so far.  I like the PNY for the reference design of the card (I like that cooling solution which works well with my system and it is also quiet).  Problem is, near as I can tell, PNY provides no bells and whistles for their card which also means no ability to set the fan to auto-adjust itself based on its temperature.  I downloaded [EVGA Precision](http://www.evga.com/precision/) which seems it is doing the trick.  Still, while looking in to this it seemed Nvidia built in fan controls into their driver.  From the [sales page for the PNY GTX 980](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133563) card:   NVIDIA GPU Boost 2.0 Technology   Dynamically maximizes clock speeds based on workload, and allows enthusiast class controls such as temperature target and fan controls, extra over-voltage headroom, and optimizations for water-cooling solutions. This allows greater customization and overclocking options and enables gamers to push performance to new levels.   So where is that?  When I look at my control panel I [see this screen.](http://i.imgur.com/MbiViWA.png)  So where are these reputed enthusiast controls?  The ones that presumably [should look like this](http://www.nvidia.com/object/performance_group.html)?  FWIW I downloaded the drivers last night so they are current.  Thanks in advance!   Harold   Maude  No one on Reddit ever seems to know what it is. They are all missing out.    That is not the same thing at all.  Consider:  You are sitting in jail for the next 40 years wrongly accused of rape.  The woman who accused you of rape has a few choices:  1)  Say nothing, she lives a long and happy life.  2)  Tell people she lied and go to jail for 20 years.  What do you think she will choose?  It is ALREADY illegal to perjure yourself to the court.  The penalties are already there to dissuade people from lying.  Your way sees to it you rot in jail for the better part of your life.  Hope that is some comfort to you because that is about all the comfort you're likely to get.    There have been many Boy/Girl Scouts who went to congress with noble ambitions.  The reality of Washington either corrupts them or, for the few who refuse to play the game, gets them sidelined and often removed from office in the next election.  For the one or two who hang on through all of that they are only one or two and woefully outnumbered.  The system is broken.  Millennials will not save a damn thing by becoming representatives (not their fault).  They will be co-opted and corrupted as easily as everyone till this point has.    Before you read the rest know that I understand how shitty this is and agree.  That said there is (possibly) more to be considered:  While I, like you, would love to see someone who falsely accused someone to be hung out to dry the problem with doing so is you discourage people who have done so from ever retracting their accusation (or for others to come forward).  That is to say if you make it so anyone who falsely accuses someone to face decades in jail then they will never (or very rarely) come forward to let it be known a miscarriage of justice occurred.  Likewise their friends or family will be less likely to come forward knowing the repercussions.  This is particularly important with rape accusations since all too often it is the testimony of the woman that is the crux of the case.  You need her to retract the accusation.  As shitty as it is I think it is better the falsely accused get out of jail than it is to put the false accusers in jail.  EDIT: Spelling  EDIT2:  To whoever is downvoting me consider if you'd rather rot in jail for 40 years or have a path for your accuser to retract their false statements.  With that path you get out of jail and your false accuser also does not go to jail.  Without that path you rot in jail and your false accuser stays free.  It may suck but reality dictates this one.  Choose wisely...  Edit3:  Downvotes with no response why I am wrong.  Way to go guys...the debate would be worthwhile.    I do not know that such a comparison has been made but I assume you could look-up the numbers and do it.  They are publicly available.  The issue here though is less about "how much" they chip in as it is about how much they take out.  Since they are illegal immigrants they cannot avail themselves of government programs meaning they cannot get anything back for what they put in.  I have seen some suggestions that illegal immigrants are an important part of keeping Social Security running since they put money in but never get paid out.  I have also seen that in some states the net outflow is more than the inflow.  States like California pay more to immigrants than they put in (mainly from their kids going to public schools).  In other states the reverse is true (states with small immigrant populations).  Overall, federally, illegal immigrants are a net benefit to the country's bank accounts and only take more than they put in in a relatively few states.    Personally I love the skits and whatnot.  It sets him apart.  There are a zillion "reviewers" out there who turn on Fraps and talk about the game.  AngryJoe provides more value with a lot of production value in his reviews which sets them apart.  To each his/her own I guess but I can do without reviewer #1,000,000,001 Frapped review.  I think YouTube and this whole genre of YouTube content is served better by people adding some production value to their content.  As always, YMMV.    He seemed to be having a lot of fun traveling to various events leaving him little time for reviews.  He'd occasionally put up some streaming crap but felt like he phoned it in more often than not.  I can appreciate that his reviews have a lot of production value and take a lot of effort and a long time to produce.  That is also why I like to watch his stuff over most other reviewers (or the even more dodgy, won't take a stance, First Impression crowd like TotalBiscuit).  TB can do 10 "first impressions" to every one of AngryJoe's reviews but I'd rather watch any AngryJoe review over any TotalBiscuit first impression.  YMMV  I really like Joe's stuff and hope he gets back to what made him popular in 2015 (I know he said he "has a plan"...fingers crossed it works out).    Sure:  Undocumented immigrants are already U.S. taxpayers.  Collectively, they paid an estimated $10.6 billion to state and local taxes in 2010, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a research organization that works on tax policy issues. Contributions varied by state. In Montana they contributed $2 million. In California, more than $2.2 billion. On average they pay about 6.4% of their income in state and local taxes, ITEP said.  A 2007 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report on the impact of undocumented immigrants on the budgets of local and state governments cited IRS figures showing that 50% to 75% of the about 11 million unauthorized U.S. immigrants file and pay income taxes each year.   snip  The truth is that undocumented immigrants contribute more in payroll taxes than they will ever consume in public benefits.  Take Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), unauthorized immigrants -- who are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits -- have paid an eye-popping $100 billion into the fund over the past decade.   snip  Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, and most other public benefits. Most of these programs require proof of legal immigration status and under the 1996 welfare law, even legal immigrants cannot receive these benefits until they have been in the United States for more than five years.

One of my all time favorite fight scenes.  The fast cuts they use in other movies is just there to hide a lack of fight choreography because it is easier and cheaper to do.  Pisses me off when the movie is all about the action in the first place.    It is worth adding that the process of collapse into a neutron star or black hole is what produces many elements we see that are iron or heavier.  The process is called [nucleosynthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis) and it happens really, really fast as the star explodes in a supernova.    This does not make sense.  The universe did not pop into existence inside an infinite space.  The Big Bang created space and time...it happened everywhere (i.e. you cannot point to a spot in our universe and say that is the center where the Big Bang started...it started everywhere including where you are sitting right now).  It is not like a bomb going off in some infinitely big room as far as we are concerned.  Space may expand forever but that does not make our universe infinitely big. You cannot say the universe is expanding "into" anything because the universe, for us, is everything.  There is no "outside" the universe.  May as well ask what is north of the North Pole (hat tip to Stephen Hawking for that one).    I became preternaturally aware of being bitten.  Which is to say I woke at the slightest provocation no matter what it was.  I became a spaz.  I kept my phone by my bed and would turn on its flashlight to scan for them rather than take time to get out of bed which might allow an escape.  Sometimes I would catch one and squish it (they are actually kinda hard to squish...especially on a bed).  If I didn't spot one the sheets came off and into the drier they went (IIRC they cannot survive temps over 120F).  Actually spotted or not everything went in the drier and I'd try to sleep on a bed with no blanket or sheets or pillows while doing this.  I didn't sleep much or well for months (literally) but I maintained my drier routine over and over and over again for a few weeks.  I had no clue if there was anything in there or not but I did it religiously anyway anytime I even suspected there was one around and it eventually worked where all else failed.  My "infestation" was not all that bad as these things go but one is one too many (and I definitely had more than one) and from start to finish fighting them was about 3-4 months.  It really, really sucks when you dread going to bed.    I tried cheating on my high school physics exam by programming my calculator to do the problems for me.  Mind you this was long before teachers were hip to calculators that could do this.  I spent all night programming the calculator to solve for any variable in the equations the test threw at me.  Took me many hours.  Come exam time it turns out that by programming the calculator to do those problems I had to understand how to do those problems. I accidentally taught myself all the material and I was faster than my lousy program at doing them too.    I had to deal with the little fuckers once. They are incredibly tenacious and hard to get rid of and positively maddening.   What ultimately worked for me was putting my bed sheets and pillows in the dryer on hottest setting for an hour EVERY time I was attacked. 2am? Didn't matter. I was crazy about it for weeks.   Worked better than anything else I tried and stopped the attacks.     How can it be infinite when it had a beginning and has an expansion rate?  Seems to me an "expanding universe" is meaningless if it is infinite in extent.  That said seeing the universe as flat or open does not make the universe infinite...just means it can expand forever which is different.     Yes, as he/she said there are hard limits on the size of a star.  Eventually, if the star gets big enough, the gravity at the outer edge of the star is too low to hold on to atoms.  The star's radiation will blow off any excess material that drops on to it.  Here is a drawing of [UY Scuti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UY_Scuti#mediaviewer/File:UY_Scuti_size_comparison_to_the_sun.png), perhaps the largest star we know of, in comparison to our sun.  This is about as big as they get.  As mentioned above for VY Canis Majoris (also an oft cited candidate for biggest star) the star would engulf a region out to Jupiter and maybe Saturn if it were in our solar system.  As for how small a star can get it is a bit of a gray area.  You have brown dwarfs which straddle the area between really big gas giants and really little stars:  Brown dwarfs are substellar objects too low in mass to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion reactions in their cores, unlike main-sequence stars. They occupy the mass range between the heaviest gas giants and the lightest stars, with an upper limit around 75[1] to 80 Jupiter masses (MJ). Brown dwarfs heavier than about 13 MJ are thought to fuse deuterium and those above ~65 MJ, fuse lithium as well.[2] Brown dwarfs may be fully convective, with no layers or chemical differentiation by depth.[3]  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf)     The universe is usually viewed as finite in size but unbounded.  It is akin to walking on the surface of the earth.  It is obviously finite in size but you could walk forever and never find an "edge" or "wall" or "end" to it.  The universe would work in similar fashion.  You could travel as long as you like but will never find an end to it.  Interestingly though, even if you viewed the universe as a 3D bubble with a finite volume and an "end" to it you still could not reach it.  Space is expanding faster than the speed of light at the furthest reaches.  You couldn't catch it if you tried (although to be clear there is nothing to catch anyway).     Not even close.  It would be smaller than our moon.  About 220 of them are larger than 100 km.  The biggest asteroid belt member, and the only dwarf planet found there, is Ceres, which is about 1000 km across.  The total mass of the Asteroid belt is estimated to be 3.0 to 3.610^21 kilograms, which is 4 percent of the Earth's Moon.  Of that total mass, one third is accounted for by Ceres alone. [SOURCE](http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/asteroid_belt.htm)  In fact the usual pictures we see of asteroid belts as a crowded place is wrong, at least for ours.  It is pretty sparse and chances are you could fly right through it without hitting anything.     This is akin to (and worse than) where I live in Illinois.  In Illinois most types of fireworks are illegal.  *Right* across the border in Indiana is a HUGE fireworks store.  Around the 4th of July Illinois state troopers will sit on the Illinois side of the border and watch with binoculars people leaving the fireworks store.  If they enter Illinois they call in police to go get them.  Been going on for ages.  Hell, cigarette taxes in Illinois are pretty high (especially in Chicago).  Lots of people drive to Indiana to get smokes.  Back in the day Wisconsin had a drinking age of 18 while Illinois was 21.  Lots and lots of 18 year olds would zoom up to Wisconsin for booze.  Shit like this has been happening between states since there were states.    There really is no such thing as artificial gravity.  The only way you can simulate gravity is via acceleration (e.g. your rotating cylinder).  According to Einstein when it comes to gravity there is only mass or acceleration (via the [Equivalence Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) which basically says an accelerating frame of reference can be indistinguishable from gravity).     The equator thing is quite misleading.   What part of "The rockets gain the angular momentum from the earth's spinning..." is misleading?  Never said they were lighter.   Indeed it does.  You are lighter because the planet rotates.  To be fair though it is not a big difference.  You'd weigh about [99.7% of what you do at the equator as you would at the poles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#Latitude)  This is also why they like to launch rockets as close to the equator as possible (in the case of the US they do it in Florida which is as far south in the US you can get except for Hawaii).  France launches from French Guiana and some proposed a floating launch pad that would sit on the equator for launches.  The rockets gain the angular momentum from the earth's spinning which means less fuel needed to achieve orbit.   Interesting.  One would suppose the HARMs were effective otherwise they would not scare radar operators into turning off their radars.  I think it is safe to assume enough found their targets to make them a credible threat.   The way to avoid them is killing them.  Been doing it since Vietnam.  Send in the [Wild Weasels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Weasel).  As soon as an enemy turns on an air search radar they launch radar homing missiles.  IIRC in Desert Storm the Iraqi AAA guys got to the point they refused to turn on their radar making their AAA pretty much useless.    This is undoubtedly something that can be calculated and indeed even measured with current instruments.    Scientists now have a clock so sensitive that if there were two of them they'd never agree.  Differences in height of a few centimeters are detectable:  That is a sliver of a second. But this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter until now. But this new clock is so sensitive, little changes in height throw it way off. Lift it just a couple of centimeters, Ye says, "and you will start to see that difference." [SOURCE](http://www.npr.org/2014/11/03/361069820/new-clock-may-end-time-as-we-know-it)    To add to this it is important to note that this has to happen.  In any given volume of particles the particles will be moving randomly in different directions and at different speeds.  However, if you add them all up some cancel and some add to each other, you will find there is a net movement in some given direction.  The law of conservation of angular momentum makes the object spin.  As the object coalesces (gets smaller) it spins faster.  Same thing happens when an ice skater spins and pulls their arms in (they spin faster).   And they don't fart -- they poot.   Interesting.  My conspiracy theory is Clinton has paid her off* in some fashion to keep her out.  Clinton does not want a repeat of 2008 and Warren would be foolish to just bow out and get nothing for it.  And no, Warren would have FAR more power as president than she would as 1 of 100 senators.  *In a legal fashion...promise her a cabinet position or something.  EDIT to add: I REALLY hope Warren was not offered a VP position under Clinton.  That would truly make Warren near powerless.    I really wish Warren would run.  I think the process (i.e. Democratic primary) will benefit by having those two duke it out.       History is littered with examples of, "What the hell is this good for?"  Then, somewhere down the road, it became indispensable.    It may be that this never amounts to anything.  Or then it might see some unforseen future use.  Or it may be that the science and techniques for this become useful in some other fashion.  Who knows?  We do have a lot of evidence from the past that seemingly useless pursuits became hugely profitable.  Then again some are dead ends.  Overall it is well worth the effort as even failures and dead ends educate us.    NYPD is a registered trademark?  Seriously?    Just to be Devil's Advocate (I am personally on the fence thinking about this):  Is there no line where you'd say the game has gone too far?  Would you be ok with a game where the protagonist is a pedophile and the game has you working to lure kids to your house so you can rape them?  Is that a bridge too far?  Why or why not?  Would you see people who play it as morally reprehensible?  If so  then you are merely arguing a matter of degree which will, of course, be different for different people.     On the other side, gun control is very important to her liberal base so why should she avoid it?   Because by itself it would be the single defining fight a president might tackle.  There is no way she can do meaningful Wall Street reform and meaningful gun control reform at the same time and she is making her name crusading against banks and not guns manufacturers.  More, gun control has the 2nd Amendment and the SCOTUS on its side.  It really is a non-starter.  Meaningful gun control reform will take decades if it ever even starts.  Of course Wall Street and its cronies will scare people like this guy that she is coming for their guns.  Anything to get them to pull the lever for their guy.  They did it for Obama and there was lots of fear that Obama was coming for the guns (look at gun sales which spiked after he was elected).    Did Obama do shit about guns?    Nope.    On the upside there is no real downside to psilocybin mushrooms beyond tripping for a few hours.  For some tripping may suck but then many find it fun (indeed it is considered a recreational drug).    This of course assumes you have actual psilocybin mushrooms and not some variant mushroom that is actually poisonous or that the psilocybin mushrooms are old and moldy (which again can be poisonous).    Plenty of information about it on the internet.  Here is a link to bit on how the shrooms work for a person who suffers cluster headaches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFuL7pcShDk  The way the sufferer described it in the video was, despite being illegal and the tripping part, it was that or suicide for him.  Standard waiver:  I am not a doctor nor am I advocating doing illegal things.  Your and her choices are your own.    Wing Commander 3 (I feel so old in this thread).    I am willing to bet whoever the republican candidate is they will not be on board with marijuana legalization either.  They will certainly be supportive of gun rights but for all the belly aching about that under Obama he has never touched it (beyond re-signing the assault weapons ban) and the gun rights community got some important decisions their way in the Supreme Court.  In short, I am willing to bet Warren (if she became president) would not even touch gun rights.  She is and has been a reformer of Wall Street first and foremost as should be obvious.  That fight will take all the political capital she can muster and then some.  I'd be willing to bet you she wouldn't touch gun laws and *even if she did* with current SCOTUS decisions I am not sure what you think she could do beyond what has already been done.  Given that you might consider some other issues as important and worth figuring in to your decision of who to vote for.     You aren't allowed to protect yourself any longer.  Well that's just not true:  In Congressional testimony, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor claimed she couldn't think of a self-defense case having come before the Supreme Court, adding, "I could be wrong, but I can't think of one." Independent research shows that fourteen separate Supreme Court cases, from 1895 to 1985, addressed every basic aspect of personal self defense. All of them held that self defense is a valid, justifiable and long-standing tenet of American law.

Torture is ineffective at getting *useful* intelligence.  That is not the same as "useless" but near enough for practical purposes.  Thing is the CIA already knew this from prior goes at torturing people [SOURCE](http://www.nbcnews.com/video/rachel-maddow/56587686#56587686).  Napoleon knew it.  [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture#Early_modern_period)  The Germans in WWII knew it. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff)  We knew it from experience in Vietnam.

[SOURCE](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/19/whatever-it-takes?currentPage=all)  We have studied it since and figured it out again. [SOURCE](http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/04/21/20090421analysis-memos0421-ON.html)  This is not to say someone being tortured never gives true information.  Just that getting *useful* intelligence via torture is nearly always the worst way to go about it (and you can't tell when it might have been "better").  Torture's main purpose is to either threaten your populace (e.g. a dictator trying to cow the populace) and/or to extract false confessions/testimony.    What the FUCK is wrong with that country   I came here to post *exactly* this.    Reminds me of why I like Reddit (great minds and all that).    So does it work or not? Does it work just a little bit? Maybe it doesn't produce enough useful information to justify the moral cost?        Thats the rub - I think. The value that it could provide doesn't outweigh the ethical and moral costs.        But there is practical value, especially if you consider it in cold, cost-benefit terms. After all, all you need is a guy and a scalpel or a cheap car battery. And in return you get data. And data is useful.   Bad data is not useful.  It can cause you to expend resources needed elsewhere.  In war that can be disastrous.  It is not as simple to verify false positives as you might think.  Torture as a means of gaining *useful* intelligence is a non-starter.  Doesn't work.   Some will argue it is the lesser of two evils.  Would torturing someone to stop the 9/11 attacks be justified to save 2000 lives?  It can be reasonably argued that this would be justifiable.  The folk who want to torture can live comfortably in these morally gray areas.  But if you point out that torture doesn't work then they've got nothing.  You no longer need a moral argument.    The photo was taken in 1977.  That story from then is now a movie.   We only have your assertions that the sources are bad and nothing addressing what was actually said.   And since you seem fond of using logical fallacies, heres one for you: Appeal to a false authority.   Who is a false authority?  Napoleon Bonaparte?  Hanns Scharff who the Nazis called their "master interrogator"?  Jack Jacobs, Retired Army Colonel, Medal of Honor Recipient for actions in Vietnam plus 2 Silver Stars, 3 Bronze Stars and 2 Purple Hearts?  A group of scientists tasked with studying this very thing?  Yeah...none of those people have a fucking clue about this stuff..._   If someone says, "The sun rises in the east," and I source www.satan.666 are they wrong because they are not a reliable source?  This is why you address the argument and not who said it.     You have not pointed out any flaws. All you did was engage in an ad hominem attack.   If you think those sources are lying or in error then prove it.   Otherwise you've got nothing.    Yeah, morality doesn't figure into it at all.  Is connecting a car battery to some guy's scrotum immoral if it means you save 100 of your guys from an ambush?  I dunno...it is a helluva thing to have to make those calls but I am thinking in war the niceties go out the window real fast.   Thing is when it comes to gaining intelligence to save those 100 guys it turns out torture is a really bad way to go.    In Iraq, I never saw pain produce intelligence, Lagouranis told me. I worked with someone who used waterboardingan interrogation method involving the repeated near-drowning of a suspect. I used severe hypothermia, dogs, and sleep deprivation. I saw suspects after soldiers had gone into their homes and broken their bones, or made them sit on a Humvees hot exhaust pipes until they got third-degree burns. Nothing happened. Some people, he said, gave confessions. But they just told us what we already knew. It never opened up a stream of new information. If anything, he said, physical pain can strengthen the resolve to clam up.  [SOURCE](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/19/whatever-it-takes?currentPage=all)    To be fair the Nazis DID torture people...a lot of people.  They just knew that if you wanted useful intelligence from someone you captured then torture was far from ideal.   The Senate report confirms it doesnt work. As those of us on the inside knew.  Many on the outside knew it too.  It is no secret that torture does not work as a means to gain intelligence.  Napoleon fucking knew it and you can be sure if setting some guy's nuts on fire served his purpose he'd have done it:  The barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture#Early_modern_period)  The Germans in WWII knew it and then advised Americans on it:    Hanns-Joachim Gottlob Scharff (December 16, 1907  September 10, 1992) was a German Luftwaffe interrogator during the Second World War. He has been called the "Master Interrogator" of the Luftwaffe and possibly all of Nazi Germany; he has also been praised for his contribution in shaping U.S. interrogation techniques after the war. A mere Obergefreiter (the equivalent of a senior lance corporal), he was charged with interrogating German-captured American fighter pilots during the war after he became an interrogation officer in 1943. He has been highly praised for the success of his techniques, in particular because he never used physical means to obtain the required information. Scharffs interrogation techniques were so effective that he was occasionally called upon to assist other German interrogators in their questioning of bomber pilots and aircrews, including those crews and fighter pilots from countries other than the United States. [SOURCE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff)  The US knew it in Vietnam:  "At the end of the day, it's very easy to distinguish between the right thing and the wrong thing to do. If you do the wrong thing, you're not going to get any positive payoff from it and it's going to be of at some great cost," Jacobs said. "We get much more information if we treat people properly."  snip  "You need to be aggressive to get the information you want, but if you treat people inhumanely, they're just going to tell you what they think you want to hear," he said. "They'll do anything just to get the mistreatment to stop, so you get nothing from mistreatment."  Speaking of his experiences, Jacobs said he has had the best success by being decent to people.   snip  "When I was in Vietnam, we were given the most intelligence, the best intelligence and had the most success with captors if we gave them cigarettes, medical care, food (and) water. Almost always, you get the best success from treating people properly," Jacobs said. [SOURCE:  Jack Jacobs, Retired Army Colonel, Medal of Honor Recipient for actions in Vietnam plus 2 Silver Stars, 3 Bronze Stars and 2 Purple Hearts](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9958544/#.VIaIvslNfPs)  Americans figured it out again:  In 2006, a group of scientists and retired intelligence officers set out to settle the matter. They sought to find the most effective interrogation tactics and advise the U.S. government on their use. Their conclusions, laid out in a 372-page report for the director of national intelligence, argued against harsh interrogation.  "The scientific community has never established that coercive interrogation methods are an effective means of obtaining reliable intelligence information," retired Air Force Col. Steven M. Kleinman, a former military-interrogation instructor, wrote in the Intelligence Science Board report. "In essence, there seems to be an unsubstantiated assumption that compliance' carries the same connotation as meaningful cooperation."  In short: Slam someone up against the wall, keep him awake for days, lock him naked in a cell and slap his face enough, and he will probably say something. That doesn't necessarily make it true.  [SOURCE](http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/04/21/20090421analysis-memos0421-ON.html)  There is more...not sure how much they need.  People need to stop watching "24" thinking that is how things should be done when you want to get intelligence.  The ONLY reason to torture is to terrorize others ala Saddam Hussein in order to maintain control via fear.  EDIT to add:  I forgot this great quote by Jesse Ventura (yeah...the former wrestler who was also a governor of Minnesota and, most importantly for this, a Navy Seal which includes SERE training so he has been waterboarded himself and has a clue about this):  ...you give me a water board, Dick Cheney and one hour, and Ill have him confess to the Sharon Tate murders.

[Composite image of every Saturn V launch.](http://vintagespace.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/saturn-v-launches.jpg)  Apollo 5 and Apollo 7 were launched on the slightly smaller Saturn IVB launch vehicle.   Not sure but guessing a big ass anaconda snake.    The best thing EVAR!! (Till she discovers your bed.)     You have to go with general relativity, which will tell you that within the event horizon, all paths lead towards the centre, and moving away from it is equivalent to going backwards in time.   Which is really interesting when you think about it.  If we went in a black hole and I asked you to point to the outside of the black hole it is not like being inside a bubble and pointing to the outside.  You can't do it.  Asking you to do that is like asking you to point the way to last Tuesday because, literally, that is the direction out of the black hole ([timelike and spacelike dimensions get interchanged inside a black hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram#Black_holes)).   For us humans the issue is rockets which are fundamentally limited by the [tyrrany of the rocket equation.](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html)  Short version is the more you want to change your speed the more fuel you need and the fuel requirement goes up exponentially.  So, you need enough fuel to get off the earth and on the way to Mars.  Then you need enough fuel to slow down once you reach Mars.  Then enough to come back to earth and enough to slow down again once you reach earth.  And the faster you want to do all that makes the problem even that much more intractable.  You end up toting along so much fuel it becomes absurd and hugely impractical.  There are ways to minimize the problem above (e.g. launch from earth orbit, send fuel ahead in separate rocket ships and refuel along the way, gravity assists and so on).  Still, the problem is complex and just throwing bigger rockets and more fuel at the problem really doesn't get you anywhere (you get diminishing returns for each kilo of fuel you load aboard).  Relativistic effects come nowhere near being an issue for this.  This is all far, far too slow to worry about that.  EDIT:  XKCD explains some of these issues here: https://what-if.xkcd.com/38/    There is something called the [photon sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere) outside of a black hole.  Basically it is the place where in order to stay in orbit around the black hole you have to travel at light speed (so, basically, light orbits the black hole).  At any distance beyond that there are orbits that could be achieved same as anywhere else in the universe.  If our sun magically converted into a black hole the earth would orbit it same as it is now.  Here is an animation of [stars orbiting our galaxy's central black hole](http://astro.uchicago.edu/cosmus/projects/UCLA_GCG/UCLA_GCG_2000.gif) (that is from real data collected).     You could continuously accelerate assuming you had an infinite amount of fuel.  However:  - You can never reach the speed of light...just get arbitrarily close to it.  - Fuel has mass so the more fuel you have the harder you are to accelerate.  There is a tradeoff here and eventually your fuel will mass more than your engines can push.  See: [The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html)   The increase in mass is a bit misleading here.  There are two types of mass scientists use.  Your rest mass (or invariant mass) and your relativistic mass.  How much you weigh never changes.  Your relativistic mass can be thought of as how hard it is to push you to move you.  The faster you go the harder it is to push you.  You can never reach the speed of light because it would require infinite energy to push you that fast.  The increase in relativistic mass happens at any speed.  However, the effect is exceptionally small till you get very close to the speed of light. At around 90% the speed of light your relativistic mass is about 2.3 times as your "not moving" mass (realize you are never "not moving"...all about reference frames).  As you can see that is a looong way from infinite you get to at 100% so the effect increases dramatically right near the end.  At the relatively (see what I did there :) ) slow speeds of planets and our rockets the effect is so negligible that it can be ignored for all practical purposes.     Actually those statistics don't seem all that bad.  One death is one too many and I am not making light of those who have lost their life in the line of duty.

If you have to run on the ground no biggie either...you can run right by them and they barely start to turn towards you before you're long gone.  Of course that boss guy at the end is bound to be a challenge but otherwise avoiding the zombies seems downright trivial and the occasional need to bash one seems like no fuss either.  I am missing the part where you are supposed to be really worried while running around???    IIRC The Witcher and/or The Witcher 2 were among the most pirated games ever and came with no DRM.  I do not recall them being problematic games.    I'd be really curious to see an analysis of how much more money the company makes while the game is "uncrackable" and paying someone however much it costs to make the DRM.  I suspect there are only a relative few who will buy the game in the first few days *only* because there is not a crack available.  There have been many analysis of piracy and its costs and IIRC the cost is negligible to the game companies.  Most people who pirate weren't going to buy the game no matter what.  I'd be surprised if the cost of paying the DRM producers is ever offset by an increase in sales.  I think the real issue is the executives of the company know DRM is nearly worthless but must do so to look good for the investors.    I reject your two options and go with option #3.

I can probably drink most 20-somethings under the table BUT I don't do shots or play drinking games anymore.  I know myself and my limits pretty well and can pace myself easily through a night of drinking.  I get and maintain a happy buzz without getting shitfaced (usually...still manage to overdo it occasionally).  What has definitely changed is recovery time.  In my 20's I could stay out till three, get up at six, go to work then go out again that night.  No more.  No way, no how.  Midnight is pushing it for me except for special occasions and recovery time is way longer.  I will be dragging ass big time the following day and don't really get all the way back to normal till 2-3 days later.  On the upside I cannot remember the last time I had a hangover (see the part above about pacing).   Drivers are insured.  When they have a customer Uber insurance is in effect.  When there is no passenger the driver's insurance is in effect (and must comply with whatever state law is about driver insurance).  Also, all their drivers undergo a [background check](http://blog.uber.com/driverscreening).    This quote sums him up well for me.  The man was a mad genius.  *The trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers . . . and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . . . Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.* ~ Hunter S.

The trade off is that the American stealth jets, particularly the F-35, aren't as good ar close range dogfighting than non-stealth counterparts like the nimble Eurofighter.  Nah...the F-22 is freaking lethal in close combat.  Not so sure about the F-35 which is far less stealthy (good stealth head on, less so from the sides and even less from the back).  When the Raptor finds itself in a dogfight, it is no longer beyond visual range, but the advantage of stealth isn't diminished. It maintains "high ground" even at close range.  *"I can't see the [expletive deleted] thing," said RAAF Squadron Leader Stephen Chappell, exchange F-15 pilot in the 65th Aggressor Squadron. "It won't let me put a weapons system on it, even when I can see it visually through the canopy. [Flying against the F-22] annoys the hell out of me."*  Lt. Col. Larry Bruce, 65th AS commander, admits flying against the Raptor is a very frustrating experience. Reluctantly, he admitted "it's humbling to fly against the F-22," - humbling, not only because of its stealth, but also its unmatched maneuverability and power. [SOURCE](http://web.archive.org/web/20130126054056/http://www.acc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123041831)  It has a [30:1 kill ratio](http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2012/02/top-usaf-general-explains-exac/) in mock dog fights (like Red Flag exercises).  It is not invulnerable but you probably do not want to get into a real fight with one.  Also remember that this radar the Chinese are building is land based.  That's all well and good but the radars aboard their planes still can't see the F-22 very well.  So if this land based radar works the Chinese could probably vector fighters in for an intercept and the F-22 would probably just shoot them all down as they got close.  There is a big difference between putting a pilot within a few miles of an enemy plane and that plane engaging effectively.    No. I seriously do not think he was thinking "Woo hoo! Free vacation!"

Yay justice!   If you want to discuss the merits (or lack of) the grand jury system that is a discussion for another place (and one well worth having).  The issue here is it is the job of the prosecutor to get an indictment.  Something they do with such overwhelming regularity as to make a farce of the grand jury system.  Now it is you and others who want to get all pious and say he did it right here and this is the way it always should be.  Again I will remind you the grand jury is not a fact finder.  That is a job for the trial court.  The prosecutor failed to obtain an indictment when it would have been trivially easy for him to get one (as he does in all other cases).  We've had other places where prosecutors conveniently decide for us such as (for instance) no criminal charges against people at HSBC for laundering multi-millions in drug money and terrorist money.  Or the flip side where a prosecutor hounded Aaron Schwartz to suicide despite all parties in the case not wanting to prosecute.  But hey...this time don't worry...the prosecutor is a good guy.   It is NOT obvious.  It is anything but obvious (read the article you linked to...there is eyewitness testimony that suggests otherwise).  THAT is why we are supposed to have trials so we can find the truth.  But that didn't happen here.     That's where you're wrong.  Remember the prosecutor is the ONLY one who brings evidence to a grand jury and they need not bring exculpatory evidence.  All he has to show is there is a genuine question at hand for the courts to decide.  This is why there is the saying they can indict a ham sandwich if they wanted to.  As the article you linked to showed there is no shortage of conflicting evidence.  It would have been trivial to get an indictment here and him releasing all that evidence to the grand jury was just muddying the water.  The grand jury is NOT a fact finder.  That is the job for a regular trial.  One that will not happen now.  So yeah...prosecutor shit canned his own trial.    in a high profile situation like this, the prosecutors didn't really have much of a choice about if they wanted to seek an indictment or not, and the facts didn't matter. regardless of what the situation was, an indictment was going to be sought, simply because the case had become a media circus.  So you're saying the prosecutor decided he didn't want to prosecute this case but felt compelled to so he intentionally ruined the grand jury trial?  I can go with that.  I think that is the sense most people have of it today.    your chart is also irrelevant, because he wasn't being judged by a federal grand jury.  It is not completely irrelevant since it shows how these things tend to roll.  State courts may be different but you would not expect them to be all that different:  Wilsons case was heard in state court, not federal, so the numbers arent directly comparable. Unlike in federal court, most states, including Missouri, allow prosecutors to bring charges via a preliminary hearing in front of a judge instead of through a grand jury indictment. That means many routine cases never go before a grand jury. Still, legal experts agree that, at any level, it is extremely rare for prosecutors to fail to win an indictment.  If the prosecutor wants an indictment and doesnt get one, something has gone horribly wrong, said Andrew D. Leipold, a University of Illinois law professor who has written critically about grand juries. It just doesnt happen. [SOURCE](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/ferguson-michael-brown-indictment-darren-wilson/)    It is the prosecutor's job to get an indictment.  Full stop.  All they need to show is probable cause for a trial.  A very, very low bar to get over.  The prosecutor is under no obligation to put any and ALL evidence up for the grand jury.  The prosecutor controls what the grand jury sees.  They can and do routinely only put up evidence that supports the case for a trial.  That they put up so much evidence in this case is telling.  The grand jury is not a fact finding body.  They ONLY determine if a trial is merited and as has been noted it is trivially easy to get indictments.  This easily should have resulted in an indictment and then it would have gone to a trial where the facts would be hammered out.  This grand jury prevented that from happening.    Everyone remember Total War: Rome II.  If you pre-order this game you're a bigger fool than I am and that's saying something.  Never again Creative Assembly...never, ever again...  (Not saying don't buy it...saying wait till release and give it a week to see how it shapes up...well, well worth the wait from past experience.)   [SOURCE](https://www.nycourts.gov/history/legal-history-new-york/luminaries-court-appeals/wachtler-sol.html):  Judge Wachtler was well aware that one weed can often cast a shadow over acres of fecund crops. When he was an Associate Judge, he had given a speech in which he stated that any prosecutor who wanted to could get a Grand Jury to indict a ham sandwich. The statement became so much a part of the American lexicon that Tom Wolfe quoted the statement and its author in his best-selling book, The Bonfire of The Vanities.   Not me.  I have seen this happen.  A woman called support saying her monitor (a CRT) was messed up.  I went to check and the screen was all wavy.  I noticed next to her monitor she had a small fan (a lot smaller than the one in the OP).  I turned the fan off and the monitor stopped being all wavy.  She complained that it could not possibly be the fan.  So I turned the fan on and physically moved it away from the monitor and back again.  Waviness stopped, waviness started again...repeat that a few times.  She told me, "But I need my fan!"  I shrugged and told her she now knew what the problem was and the solution.  If she preferred the fan enough to deal with the wavy monitor that was her call.  It does not matter if the hard drive has more powerful magnets.  The issue is spinning the disk platters in a magnetic field.  If that field is strong enough it can start flipping bits on the disk platters which will introduce errors over time.  I *do not* know if that motor puts out a magnetic field sufficient to do this but I do know there is one and it is noticeable.  I'd say running the laptop near an unshielded motor like that is a legitimate worry.  It can also potentially induce current in wires nearby which would also be a problem.   The first thing to remember is the speed of light will be measured as the *same speed* no matter how fast you are moving.  This is counter-intuitive.  If you are standing next to a railroad and a train goes by at 50mph it zooms by but if you are driving next to the train at 45mph you will measure the train's speed (relative to you) as 5mph.  Not so for light.  No matter how fast you go you will *always* measure the speed of light at around 300,000km/s.  So now you have a problem.  If you are on your spaceship going 50% the speed of light and measure the same speed as I do standing still how can we reconcile that?  Well, speed is Distance/Time.  So, miles per hour or kilometers per second or whatever you are using to measure those.  Think of the train example again.  If you are in the car going 45mph you would say the train is going 5mph (relative to you).  BUT in this case let's pretend the train is light and we BOTH measure its speed at 50mph.  The only way to make your measurement agree with mine is to adjust the rate your clock ticks at (and in the case of relativity length gets contracted too but we'll ignore that part for now).  The only way to stretch out what you *think* should be a measured speed of 5mph to 50mph is to slow your clock down.  The longer it takes between ticks the faster whatever you are measuring will seem to be.    It is worth noting the clock only seems to move more slowly for someone not moving looking at someone who is moving.  To the person moving everything will seem normal.   Fascinating stuff.  Should be required listening for everyone.   Let's say you have a lemonade stand selling lemonade to passersby.  Your stand is doing good business and you want to expand your operations but you do not have enough money to buy all the stands you want.  So you offer to sell people an interest in your company.  Let's say you create 1,000 shares of stock and give yourself 500 of them (so you retain 50% ownership of your company).  You sell the other 500 shares.  These shares are sold on a stock market.  The stock market acts as a price discovery mechanism.  Potential investors look at your company and decide what 1/1000 of your company is worth (the share price for each share).  When all is said and done you will own 50% of your company and investors will own the other 50% of your company.   Nothing in particular.  We have planes that do this and of course the Space Shuttle and ISS do this.    Remember the speed the earth is spinning at is different at different latitudes with it being fastest at the equator and slower the further you get away from the equator.  At the poles you could walk faster than the earth spins.     It has been shown again and again that ownership rates have no effect on violent crime rates.  Well, a quick Google search shows there are studies that disagree:  Given those flaws in the studies showing no effect, the Leigh and Neill study appears the most reliable of the ones conducted. It seems reasonably clear, then, that the gun buyback led to a large decline in suicides, and weaker but real evidence that it reduced homicides as well. [SOURCE](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/08/02/did-gun-control-work-in-australia/)    It has been shown again and again that ownership rates have no effect on violent crime rates.  What about violent crime outcomes?  I.e. How many deaths, how many hospitalizations, how many "successful crimes" (e.g. the perp got away with the purse) and so on.   (Serious question)    I just broke...or perhaps modified is more accurate...my personal policy on no pre-orders by pre-ordering Dragon Age: Inquisition.  I reasoned that in this particular case the game has been out for review for a week already, game reviews were all very positive (from sources I trust) AND that Origin has a return policy that lets me return the game up to 24 hours after I first start playing it.  The only other game I might break my rule on is The Witcher 3 because CD Projekt Red has earned my trust and if I can reward them for it in some small way I am happy to do so.  Without a return policy like Origin though I will pretty much never pre-order on Steam again (I'm looking at you Total War: Rome II).    He said "food trough wiper"?  Holy shit...been forever and I though it was "fruit drop of water".  Yeah...didn't make sense to me either.  I feel like a lifelong mystery has been revealed to me.    Thanks! (really)   They tried the same thing with Vista and it didn't work.  I stuck with XP, along with a jillion other folks, and ignored Vista and DX-10 (11?) with no problem.  Some few games had neat extra features but wasn't enough to move anyone.  Windows 7 made the move worthwhile.  I am NOT saying Windows 10 is good or bad (no one can say yet).  I am merely saying their bullshit strong-arming people to adopt the new system won't work.  If Windows 10 is better people will move.  If not they won't.  DX-12 won't really decide it and game developers will make their games for what the majority of people have.     I'm not saying that they can't be susceptible to mental health issues but narcissism for the average person and narcissism for celebrity just cannot be held in the same light. Nobody is going to celebrate you but you at the end of the day.  Huh?  You just gave a laundry list of the accolades West has received.  He has received tons of recognition from his peers and fills arenas with tens of thousands of fans, has people like you defending him at all costs and is surrounded by sycophants.  I submit he is quite well celebrated and does not need to pat himself on the back.    Where is it written that good musicians can't have mental problems?  Robin Williams suffered from paranoia and depression.  Kurt Cobain had depression.  Michelangelo [may have been autistic](http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20040526/did-michelangelo-have-autism).  Isaac Newton may have had [bi-polar disorder or been autistic.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/isaac-newton-facts-physicist_n_4058836.html)  Great people who contribute a lot can and do have issues.  They are human.  No matter how high a pedestal you want to put them on they are not immune to human shortcomings.  Look up [narcissistic personality disorder](http://psychcentral.com/disorders/narcissistic-personality-disorder-symptoms/) then watch that video of him again or watch him at the VMA awards crashing the stage and ruining Taylor Swift's award moment.  On and on it goes with him.   Can you say "narcissist"?  He is seriously one of the best examples of a narcissistic personality disorder I have ever seen.  Not just a little bit but pathological and should seek professional help.  I do not know how others can tolerate being around him even if he is rich.   Picture a long, endless dungeon of a room of cubicles in the EA basement.  Programmers are chained to their desks slaving away on the next iteration of micro-transactions.  On the EA floor map they have a box drawn around cubicles 3a, 4a and 5a and call it "Maxis" because those guys are doing work on Maxis-Clone-Game-22.  Calling Maxis a distinct development group is nuts.  They work for EA and their paychecks are signed by EA and they are beholden to whatever insane thing some suit in EA marketing dreams up and I would be surprised if any of the creative talent from Maxis is still there.  Maxis is just a name used for marketing purposes by EA because it still carries some cache with gamers who fondly remember the cool stuff they once did.    Don't forget Bullfrog!  Really miss those guys...    That does not mean the original team is largely or even partially intact.  I recently read that while Bungie exists as its own development studio pretty much none of the original team behind Halo is left.  I *do not know* if this is true of Maxis or not.  I am just pointing out that being a distinct sub-unit within EA producing specific games does not mean much in and of itself.  More like a line item on an EA accountant's books than anything else.    The making of Apocalypse Now was so screwy from start to finish it is almost unbelievable.  Indeed there is a whole documentary on it: [Hearts of Darkness: A Filmaker's Apocalypse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102015/) (it's worth watching).    One of my favorite bits is this:  Sheen then added his own dose of mayhem, a result of the severe alcoholic phase he was going through.  In the opening scenes, Willard has a violent mental breakdown brought on by heavy drinking. Sheen played it with all the stunning realism of a man who was himself out of his head on booze after a 24-hour birthday bender.  He could hardly stand up and when, for the film, he smashed a mirror with his fist, he was so drunk he didn't realise his hand was badly cut and streaming blood. Those on the set with him were on tenterhooks, scared that he was going to take a swing at the director and the camera crew.  Shortly afterwards, Sheen collapsed with a heart attack, though he was just 36 years old, and was found crawling along a road looking for help. The jungle heat may have had something to do with his condition, but his drinking and the fact that he was woefully out of shape for such a demanding role can't have helped.  When Coppola heard the news, he had an epileptic fit of his own. He blamed himself and ordered a news black-out on Sheen's illness.  'Even if he dies, he's not dead until I say so,' he told startled studio bosses back in Hollywood. [SOURCE](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1233293/The-maddest-movie-Why-Apocalypse-Now-finest-film-modern-times.html)   This is a variation on the [Double Slit experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc).  For this the important part to know is when you shoot a particle at the double slits you get an interference pattern behind the double slits BUT you cannot know which slit the particle went through.  If you put some measuring device at the double slits to see which slit the particle went through the interference pattern behind the slits disappears.  In short, the act of observing the system causes the quantum wave function to collapse and it behaves classically.  The quantum eraser experiment is similar to the double slit but it is setup in such a way as to see if it is the act of observing the particle that causes the wave function to collapse.  Basically, instead of watching at the double slit to see which path the particle went through they put a camera behind the double slit to see if a wave or a particle came through.  The weird part is, once again, the wave is there till they look, even *after* the wave has gone through the double slit.  This implies that history is changed.  The particle went through as a wave, was observed after the fact so it reverts to a particle and then re-writes its own history so it was a particle going through the double slit.  Weird stuff.  *""Anyone not shocked by quantum mechanics has not yet understood it."* ~Niels Bohr     What you're forgetting and they are conveniently neglecting is *everyone dies*.  So sure, tobacco harms people but their calculation is suggesting that if you do not smoke you will have no health care costs and that is of course wrong.  According to one study (Banarto, McClellan, Kagy and Garber, 2004), 30% of all Medicare expenditures are attributed to the 5% of beneficiaries that die each year, with 1/3 of that cost occurring in the last month of life.  I know there are other studies out there that say slightly different things, but the reality is simple: we spend an incredible amount of money on that last year and month.  [SOURCE](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbell/2013/01/10/why-5-of-patients-create-50-of-health-care-costs/)  Note that they are not distinguishing WHY these people are sick and dying.  It doesn't matter whether a cigarette caused it or old age caused it.  In the end people die and end of life care is expensive.     The bullshit of the thing here is smokers pay a sin tax on every pack of cigarettes which can be substantial (in Chicago where I live the tax on a pack of smokes is [$7.42](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/21/proposed-chicago-cigarette-tax-would-be-highest-rate-in-nation/)).  That is JUST the tax...then add in the actual cost of the pack and profit and so on and you easily hit $12/pack in downtown Chicago.  As if that was not enough we had the states sue the tobacco companies for many, many billions of dollars to cover the cost that smoking cost them via healthcare costs.  Then consider that dying is expensive regardless of why you are dying.  Old people dying of old age shit cost as much as a young smoker dying of lung cancer.  But wait, there's more...smokers die younger so they tend to not collect on Social Security.  All the money they paid in the government keeps.  From the government's perspective, if all they care about is the fiscal bottom line, smokers are fucking awesome!  Bottom line is smokers do not cost society money.  Some do, many don't and when all is said and done it is about a wash.    This seems an unusual post for here but not sure what other subreddit might be more appropriate.  I think it is an interesting question.     	135

 When has Ron Paul ever supported corporatism?  We have always been around, the establishment guys are just way more powerful than we are.   The Dems. support none of my political beliefs. As a Libertarian there is literally no room in the Democratic party for me.  I support the abolishment of the Federal reserve, welfare state, the IRS, ending the drug war, opening the borders, and introducong a flat tax. The dems don't support decentralization.   Thats because most of us young Republicans are actually old school republicans (as in pre-prohibition Republicans).  The new identity of conservatives is remarkably unconservative. The whole point of conservatism is less government involvement. State regulation of marriage, the drig war, an aggressive foreign policy, strict border control; none of these things are truly conservative at all. There is a new wave of liberty loving Republicans though.   Because they don't have that kind of power yet. They are a loosely organized band of hyped up hadjis, no way they could stand a chance against the disciplined, organized, well funded, and battle tested Israeli military. They understand that they would get slaughtered. Same reason they don't commit an open attack against the US. There are grossly outgunned.   The same reason Duck Dynasty is popular. Just because it is scripted does not mean it is entertaining. Wrestling is not about the competetion aspect like other sports, it is about the flash and pizazz. The gimmicks, the quirkiness, and the trash talking.   Uh.. Shoes don't really factor into the sexy equation for me. As long as they aren't ass-ugly I probably won't even notice them.   This is not a question with an objective answer. You are in the wrong sub.   Its kinda subjective.   Technically it would encompass everyone whose roots lie in the Reformation.    Now it mostly identifies groups who are confessional in the Calvinist tradition. A lot of us get labeled "TR" or "truly Reformed" when we are super strict confessionalists.    These stories about vets claiming PTSD without an actual event are very prevalent, but I have never ever met anyone who actually claimed those things.   Most vets I know would never claim PTSD if they never saw it.   Also, while a little good natured rib poking at the "fobbits" (myself included) is all well and good, but you seem genuinely venomous about it. Shit happens on FOBs too. If you doubt it you can talk to my good buddy's widow. Shank got hit all the time, and not 1000m away.   It has nothing to do with WW2. That is the logo of The Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War.   [Here](http://www.suvcw.org) is their website. Perhaps if you contact them they can give you more info on what exactly that badge represents.   It looks like there were a bunch made in the 30s, 40s, and 50s. I would assume that they are affiliation badges of some sort. Was it possible your grandfather was the son/grandson of a Union veteran of the civil war?   I never said he was.    My point was just I don't see any reason to boycott.    No we should not fund it. It is not our business.   Both sides have committed acts of injustice.   1. Reading - I read around 5 books a month. I love to learn. I am active in a local book club, and jump at the chance to attend literary themed events in my area. I am a huge library patron.   2. Gardening - I love trying to be more self sufficient, and enjoy working with my hands.   3. Fishing -Nothing more relaxing than a day on the river/lake with a cold sixpack and a few sandwiches.  4. Hunting - Again, I love being self sufficient. I love the thrill of taking down game, I love preparing fresh game.   5. Camping - I like being out in nature, retreating from the modern world. I am not a big technology buff, and like the simplicity of being alone in the woods.  I don't really watch tv or play videogames. I do enjoy interacting with people via the internet, but otherwise I am a pretty unplugged guy. I like nature, working with my hands, and doing things for myself.   The tears of your enemies.   I like when my wifr cooks my favorite breakfast (steak and eggs for me), and picks up some beer for me. I am not a fussy guy either, I don't like parties, big to-do's or anything, just a nice day relaxing at home with some good homemade food   We fence the table through invite. The pastor makes it clear the Supper is for baptized believers who are not living in unrepentant sin.     As for the OPC;  No intinction.   Yes, they recognize your baptism and would allow you to take communion.    Oh come on.. Patriotism, love for America etc are subjective things... Stick to policies. Vote based on policies.   I can see how the prohibition of closed shops would be unlibertarian.   No. It would violate my convictions.   What does team lead do exactly?   From what I understand, if a union and employer cannot reach an agreement, the federal govt can come in and force them to adopt closed shop practices. Wouldn't RTW protect against this?   I don't know why an employer would ever *voluntarily* adopt closed shop practices.   Please explain further   It was more a symbolic thing than an expectation that extraterrestrials would actually find it.  That being said, any intelligent lifeforms probably have already discovered sound/recording and will be able to figure out the gist of it    What exactly does a logistics specialist do in the civilian world? What does a typical day look like?      Good. Workers should be allowed to associate with whomever they choose and also refuse to associate with whomever they choose.   710th is a unit we were both in.   Not really, I haven't had it as bad as other guys. There are some dudes with serious psycological scars though, and some of them have a hard time relating to civilians.   Stolen Valor is a real thing, and it is illegal. I have the same opinon thst most vets do, trying to steal valor is morally reprehensible. If I ever saw it I would call them out on it.   Yeah, its doggone freezing here now, snow everywhere.   Don't make assumptions about what I did or didn't do. I saw my share of shit.    Shank got hit all the time for one thing, and my support unit had our share of tragedy.    This was in July.    I was referring to how we are wired differently once we have done tours, thats why we prefer our own language to the civilian world. It is familiar.      Its a few months old. We came back in July of 2014. I just found it yesterday.   All of it, kind of. We were in a valley near the mountains.   2014, right after we left. 82nd deactivated it.   This was literally the moment I got out of the car. My wife opened the door and he met me in the yard. Relax bro   He might be. He was a shelter puppy so I just went off what they told me. I just googled schiller hound though and he looks exactly like that.   3rd   No, a lot of the animals over there have rabies etc. They try to discourage that practice now.   They did when we first arrived, but we closed everything down. Shank has been deactivated.   I don't know why the heck I got downvoted. I was just pointing out that Spartan brigade has cased their colors.   Fuck you.   Yeah. Dude who did it was in my unit too. He was a moron. Worst way to go, that was a super fucked up situation.   We don't remember how to civilian. We have fucked up brains and fucked up souls and the military is all we know. Thats why we get so excited to talk to other vets in military talk, its about connecting with folks who get us.   Oh shit. Yeah, Terry Hurne. We were in the same unit, and I was at that range.    If you are serious about meeting girls the bar scene is not the place. Literally every dude in there is trying to hit on the girls in there, and they all know that. I am not saying you will never ever meet a girl at a bar, but there are other places to really connect with someone. Volunteering with local organizations, social groups, book clubs (this one especially. Hardly any straight dudes are involved with book clubs. Tons of single girls are involved with book clubs)     Just my two cents.   Where was 1-32? Rushmore?  We were at Shank.   92A. Logistician.   Aw man that sucks bro..   Yup, Spartans are all gone now.   A whole ton of culture, good food, deep roots, hospitality, manners, work ethic, and pride.  I was raised in South Alabama. My mom whooped my butt if I didn't say yes sir and yes ma'am. We were poor but had blue collar pride. The "poor folk" food we ate is still my comfort food (redeye gravy and cathead biscuits, fried baloney, and rice and red gravy.) I will never ever foget my roots or my family.   Sweet, I am over in CAB now. I was with 710th.   1. The onus is not on me to cite something not happening. The onus is on you to give an example of a monopoly occuring naturally in the free market.  2. Businesses coukd not use coercive force because that would be illegal. This is the one thing I believe government is responsible for, protecting against/prosecuting acts of aggression. If a corporation vandalized, threatened, attacked, stole from etc another business they would be arrested for those acts of aggrssion. TmIt has nothing to do with market regulation It has to do with government defending against acts of aggression.   Yup. I deployed with 3rd BCT before they deactivated.   Monopolization is extremely rare in the free market without big businesses using force. Since we (Right Libertarians) oppose all acts of aggression that would be nullified. Monopolies are usually created by the government through corporation friendly legislation. There is no evidence for a natural monopoly occuring in the free market. If you are so adamantly against monopolies, why do you support the government's monopoly of force?   The government did "technically" invent the internet. But in keeping with my previous statement, it did so shittily. It created Aparnet, a network which only communicated between 37 computers. Only when the internet was privatized in 1995 did it flourish and become usable for the average person. Even while the government was "inventing the internet" it was done through private sector research. Why didm't the free market create the internet on their own? Because the government heavily regulated the research though the FCC and blocked out private sector attempts.      Regulating it would give the government control over the maryjane market. The government screws everything up.    I believe in free markets, with zero government presence.   I would not. I would legalize it totally and leave the government out of it.    I have seen the question asked for officers, but not for us enlisted guys. I am a 92A, logistics specialist. I haved worked as a warehouseman, ordering and recieving parts, managing a motorpool etc.    What civilian jobs would fit my experience?   Hey y'all,  I am originally from Baldwin County, but I have been in the Army for the past few years. I am nearing my transition date and preparing to move to Birmingham to attend UAB. I had some questions about the city.  1. What is the city vibe like? I enjoy artsy stuff, indie bookstores, theatre, live music, etc.   2. What is the job market like? I will be looking for a blue collar job while I attend school. I have experience in logistics, plan on looking for work with either the railroad, UPS, FEDEX, manufacturing, or anything else I can do to support my family. I am really open to anything with decent pay.   3. Anything else you wanna tell me about Bham? get me excited to move there?   He was not. This is him seeing me after I came back from Afghanistan.   For anyone curious he is a two year old bloodhound/labrador mix, with a big sensitive heart!      I am from Baldwin County and I have been in the Army for the past few years and I am getting ready to transition out and plan to attend UAB, majoring in English Secondary Education. I would be coming in as a junior.  I am just looking for some student insider perspective.   1. Do you enjoy UAB? Why or why not?  2. What is Birmingham like? Job market, things to do, etc.  3. Do you know of any student veteran organizations on campus?  4. What is the UAB English/Education program like?  5. Any other things you wanna share?   I don't carry a knife for self-defense I carry a gun for self-defense.   A knife is one of the handiest tools you can carry regularly. Opening stubborn packages, makeshift screwdriver, reaching into small places to unclog them, cutting gasket cloth etc. I use mine on a daily basis.   He said he had a biology degree, but he was referring to his M. D. Was he puffing up his credentials a lottle? Sure. Does that mean he is a bad choice for president? No. Nobody is perfect, and all of thise guys fib to make themselves look better. There is no denying the fact that he is an actual doctor with an actual M. D.    Fortunately I can turn my telescreen off. Winston wasn't so lucky.   Basic was not that hard. I wouldn't say it was a cakewalk, but it was way easier than deployment.  Basic has a lot of stress and anxiety, but is pretty idiotproof. I was not terribly rattled, I kept my head down and didn't get singled out.   Actually, I do have the same attitude about focusing on Democrats namecalling. As a Libertarian-Republican I agree with Democrats on a good many issues, and don't buy into the two party hostilities. I have no respect or support for establishment politicians at all regardless of their party. I think Giuliani's comments were pointless, but just about everything he says is. I just think it is a waste of time to cover this as actual news, other than a passing reference.   Kind of.   Technically it does, but there are proper avenues through which he relays those commands. There is a huge system in place for the command of our armed forces.   If my post commander randomly ordered no contact with the outside world we would all agree he was fuckin nuts. He would probably be reported to the inspector general and would not be in charge.   If there was a war, some valid reason reinforced by his higher ups then we would lock down base i guess. But there are very very specific rules for when and how to put a base on lockdown. Like I said, there is a shit ton of oversight in the military. Nobody has totalitarian power.   Yes. There is a shit ton of oversight in the military. It would be pretty much impossible for an immoral order to be ordered on a large scale. There have been instances of immoral orders of course, but usually they happen at low levels (platoons).    They both are. Ron was in the pregnancy ward.  Rand is an eye doctor. Still an M. D. He has done a medical missions trip in Guatemala last year.   He obeys his original orders. This specific instance is covered in our three general orders. Summed up these say that when we are given a post to guard, we guard it to the best of our ability in exactly the way we were told.  A crypto safe always has a list of specific people who are allowed access to it, so that would be the standard the guard will follow.   To answer youe larger question, an order can be disobeyed if it violates human rights, or basic military values. Basically if an officer tells me to do something morally wrong like rape or shoot a baby, I can and will refuse it. On murkier issues if you refuse an order, you will have to present a case before court marshall and they will judge whether it was moral or not.   Rand Paul said that vaccines are wise, as a doctor he fully supports them and that is extremely unwise to refuse them. But he does not think they should be state mandated.   I think even if you disagree with his positions, his statesmanship was remarkable. If only all candidates approached campaigns with his humility and respect for opponents.   He was asked how old the earth is at one point and I believe he passed on the question. He may have been pandering the political game or he may very well believe that. I don't think his religious beliefs discredit him though.  I preferred his father, he was one of my personal heroes. But Rand still has a high regard for liberty and common sense approach to government.   Nope. It was blaring at work, kind of hard to ignore.   I tend to get my news from Reuters or BBC.   I think Justin Amash and Rand Paul are some of the best current GOP'ers.   The rest of those guys are still harping on the drug war, homophobia, and oppressive immigration laws.   No, the fact that they are focusing on absolutely pointless issues as valid news is proof that it is more than bias.    Its more than bias. This same story is on CNN and Fox.    It is vapidness, idiocy. American journalism is absolutely retarded.   I use one for work. I jot down phone numbers, part numbers, important bits of info.  I carry another when I am in civvies. I use it for library lists, topics to research later, quick fleeting thoughts, etc.   I don't see the big deal. As long as you aren't wearing the whole uniform, patches, claiming to have served etc.  There is a common sense line between wearing military surplus (I am from Alabama, everybody wears military surplus in my trailer park) and disrespect.   If you wear a camo jacket, that is cool with me.    I am complaining about both things.   I am a Republican and I adamantly oppose such philosophy. You are stereotyping now.   Ron Paul is a good example of a Republican who did not behave like those establishment quacks.   I agree. I usually stay away from the nonsense, but it is on endless repeat at work.   I agree that he is trying to change America. That does not mean he is unpatriotic or "hates America".  So why don't we respectfully speak about the issues, not subjective emotions.   That was not my point. My point is thst not only were the comments not useful, but also our media focuses on absolutely pointless things (by the way this was MSNBC).      So you agree with his opinion.   My point is that this has no bearing on any real issues. We are focusing on silly feelings and emotions instead of concrete issues.   Yeah.. That dude gives the GOP a bad name.   No, I am a Republican. This is not respectable statesmanship though, its just namecalling. Instead of thoughtfully debating the issues we are spending all our time wondering whether The President "loves America?"   I have been watching the news blabber about Rudy Giuliani's comments about the President, and it has reinforced how awful the American media is. Come on guys, is this what counts as "meaningful political analysis" now? One guy says someone else "doesn't love America" and we have to discuss it for an hour and a half, with panels of experts commenting on the implications of such comments on the GOP's 2016 race?   Why does this remind me of an analysis of an argument between toddlers?  "Up next on The News, little Joey said Adam did not love his mommy. Adam says he does in fact love his mommy. Who is right? We are gonna debate it for an hour and a half to find out!"   Let me put it this way, you will get what you put in.   Basic and AIT will give you some very basic foundational concepts of discipline, but if you are not willing to continue down the path of self discipline you will lose it all when you get in the real Army.   The Army will give you a good foundatiom, but you have to have strong self motivation to develop yourself.   No. Only you can get your shit together.   No organization can change your bad habits, you have to do it yourself. The Army can put you in an environment that promotes hard work and discipline, but you are going to have to make some personal choices to develop your own character.   There are lazy dirtbags in the Army too.   I am not very well read on the Spanish Revolution and would like to correct that. What is some essential reading on the subject?   I am looking to understand what the lives of working class folks were actually like in the heydays of the various communist systems throughout history (the USSR, Cuba, Maoism etc). Along with responses, articles, books, or other media related to this subject would be greatly appreciated.    I understand that according to most Communists the Marxist ideal has never been realized. But there were periods in which parties based (even loosely) on Communist ideals had control. I am curious what worker's living conditions were like under those parties.   Is the association voluntary?    I am looking to understand what the lives of working class folks were like in the heydays of the various communist systems throughout history (the USSR, Cuba, Maoism etc). Along with responses, articles, books, or other media related to this subject would be greatly appreciated.       12 dollars a week.   My job requires certain hair standards though. I am in the Army. Still, it keeps my hair looking fresh and well groom, and it never gets in that awkward patchy phase. And i get a bonus hot towel massage and straight razor shave every friday (something to look forward to.)   I get a weekly haircut.    A society in which I am free to make any choices I want as long as they do not encroach upon another individual's life, liberty, or property.   Freedom means freedom from regulation and government involvement in my life (as long as I do not commit/threaten an act of aggression). The primary person responsible for my wellbeing, safety, and defense is myself.   Thank you!   I don't believe the 1000 year number is a literal number.   Again, this is the same view the Church has embraced for thousands of years. Dispensational premil theology is a modern oddity.   Can anyone recommend good homesteading podcasts?   Well, strictly speaking yes. The internet is a valuable resource for selfdevelopment and autododactic learning.  Also, as a soldier I am required to have a valid phone number that I can be reached at at all times. So a phone is a need.   I don't own a computer. I have a Samsung galaxy, and that is all. For any real computer needs I use the library.   As a minimalist I try not to own things I do not need.   Read up on [amillenialism](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amillennialism)   It is the traditional view of the Church, especially amongst those of us of the Reformed persuasion.  The idea that the millenial reign is a literal 1000 year reign on earth is a relatively new idea.   No. I believe we are in the millennial reign now. Christ is on the throne of his kingdom.  I am an amil.   Awesome, thanks for the info!   What exactly about the self sufficient aspects of Agorism don't appeal to you, if I may ask?   So Agorism?   Robert Pirsig's alter ego. Pirsig suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.   It is more difficult to wean the public from the teat of the state.   I don't hear this very often. Most decent guys don't care about your past.    I hold both genders to the same standard. I don't approve of sex outside a committed relationship for either men or women.    I browsed their website, and it looks really interesting. Are any of y'all familiar with the organization? Any personal stories about them? I love motorcycles, and a vets club might just be the right kind of community for me.   Basically I am curious to know what form of transition you support from our current statism to a voluntary society?   I tend to support a more gradual transition. I have never been a revolutionary. I think the gradual deregulation of the markets, and drawdown of government. It seems to me that a revolutionary transition would wage havok on the markets for a while, and we would need a longee buffer time for recovery.    How can we transition from our current state to one of liberty?    I am a soldier myself. I understand the struggle.   It seems like a *huge* paradox to me that progressives tend to support an individualist social perspective (subjective morality, freedom from religious oppression, marriage equality, equality of all choices etc) but insist on a collectivist/classist economic outlook (activism against class warfare, white privilege, affirmitive action, etc).   What are y'alls opinions about this paradox? Have you ever heard any of them try to address it?   I feel I am not responsible for the actions of other members of my gender, my race, my tax bracket, or my region...   Its not just feminists.. It is common sense that a man controlling a woman as portrayed in that book is total abuse.   *To Kill a Mockingbird* or *Forrest Gump*   I don't.    Picking up hookups at the club is childish.   We have a different approach to worship. We believe worship is obedience driven, not emotion driven, and that probably has a big effect on our external reactions.   We tend to prefer a more reserved and less flamboyant type of worship than our nondenominational brethren.   By having sex with him without his consent.   Physical reactions to external stimuli (e.g. an erection) do not always mean consent. Women can orgasm during rape, and men can get erections without wanting to.   Chill out.   Basic is easy, don't volunteer for shit, keep your head down. When you get to your first unit nobody is gonna give a shit how good you did in basic, remember that.    You will have plenty of time to be hooah sf airborne ranger dude, but learn your mos and the basics of soldiering first.    The Army is nothing like the movies, it is boring bullshit 99% of the time, and that is ok.    A remarkable number of Asimov's predictions came true. Have you read his short story about the [2014 World Fair](http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/23/lifetimes/asi-v-fair.html) (written in 1964)?  Driverless cars, coffee makers, robots, videophone technology etc...   I think Asimov's principles of robotics and the way he applies them in his stories is remarkable.   Either Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke.   Asimov was a genius, well rounded, and incredibly perceptive. I would place him slightly above Clarke as the King.   Voluntaryism.   1. Yes.   2. I am hoping for steak and eggs for breakfast (I found the ribeyes in the fridge earlier, she tried to hide them from me.) That is my usual big valentine's day request.   I bought her flowers, an Old Navy gift card, and a new charm for her Pandora bracelet. We are going to dinner and a movie, and then cuddling on the couch.   Here is mine   These are the same kids watching rape scenes in Game of Thrones and killing hookers on Grand Theft Auto. Abrasive ideas must be encountered. Issues like violence, sex, rape etc must be encountered at some point for an accurate grasp of our world. Literature is the perfect medium through which to encounter such ideas.   No, I don't rank women on the basis of their physical attributes.    Marx has no clue what laissez faire capitalism resukts in because there has never been a laissez faire capitalist system. There has never yet been a society founded totally on voluntary association and totally free markets.   I have read *Das Kapital* and of course his and Engels's *Communist Manifesto*.   I have also read David Ricardo quite a bit.   Still a laissez faire capitalist libertarian.       I am glad you disagree with religious freedom so vehemently. That kind of attitude has been very effective in the past. Lets just ban everyone who disagrees with us..  	135
